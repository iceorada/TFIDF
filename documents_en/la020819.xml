<HD>Combs to Put Rap on Election Trail</HD>

<LD>Last year, Sean "Puffy" Combs told The Times that he would make a
better president than George W. Bush. Now he'll be telling rap fans
to think of themselves as a political force as well.</LD>
<LD>   A public-service announcement featuring Combs exhorting rap fans
to get involved in the campaign season will be unveiled Tuesday at a
New York press conference launching Rap the Vote's 2002 effort. As
its name would suggest, Rap the Vote is an initiative that takes as
its blueprint the Rock the Vote effort, which memorably braced youth
support for Bill Clinton's 1992 run to the White House.</LD>
<LD>   On hand for the press conference will be Russell Simmons, the
politically active rap mogul of Def Jam fame, along with officials
from the NAACP, several record companies and sister group Rock the
Vote. Rap the Vote will set up outreach efforts at hip-hop shows,
college campuses and town hall meetings in urban areas and also use
celebrity faces--such as Combs and actress Rosie Perez in the first
round of commercials--to get rap fans active. Instead of a
presidential race, the focus will often be on elections that will
affect urban areas.</LD>
<TE>   The effort is music to the ears of Minister Benjamin F. Muhammad,
the Nation of Islam leader who became widely known (then as Benjamin
Chavis) for his brief and controversial stint as NAACP national
director in the 1990s. He now works closely with Simmons guiding the
politically minded Hip-Hop Action Summit Network. The former Motown
fan hears a rallying cry for youth in the beats of hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   "This will get young people to register and vote. It's going to
affect the turnout of young people voting in the 2002 elections,"
Muhammad said, adding that more big-name rap artists will join the
call. "Hip-hop artists have an enormous influence over the
consciousness of young Americans. This is a methodology that will
work."</TE>

<HD>Film Tribute Features Mizoguchi's Best</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Crust</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Director Kenji Mizoguchi stands alongside Yasujiro Ozu and Akira
Kurosawa as one of the touchstones of Japanese cinema, their
internationally respected films playing a major part in the revival
of their nation's film industry following World War II. Mizoguchi,
whose career began in the 1920s, rose to prominence when three of his
films won top prizes at the Venice Film Festival in consecutive years
(1952-54).</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art Film Department pays tribute
to him this weekend with "Spotlight on Mizoguchi," featuring two of
the director's Venice triumphs, "Ugetsu" and "The Life of Oharu."</LD>
<LD>   Mizoguchi, who died in 1956, embraced many styles of filmmaking
during his nearly 40-year career, from historical dramas and literary
adaptations to modern, near neo-realistic stories told in urban
settings. The films he made in the '30s often focused on the
inequalities suffered by women in Japanese culture, most notably in
his 1936 film "Osaka Elegy," a melodrama about an oppressed Tokyo
telephone operator. In "Osaka," Mizoguchi used dark shadows similar
to the later Hollywood style found in film noir.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike Kurosawa, whose early films made him an international
critics' favorite, Mizoguchi had made more than 60 films before being
discovered by cineastes. The director's 1952 film, "The Life of
Oharu," which screens Saturday at 7:30 p.m. in LACMA's Bing Theater,
won the International Award at Venice and earned him worldwide
prominence. The film tells the story of a prostitute in 17th century
feudal Japan recounting her troubled life as she prays to a statue of
Buddha. Its long takes and celebrated performance by Kinuyo Tanaka,
as Oharu, evokes a transcendental style central to Mizoguchi's final
films.</TE>
<TE>   "Ugetsu," screening Friday at 7:30 p.m., won the Silver Lion at
Venice the following year and is regarded as Mizoguchi's masterpiece.
Based on a pair of short stories by 18th century writer Akinari Ueda,
the fable-like film looks at two men, a country potter and a farmer,
whose dreams destroy those around them, and displays the fluid
camerawork for which Mizoguchi is known.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kirk Franklin likes to greet gospel audiences by shouting, "Let me
hear you make some Holy Ghost crazy noise!"</LD>
<LD>   And at the Forum on Saturday, Franklin left the house lights on,
turning the venue into massive revival meeting and delivering a
potent mix of classic gospel with modern pop styles that was as
moving as it was deeply religious in message.</LD>
<LD>   The bandleader headlined "A Joyful Noize," a four-hour gospel
festival that also included the high-energy traditionalist Dorinda
Clark-Cole and the duo Mary Mary.</LD>
<TE>   The Z in "noize" was meant to signify an element of hip-hop
awareness, but Franklin's gift in a decade-long career has been to
modernize gospel without cheapening the music and tradition at its
core. His 2-million-selling "Nu Nation Project" album in 1998 crossed
over to a wide popular audience by firing up his gospel with hip-hop
and modern R&amp;B elements, putting him in direct competition with
secular pop.</TE>
<TE>   But if anything, his hourlong set leaned far less on modern
gimmicks and more toward straight gospel.</TE>
<TE>   Running, shouting, rhyming, pumping his fist like a football coach
to the accompaniment of his 13-member choir and five-man band,
Franklin opened with "Hosanna," demonstrating that at its best,
gospel is all about voices erupting with passion and faith.</TE>
<TE>   His newest album, "The Rebirth of Kirk Franklin," opens with a
wrenching dramatization of his abandonment as a child. And on
Saturday, he talked repeatedly of hard times transformed by faith,
pausing once to mention a younger sister who recently finished a
decade in prison. "This is not a celebration of how much money we
have, what kind of car we drive!"</TE>
<TE>   A reworking of Bill Withers' "Lovely Day" provided some smooth,
sunny soul, not unlike Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's finest moments.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin cast a powerful presence, even if his role has him
working the room more as a preacher and bandleader than as
traditional gospel frontman. He did sing a bit during the gospel funk
of "He's Able," from his early career.</TE>
<TE>   His audience spent most of the show on their feet, hands in the
air, and when Franklin told fans to leave their chairs to "hug three
people and tell them that you love them," they did.</TE>

<HD>What's Not Happening at the Pavilion</HD>
<DH>Entertainment* With Disney Hall opening soon, the Music
Center struggles with its fledgling role as impresario.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the fall of 2003, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Los Angeles
Master Chorale will depart from Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for Walt
Disney Concert Hall across the street. They'll leave nothing behind
except about 100 open performance dates.</LD>
<LD>   Exactly what will fill the gap at the venerable flagship of the
Music Center of Los Angeles County is unclear.</LD>
<LD>   Most performing arts centers book their seasons at least a year in
advance, but the Chandler's new impresario, the Music Center's board
and staff, has nothing firm lined up to go with the eight
productions, totaling 60 to 65 performances, that the Los Angeles
Opera expects to mount during its 2003-2004 season.</LD>
<TE>   Center officials say that they have a few prospective bookings in
the pipeline but that they will not make any deals until September at
the earliest. After nearly 40 years as a low-profile functionary--a
landlord, primarily, and a sponsor of educational programs--the Music
Center is trying to reinvent itself, and its leaders say they don't
want to rush, even if that means some dark nights at the 3,197-seat
Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Staffers at the center have known for years that they would need
to become programmers, not just caretakers, at the downtown complex
that includes the Pavilion, the Ahmanson Theatre, the Mark Taper
Forum and soon Disney Hall. But they say that an ongoing cycle of
internal restructuring has made it hard to keep a single-minded focus
on reinventing the Music Center as a performing arts presenter.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, acknowledges Andrea Van de Kamp, chairwoman of the
center's board, it can't go full speed ahead as an impresario because
it lacks a leader who can play the part. Center President Joanne
Kozberg, who is in charge of day-to-day operations, announced her
resignation in April but is staying until her replacement is found.
Kozberg has won respect for making a single, more streamlined unit
out of an unwieldy management structure that, until her arrival in
1999, had consisted of two entities with separate staffs. But her
background is in government and administration, not in booking
performers and enticing a ticket-buying public.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the Music Center, the Los Angeles Philharmonic says
it is set to import at least 50 concerts in addition to its 100 or so
annual performances at Disney Hall. (The Music Center also will be
able to present at Disney Hall when it isn't occupied by Philharmonic
programs; those dates will be limited in the first year.)</TE>
<TE>   "We will have an enormous spectrum that will establish the
Philharmonic as the leading presenter on the West Coast of classical
music and related genres," said Deborah Borda, executive vice
president and managing director of the L.A. Philharmonic. "The
message is, 'Come on down,' " she said, doing a pretty good P.T.
Barnum while withholding details until a planned Nov. 21 announcement
of the programming schedule for 2003-2004.</TE>
<TE>   The Music Center's pronouncements about the future of the Chandler
are, in contrast, the soul of circumspection. "I think we need to be
extremely cautious in booking," says Van de Kamp. "If we ended up
with some dark time, I would be disappointed but not crushed. I would
rather do it right."</TE>
<TE>   Doing it right, Van de Kamp says, means booking events diverse
enough to make all communities in a polyglot, multiethnic region feel
invested. "We can serve aging gray hairs or be thoughtful and get the
kind of diversity and intensity we want the center to represent."</TE>
<TE>   Kozberg and Karen Schmidt, the Music Center's director of booking
and presentation, emphasized that they are still in a planning phase
that has involved consulting with experts, collecting community
feedback and mulling the financial implications of being an
impresario.</TE>
<TE>   "If we shortchange the planning process, then we've shortchanged
ourselves for the long term," says Schmidt, who held another
administrative position at the center before moving into her current
job two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Music Center will say that it is looking to major dance
companies, children's entertainment, ethnic festivals, comedy and
holiday shows as possible attractions. Rock 'n' roll will be
welcome--although the center would simply collect rent while letting
experienced rock promoters take the risk. It worked like a charm in
October when the concert producer Goldenvoice brought the Icelandic
rock chanteuse, Bjork, to the Pavilion. Schmidt says the show sold
out in 12 minutes, even though it fell on a Monday. Broadway musicals
were a staple at the Chandler from 1964 to 1987 under the aegis of
the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera. But don't look for them to return.
It would be up to Center Theatre Group to initiate anything
theatrical at the Pavilion, Music Center officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon Davidson, the theater group's artistic director, says he is
not looking to expand its reach beyond the Ahmanson, the Mark Taper
Forum and the Kirk Douglas Theatre, a 320-seat house tentatively
scheduled to open in Culver City in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "There may occasionally be something we want to present for a
limited run, but it's not going to be the mainstay of what we do," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Owens, the Music Center's vice president for advancement,
says it has a $9-million endowment for programming; $2.5 million of
that is earmarked for dance. The goal, Owens said, is to keep the $9
million intact while spending only the yield--about $450,000 a year,
assuming the targeted 5% investment return. Like all nonprofit arts
presenters, which seldom expect to cover costs at the box office, the
Music Center also will be seeking donors for specific events.</TE>
<TE>   The Music Center began gearing up for its future as a presenter in
2000 when a volunteer group, the Center Dance Assn., formed to help
plan and fund the importation of dance companies.</TE>
<TE>   With available dates scarce at the Pavilion, major dance
attractions often have skipped L.A.; a well-regarded series at the
3,000-seat Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa has
picked up some of the slack. The Music Center's dance support group
has more than 100 members and has raised about $1 million, says its
founder and chairman, Liane Weintraub.</TE>
<TE>   The Music Center has used the last two seasons to put a toe in the
water as a dance presenter, bringing in four companies: Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theatre, Twyla Tharp Dance, Complexions and American
Ballet Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   "So far we've done well," says Schmidt. "We've hit our numbers and
we're thrilled." The Music Center expects to bring in three more
dance companies next spring: Pilobolus Dance Theatre and the
L.A.-based Diavolo Dance Theater at the Ahmanson and the Joffrey
Ballet at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. Judith Morr, the chief
programmer at the Orange County center, said she and Schmidt have
discussed jointly presenting two or three dance attractions at both
venues during 2003-04 and 2004-05.</TE>
<TE>   The Music Center may be late to the dance in booking for 2003-04,
but it won't necessarily be a wallflower, says Bob Fogelgren,
director of programs and administration for Dance/USA, a national
service organization based in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "National companies will lock in engagements many years out, but
they have flexibility," he said. The Music Center "should be able to
develop a significant season. When you have a chance to perform at a
major center like the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, many companies will
try to do that."</TE>
<TE>   All events at the Pavilion, starting a year from now, will revolve
around the opera's plans.</TE>
<TE>   The company must now spend 25% of its allotted preparation time
setting up and taking down scenery and the L.A. Philharmonic's
acoustic shell so that the Philharmonic can rehearse or perform on
the same day the opera is using the hall. A year from now, says Edgar
Baitzel, L.A. Opera director of artistic operations, opera-goers will
see better-rehearsed shows that will benefit from greatly increased
time for technical elements such as lighting design.</TE>
<TE>   Better quality, in the opera's grand strategy, will lure more
subscribers, attract more donors, and enable it eventually--but
probably no sooner than 2008--to expand its seasons to 12 productions
and 90 to 100 performances, Baitzel says. Such growth, he estimates,
would require a budget increase from the current $35 million to
nearly $60 million. Until then, the opera expects it will need 32
weeks a year in the Pavilion for set-ups, rehearsals and
performances, divided into four eight-week periods. Baitzel says the
opera informed the Music Center of that timetable more than seven
months ago. In keeping with their cautious approach to programming,
center leaders say they will wait until next month, when the opera
must submit its official schedule for 2003-2004, before they make any
booking commitments.</TE>
<TE>   What they come up with will begin to forge a new identity for the
organization and for the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a presenter you need a personality, a vision," says
Deborah Card, executive director of the Seattle Symphony, who spent
14 years as an executive for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Los
Angeles Chamber Orchestra before moving north in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Following through on the promise of a multiethnic embrace will be
crucial, says Shelton g. Stanfill, a former Music Center president
who left in 1996 for his current post as president of Atlanta's
Woodruff Arts Center.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, this is the most important decision that the Music Center
has made in order to secure its future," Stanfill says. "It has
to--as all of us do--diversify the ownership of these institutions,
and that means diversifying the programming. They have to find a real
great presenter-programmer."</TE>

raising its 17-day take to $150.7 million.</LD>
<TE>   "Blue Crush," starring Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe
Lake as die-hard surfers in Hawaii, premiered in third place with
$15.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend's other major release, Eddie Murphy's sci-fi comedy
"The Adventures of Pluto Nash," bombed with just $2.15 million,
coming in at No. 10. The movie, which cost about $90 million, was not
screened in advance for critics, generally a sign that it's a
stinker.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, every studio at some point has to face
disappointing results from one of your films," said Dan Fellman, head
of distribution for Warner Bros., which released "Pluto Nash." "You
only hope they're few and far between."</TE>
<TE>   In narrow release, Gwyneth Paltrow's scholarly romance
"Possession" premiered with a respectable $1.6 million. The
German-language food flick "Mostly Martha," about feuding restaurant
chefs, opened strongly with $42,000 in two New York City theaters. It
will expands to the top 10 markets next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   ''This has been a dream year for the studio,'' said Amy Pascal,
chairman of Sony's Columbia Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Sony still has a healthy lineup to come before year's end,
including the animated "Adam Sandler's 8 Crazy Nights"; Sandler and
Emily Watson in "Punch-Drunk Love"; Murphy and Owen Wilson in "I
Spy"; and Jennifer Lopez in "Maid in Manhattan."</TE>
<TE>   The studio also has plenty of mileage left in "XXX," which
confirmed Diesel's status as Hollywood's big new action star. So far,
the film has done slightly better business than Diesel's breakout
movie, "The Fast and the Furious," which grossed $144.5 million last
year.</TE>
<TE>   With big hits waning as summer winds down, "XXX" could repeat
again next weekend as the No. 1 movie, said Jeff Blake, head of
distribution for Sony.</TE>
<TE>   Premiering next weekend are Al Pacino's Hollywood satire "Simone,"
the Elizabeth Hurley-Matthew Perry comedy "Serving Sara" and the
Wesley Snipes-Ving Rhames prison-boxing drama "Undisputed."</TE>
<TE>   "The disadvantage of late summer is it's hard to get a big opening
because people are less in tune for going to the movies," Blake said.
"The advantage is there's a lot less competition."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Hollywood revenues slipped for the fifth-straight week
after months of surging business. The top 12 films took in $101.4
million, down 2% from the same weekend last year.</TE>
<TE>   Summer revenues still remain about 5% ahead of the record set last
year. And Hollywood remains on track to break 2001's yearlong
box-office record of $8.4 billion, said Paul Dergarabedian, president
of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks ticket sales.</TE>

<HD>Giving Hitler a Human Side</HD>
<DH>Television* Critics say a planned CBS miniseries on his
early life is a play for ratings that may stoke hatred. Producers
argue it looks at the roots of evil.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Television seems willing to take on any sensitive subject--from such
small-scale contemporary horrors as the JonBenet Ramsey killing, to
epic dramas taken from the Bible--but it has been more careful when
it comes to Adolf Hitler, confining depictions to news documentaries
or portraits of the adult fuhrer.</LD>
<LD>   Now, in an unprecedented move, a planned CBS miniseries called
"Hitler" is attempting to portray the most infamous villain of the
20th century in a way he has never been seen before: as a human
being. The project, which is scheduled to air over two nights during
either the February or May ratings sweeps period, is based on British
historian Ian Kershaw's book "Hitler: 1889-1936: Hubris." The
accuracy of Kershaw's work on the pre-World War II Hitler is not
being questioned. What has raised concerns is the inflammatory nature
and commercial imperatives of a TV movie that would chronicle
Hitler's progression from childhood to adulthood, from outcast
starving artist to leader of the Third Reich, without depicting the
horrific result of this rise.</LD>
<LD>   Some see the project as a naked play for ratings, using a figure
whose name instantly titillates.</LD>
<TE>   "History has made a judgment of the man, he's a monster," said
Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League.
"So now, why do we need to know when he dated, how he dated? The next
one will be Hitler as a preteen, we'll find out he's a bed-wetter. We
know who he is, we know what he did, what are we going to learn?"</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of CBS and Canada's Alliance-Atlantis, which is
producing the TV movie, have responded that their aim is to explore
the roots of evil, to examine what from Hitler's past made him into
the century's most reviled leader.</TE>
<TE>   In an early draft, a copy of which was obtained by The Times,
Hitler is introduced as an imperious, moody 12-year-old boy, playing
cowboys and Indians with his friends in Linz, Austria. In the draft's
climactic scene, Hitler, seen in a screening room, luxuriates in his
image as captured in German filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda
piece "Triumph of the Will."</TE>
<TE>   What is perhaps most alarming--and trivializing--to critics is the
very attempt to dramatize Hitler with dialogue, and Hollywood
dialogue at that. In "Hitler," this ranges from off-handed asides
("I'm not accustomed to such excellent pastry," Hitler says at one
point) to his remark about the revolt against communists in Germany.
"I'll need more than words to shut them up. Would you know anyone who
likes to crack heads?"</TE>
<TE>   "From a dramatic point of view, the script that I saw, which was
the first or second draft, is driven for the best emotional impact,
particularly in the second segment," said Rabbi John Rosove of Temple
Israel of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Any film that tackles a tragic time in history faces an inevitable
dilemma--to tell a compelling story requires characters speaking not
only in colorful language, but also with words that advance the plot.</TE>
<TE>   Can "Hitler" capture the man's essence without making him
sympathetic? The same sort of challenge faced NBC's acclaimed
"Holocaust" miniseries in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   Although upcoming project is designed to depict Hitler's
megalomania and madness--and by implication the roots of tyranny, in
any epoch--Rosove and others fear the planned miniseries could have
unintended consequences at a time of growing anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if they get it right, which is like a small percentage of a
chance, there's still going to be a lot of people out there who
misinterpret the whole thing," he said. What those behind the
miniseries "fail to understand is the impact this will have on the
haters in America, as well as in Europe and the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   Attempting to do Hitler-as-protagonist is hardly unprecedented.
He's been parodied on screen (by Charles Chaplin, most famously, in
the 1940 film "The Great Dictator") and taken on as a dramatic
character (by Richard Basehart in the 1962 film "Hitler" and Anthony
Hopkins in the 1980 TV movie "The Bunker.")</TE>
<TE>   CBS CEO Leslie Moonves formally announced the miniseries in July
at the annual gathering of television writers in Pasadena. "We know
how the story ends," Moonves said at the time. "But this is how
Hitler came to power. This is Hitler from a very early age in which
people don't know much of the story. This is a very timely subject
about how bad guys get into power and how it affects the rest of the
world," he said, a reference to Osama bin Laden and Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Moonves' announcement last month has thus far generated something
short of widespread controversy. Neither Foxman of the ADL nor Rabbi
Rosove suggest that preventing the production is the proper course.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, there is cynicism about the network's motives (it's more
about generating ratings than educating, critics say). On the other
side of the argument are Moonves, CBS Entertainment President Nancy
Tellem and Alliance-Atlantis Group CEO Peter Sussman, all of whom are
Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Moonves told Daily Variety columnist Army Archerd: "My
[Polish] grandmother was the only one of 11 children who survived"
the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   The weekly newspaper the Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles has
written several questioning articles, including one headlined "Prime
Time for Hitler." In its current issue, the journal critiqued the
first draft of the script.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly hope those concerned can withhold judgment until we
have material that is final. At this point, we are still in the early
stages of development," CBS spokesman Chris Ender said Friday.
Moonves declined to comment for this article.</TE>
<TE>   Alliance-Atlantis' Sussman allows that he's chagrined at the
leaking of the script's first draft, which is somewhat commonplace in
Hollywood. That assured the script would change significantly by the
time shooting is scheduled to begin, sometime in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Hitler's "point of view will be relevant in the film. Whether it's
only his point of view, I can't say. All you've seen is our attempt
to map out the sequence of his historical existence," Sussman said.</TE>
<TE>   Alliance-Atlantis is hardly an upstart; its production credits
range from the CBS series "CSI" and the TNT miniseries "Nuremberg" to
the acclaimed Canadian film "The Quarrel," about two Jewish Holocaust
survivors.</TE>
<TE>   A miniseries about a young Hitler, Sussman hopes, will fill "a gap
in the existing catalog of films" about Nazism and the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why he had chosen Hitler, as opposed to other perpetrators
of genocide, Sussman said: "Because this was the biggest monster of
our time. Why not do the biggest monster instead of the fifth biggest
or the ninth biggest?"</TE>
<TE>   The miniseries will likely shoot in Prague and Germany in the
fall, and a lead actor is weeks away from being named, Sussman said.
Of concerns that a twentysomething star actor would invite younger
viewers, uneducated about the Holocaust, to identify with a young
Hitler, Sussman said: "You need to be elegant about this decision.
Those WB ... actors in their 20s aren't exactly the right folks to
play Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   "Evil is not obvious, and I think it's important to never forget
how this kind of evil manifested itself. In fact, the German people
themselves were fooled into the momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "People say, 'Careful, you might make him more human.' He was
human ....We forget at the end of the day he was a human being. I
don't mean he was a good guy. He was a bad guy."</TE>

<HD>Americans can find comfort in a classic fall lineup</HD>

<LD>Brian Lowry's harsh critique of ABC's new prime-time lineup ("ABC
Looks Back, Hoping It Will See the Future," Wednesday) shows that he
is completely out of touch with the sentiments of many, if not most,
Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Since our collective post-9/11 shock, dismay and fear, many
television viewers have sought the comfort of less-complicated times.
Networks like Pax are too small or skew too far to the religious
right to satisfy this need.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than filling its airwaves with violent, overtly sexual or
doomsday, futuristic fare, ABC programming executives have strived to
offer viewers a balance.</LD>
<TE>   Clearly networks must appeal to the masses in order to achieve
ratings success. Yet ABC attempts to do this with a combination of
family programming, adult drama and, out of necessity, mainstream
reality shows.</TE>
<TE>   It is almost with joy that Lowry writes with such sarcasm, almost
as if to intimidate Times readers from actually checking out the new
lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Programs such as "8 Simple Rules ... ," "Less Than Perfect" and
"Life With Bonnie" are classic sitcoms, rooted in humor that never
approaches the ridiculous or offensive. Comedic dramas such as "MDs"
and "That Was Then" challenge viewers' attitudes toward life, aging,
prejudice and, in the case of "MDs"--and 40 million or so
Americans--living without health insurance!</TE>
<TE>   For Lowry to write this epitaph for ABC's new lineup is completely
shortsighted or evidence that his agenda is influenced by something
more.</TE>
<TE>   Jacqueline Cohen (a former "Happy Days" addict) is employed in
sales by ABC/ESPN Radio Networks in Burbank. She is not involved in
television programming but had the opportunity to view pilots of the
new ABC prime-time lineup.</TE>

<HD>Ahn Trio Spices Up Program With New Work</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intent on investing some of its glamour-girl capital in a good cause,
the Ahn Trio would like to do for the tradition-encrusted piano trio
repertoire what the Kronos Quartet has done for the string quartet.
Hence, "Ahn-Plugged," a concept that has produced one intriguing EMI
album (with another due in October), a string of concerts on that
theme and hybrid events like the one at the John Anson Ford
Amphitheatre on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The announced program was scrapped for another with a similar
plan--opening with a dash of tradition and spending the rest of the
evening in the present tense. Tradition didn't fare too well with a
bland legato reading of Haydn's Trio No. 45 in E-flat major, but the
sisters Ahn soon became invigorated by the new music, all written for
them this year.</LD>
<LD>   If you were looking for something truly startling, you wouldn't
find it in Maurice Jarre's "Engadiner Suite" (a U.S. premiere), in
which the composer of "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Dr. Zhivago" sends
the Ahns on a rambling, tuneful, mostly pretty journey through
Alpine-inspired soundscapes. Nor would you find it in Michael Nyman's
"Yellow Beach," where fluttery lyrical passages alternate with the
agitated minimalist machine.</LD>
<TE>   The least-known--and youngest (29 this year)--composer, Kenji
Bunch, provided the most interesting music in "Swing Shift: Music for
Evening Hours," which prowls urbanely through nocturnal New York City
for nearly half an hour, incorporating stylized impressions of jazz
while chugging to a close with something resembling a mechanized funk
groove. The ideas sometimes wear thin, and the Ahns could have swung
the pop sections more, but this and the hilarious encore, a
Kronos-like take on The Doors' "Riders on the Storm," had some of the
pizazz the Ahns apparently seek.</TE>

<HD>Maraca's Salsa-Timba Mix Gets the Crowd on Its Feet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bandleader and flutist Orlando "Maraca" Valle came from Cuba to
Culver City on Friday to remind us what great salsa should sound
like.</LD>
<LD>   His band's dynamic performance at Sagebrush Cantina displayed all
the elements that make genuine Afro-Cuban music so addicting. It was
spontaneously celebratory, rhythmically complex, lyrically clever,
instrumentally thrilling.</LD>
<LD>   And it made you want to dance.</LD>
<TE>   Maraca, a veteran of Irakere, has spent the last few years
defining his own style in the busy Afro-Cuban cosmos. He's now hit on
a successful balance between straight-ahead salsa and Cuba's
hard-driving new rhythms called timba, too fast and funky for
conservative U.S. salsa fans, who complain they can't dance to it.</TE>
<TE>   That certainly wasn't the problem Friday night at the hopping,
brightly lighted cantina. Maraca even made the waiters dance. At the
same time, he satisfied those demanding fans who look for unexpected
and sophisticated flavors in their salsa.</TE>
<TE>   Maraca's tight, muscular and accomplished 10-piece band performed
two sets, mostly from his latest album, "Tremenda Rumba!" (Tremendous
Rumba). They certainly lived up to the title, which can also refer to
a dynamite show or one heck of a party.</TE>
<TE>   Fans stood on chairs, did sexy bump-and-grinds by the bar and
formed admiring circles around the best dancers. All of it just feet
from the flutist and his two top-notch soneros (improvisational
singers), who stood on the floor in front of the bandstand.</TE>
<TE>   The place was so compact that they performed face to face with the
cluster of fans who gathered to watch them. After one of his dazzling
flute solos, the bandleader would wade into the crowd, greet a friend
or well-wisher, and turn to watch his band as if he was a fan.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, performers and spectators were chanting together,
hopping up and down, arms raised in the air. Tremenda rumba, indeed.</TE>

<HD>This Isn't Your Cup of Tea?</HD>
<DH>Marcel Marceau's popularity aside, many persist in seeing
mime as a most unspeakable act.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to mimes, it's time to break the silence:</LD>
<LD>   People hate 'em.</LD>
<LD>   Mime is not something that often comes up in casual office
conversation: "Hey, how 'bout those mimes?" But bring up the subject
in the form of an invitation to see Marcel Marceau--performing at
Westwood's Geffen Playhouse through Sunday--and mime bashers come out
of the closet, or maybe one of those boxes mimes always manage to get
stuck in.</LD>
<TE>   Here was a free ticket to see Marceau, the world's greatest living
mime, on opening night. But suddenly, friends of long standing were
horribly busy. E-mail invitations went unanswered. Even my husband,
who has a certain contractual obligation--how does that go, in
sickness and in theater featuring performers in whiteface--was headed
out of town on a business trip. Coincidence? I think not.</TE>
<TE>   I could have sulked about this, but the fact is, I didn't want to
go either. I confess: I, too, hated mimes. The only reason I attended
this performance was to research a compelling journalistic
assignment--to find out why so many among us despise the mime.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Wellner, the 10-year-old daughter of a college roommate
who lives in Washington, is too young to respond to societal pressure
to reject the form. Rebecca adores mimes. Why? "Because they can be
anything, do anything, and make anything out of nothing," Rebecca
says.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what Marceau did. Here was mime, and I didn't hate
it. Marceau was marvelous, transcendent--and, at 79, doesn't look
half bad in the white stretch suit he wears as his hapless signature
character, Bip. Any mime-haters in this audience were surely rendered
speechless.</TE>
<TE>   Yet outside of that particular box, it remains a bad time in
history for mimes. Just ask Marceau's assistant mimes, Gyongyi Biro,
35, and Alexander Neander, 32.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to justify a lot; it is very difficult," explains Biro,
educated as an engineer in her native Romania before jettisoning that
career to study mime at the Marceau school in Paris. "And they always
say: Do something," she adds, offering a quick rendition of
hands-on-the-invisible-wall backstage at the Geffen. You don't, she
points out, ask a dentist to demonstrate a little oral surgery, just
for fun.</TE>
<TE>   Setting the Stage</TE>
<TE>   Biro and Neander are Marceau's presenters. This means getting into
elaborate costume for the sole purpose of standing frozen in a formal
pose for about 20 seconds before each segment of Marceau's show,
holding flags printed with the title of the piece His Mime-ness will
perform next. Marceau's lengthy repertoire includes "The Creation of
the World," "Walking Against the Wind" (Michael Jackson modeled his
moonwalk on Marceau's wind-walking technique), and "The Cage." Then
there's "Bip Travels by Sea," "Bip as a Street Musician," "Bip
Commits Suicide." Occasionally, presenters' duties include walking or
other minor movement, but not much.</TE>
<TE>   But presenting the world's greatest mime is enough for Biro and
Neander. Working with Marceau makes it worth explaining over and over
that comparing Marceau's art to the mimes you find scaring kids at
birthday parties makes no more sense than comparing a street musician
to Yo-Yo Ma. "I never even dreamt, in my very, very secret dreams, to
be onstage with Marcel Marceau," Biro says, wide-eyed.</TE>
<TE>   The assistants get the chance to do more elaborate work as part of
Marceau's company, which does full-length "mimodramas." But Neander,
a Frenchman who fell in love with mime at age 9 when he first saw
Marceau, relishes the challenge of expressing emotion while standing
still as stone. "It seems perhaps to the public very short and
static, but the thing is, Marcel Marceau, every time we do the
position or the presentation, he is watching," Neander says. "From
the moment the lights come on, the attitude must be perfect--you
can't correct it."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Biro: "You have to have the spirit of the thing. That's why
some sculptures are good and some sculptures are not good. You look
at the Michelangelo sculpture and you say, 'Wow, he is expressing
something,' even though he is," she laughs, "moveless."</TE>
<TE>   The word was exactly right, even though it does not exist. After
this discussion, it seemed even more urgent to find out why so many
people shun the opportunity to be moved by movelessness, as much a
part of the magic of mime as walking against the wind. Time to
consult the experts.</TE>
<TE>   Once my mental block against mimes was shoved aside by Marceau, I
remembered that I actually have a mime friend, Los Angeles
writer-performer Charles Degelman. From 1967 to 1970, Degelman was
part of the famed San Francisco Mime Troupe. He went on to become a
founding member of the Pickle Family Circus.</TE>
<TE>   Out of habit, Degelman gives the word the French pronunciation,
"meem," because that's how the term was officially pronounced by the
San Francisco Mime Troupe until 1970, when there came a social
revolution. "It sounds facetious, but I'm telling the truth--in 1970,
there was a policy decision made; rather than having this snooty
French pronunciation, 'meem,' it was changed to mime so 'the people'
could say it," Degelman says.</TE>
<TE>   Degelman stresses the difference between "pantomime" (bad) and
"mime" (good), an important distinction he learned through R.G.
Davis, founder of the San Francisco troupe, who studied with Etienne
Decroux, a mentor of Marceau.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowing from Davis and Decroux, Degelman defines pantomime as
the "representation of objects in absentia"--say, pretending to play
a guitar that isn't there. Mime is the use of the body to become the
thing. "If I were to mime the playing of a guitar, I would represent
the guitar with my left arm extended, and flutter my fingers over my
lips while I sang notes," Degelman explains. He points out that,
contrary to popular belief, mime does not require silence. "We used
to shout at the top of our lungs," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The more abstract performance is, in Degelman's words, "mime
without the panto." This should not be confused with mime without the
pants, which is apparently what's going on over at the Coronet
Theatre in "Puppetry of the Penis."</TE>
<TE>   Where It All Went Wrong</TE>
<TE>   Degelman blames public misconception of mimes both on the
pervasiveness of cheap pantomime and on the 1970s--a decade that was
on the whole an embarrassment to the century (think Watergate and the
disco inferno).</TE>
<TE>   The '70s, he says, marked the birth of "living theater"; it became
chic to break down the implied "fourth wall" that separates an
audience from the performers. Attempting to interact with the
audience, either in the theater or on the streets, is a philosophical
choice for the mime, not part of the form.</TE>
<TE>   This tactic could inspire fear and loathing in any type of
performance; just because you want to hear Yo-Yo Ma play the cello
doesn't mean you want him to follow you down the street and poke his
bow in your ear. That's not mime or pantomime; that's just rude.</TE>
<TE>   University of Tulsa psychologist Tom J. Brian says research shows
that, in conversation, people are most comfortable when the other
party stands 3 feet away. The in-your-face mime invades this personal
space. With or without panto, this breed of mime is the annoying
"close talker" made famous in a "Seinfeld" episode, only worse--a
close talker who refuses to speak.</TE>
<TE>   Who is to blame for this trend? Fingers point to Shields &amp;
Yarnell, the mime duo who started as '70s street performers in San
Francisco's Union Square, rocketed to fame on the "Sonny and Cher
Show," moved on to their own TV show, went to Vegas, won an Emmy and
flamed out by the early 1980s. Before Robert Shields began following
people around on the streets of San Francisco, he did his robot act
in Los Angeles outside the Hollywood Wax Museum. He now lives in
Sedona, Ariz., --where he creates jewelry for a chain of four stores
called Robert Shields Design.</TE>
<TE>   During the duo's heyday, Shields, who studied with Marceau, spent
a lot of time complaining about mime-bashing, but at the same time
bashed Marceau's traditions.</TE>
<TE>   He quit Marceau's school after 3 1/2 weeks because "everyone was
wearing striped shirts and walking against the wind." "I'm not a real
fan of mime," Shields has said. "I'm a clown, an eccentric
dancer--everything Marcel Marceau wouldn't do, I do."</TE>
<TE>   So who's still walking against the wind to multiple standing
ovations around the world at 79, and who's selling bracelets in the
Southwest? I'm only asking. The moral of the story is, have respect
for mimes, and meems--for the mime can do anything, be anything, make
anything out of nothing. But please, do it at least 3 feet away from
me.</TE>

<HD>Magical 'C Zone' Defines Mancini's Value</HD>
<DH>Composed by leader John Clayton for his pianist son,
Gerald, the work united the orchestra's creative elements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was an exquisite segment--about halfway through the Mancini
Musicale at Royce Hall on Saturday night--that defined, more than any
other, the great value of the Henry Mancini Institute.</LD>
<LD>   The piece was "The C Zone," written by bassist-bandleader-composer
John Clayton for his son, pianist Gerald Clayton.</LD>
<LD>   Magically, the work, performed by the HMI orchestra under John
Clayton's articulate direction, brought together a superb
composition, a brilliant soloist and an enraptured ensemble
performance. Amid the ups and downs of the HMI's sixth season, this
work provided a persuasive musical illumination of how effective the
HMI can be, given the right material and creative focus.</LD>
<TE>   "The C Zone," according to John Clayton, refers to "challenge"
and/or "comfort," "beginning with the former and ending with the
latter." And it fulfilled both goals via a kaleidoscopic palette of
sound and rhythm, all of it circling, embracing and "challenging" the
piano solo.</TE>
<TE>   Southland jazz fans have become increasingly aware of Gerald
Clayton's remarkable skills through his local appearances. But he
outdid himself here, brilliantly dashing off the often demanding
written passages, adding his own unique touches, delivering virtuosic
improvisations topped with a truly extraordinary cadenza to close the
piece.</TE>
<TE>   Add Saturday's "C Zone" to last week's HMI Orchestra performance
of Bob Belden's "The Black Dahlia," toss in other important
elements--the brilliance of the HMI Orchestra string section, which
seemed to improve with every outing; the eagerness of the young
players to seize every musical moment; the numerous examples of fine
soloing--and the season begins to look like a success.</TE>
<TE>   Much more so, that is, than in the far too many passages in which
the various ensembles performed music that was beneath their skill
levels. Or, for that matter, than in the too numerous inclusions of
material by artistic director Pat Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Like last week's HMI Orchestra program, the Musicale included a
cluster of Williams efforts: a movement from a trumpet concerto
featuring solo work by Roy Hargrove; a vocal piece for the talented
young soprano, Dawn Cantwell; and four arrangements for a set of Ella
Fitzgerald songs, impressively sung by Patti Austin.</TE>
<TE>   And there was irony in the fact that the trumpet work, with its
electrifying orchestral passages, offered so much more convincing
evidence of Williams' skills than any of his other frequent
contributions to the programs. Less can definitely be more.</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately, the program opened and closed with a pair of
buoyant Mancini compositions, the highly combustible "Strings On
Fire" and the surging rhythms--enhanced by bassist Abe Laboriel--of
"Peter Gunn."</TE>

<HD>Minus the Chain Saw, Eminem Seems a Bit More Mature</HD>
<DH>The singer, showing new depth, gets further with quality
than crudity at Anger Management.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fans have to be prepared to work hard at rap-rock concerts. Between
the host and the five acts Friday at Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion
in Devore, the crowd was asked to wave its hands in the air, shout
"yeah" or just plain make some noise about, oh, 2.3 million times.</LD>
<LD>   The 20,000 fans did their best to oblige during the 4 1/2-hour
Anger Management Tour stop that featured crowd-pleasing but mostly
one-dimensional performances until Eminem took the stage--atop a
roller coaster.</LD>
<LD>   The towering, brightly lit device was the centerpiece in a
circus-like stage design that grew out of a line in "Business," a
track on his album "The Eminem Show." In the song, a collaboration
with Dr. Dre, Eminem shakes his head at the furor around him in
recent years: "What is this? There must be a circus in town."</LD>
<TE>   But the fun began before Eminem stepped on stage, as video screens
featured images of politicians and others, from Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.) to second lady Lynne Cheney, denouncing the
rapper's music with terms such as "outrage" and "shocking." It was
reminiscent of the '50s TV clips of adults attacking rock 'n' roll as
the work of the devil, integrationists or perhaps the Communists.</TE>
<TE>   The audience, naturally, howled.</TE>
<TE>   To make the remarks appear even more clownish, nine of the video
clips were placed together on the screen to resemble the boxes on
"Hollywood Squares."</TE>
<TE>   Though some fans may see the change from the 2000 Anger Management
Tour, when Eminem walked on stage with a chain saw, as a sign that he
is softening, the rapper's willingness to simply have fun on stage
was a liberating sign. There is an increasing maturity in his work,
and he has enough confidence in the material not to limit himself to
a single role on stage.</TE>
<TE>   It was telling Friday that Eminem stepped away from all the
sideshow effects and left his many cohorts in the wings for an
intimate version of "Cleaning Out My Closet," the most absorbing
track on the new album. It was the hip-hop equivalent of an acoustic
solo turn in a rock show.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Eminem's young fans knew the chain-saw image, which some
adults denounced as irresponsible, was really just a playful nod to
the horror-movie elements in his music.</TE>
<TE>   They also saw the humor in pushing parents' buttons by employing
satanic images, the same way the heavy metal bands have done over the
years.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for Eminem's massive appeal, in fact, is that he has
both rock 'n' roll and rap instincts, giving him far more dimension
than the other acts on Friday's bill--the rock group Papa Roach and
hip-hop entries Ludacris, Xzibit and X-ecutioners.</TE>
<TE>   Those rock instincts help him in the studio, where his most
powerful songs--including "Stan" and "Cleaning Out My Closet"--have
the same self-discovery and confession that rock picked up from folk
music.</TE>
<TE>   He's not the first rapper to incorporate this gripping personal
commentary in his songs. Ice Cube and 2Pac, among others, spoke about
their experiences in ways that were both artful and convincing. Most
bestselling rappers these days, however, deal in such generic
tough-guy or party-guy sentiments that the music seems fleeting and
disposable.</TE>
<TE>   Live, Eminem brings together the self-affirmation and spectacle of
rock and the edginess and modern sonic vitality of rap.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of Eminem's set was as endearing as the highlights, which
ranged from the gripping "Stan" and "Closet" to the ridiculously
catchy, PG-rated "Without Me."</TE>
<TE>   The rapper still shares far too much of the stage with his pals
from the rap group D12, and the ugly portrayal of women in such songs
as the macho-minded "Superman" is disheartening--even if hundreds of
young women near the front of the stage screamed throughout the song
as if he were serenading them with a love ballad.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike rock performers who apologize for stardom, Eminem has
always sought a wide audience, and some of the cruder elements in his
music seem designed to make sure the young suburban hip-hop crowd
continued to think of him as hard-core.</TE>
<TE>   But he got far, far stronger responses Friday for the quality
material in his repertoire than he did for the merely crude numbers.</TE>
<TE>   In his best moments at Blockbuster, Eminem didn't need to ask
anyone in the well-behaved crowd to raise their hands or shout,
"yeah." The hundreds of fans who held up lighters to show their
affection during "Closet" may have been employing a ritual borrowed
from rock, but it felt right at home on this chiefly hip-hop night.</TE>

<LD>A Tale of Two Martha Stewarts in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   It was the best of Marthas, it was the worst of Marthas.</LD>
<LD>   It was the Martha of wisdom, it was the Martha of foolishness.</LD>
<TE>   It was the Martha of belief, it was the Martha of incredulity.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Martha of light, it was the Martha of darkness.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Martha of hope, it was the Martha of despair.</TE>
<TE>   It was the gracious-living Martha of painted bird cages and dried
rose petals, it was the Martha of controversy--tainted by the feds
suspecting her of illegally trading ImClone Systems Inc. shares.</TE>
<TE>   It was the sage Martha of fava beans and Maine pancakes, it was
the ridiculed Martha of farce who kept chopping cabbage while trying
to fend off host Jane Clayson's questions about ImClone during her
weekly segment on CBS' "The Early Show."</TE>
<TE>   Two separate and distinct Marthas, at odds yet somehow
co-existing.</TE>
<TE>   I've never been a great fan of hers, although she did turn out to
be right about cats' hairballs. If combed together, they do make an
attractive centerpiece for formal dinners.</TE>
<TE>   The polar opposites of her life are intriguing, though.</TE>
<TE>   One Martha uses her media sprawl to give cheerful home-style
advice: in her magazine, newspaper column and radio show. And in
"From Martha's Garden" on HGTV, "From Martha's Kitchen" on Food
Network and her daily TV series, "Martha Stewart Living," airing at 9
a.m. on KCBS.</TE>
<TE>   The other embattled Martha is now taking on heat like one of her
Tuscan pot roasts. The U.S. attorney's office, the Securities and
Exchange Commission and Congress are questioning her dumping 4,000
shares of ImClone--whose former chairman, Sam Waksal, was her close
friend--a day before the biotech company announced its new cancer
drug had been rejected by the Food and Drug Administration. Although
Waksal faces federal charges of insider trading and perjury, Martha
has not been charged and denies all wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   How to reconcile these dueling Marthas? I thought of that when
bumping into "Martha Stewart Living" while surfing daytime TV one
morning and noting that many live-audience talk shows are
anachronisms on the cutting edge of obsolescence. As Martha's show
may be, should her image keep blackening.</TE>
<TE>   Time has stood still on these tawdry hours. Many still pluck their
guests from goofy little subcultures, the exposure on TV elevating
them to undeserved prominence. Here's betting they draw viewers from
the same underclass gene pool, people who surely find in these shows
validation of their dark feelings about life.</TE>
<TE>   On Jenny Jones' show, the audience screamed at a busty woman who
boasted of flashing men. On Maury Povich's show, the audience hooted
a man whose answers to a polygraph refuted his denial of cheating on
his pregnant teenage wife. "I ain't been with nobody," he insisted,
as poor Uncle Maury was deeply distraught--do you hear, an emotional
wreck?--over this domestic dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Sally Jessy Raphael, packing it in at the end of the
year as daytime TV's doyenne of low burlesque, was airing excerpts
from her best shows. On one, titled "I've Got a Shocking Secret," a
man rushed from the audience and began screaming at the guests, who
screamed back. Poor Sally was helpless to stop it, shaking her head
and throwing the camera one of those oy vey looks.</TE>
<TE>   In another oldie, the audience hooted and hissed at a man who had
devastated his fiance, Autumn, by telling her he'd slept twice with
her best friend, Gina. It didn't "mean nothin,' " he assured Autumn,
on his knees while begging forgiveness, because he and Gina were only
"the bestest of friends." Autumn wasn't buying it.</TE>
<TE>   She suffered, he suffered, poor Sally suffered. Then out came
Gina, who immediately began suffering too. "You're scum!" an audience
member shouted at the palooka who'd cheated on Autumn. He screamed at
the audience, the audience screamed at him. Sally rolled her eyes. As
much as her heart was breaking, as much as she wanted this to stop,
what could she do?</TE>
<TE>   There, there, Sally.</TE>
<TE>   Much of daytime has always defined its own shuttered reality.
Which is why "Martha Stewart Living" is a perfect fit, its opening
blissful shots of her smelling roses, smiling warmly at berries and
dipping a finger into whipped cream setting up an idealized tasteful
realm as distant in tone from Sally's back-alley grunges as the
Hamptons are from Coney Island.</TE>
<TE>   There she was one morning on "Martha Stewart Living," getting it
all together effortlessly for a 12-year-old's rock-climbing birthday
party, from the invitations (little rocks, with tags) to the cake
made from gooey, chewy, rocky ledge birthday bars that he helped her
make.</TE>
<TE>   While the scummiest of daytime shows peddle a nightmarish America
where supposedly no one can be trusted, "Martha Stewart Living" sells
dreams, too, as its star putters around her spotless house whipping
up comfort, sealed off from anxiety. Her dreams are unattainable
happy faces, though, and her manner confident and soothing, in
contrast to the chaos of her life.</TE>
<TE>   This recalled another surreal TV moment several years ago when
NBC's "Today" taped co-host Katie Couric celebrating Christmas inside
the White House with Bill and Hillary Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   The Clintons could have passed for Ozzie and Harriet while
schmoozing cozily with Couric, spinning Christmas yarns and telling
her they'd be holiday homebodies and "just have a good time
together."</TE>
<TE>   It was another remarkable performance by a pair of superb actors
who gave no hint of anything troubling them. As NBC's audience
watched this comforting fiction on videotape, however, cable's
all-news channels beamed live coverage of an overlapping reality that
was much grimmer:</TE>
<TE>   The House Judiciary Committee debate on impeaching Clinton over
Monica Lewinsky.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, as Martha is learning, there are times when even
the best acting doesn't amount to a hill of fava beans.</TE>

<LD>The initial announcement that Dave Brubeck would perform with "full
orchestra" at the Cerritos Performing Arts center tonight was an
eyebrow-raiser. Assembling a full orchestra takes considerable
planning, rehearsing and coordination--far more effort than one might
expect for a single night's engagement.</LD>
<LD>   If, however, Brubeck and his quartet were scheduled to appear with
an existing orchestra, that would be a far different story. But what
orchestra? And why did the announcement describe the ensemble in what
seemed to be such a purposefully vague fashion?</LD>
<LD>   It didn't take the CIA to come up with an answer. The first clue
was the inclusion of Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" for
trumpet--orchestration by Vlad Lavrik, with trumpet soloist Timofei
Dokshitzer--conducted by Carlo Ponti Jr. None of those names has ever
popped up on a list of the Southland's prominent studio musicians.</LD>
<TE>   But--second clue--in 2001, Ponti was appointed associate conductor
of the Russian National Orchestra, and Lavrik and Dokshitzer are
Russian names. Add to that two more clues--Brubeck performed with the
Russian National Orchestra on Friday at the Montalvo Festival in
Saratoga, and the Russian National Orchestra appears at the Hollywood
Bowl on Tuesday and Thursday--and the pieces of the puzzle come
together.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, it is the Russian National Orchestra, not an anonymous
"full orchestra," that will accompany Brubeck in his symphonic music,
as well as in such classics as "Blue Rondo a la Turk" and "Take
Five."</TE>
<TE>   So why all the mystery? For contractual reasons, given the
Russians' appearances at the Bowl, which obviously would like to sell
as many seats as possible, the Cerritos Center was obligated to
neither "advertise, promote or publicize" the Russian Orchestra's
performance, and it has not done so. But the evidence that was
apparent to anyone willing to do a bit of "Blue's Clues"-like probing
was too accessible for the secret to last.</TE>

<LD>Attempting to merge films with the ephemeral art of dance, Deborah
Brockus, artistic director of Brockus Project Dance Company,
presented "Caught Between: Dancing for Camera and Live Audience" at
the Ivar Theatre in Hollywood over the weekend. The 12-part
program--oldies, excerpts and premieres--yielded mixed results.</LD>
<LD>   Although dance on film can range from flat to breathtaking,
nothing beats the intoxicating aspects of well-performed live dance
with good choreography, when flesh and blood beckon the audience's
senses, taking them on a journey of discovery and satisfaction.
"Inside Out," was such a dance, with Kelley Parker and Scott Hislop
giving life to Alexandre Magno's hot, if overly commercial, 1992
choreography. Sensual partnering made for a compelling work, with
Magno's video (a premiere) of the couple redundant, indeed, a
distraction from the onstage action.</LD>
<LD>   Bodytalk dance's Lauren Winslow Kearns made better use of a slide
from Notre Dame as backdrop to her premiere, "Holding," a duet
between her and Sally E. Lambert punctuated by swinging arms and
whiplash-like partnering. Winslow Kearns' other premiere, the film
"Everywhere I Look," saw her moving fluidly through an all-white
space.</LD>
<TE>   Another dance-film premiere was Brockus' "Places Between."
Beautiful but benign, it featured dancers moving from beach to desert
to city in colorful costumes.</TE>
<TE>   Other stand-alone films: Stephanie Gilliland's brilliant
black-and-white "The Elevator Dance" (2001), a grainy, "dance noir"
party taking place in an elevator with her hard-working company,
Tongue; Jamie Nichols' "Caixa del Sol (Box of Sun)" from 1990 with a
hip-swinging, shadow-filled duet; and "Four Minutes," Sallie DeEtte
Mackie's artful look at local dancers she has photographed since
1992.</TE>
<TE>   Previously seen but making effective use of live dance and video
were Rosanna Gamson/World Wide in excerpts from "Rita Goes to Hell"
(2001), and the feral "Instinct" (2002), choreographed by Hysterica
Dance Company director Kitty McNamee.</TE>
<TE>   Less successful was Nina Kaufman's "Flight" (2001), a static film
and duet. Nina Winthrop's film, "Too Close for Conversation," was
clever, but her work-in-progress, "Prism," featuring a live musician
and solo dancer, had no film and didn't belong in the show. Where
were Fred and Ginger when you needed them?</TE>

<HD>Plan Steps Out From the Wings</HD>
<DH>Playhouse* La Jolla venue unveils an $11.5-million
expansion, which will include a third stage, offices and a cabaret.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Des McAnuff collected Tony Awards for directing "Big River" and "The
Who's Tommy," Broadway musicals he first staged as artistic director
of La Jolla Playhouse. Now it looks as if he'll get air conditioning
too.</LD>
<LD>   The playhouse unveiled architectural plans Friday for an
$11.5-million, 45,000-square-foot addition that will provide the
nonprofit regional company with its third stage, a black-box theater
that can seat as many as 450 and be reconfigured for each production.</LD>
<LD>   Other amenities include rehearsal rooms, tech workshops,
classrooms, a restaurant-cabaret, and for the first time, indoor
offices. Since its opening in 1983, the playhouse staff has worked in
trailers parked on the grounds. More than 40 people occupy four
trailers; McAnuff and his artistic staff have the one without air
conditioning.</LD>
<TE>   "I was told when I came here 20 years ago that they would build
offices," McAnuff recalled Friday over the phone from his trailer. "I
was shown designs and I bought it hook, line and sinker."</TE>
<TE>   The new designs by RoTo Architects and Fisher Merriman Sehgal
Yanez Inc. are backed by $32 million the Playhouse has raised in a
$36-million campaign that began in 1997. The goal, by year's end, is
to fund the expansion, bolster the theater's endowment from less than
$300,000 to $6 million and to have raised $18.5 million for annual
operations over the course of five years.</TE>
<TE>   Construction on the new wing, dubbed the Joan and Irwin Jacobs
Center for La Jolla Playhouse in honor of a $5-million donation from
the Qualcomm founder and his wife, is scheduled to start early next
year.</TE>
<TE>   The new theater is projected to open in spring 2004. It will be
named in honor of Sheila and Hughes Potiker, La Jolla philanthropists
who made a fortune publishing books of entertainment discount
coupons.</TE>
<TE>   The Potiker theater will help ease a logjam created by the
playhouse's affiliation with UC San Diego's department of theater and
dance. The playhouse is on campus, the site where student shows
occupy the 500-seat Mandell Weiss Theatre and the 400-seat Mandell
Weiss Forum about half the time. The Playhouse now will be able to
expand its seasons from six productions to eight, spread over the
three stages.</TE>
<TE>   McAnuff also covets the black-box space as an incubator of new
works via readings and workshop productions and as a home for shows
aimed at kids. "Our vision is to see a parking lot full of yellow
school buses," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The cabaret will have seating indoors for 200, with another 200 on
its patio, said McAnuff, who sees it as a diversely programmed hub of
post-theater entertainment, a la Joe's Pub at the Public Theater in
New York City.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, he said, the Potiker theater and its ancillary spaces
"will give us the freedom we've always needed."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign is approaching its goal despite repeated turnover in
the artistic director's chair. It began under Michael Greif,
continued under Anne Hamburger, who left after a year to become a
Disney executive in charge of theme park entertainment, and will end
under McAnuff, who returned in 2000 after six years as a filmmaker.</TE>

<HD>Sony Pictures Shatters a Record at the Box Office</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sony Pictures Entertainment shattered an industrywide box-office
record this weekend, exceeding more than $1.29 billion in domestic
ticket sales for 2002. The figure is even more significant because
the year isn't over, said Dan Marks, president of Nielsen EDI, a
box-office tracking firm.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the $1.3 billion does not include international and
other ancillary markets, such as television and DVD.</LD>
<LD>   Sony has had six No. 1 films this year, Marks said.</LD>
<TE>   This is the first winning streak the studio has seen since 1997,
when it set the industrywide record at $1.27 million.</TE>
<TE>   The new mark is due in large part to the phenomenal success of
"Spider-Man," which broke box-office records its first weekend and
has made more than $400 million domestically.</TE>
<TE>   The studio, which distributes films from Columbia Pictures, Joe
Roth's Revolution Studios and Screen Gems, had several other
high-grossing films this year, including the Adam Sandler comedy,
"Mr. Deeds," and the blockbuster sequel "Men in Black 2"--both of
which have topped $100 million domestically. In addition, Vin
Diesel's "XXX," which came out Aug. 9, has grossed an estimated $84.9
million.</TE>
<TE>   Sony, which has had a spotty track record at the box office for
the last several years, has spent more than $700 million in
production and marketing costs for this summer's blockbuster movies.</TE>

<HD>Thoth Dances Into the Vortex</HD>
<DH>Movies* Cinemax will feature the story of the violinist who
stole the show on Oscar night.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY A. RUHLING</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The violinist in the shiny gold loincloth and glittering chest chains
burst onto the red carpet at this year's Oscar ceremony like a
whirling dervish, startling the stars with his solo serenades.</LD>
<LD>   Nicole Kidman stopped in her tracks, transfixed, as he sang to her
and spun around her. A speechless Sandra Bullock couldn't take her
eyes off him.</LD>
<LD>   Russell Crowe shook his hand and congratulated him on a job well
done. A host of other celebrities, Uma Thurman, Judi Dench, Helen
Mirren and Jada Pinkett Smith among them, were mesmerized by his
music.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, Jodie Foster turned to Ethan Hawke and asked, "Who is
that guy who is stealing the show?"</TE>
<TE>   For the easy answer, they--and the millions who had tuned in--had
to wait until the awards ceremony, when the violinist named Thoth
twirled up to the stage with filmmaker Sarah Kernochan as she
accepted her Oscar for "Thoth," her short documentary about his
extraordinary life.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knew my name until then," he says, bubbling with joy after
the Oscars. "But afterward everyone came up to me to congratulate me.
I was the first African American to get an award that night, which
turned out to be a historic one for African Americans [Denzel
Washington and Halle Berry made Oscar history by winning best actor
and best actress honors], I was the only being on stage that nobody
had ever seen before, and I did things on stage that nobody there had
ever seen before."</TE>
<TE>   Now, wherever he goes, people stop him in the streets, where he
has been performing for nearly a quarter century, and ask him to
play.</TE>
<TE>   The world now knows his name and of his Oscar fame but few know
the story of how this classically trained musician went from being
homeless to playing at the Academy Awards. That will change today,
when "Thoth" makes its debut at 7 p.m. on HBO's Cinemax.</TE>
<TE>   "The film 'Thoth' is the intro to my message," he says. "It's
really Thoth 101. I hope that after viewing the film, people will
understand that I'm a serious musician who does serious work."</TE>
<TE>   The serious work he speaks of is his solo opera, which will be
self-released on CD starting today. Inspired by Wagner's "Der Ring
des Nibelungen," Thoth's "The Herma: The Life and Land of Nular-in"
focuses on a mythological land called Festad, where people of all
races live in harmony.</TE>
<TE>   "The Herma is the first original opera in all regards in this
millennium, and it is the first solo opera, and in terms of
accomplishment, I revel in it."</TE>
<TE>   How Thoth, a.k.a. the 48-year-old Stephen Kaufman of Queens, N.Y.,
came into being reads like the plot of a Hollywood movie. Of mixed
racial ancestry--his mother's family was from Barbados; his father's
relatives were Russian Jews--Kaufman grew up in a world that hurled
hatred at him.</TE>
<TE>   "There were several mixed couples in my parents' social set--my
father was a physician and my mother was a classical musician--but
when we left that world, people yelled obscenities. Even my father's
family disowned us," he says. "I didn't know who I was. I wasn't
black. I wasn't white. I wasn't accepted by either world or any
world."</TE>
<TE>   The young Stephen found solace in his music, composing a
mythological world, the Festad, where everyone lived peacefully. His
parents divorced when he was a teenager, and he embarked on a journey
of self-discovery that culminated in his transformation into Thoth,
the ancient Egyptian god of wisdom and communication.</TE>
<TE>   Thoth, who dresses like a cross between an ancient gladiator and
an Indian medicine man, turns his entire body into a musical
instrument as he performs what he calls "soloperas," or solo operas.</TE>
<TE>   As his otherworldly voice and the voice of the violin waft through
the air, his sandal-clad feet become drums, pounding the rhythms that
are the heartbeats of his performance pieces, accenting the rich
sounds of the bells and shells that are tied to his ankles.</TE>
<TE>   "I call my works 'pray-formances,' " he says. "In my soloperas,
I'm the composer, the orchestra, the characters and the dancers. My
work is part vocalization, parable, aerobics, monologue, alchemy,
theater, puzzle, language deconstruction, healing ritual and sacred
dance, and it draws upon my studies of religion, philosophy,
mythology and botany."</TE>
<TE>   It is also riveting: Kernochan, a successful screenwriter whose
only other documentary, 1972's "Marjoe," won an Oscar for best
feature documentary, was one of those who couldn't stop listening
when she discovered him in New York City's Central Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew immediately that I wanted to make a film about him," she
says. "I wanted to create a portrait of this artist, I wanted to
capture on film his performance so the rest of the world could
experience the same joy that I felt."</TE>
<TE>   The hoopla hasn't changed Thoth: Although he won't perform in
Central Park today when Cinemax airs the film--it's his regular day
off--he will be there the rest of the week. "Everything I do is an
expression of my being, my emotions," he says. "In showing my
emotions, I'm showing who I am."</TE>
<TE>   And who is that?</TE>
<TE>   "Myself," he replies emphatically. "Thoth."</TE>

<HD>Marin Sets the Mood for Flamenco Troupe</HD>
<DH>The Spanish company's intense leader ensured that the
program moved on his defiantly exacting terms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Distinctively skinny and surly, with a short contemporary haircut and
black work clothes, Andres Marin prowled the stage of the Irvine
Barclay Theatre on Friday looking more like a stagehand than the
leader of an esteemed flamenco company from Seville.</LD>
<LD>   Often standing in what an art student would recognize as the
Gothic Slouch, sometimes scarcely moving but swaying very slightly to
the music, Marin spent the early moments of the plotless, 90-minute
"Mas alla del Tiempo" (Beyond Time) exploring a few bold changes of
position and a series of slashing arm motions.</LD>
<LD>   His tight black pullover, with sleeves rolled up to the elbows,
heightened his intense gestural statements. But sustained step
patterns were a long time coming. Compania Flamenca Andres Marin
turned out to be as much about music as dance, so only when he had
directed his attention and ours to the artistry of an unusually
varied complement of accompanists did the real dancing begin.</LD>
<TE>   Even then, it came only from Adela Campallo and Mercedes Ruiz,
dancers who possessed Marin's heat, energy and gestural style but
also a technical polish that he resolutely avoided. Moreover, where
Campallo and Ruiz mirrored or matched one another in long, forceful
step patterns, Marin's next solo continued to keep the audience off
guard with only the briefest explosions of complex step rhythms, and
his endings nearly always looked unplanned or even defiant.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Marin came clean, dancing with the power of a
jackhammer ripping up concrete but with spectacular musical acuity.
Indeed, you might think of him as bringing to flamenco what Savion
Glover brought to tap: state-of-the-art technique kept deliberately
roughhewn and the refusal to flatter or spoon-feed the audience.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of the evening, when his step flourishes grew
incredibly intricate and prolonged, he would curtly kick toward the
audience and then leave the stage with a scowl, conveying his disgust
at wasting time on us, an attitude deeply embedded in flamenco
tradition. Like black people in America, Gypsies in Spain were
allowed to entertain the majority population but remained an abused
and isolated underclass. And they resented the oppressors who paid
them to perform.</TE>
<TE>   So even though Marin's haircut, clothes and dancing style seemed
daringly anti-traditional, his concept of the dancer/audience
relationship proved as old as flamenco itself--and still humbling, if
you accepted all the implications.</TE>
<TE>   Singers Pepe de Pura and Londro upheld the depth of feeling in
classic flamenco vocalism all evening, with guitarists Juan Antonio
Suarez "Canito" and Paco Iglesias offering refined support. However,
Encarna Anillo dominated the music-making with a voice choked with
tears, yet still unforgettably urgent and commanding.</TE>
<TE>   The accordion of Rafael Alvarez flavored a sensuous tango for
Campallo and Ruiz that blended characteristic Argentine rhythms with
flamenco footwork. A more enigmatic sequence found Marin slowly
crossing the stage, draped in an immense white, fringed shawl,
accompanied mournfully by the viola of Jerome Ireland and the bass of
Juanmi Guzman. After he dropped the shawl and left, without dancing a
step, Ruiz picked it up to begin a restless, sinewy solo that
depended as much on manipulations of that shawl and her long train as
her footwork.</TE>
<TE>   Percussionist Antonio Coronel completed the musical
ensemble--larger than any heard at the Barclay's New World Flamenco
Festival this season. As the final attraction of the 10-day event,
Marin left audiences with a musically rich but choreographically
challenging statement of where he thinks flamenco is headed.</TE>
<TE>   The antithesis of the indulgent pop-influenced flamenco fusion
that briefly flourished on world stages in the late 1990s, it
reinforced the art's core values while stripping away the
embellishments that leave flamenco linked to the past. Some audiences
may miss the frills and polka dots, bolero jackets and glamour he has
discarded, but something more essential remains, alive and definitely
kicking.</TE>

<HD>'Pluto Nash' Could Use More Lunar Lunacy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN STUART</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More gets you less in "The Adventures of Pluto Nash," a listless
sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate,
futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect. It's not awful,
but the high cost of a movie ticket these days seems like a steep
price to pay for 90 minutes of air conditioning and production
design.</LD>
<LD>   Murphy gives an oddly subdued performance as Pluto Nash, an
ex-smuggler who takes over a failing nightclub on the moon in 2080
and turns it into a cash cow. Once Club Pluto takes off, the lunar
mafia wants in. Nash brazenly turns them down, and soon he finds
himself the target of some nasty men with guns.</LD>
<LD>   Murphy goes after an aspiring singer with Marilyn Monroe moxie and
Whitney Houston pipes (Rosario Dawson). His sidekick is an aging
robot named Bruno (Randy Quaid) with a jolly Midwestern accent and a
big Howdy Doody smile that never quits, thanks to a happiness-chip
implant.</LD>
<TE>   The idea of a Prozac for robots is an amusing one--Hal and C3P0
could have benefited greatly. But Murphy and screenwriter Neil
Cuthbert never fully exploit the comic possibilities of today's
culture in tomorrow's clothing. The best they can come up with is a
bad Polish lounge singer (Jay Mohr) who reinvents himself as a
space-age Frank Sinatra, in his Capitol days. "Fly Me to the Moon,"
get it?</TE>
<TE>   As a souped-up crooner, Mohr brings you less as well, although
it's not from want of trying. Mohr is one of several talented
co-stars in search of better material, including Joe Pantoliano
(that's him, under the blond rug), Ileana Douglas (under the other
blond rug), Pam Grier (as Murphy's Foxy Brownish mom), John Cleese
(as a virtual-reality chauffeur) and Luis Guzman (as a garden-variety
comic Puerto Rican). As for Murphy's other incarnation, it's supposed
to be a surprise, and far be it from me to further waste your $10.</TE>
<TE>   Production designer Bill Brzeski earns his salary with a congested
moonscape of quickie motels and decaying clubs. The film's funniest
thing, aside from Quaid's lumbering automaton, is a visual gag: It's
perversely comforting to know that "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"
will still be running on the moon in the 2080s. It's doubtful whether
"The Adventures of Pluto Nash" will even be available on pay-per-view
by then, unless they pay you to view.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA-rated: PG-13, for violence, sexual humor and language.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's Nov. 25, 2001, and a tense scene caught on videotape unfolds on
a desolate strip of sand in the Afghan desert. Two young men are
perched face to face on a sprawl of blankets, a pair of Americans
brought together halfway across the world to play out an improbable
and ultimately tragic string of events.</LD>
<LD>   In a few moments, the interrogator would be dead, and the other
man, his arms still bound tightly behind him, would escape amid a
firestorm of bullets into the dank bowels of a prison encampment.</LD>
<LD>   The brief meeting of CIA agent Johnny "Mike" Spann and John Walker
Lindh is the centerpiece of an A&amp;E special tonight at 9 that examines
the starkly different paths that nevertheless led the men to the same
desert storm.</LD>
<TE>   "Investigative Reports: Two Young Americans: The Patriot and the
Taliban" paints an absorbing picture of individuals whose only
apparent shared trait was a steely sense of commitment.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, the paint is slapped on thicker than it needs to be.
Spann's story of being raised in a small Alabama town is accompanied
by warm, folksy music and depicted by shots of leafy streets and
Little League baseball. Lindh's Bay Area segment runs without music,
other than the blare of a commuter train's horn.</TE>
<TE>   The personality shadings are interesting. Spann's junior high
teacher cheerfully describes the boy punching out a classmate.
Lindh's online records reveal him posing as a black man in a chat
room while pontificating on the nature of racism.</TE>
<TE>   But the most gripping moments are spent with Spann's parents and
widow, whose pain and anger is assuaged only by the belief that they
lost a loved one for a noble cause.</TE>

<HD>Which Way to Network Success?</HD>
<DH>ABC's founder would say: Take some risks with new ideas</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARVIN WOLF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Iwas flabbergasted by ABC Entertainment President Susan Lyne's remark
(quoted in Brian Lowry's column Wednesday, "ABC Looks Back, Hoping It
Will See the Future") that ABC will leave "groundbreaking [prime-time
programming] to someone else."</LD>
<LD>   Lyne undoubtedly merely echoes her superiors, but such a policy
ought to set ABC founder Leonard Goldenson spinning in his grave.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of recycling tired concepts and retired executives from
the glory days when the network vanquished all comers in the ratings,
ABC management might better reflect on how Goldenson built ABC into
the top network of the 1970s and early '80s: by trying ideas never
tried before, and by hiring people with fresh ideas and giving them
the resources to produce, yes, groundbreaking shows.</LD>
<TE>   One of Goldenson's hottest hotshots was twentysomething Michael
Eisner, a fountain of wild notions who refused to censor himself.
Eisner wowed his boss, Marty Starger, with off-the-wall show notions
like a '50s high school crowd. "Happy Days" was original,
trend-setting, successful.</TE>
<TE>   Say, isn't ABC debuting a show about a '50s family this fall?</TE>
<TE>   Young Eisner saw the synergistic possibilities in turning the
Jackson Five--adolescent Michael and his brothers--into an animated
kids show.</TE>
<TE>   He had a lot of ideas, and if many led nowhere, quite a few became
hits.</TE>
<TE>   Goldenson delegated well. He gave junior executives like Eisner a
lot of rope and stayed out of their way. But he also listened to
everybody; his door was always open. CBS and NBC blew off a brash
young documentary filmmaker named David L. Wolper, but Goldenson
bought Wolper's "The Making of the President." From that relationship
came "Roots," an expensive, groundbreaking epic about black slavery,
a prime-time miniseries for largely white audiences, aired on eight
consecutive nights--a new approach and a colossal gamble. That was
Goldenson--always ready to bet his gut.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he made mistakes. He turned down Norman Lear's "All in
the Family." Twice. At ABC, only Eisner thought America was ready for
such a pioneering concept.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly Goldenson guessed right. And he backed his underlings:
When Edgar Scherick, whose background was in sports production,
wanted to leave sales to head programming, Goldenson gave him a shot.
He ignored those who ridiculed the notion and let Scherick turn a
comic book into an improbable series like none other: "Batman." He
listened again when Scherick opined that replacing low-rated shows in
midseason was better than waiting months to debut new ones. Now every
network has a second season.</TE>
<TE>   If good television is always risky business, ABC--under the firm
guidance of one Michael Eisner, chairman of parent Walt Disney
Co.--now prefers safe and tried material. They pour old wine into new
bottles and repackage tired concepts in the hopes that no one will
notice.</TE>
<TE>   A few years before he died in 1999, Goldenson told me that "Fox
trumped our ace" when that network turned out new shows to capture
young audiences and new kinds of shows aimed more broadly. But by
then ABC belonged to Capital Cities.</TE>
<TE>   And long before the multimillionaire CEOs of bankrupt behemoths
became household names, Goldenson explained the risks of operating a
company when its board is controlled by company management: "Good
outside directors will always try to do what's best for the company,"
he said. "But management directors are always tempted to do what's
best for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Television has evolved in many ways since the post-World War II
era when Goldenson entered it, starting with big screens and color
and progressing through cable to new networks and a fragmented
audience. But some things don't change. "In the end, it's just
pictures flickering on a screen," said Goldenson. "If people like
what they see, they'll watch it."</TE>
<TE>   When I spoke with Eisner in 1990, he described his early years at
ABC: "We were all in a fish tank, but there was nobody saying, 'This
fish, that fish.' So the strongest fish dominated, the most creative.
I think that's how ABC succeeded."</TE>
<TE>   Michael, ABC can succeed again. Every hotshot cools. Jump out of
the tank; get new fish who don't know what's impossible and let them
fight it out. Take chances--and ask yourself how Leonard almost
always got his way during the decades when most ABC directors were
outsiders and the network was a winner.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, there might even be a show there.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Wolf collaborated with Leonard Goldenson to write "Beating
the Odds" (Scribners, 1991), an account of Goldenson's years at ABC.
His latest book is "Buddha's Child, My Fight to Save Vietnam" (St.
Martin's, 2002), in collaboration with former South Vietnamese Prime
Minister Nguyen Cao Ky. Wolf lives in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>'High' From Alcohol Linked to Genes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though it's well known that the sons and daughters of alcoholics are
prone to heavy drinking, researchers have had a hard time pinpointing
exactly why.</LD>
<LD>   Some studies suggest that alcoholics' genes impart a heightened
sensitivity to the pleasures of a drink. Other experiments imply that
people inherit a physical tolerance: They're able to hold their
liquor, in effect, because they're less sensitive to the drug's
effects than the average person.</LD>
<LD>   A study published last week may help resolve the confusion.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers at Indiana University School of Medicine measured the
effects of alcohol on 116 adult social drinkers, who normally
averaged about four drinks a week. Half the subjects had at least two
close relatives who were diagnosed as alcoholics; the other half had
no known family history of heavy drinking. Both groups were given a
dose of alcohol intravenously, equivalent to about two drinks, and
asked to rate the drug's intoxicating effects.</TE>
<TE>   All immediately felt the sensation of the booze. But those with a
family history rated their intoxication level as significantly higher
than the group without the drinking pedigree. "They appeared to feel
the alcohol 'high' more intensely, at the beginning of the test,"
said Sandra Morzorati, a professor of psychiatry and the study's lead
author.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, however, the high had faded. Though the level of
alcohol in their blood was unchanged, the subjects with a family
history of alcoholism had adapted; they now felt no more intoxicated
than the others, said Morzorati.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that this could mean that people with a family history
develop a tolerance for alcohol because they drink more to maintain
the same effect they had earlier," she said. "That initial high goes
away, and they drink more to get the feeling back."</TE>
<TE>   One reason researchers have had difficulty measuring responses to
alcohol is that each person absorbs a drink at their own rate: In
some the alcohol moves from the stomach to the brain quickly; in
others it takes more time. Morzorati got around this problem by
administering the alcohol intravenously, and monitored blood alcohol
levels continually. "This allows for a direct comparison of the
effects, at a specific blood alcohol level," said Robert Pihl, an
alcoholism researcher at McGill University in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Genes may underlie how we think about the sensations of drinking,
researchers say. In previous studies, people closely related to
alcoholics have shown themselves to be very sensitive to positive
sensations, such as euphoria, and less to negative effects, such as
tiredness, Pihl said. By contrast, those with no family history of
alcoholism appear more likely to report the negative sensations, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   About one in 10 Americans who drink regularly go on to develop
habits that cause them serious problems, and about one in 20 become
heavily dependent, alcoholic drinkers, according to government
statistics. An estimated 20% to 25% of sons or brothers of alcoholics
develop serious drinking problems; and about 5% of alcoholics'
daughters or sisters do.</TE>
<TE>   "The next step in research is to look at the genetic contribution
to drinking behavior," Morzorati said. "To see, for example, if those
with a family history enjoy the drug more if they're drinking
faster."</TE>

<HD>A Family Holds On</HD>
<DH>When Alzheimer's strikes early, life turns upside-down as
children and spouse begin a slow farewell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Al Rhodes-Wickett hadn't been acting like himself for quite a while,
and his family was worried.</LD>
<LD>   When the doctor called one afternoon, his wife,
Sharon, disappeared into the privacy of a back bedroom. Their teenage
children, Rachel and Ben, feared the worst: Cancer? A brain tumor?</LD>
<LD>   The diagnosis: Alzheimer's disease.</LD>
<TE>   The kids were stunned. How could their father, a musician and
Methodist pastor, have Alzheimer's? He was only 55. Rachel, then 18,
looked up Alzheimer's in a medical encyclopedia that evening in March
2001. What she read didn't fit her dad. It said the memory-robbing
disease occurred in those older than 65 and was "invariably fatal."
Her mind jumped ahead--to her wedding day, to having children, to all
the pivotal moments she and her 14-year-old brother might not be able
to share with their laid-back dad.</TE>
<TE>   The experience of the Rhodes-Wickett family is at odds with our
image of Alzheimer's disease. We tend to envision Alzheimer's
patients in their sunset years like President Reagan or the frail
elderly who populate nursing homes. We don't picture physically
robust men or women whose sons and daughters have geometry homework
and soccer practice.</TE>
<TE>   As the baby boom population grows older, there will be many more
families like the Rhodes-Wicketts. Sharon, 53, and Al, now 56, like
many in their generation, delayed childbearing until their 30s and
40s to pursue careers. They were blindsided by an Alzheimer's
diagnosis with the kids still at home, college ahead and Medicare
help years off. Their story and that of families like them has been
little told.</TE>
<TE>   Although no one tracks early-onset cases, the Alzheimer's Assn.
estimates that as many as 10% of Alzheimer's patients--or 400,000 of
the 4 million people diagnosed each year--are younger than 65. An
unknown percentage of that group is still caring for children. If
current trends continue, more than 513,000 American men and women
between 45 and 64 might be affected by the beginning of the next
decade, estimates Shin-Yi Wu, a health researcher with Rand Corp., a
Santa Monica think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to see more and more of this," says Harvard
University neuropsychologist Marilyn Albert, noting that improved
diagnostic technology is helping doctors make earlier and more
accurate diagnoses of Alzheimer's.</TE>
<TE>   The disease profoundly alters family dynamics. The healthy parent
often becomes primary breadwinner, arbiter of family disagreements
and principal caregiver. As the affected parent is less able to
function independently, the spouse--and children--step in with
reminders about medicines, social cues and assistance with
irretrievable words.</TE>
<TE>   Kids Face Role Reversal</TE>
<TE>   All this can turn life upside-down for children used to depending
on that adult for security and stability. A parent who once made them
feel safe suddenly needs their help. The role reversal forces them to
grow up fast.</TE>
<TE>   There's no blueprint for dealing with an Alzheimer's-stricken
parent. No handbooks. No Web sites. No chat rooms. The few materials
from the Alzheimer's Assn. speak mostly about when Grandma or
Grandpa, not Mom or Dad, develops the incurable degenerative illness.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't give the kids a book because there's nothing written from
their perspective, based on their needs," says Laura Rice-Oeschger, a
social worker in Northridge for the Alzheimer's Assn. of Los Angeles.
She just organized a retreat for the half-dozen teenage children of
her early-onset support group.</TE>
<TE>   For many of them, home may no longer feel like a haven. With Dad
or Mom no longer his or her old self, it can be tough to explain the
nature of the illness to peers who want to know if the affected
parent is getting any better. Often kids become reluctant to burden
the rest of the family with their problems or emotions--at the time
of their lives when they most need help.</TE>
<TE>   That's been the case for Al and Sharon's younger child, Ben, 16.</TE>
<TE>   "We already have a whole lot of problems, and I don't want to add
to it," says Ben, who became so depressed and distracted by his dad's
illness that he flunked a history class. Therapy and antidepressants
got him back on track. Music helped too.</TE>
<TE>   A bassist whose band, Kill the Sound, recently performed at the
Whisky on Sunset Boulevard, he says getting out means "I don't think
about anything at home. I can actually have fun." He dreams of a
college where he can snowboard, maybe in Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   But he'll probably have to start at a more affordable community
college. Alzheimer's care drains family savings.</TE>
<TE>   Rachel has spent two years at Santa Monica College but has hopes
of transferring elsewhere. She's been able to save money on housing
and tuition while being near her dad: "I felt if these are his good
years, and these are his lucid years, I don't want to miss them."</TE>
<TE>   As Alzheimer's ravages the brain, it can make a parent behave in
ways that seem out of character. Rachel has learned to blame the
condition, not her dad, for the important things he has forgotten to
do and say--and for an aloofness that sometimes made her think he
loved her brother more.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you find out it's Alzheimer's, you can trace it back and
look at all the things you blamed him for in the past," says Rachel.
"There's a lot of forgiveness that can happen."</TE>
<TE>   There have been other gifts too: She and Ben have drawn closer.
Rachel calls her brother "the only other person on Earth that's
really going through the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Yet even though they may seem to be coping, sons and daughters of
early-onset Alzheimer's patients inevitably worry about their own
neurological health. Unlike late-onset Alzheimer's, which has
multiple causes, most early-onset stems from gene mutations passed on
by one parent. In families with these mutations on chromosomes 1, 14
and 21, the kids have a 50-50 chance of developing the disease
relatively early in life.</TE>
<TE>   When doctors first told Al that the Alzheimer's probably came from
his father, he thought: "If my dad gave this to me, I don't want to
be giving it to my children." Says Rachel: "I'm OK about getting
Alzheimer's at 85, but not at 45."</TE>
<TE>   Ben says he tries to reassure himself that by the time he might
get it, there will be a cure.</TE>
<TE>   Planning for the Future</TE>
<TE>   Alzheimer's can dash even the best-laid plans.</TE>
<TE>   Al and Sharon, who met while studying for the ministry, always
found a way to accommodate each other's ambitions. When Sharon worked
nearly round-the-clock as a district superintendent for the United
Methodist Church, Al did the lion's share of parenting, shopping and
housekeeping. When Al took sabbaticals from his congregations to work
on his music, Sharon shouldered the financial burdens. Now she has no
choice but to carry the load alone.</TE>
<TE>   Since Al left his church in Torrance and began collecting
disability benefits in January, Sharon has tried to square away the
family's modest finances and put something aside for the kids. She
paid off one car and put some money into IRAs. Because Al's driver's
license was taken away last month, she will put his car in Rachel's
name.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, the pastor of Westwood United Methodist Church, shared
Al's diagnosis and her feelings about it in a letter to her
congregation just after Easter last year, telling them: "You will
find that sometimes I can talk about it quite rationally and calmly;
then there are times when the tears are just ready to spill over."</TE>
<TE>   Alzheimer's is hard not only on the patient's children, but on the
spouse or partner as well. The disease can cause the affected person
to become withdrawn, creating feelings of loneliness and frustration
in the other person--at a time when he or she most needs support.</TE>
<TE>   The loss can seem doubly cruel to a couple who had expected many
more years together.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sharon had a phase of being "obsessively scared about the
future," she now feels "that one way or the other, I'll be provided
for, my kids will be provided for and somehow we will manage."</TE>
<TE>   But the plans she and Al once had--to buy a little piece of
property for their retirement years, for example--have evaporated.</TE>
<TE>   The future, Sharon says, "now looks more like a solitary prospect
for me."</TE>
<TE>   She'll work as long as she can, which brings not only income but
health insurance for Al. But even that benefit has its limits. Al had
to enroll in a UCLA clinical trial to get Reminyl, one of the three
medications that helps Alzheimer's patients function better even as
their brain cells are dying.</TE>
<TE>   All things considered, Al is doing well, according to his UCLA
neurologist, Dr. Verna Porter.</TE>
<TE>   He still has some insight into his illness, and says that without
the identity and income that work gave him, he feels "as if a large
part of me is just floating someplace."</TE>
<TE>   He wonders what contribution he can still make.</TE>
<TE>   He's trying to finish his fourth musical before the forgetting
takes over.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, Porter says, he won't recognize his wife or
children. "When it's a loss of connection to their lives on a daily
basis, that's going to be a turning point."</TE>
<TE>   Alzheimer's brings about mental followed by physical declines, but
doctors don't agree whether early-onset patients decline at the same
rate as the majority of patients.</TE>
<TE>   Some say the end will come more quickly; others say their relative
physical health will keep them alive longer, even after their mental
faculties deteriorate.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, all patients eventually need full-time care. Sharon is
thinking about a retirement community for religious workers that
offers assisted living and nursing services.</TE>
<TE>   Focusing on the Present</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two miles from the Rhodes-Wickett house is the San Fernando
Valley home of Dave and Shelly Rothberg. The couples attend the same
Alzheimer's support group.</TE>
<TE>   Dave, now 63, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's two summers ago, just
before his daughter Sarah's bat mitzvah, making bittersweet the
ceremony marking a Jewish girl's passage into adulthood. He retired
from his law practice a couple of months later.</TE>
<TE>   The Rothberg family defuses frustration with laughter and easy
banter that can make it look as though nothing's wrong. For a long
time, Dave and Shelly, 52, refused to believe that Dave's memory
problems were serious. But like many perceptive kids, Joseph, 16,
began putting the pieces together.</TE>
<TE>   He suspected something was wrong six years ago when he beat his
father at chess for the first time; Dave's victory had always been a
foregone conclusion. A few years later, when Joseph's Hebrew school
class watched a video about Alzheimer's, he read the list of warning
signs and gasped: "Oh my God, my dad has every single one of these."
He didn't breathe a word to his mother because he didn't want to
worry her, a protective instinct he shares with other kids.</TE>
<TE>   Driving is a milestone for any teen, but even more important for
Joseph. The day he got his permit, his father got a DMV-issued
California ID card to replace his relinquished license. Joseph's role
as No. 2 driver has been hard on his sister, Sarah, 14: "Joe can do
something for the family that's productive, and I really can't."
She's also lost that quiet time in the car with her father: "My dad
and I used to bond when he drove me places." Like many Alzheimer's
families, the Rothbergs know tomorrow rarely brings good news, so
they're taking vacations together now, while Dave still enjoys
traveling.</TE>
<TE>   For spouses and children, the hardest thing may be watching the
person they know disappear a little bit more every day. But experts
and families say that what's important is to focus on the
present--not on what has been lost, but on what's still there.</TE>
<TE>   "Remember the person he or she was and still is on the inside,"
says Rachel Rhodes-Wickett. Looking ahead to the inevitable, she says
that what she wants from her father "is something he's already given
me. He's a great father. That comes from being a good human being. He
couldn't give me more of that if he lived 100 years."</TE>

<HD>That Appendix May Be Good for Something After All</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You'd think life was dangerous enough without our bodies lugging
around a useless structure that can turn traitor and kill us. We're
talking, of course, about the appendix--that 4-inch-long blind alley
that branches from the right side of the colon. ("Vermiform
appendix," for any Latin lovers out there, means "hanging,
worm-shaped form.")</LD>
<LD>   In school, kids learn that the appendix is an evolutionary
vestige--one that was more important in our distant past, when our
ancestor's diets were different, but pretty much a free-loader now.
Medical students learn that too.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the idea has been growing for a while that the appendix does
something good for us.</LD>
<TE>   That "something good" must be subtle, of course. The appendix
isn't needed for life: Removing it when it gets diseased doesn't make
folks drop dead (though this may not have been the case for the first
appendectomies, way back in the 1700s).</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if there are any down sides to strolling around without
an appendix, scientists have still to find them.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the case for the useful appendix is alluring.</TE>
<TE>   Even old-time anatomists noticed that the appendix had striking
similarities to structures in the gut, lung and other mucus-making
tissues that are loaded with cells of the immune system. And if you
look at it under the microscope, the appendix is rather like a
structure in the chicken called the bursa of Fabricius--and that's
definitely an immune system organ. (Immune cells were first
discovered in the bursa.)</TE>
<TE>   Those things add up to an interesting idea: that the human
appendix plays a part in developing the body's immunity.</TE>
<TE>   If that's the case, it would be great to carefully compare immune
systems of people who've had their appendixes out and those who
haven't--or to study human appendixes in detail to find out just what
they're doing to immune cells.</TE>
<TE>   Great but brutishly difficult, says appendix researcher Rose Mage
at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Try
getting hold of the tissue--unless, that is, it's a diseased appendix
from an appendectomy, which means the tissue is probably not normal
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The rabbit appendix is another matter (and luckily rabbits have a
much heftier appendix for their body size than do we). From these,
Mage's team has learned that the appendix starts filling up with
immune cells after birth until by 6 weeks it's positively brimming
with them. Thereafter, the numbers subside: Rabbit youths have
relatively shrunken appendixes.</TE>
<TE>   This also seems to be the case with human appendixes, to the
extent that Mage can study them: They fill up with immune cells then
lose them by the teenage years.</TE>
<TE>   Mage has also learned that the immune cells kind of mature while
they're hanging out in the rabbit appendix--so that they're ready to
fight the good fight against bacteria, viruses and other looming
threats.</TE>
<TE>   "The appendix seems to be important in the very young," she
suggests. This may be why people do nicely without them. By the time
they've gotten appendicitis, maybe the structure's already done its
job.</TE>
<TE>   A few more facts about appendixes:</TE>
<TE>   * The causes of appendicitis are varied, but often stem from the
narrowness of the appendix's opening to the colon. "If you get a hard
piece of stool or a piece of corn, nut or debris, such as a piece of
celery, that fills up the opening of the appendix so it can't empty
out into the colon," says Dr. Bennett Roth, professor of medicine at
UCLA, it can lead to inflammation, infection, even rupture.</TE>
<TE>   * Inflamed appendixes may increase someone's odds of getting
inflammatory bowel disease, says Dr. Gary Lichtenstein, director of
the inflammatory bowel disease center at the Hospital of the
University of Pennsylvania. This again suggests the appendix has a
role in immunity--though in this case, immunity run amok.</TE>
<TE>   * Finally, certain surgeons have no doubts that the appendix is
useful. They use it to create an artificial urine channel for kids
born with urinary tract defects.</TE>

<LD>I'm 40 now and close to accepting that I'll never make it in the NBA.</LD>
<LD>   It's not just that I'm slow, can't jump and am a less-than-stellar
free-throw shooter (just like Shaq). It's that I'm out of practice.
At least I'm pretty sure that's the only reason.</LD>
<LD>   I haven't run a full-court game since the morning of my wedding
more than five years ago. My goal that day was simple: Survive to say
my lines. So when asked recently to do a column about pickup
basketball, my goal was essentially the same: Survive to write these
lines.</LD>
<TE>   I say survive because after being a lifelong basketball player my
ankles feel as if they are made of papier mache. My knees feel as
brittle as chalk. And the only Walton my game feels like is Grandpa,
not Bill or Luke.</TE>
<TE>   But the pull of the courts is strong. I practically grew up on
basketball in North Carolina. When I was a kid, there weren't any
local pro teams to speak of, and college hoops was a near religion.
Most autumn and winter days after school were spent in the backyard
or a local community center honing jump shots or perfecting the pick
'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   As an eighth-grader, I attended Dean Smith's basketball camp in
Chapel Hill. It wasn't based on merit. I had a friend whose father
was a generous donor to the university. Instead of Smith, the
legendary former coach of the University of North Carolina Tarheels,
we got one of his assistants, Roy Williams, who turned out to be no
slouch himself.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, now head coach at the University of Kansas, taught us
all about "Carolina basketball," which stressed the fundamentals:
passing, dribbling and shooting. But above all, Carolina basketball
meant unselfishness. How to set picks, how to hustle on offense
without the ball and how to hit the open man.</TE>
<TE>   In short, we learned all the skills that are next to worthless in
a pickup game. That lesson was brought home to me yet again as I
played one recent afternoon at the Ketchum YMCA in downtown Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The courts at the YMCA are outstanding. The hardwood floors are
well maintained and wonderfully squeaky, if lacking that smoky old
gym charm I recall from the movie "Hoosiers." Not surprisingly, it
gets crowded. During the lunch hour and after work, both mini-full
courts are usually bustling with action and a bunch of (mostly) guys
waiting in the wings to play.</TE>
<TE>   When I went one midweek afternoon, there were only enough people
for a half-court game. Within 30 minutes, more players arrived and we
moved to a full-court game.</TE>
<TE>   The age range of players was probably from 14 to 50 or so, but
most seemed to be in their late 20s and early 30s. The skill level
was fairly competitive. One sure sign of decent players: no
sandbaggers (guys who linger near their own basket while everyone
else scrambles to the other side of the floor to play defense).</TE>
<TE>   To fulfill the fitness portion of this column, I was supposed to
wear a heart-rate monitor. I was a little nervous about this since
its discovery would mean certain ridicule from strangers. If we went
to shirts and skins, I had an excuse ready: I have a heart condition.
Luckily, everyone kept their shirts on and nobody seemed to notice
the monitor.</TE>
<TE>   I stretched before the game and was fairly confident that even
though I hadn't run the courts in a while, I'd be fine. I'm in pretty
good shape. I do a 30-minute cardiovascular workout at least four,
sometimes five, times a week without much trouble.</TE>
<TE>   After about 10 minutes, I realized that I was indeed in good
shape, as long as I stuck to exercise machines. I am in what you
might call "elliptical trainer shape," not "full-court basketball
shape." I was using all kinds of muscles that apparently had been
sleeping during my cardiovascular routines.</TE>
<TE>   My heart monitor was programmed to beep if I rose above or fell
below my target heart rate zone, which indicates whether I'm training
too hard or not hard enough. Well, my ticker was racing so much that
when I shuffled back on defense I must have sounded like a truck in
reverse. Luckily, my loud and labored breathing drowned out the
beeping sound.</TE>
<TE>   In about an hour of playing, I was--despite the many ups and downs
on the court and in my heart--within my target heart rate for almost
45 minutes. There were momentary breaks during games or breaks
between games when disagreements arose over the score or fouls. But
all in all, a very vigorous workout.</TE>
<TE>   I tried to ignore my body's urgent pleas for more oxygen and
practice the basketball fundamentals I'd learned so long ago. I set
picks, I boxed out, I passed.</TE>
<TE>   My teammates, however, didn't really play that kind of ball. Their
style might best be summed up as: "If I touch it, I will shoot it."
By the end of the third game, I was launching long shots from the
perimeter too.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't have the energy to do much more. As it got close to the
end of the hour, the only fundamental I was trying to practice was
simply standing up and moving my cinder-block legs as best I could.</TE>
<TE>   Though age may have withered the body, it has developed the mind.
When matching up for the full-court game, I chose the most
tired-looking guy I could find. We both were grateful for the other's
poor physical condition.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily, my ankles and knees remained intact. The next day,
however, an assortment of leg and neck muscles felt as taut as the
cables on the Golden Gate Bridge. As much as I hate to admit it, this
experiment has taught me that I can rule out an NBA career. That is,
unless I'm hired to guard Shaq.</TE>

<LD>For some women, weight gained during pregnancy is the beginning of a
persistent battle of the bulge. Now researchers have found that women
who gain too much weight  before delivery--regardless of their
starting weight--are more likely to be overweight years later.</LD>
<LD>   But the first long-term study of weight problems in a large group
of women following pregnancy also had an encouraging finding: Women
who manage to lose the fat within six months of delivery are, on
average, only about 5 pounds heavier later in life. In contrast,
those who hold on to their pregnancy weight are about 18 pounds
heavier on average.</LD>
<LD>   Breast-feeding and aerobic dance or exercise classes can help the
weight loss process, according to the Gundersen Lutheran Medical
Center researchers in La Crosse, Wis. Among the 540 women studied an
average of 8 1/2 years after delivery, those who nursed their babies
for at least three months had a significantly lower weight gain over
time. And though the women didn't see an immediate weight loss from
aerobic exercise, over the years there were significant benefits.
Neither subsequent pregnancies, age nor recreational physical
activity such as running, cycling or swimming made any difference.</LD>

<TE>   Forcing a Food on Children</TE>
<TE>   May Create Lifelong Aversion</TE>
<TE>   If you've ever told your child to eat her spinach before she could
leave the table, you could be setting her up for a lifelong avoidance
of greens. A new study has found that the feelings of helplessness
that are aroused when a child is forced to eat a disliked or new food
can trigger a permanent food aversion.</TE>
<TE>   A survey of about 400 Southern Methodist University undergraduates
found that, as children, 69% of them had at least one episode in
which they were forced to eat a food. This was a much higher
incidence than had been reported in past studies.</TE>
<TE>   Vegetables were the food most often forced upon the students as
children, followed at some distance by red meat and seafood. The most
common form of coercion was threat, usually involving some kind of
punishment: "You cannot leave the table until you finish." And 26%
said they were punished. Some were forced to stay at the table or go
to bed without dinner.</TE>
<TE>   The clash of wills between the child and the authority figure had
lasting consequences. In this study, 72% of those who had battled
over food would still not eat the food, and it made 37% of them
extremely uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more important to win the war of a lifetime of healthy
eating than a single battle over any specific food," says W. Robert
Batsell Jr., a coauthor of the study and associate professor of
psychology at Kalamazoo College in Michigan. "Parents should not
insist that a new or disliked food is eaten. If the child voluntarily
samples the food, they will probably come to like it over time. If
not ... don't make a big deal about it, and try again another time,"
he says.</TE>

<TE>   Vitamin E Shown to Boost</TE>
<TE>   Brain Function in the Elderly</TE>
<TE>   Vitamin E has been touted for its anti-aging and anti-cancer
benefits because, as an antioxidant, it counters the destructive
action of molecules called free radicals. Now a study has shown
vitamin E may also help the memory loss and impaired thinking that
occurs in the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging in Chicago
conducted a three-year study involving nearly 3,000 people older than
65 to investigate the cognitive effects of vitamin E in food and
supplements. By comparing the average scores of four different tests
of memory and perception, the researchers were able to track change
in cognitive function with age. The participants also completed
dietary questionnaires periodically, which enabled the researchers to
determine their vitamin E intake.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that the higher the intake of total vitamin E, the
less change there was in the people's average test scores each year.
And those men and women who consumed the most vitamin E had a 36%
lower rate of decline in their average test scores than those who
consumed the least vitamin E. Other antioxidants, such as vitamin A,
carotene and vitamin C, had little effect on the results.</TE>
<TE>   Those who took supplements but got little vitamin E from food
appeared to have the same protective benefit from the vitamin as
those who consumed high amounts of E in their diets, says Martha
Clare Morris, an assistant professor at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center. Several clinical trials are underway to compare
protection from cognitive decline in people taking a supplement or a
placebo, she says. In this study, the majority who took a supplement
reported taking 400 IU a day.</TE>

<TE>   Teens Need Not Fear Weight</TE>
<TE>   Gain From Birth-Control Pills</TE>
<TE>   The most common reason that women stop taking birth-control pills
is that they think the contraceptive is making them gain weight.
Several studies have proved this is a misperception in adult women,
and now a study has found that teenage girls don't need to worry
about it either.</TE>
<TE>   An ongoing study at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey has
been tracking a group of 112 healthy young women for nine years,
since they were about 12 years old. This report from the ongoing
research evaluated body weight, percentage of body fat and levels of
various fats in the blood of 66 girls, 39 of whom had been taking the
pill for at least six months and until they were 21 years old.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found that the changes in body weight and
percentage of body fat among the pill users over time was no
different on average than that of girls not taking the pill. The
gains were the same even when the researchers took physical activity
into account.</TE>
<TE>   The pill takers had, on average, higher levels of total
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (the unhealthful
kind) and triglycerides than those girls not taking the low-dose oral
contraceptives. However, the researchers noted that although
elevated, the cholesterol levels of the pill takers were within the
normal range.</TE>

<TE>   Viagra May Be Safe for Men</TE>
<TE>   With Congestive Heart Failure</TE>
<TE>   Men with heart failure and impotence often think they have to
choose between Viagra and their heart medication. But many don't have
to make the trade-off, according to a study from Sao Paulo University
Medical School in Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Among 23 men with moderate to severe heart failure and impotence,
Viagra (sildenafil) caused no harmful effects and actually improved
the men's ability to exercise, which affects the heart in a way
similar to sex, researchers found. There has been some concern about
sildenafil because it inhibits an enzyme that affects heart and blood
vessel function.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, the men took sildenafil or a placebo and had an
exercise stress test about an hour later. On another day they
returned, took whichever drug they hadn't taken the first time, and
repeated the stress test. In the second part of the study, the
patients took 50 to 150 milligrams of sildenafil at home two hours
before they expected to have sex.</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen men were able to complete the study. All but two were
able to have sex after taking sildenafil, and there were no more side
effects in those taking the drug than in those taking the placebo.
The men's heart rates did not increase significantly during the
exercise stress test; the researchers say this indicates that blood
flow to the heart was adequate and that it reduced the chances of
chest pain or heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   The authors suggest that physicians caring for men with congestive
heart failure and impotence give those patients an exercise stress
test after they've taken sildenafil to see if the drug is safe for
them.</TE>

<HD>Nutrition Facts Can Make for Revealing Reading</HD>
<DH>Diet * Some foods (like cereal) can be deceptively high in
calories while others (like bacon) can be surprisingly low. So read
labels carefully.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY SQUIRES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every year, registered dietitian Jackie Berning takes her new
students grocery shopping. Then she sits back and waits for their
surprise as they discover some foods aren't as bad as they're cracked
up to be--and others aren't quite as good.</LD>
<LD>   One of the biggest shocks every year? Turkey hot dogs, which clock
in at 115 calories and seven grams of fat per dog: less than the 150
calories and 13 grams of fat in beef hot dogs, but not exactly a
low-fat choice.</LD>
<LD>   "The students are usually on a tight budget and eat a lot of hot
dogs," says Berning, professor of nutrition at the University of
Colorado and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetics Assn. "They
think they're doing the right thing by choosing turkey hot dogs until
they do the calculations and figure out that more than half the
calories in them are from fat."</LD>
<TE>   Whether it's turkey hot dogs, baked crackers or frozen soy
desserts, some foods can be deceptively high in calories and
others--including whipped cream--can be surprisingly low. For that
reason, Berning and other nutrition experts urge even consumers who
fancy themselves well-informed to pay special attention to the
nutrition food labels.</TE>
<TE>   Here are a few food surprises that may help motivate you to take a
closer look at nutrition facts.</TE>
<TE>   Worse Than You Thought:</TE>
<TE>   Chicken: All poultry is not low-fat. One cooked four-ounce wing
has about 11 grams of fat. Chicken nuggets contain about 17 grams of
fat per three-ounce serving--four more than a hot dog.</TE>
<TE>   Cereals: Often a good source of fiber and folic acid, some are
surprisingly calorie-dense. Grape Nuts, for example, has 200 calories
per quarter-cup. Also, you may be surprised to learn that some
"healthy" cereals have little or no fiber. Example: Special K has 150
calories but just one gram of fiber per cup.</TE>
<TE>   Crackers: Just because they're baked doesn't mean they're low-fat.
One ounce of Wheat Thins or Wheatables (about 16 crackers) packs 140
calories and six grams of fat, rivaling fried snack foods such as
Nacho Cheese Doritos (seven grams of fat, 140 calories per ounce).
Don't assume that vegetables give you a pass, either: Nabisco's
Vegetable Thins have 160 calories per 14 crackers and nine grams of
fat per serving--two grams more than the same amount of fried taco
chips.</TE>
<TE>   Frozen desserts: "Gelato" sounds light, but added cream can hike
calories to a whopping 500 per cup, including 12 grams of saturated
fat. Frozen soy desserts can check in at 400 calories per cup, 100
more than some ice creams.</TE>
<TE>   Meatless "chicken" nuggets: Some are fairly high in fat, with
seven grams per serving--as much as seven times the amount of some
"meatless" burgers.</TE>
<TE>   Peanut butter: Many commercially prepared brands contain
artery-clogging hydrogenated trans fats to make them more spreadable.
Instead, buy peanut butter that is freshly ground in the store; drain
the oil on top to cut fat in half and avoid the hydrogenated oils
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Popcorn: Air-popped, it's just 20 calories per cup--about a
handful--but microwave bags can contain nine to 12 cups and 39 grams
of fat--more than a day's worth. Look for light varieties, which
hover around five to six grams of fat per serving and about 20 to 25
calories per serving. But count those handfuls carefully.</TE>
<TE>   Better Than You Thought:</TE>
<TE>   Bacon: No, you wouldn't want to eat it every day, but two slices
have about seven grams of fat--only three saturated--and about 70
calories.</TE>
<TE>   Chocolate sauce: Who says you can't have a little decadence? One
tablespoon has no fat and just 50 calories.</TE>
<TE>   Pumpkin pie: It counts as a vegetable and, made with skim milk, is
low in fat and calories, averaging about 150 calories per serving.
But go easy on store-bought varieties, which can have nearly double
the calories and 11 grams of fat per serving, mostly because of cream
and high-fat crusts. When in doubt, eat only the filling.</TE>
<TE>   Red meat: Ounce per ounce, most cuts of red meat are "not that
different calorically than chicken or fish," notes Leslie Bonci,
director of sports nutrition at the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center. Leaner cuts include flank steak and pork-loin center chops.</TE>
<TE>   Tuna in oil: Yes, it has six grams of fat per serving and 110
calories per two ounces. Press it down and drain it to remove most of
the oil. The result: tuna with calories nearly as low as the 60 found
in two ounces of water-packed tuna. Because oil-packed is more moist,
you need less mayo, which adds 100 calories per tablespoon. Canned
tuna salad, now available in lunch packs, may not be as good a
choice: It contains 16 grams of fat per serving.</TE>
<TE>   Waffles: Low-fat, whole-grain frozen varieties can have as little
as 2.5 grams of fat per two waffles and 170 calories.</TE>
<TE>   Whipped cream: It's known for being high-fat, but two tablespoons
have just 25 calories, a satisfying way to top off a cup of fresh
berries.</TE>

<HD>In Crashes, Legs Often Take a Hit</HD>
<DH>Airbags and seat belts don't protect the lower body. Car
designers and federal officials are trying to improve overall safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Airbags and seat belts have helped more people survive potentially
fatal automobile crashes, but they haven't shielded drivers and
passengers from leg and foot injuries.</LD>
<LD>   The vulnerability of feet was illustrated earlier this month, when
actor Jason Priestley suffered fractures to both feet, his back and
nose, as the car he was driving at the Kentucky Speedway crashed into
a wall at 180 mph. He eventually was flown to Methodist Hospital in
Indiana, which specializes in injuries common in professional racers.</LD>
<LD>   Although Priestley is expected to make a full recovery, his foot
injuries could require a lengthy recuperation.</LD>
<TE>   Race cars have little in common with passenger vehicles--for
example, their engines are behind the driver--but people traveling
the nation's highways often suffer similar injuries in a front-end
crash.</TE>
<TE>   Automobile designers and federal officials are working to change
that. Some new models of cars and trucks have been designed to better
protect the lower extremities, and the crash-test dummies used to
test automobile safety will be given more realistic thigh bones,
knees, Achilles tendons and ankles, said Tim Hurd, a spokesman for
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In short, the
crash test dummies are getting new legs.</TE>
<TE>   The new part, called the Thor-LX Advanced Lower Extremity, remains
experimental, but will better measure how the leg withstands impact.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago, that person in a high-energy crash was dead," said
Dr. Andrew Burgess, an orthopedic surgeon and trauma specialist who's
been working with auto makers and federal officials to make sure cars
better protect the legs in automobile accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Burgess said, airbags and seat belts protect the head,
chest and abdomen. But the spleen, pelvis and thigh bones are less
shielded. Doctors can usually repair those injuries, but many
patients are discharged from the hospital with painful lower leg
injuries that can interfere with their ability to work and play,
leading to depression, addictions, job loss and relationship
problems.</TE>
<TE>   The Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, which has been
focused on lower leg injuries for several years, has found that about
one in five drivers admitted to trauma centers after a crash suffer
at least one lower leg fracture. The most frequent specific fracture
involves the ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "Bad ankle injuries from car crashes most often resemble people
falling or jumping from heights," said Burgess, chief of orthopedic
surgery at Shock Trauma until recently going into private practice in
Portland, Maine. "Everything pulverizes."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have found that women have a higher incidence of foot
and ankle fracture in crashes than men. Burgess said that's because a
woman's smaller foot hangs off the brake pedal, suspended. In a
crash, the floor area behind the brake slams into her heel. Men's
larger feet already are in contact with the floor, so their heels
aren't slammed as hard.</TE>
<TE>   Such heel and ankle injuries often don't heal well because the
bones are so damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Legs are injured in two ways. First, when you're in a moving car
that suddenly stops, the excessive force of your body continuing to
move forward can break your leg. Even without causing an injury, a
crash may apply 60 to 80 times the force of gravity to the legs, said
Adrian Lund, chief operating officer of the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety in Arlington, Va. Second, he said, as the passenger
compartment gets crushed, your foot might get caught in the brake and
gas pedals or your knee can jam into the instrument panel.</TE>
<TE>   Front-seat passengers are subject to the same injuries, except
they don't have the complications of pedals. Back-seat passengers can
be subject to leg injuries, most often involving side impact.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, Mercedes began to pad the floor area behind the
brake pedal. Several automakers, including Saab, Volvo and Lexus,
added breakaway or energy-absorbing brake pedals.</TE>
<TE>   Several carmakers have since begun creating crush zones for the
feet. Some weld extra steel onto the underside of the car to divert
energy away from the feet.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic car makers have been catching up. The new features tend
to be added with major model changes.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn about a particular model's safety by checking
ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Federal
safety agencies test the effects of head-on crashes, but the
institute specializes in so-called offset crash tests, in which only
about 40% of the front-end on the driver's side hits the barrier. At
40 mph, these offset crashes are extremely damaging to the passenger
compartment, sometimes even more so than the head-on crashes.</TE>
<TE>   Structures at the front of the car begin to crush first, and then
the floorboards start to crush toward the driver, Lund said. The
institute tests found that in some cars, the passenger compartment
was crushing before the front-end.</TE>
<TE>   "We started testing in 1995. Since we've been doing offset crash
testing and comparing vehicles, we've seen tremendous improvements,"
Lund said. "Most vehicles we test now are doing a good job of
protecting the occupant compartment."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

of cars, including the risk of leg injury. For ratings, call (703)

<HD>Lead-Tainted Mexican Products Pose Growing Threat</HD>
<DH>Poisoning* Candy, folk remedies, pottery cited in report.
Children in border states are at particular risk.</DH>

<LD>Old, lead-containing paint has long been considered the major source
of lead poisoning in children. But California health officials last
week identified certain lead-contaminated candy, pottery and folk
remedies from Mexico as a growing threat to children.</LD>
<LD>   About 15% of California children with lead poisoning had been
exposed to lead-contaminated candy or other products originating in
Mexico, a recent state study found. The study examined about 1,000
children diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels between May 2001
and January 2002.</LD>
<LD>   While many of the children had eaten contaminated candy made in
Mexico, the report, published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, also cited cases of lead poisoning from imported
pottery and from a Mexican folk remedy called greta. Greta is a
lead-based powder, typically made from soil, that is popular in parts
of Mexico to treat stomachaches or intestinal illness.</LD>
<TE>   Nationwide, most childhood lead poisoning occurs from ingestion of
old paint chips or lead-contaminated soil. But the lead found in
candy, pottery and folk remedies is a particular problem in border
states, such as California.</TE>
<TE>   "Soil, dust and paint are the most important sources of lead
poisoning, even for groups like our Latino immigrant population,"
said Dr. Joseph Courtney, chief of care management and research for
the state's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch and the
study's lead author. "But these cultural sources probably represent
another important exposure for these groups."</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time in recent years that state health
officials have issued warnings about the potential dangers of some
candy from Mexico. Last year, the state joined the Food and Drug
Administration to stop sales of tamarind fruit lollipops called
Dulmex Bolirindo after the product was found to have
lead-contaminated wrappers. The FDA has also embargoed products
containing tamarind fruit. But, said Courtney, tamarind candies are
still found in the state.</TE>
<TE>   "They are coming in through all kinds of routes," he said. "These
candies are fairly commonly eaten by kids. If you went out and asked
a sample of young Latino children if they had eaten these candies,
I'd bet a lot of them would say they have."</TE>
<TE>   State investigators are also attempting to identify other Mexican
candy products that might contain lead, such as sweet-tasting jams
sold in small, ceramic pots that may leach lead. Candies made in
other parts of the world, such as Southeast Asia and other Latin
America countries, may also contain potentially toxic levels of lead,
Courtney said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to make any definitive identification [of lead]
because there is huge variability from candy to candy and lot to
lot," he said. Quality control at foreign manufacturing facilities
can vary widely, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Infants, young children and pregnant women are especially
vulnerable to lead poisoning. Even short-term exposure can damage the
central nervous system, resulting in learning disabilities and
behavioral disorders. The persistent threat of poisoning underscores
the importance of routine screening for lead, health officials stated
in the report, published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report.</TE>
<TE>   State regulations require health professionals to check children
between the ages of 6 months and 6 years for lead poisoning. Under
state guidelines, children treated in publicly supported programs,
such as Medi-Cal and Healthy Families, are given blood tests at 12
and 24 months of age. For other children, health professionals are
supposed to ask families about possible sources of contamination,
such as living in a dwelling built before 1978 that has peeling paint
or that has been newly renovated.</TE>

<HD>'Boutique' Medicine Does a Disservice</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent coverage of "boutique" medical practices ("A Visit With
Dr. Deluxe," July 22) strikes a number of chords with me. These
so-called concierge medical practices move experienced physicians out
of the mainstream at a time when primary-care providers are in
greater demand than ever.</LD>
<LD>   As a nurse practitioner, I already provide virtually all the care
provided by these specialized practices at compensation levels that
would barely pay their monthly phone bill. Nurse practitioners are
educated to provide primary health care, which emphasizes prevention
and the maintenance of individual and family wellness. This care,
according to the definition of boutique service, deserves
supplemental income. For my nurse-practitioner colleagues and many
primary-care physicians, it's part of the normal job description.</LD>
<LD>   It's true, patient demand is overwhelming many primary-care
professionals in this country. What we need are changes to the laws
and regulations that prevent nurse practitioners from accepting a
larger share of the burden, not boutique medical practices that only
exacerbate an already confounding problem and further limit patient
and family choices.</LD>
<TE>   CHRISTINE M. BETZOLD</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   According to the Health section, "boutique" medical practices are
being franchised across the nation. Charging a retainer fee of $1,000
to $4,000, these practices offer one-day appointments,
round-the-clock access to physicians, comprehensive yearly physical
examinations and more--in short, the things you need from a doctor to
save your life.</TE>
<TE>   All a doctor need do after franchise is tussle with his conscience
after tossing all the patients who can't afford his fee. I don't
think Hippocrates meant it that way. Soon people will see they are
dealing with the same doctors who gave them managed health care and
doctors who regularly sell out to the huge pharmaceutical
corporations.</TE>
<TE>   TOM FREEMAN</TE>
<TE>   Pinon Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There are two categories of doctors: those who are in it for the
dedicated Hippocratic humanitarian mission and goal, and those who
are in it for the money. The latter category is arguably useless at
best and no better than the Enron and WorldCom executives at worst.
These guys and gals have lost their way in a materialistic world. My
apologies to those upscale "boutique" doctors who use their "extra"
time treating the poor, the disenfranchised and the uninsured. Are
there any of these?</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irene Christie is 93. She can no longer drive, stand for long, or
cook, not even to bake the pies that were once her specialty. But
when the San Dimas woman signed up for home-delivered meals, she had
to wait nearly six months for the first one.</LD>
<LD>   Like thousands of seniors in Southern California who would benefit
from meals delivered to their homes, she struggled to get by. A
friend and her children sometimes brought her food, but she didn't
like to ask for it. "I'm a person who likes to be self-sufficient,"
she said. "I ate what there was to eat." Her daughter, who travels a
lot, had suggested home-delivered meals in February, but weeks
stretched into months because, in the San Gabriel Valley, 167 elderly
people are on a waiting list for food.</LD>
<LD>   The local hot-meal program, like hundreds of other food programs
in the United States, does not have enough money to feed all people
60 and older who are legally entitled to five meals a week, not
counting holidays. So program officials assign points to people who
need assistance. Those coming home from the hospital who have no
support get the most points and may not wait very long. Those like
Christie, who can get by for a while, must wait until someone dies or
the program finds more funding. "We basically do triage," says Donald
Herring, director of Intervale Senior Services, part of the YWCA of
San Gabriel Valley.</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes, depending on where they live, even seniors just out of
the hospital can't get meals immediately. "It's a nightmare," says
Leah Monson, program director for the Southeast Area Social Services
Funding Authority in Whittier. "People die while they are on the
waiting lists. They are that frail." At her program, 50 to 70 seniors
are always waiting for a meal.</TE>
<TE>   This food is crucial for many elderly people--sometimes, it may be
their only meal of the day. Without it, malnourishment can take its
toll. Breaking a bone, getting the flu or having surgery can prove
too physically taxing; seniors may be forced into nursing homes
prematurely or have to spend more days in the hospital when they get
sick.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the emotional benefits. For some seniors, the man
or woman who delivers their food is the only person they ever see,
providing much-needed contact with the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   Assigning points based on need is a kind of rationing system for
older people in the richest country in the world. As more seniors
need food, rationing will probably become more severe. In 1996, the
most recent year for which there are data, 41% of the 4,000 programs
in the country had waiting lists, according to the federal
Administration on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   In California, nearly 11 million meals were delivered to 56,000
home-bound elderly people in 2000. Hundreds more are waiting,
although no one knows the exact number, since waiting lists come and
go depending on the season and the flow of money to the food
providers. In Los Angeles, 481 people were waiting in April,
according to Rushmore Cervantes, interim general manager for the City
of Los Angeles Department of Aging. At the moment, he says, no one is
waiting, because additional funding has erased the waiting list for a
while. By 2010, there will be almost twice as many people 85 and
older than there were in 1990. By contrast, the number of people 65
to 74 will grow only 16% over the same period. The need for meals is
greatest among people older than 80, more than half of whom have
disabilities that prevent them from shopping and preparing food.</TE>
<TE>   Congress anticipated the elderly's need for food aid 30 years ago,
establishing two programs--one that provided hot meals at places
where seniors could gather and one that used local food providers to
deliver meals to homes.</TE>
<TE>   Federal funding has not kept pace with the need, particularly
squeezing the home-delivered meals program, which has caused waiting
lists to swell. The other program has also suffered, although demand
for meals served at senior centers has not grown as rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the federal government will give both programs some
$716 million, a fraction of the billions that the National Institutes
of Health gets to discover new cures to help people live longer. Each
year Congress doles out a little more money, but nowhere near the
amount the programs say they need. By the time this year's increase
of $36 million trickles down to all the programs in the country, the
impact on some will be negligible. The federal government never
intended to provide all of the money. States must add at least 15% of
the total cost, although some kick in more. But now with state
budgets strained, extra money will be scarce. Local governments also
contribute. So do philanthropic organizations. Congress anticipated
that some of the funding would also come from seniors. Although they
are not required to pay for their meals, many do, even if it's only
50 cents toward the $5.30 it costs on average to provide one meal. In
some places, contributions, especially for home-delivered meals, are
declining. "As people age, they may not be able to afford it," says
LuVerne Molberg, director of the Riverside County Office on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   Whether programs have waiting lists or can offer extra meals on
weekends and holidays depends on fund-raising. Rosemary Regalbuto,
who directs Meals on Wheels West, serving communities such as Santa
Monica, Malibu and Pacific Palisades, says her program has no waiting
lists. It is able to deliver two meals a day, seven days a week.</TE>
<TE>   Other programs are not as fortunate. Monson says fund-raising is a
struggle in southeastern Los Angeles County. Three years ago her
program offered the elderly two meals on the weekends but had to
discontinue them so it could serve more people one meal Monday
through Friday. "If we hadn't made that choice, our waiting list
would be in the hundreds," she says.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to overlook the problem of hungry seniors. The homebound
elderly are largely invisible. They don't like to admit they are
hungry and can't provide for their most basic human need; most are
vague about what they eat while they are waiting for meals.</TE>
<TE>   Often their children have moved far away. They don't vote much or
give campaign contributions. They have no lobbyists and few champions
in Congress. Politicians generally support the programs, but not many
are willing to fight for adequate funding.</TE>
<TE>   Yet something so simple as an attractive, well-balanced meal
changes their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Irene Christie's voice rises when she talks of her meals. After
waiting so long and eating when she could, the baked chicken,
scalloped potatoes, peas, fruit and a slice of bread with a big pat
of butter seemed like a feast. "Words cannot tell you how thankful I
am," she said.</TE>

<LD>Question: Do you have any tips on how to lose saddlebags?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Remember: Spot reduction is a myth--it simply doesn't
work. To store less fat on our hips, we need to trim our overall body
fat. How? Add cardiovascular (aerobic) exercise. This is a major
component of fat/weight loss because we can burn a lot of calories
while exercising. Try doing cardio four or five days per week for 45
minutes. That's the amount of time you need to get lasting results.</LD>
<LD>   Walking is a good cardio activity because it's low-impact. Also
consider cycling, in-line skating and hiking; all are low-impact
activities that firm your legs and hips. In the gym, the step machine
is a good aerobic exercise because it will tone your legs as well.</LD>
<TE>   Another secret to getting rid of saddlebags is weight training for
your upper body. Getting a stronger upper body helps increase your
lean muscle tissue, which in turn increases your resting metabolism
so that you burn more calories throughout the day--even when you're
sitting at your desk.</TE>

<HD>Group Seeks Recall of Meat Substitute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DELTHIA RICKS</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A meat substitute made from fungus should be removed from the market
because it not only makes people sick, a consumer health group
charged last week, the label misleads people into believing the
product is made from mushrooms.</LD>
<LD>   The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington,
D.C.-based health advocacy organization, announced that it has
received reports of sickness from 100 people about the product known
as Quorn. The discomforts ranged from nausea, diarrhea and hives to
fainting spells. The product is made into "chicken" patties, nuggets
and cutlets, and fashioned into an imitation ground beef.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Jacobson, the center's executive director, said in a
letter to the Food and Drug Administration that Quorn should be
recalled immediately. The meat substitute, made from a fungal
protein, has been on the market in the U.S. since January. It has
been sold in Europe since the mid-1980s.</LD>
<TE>   Before it is processed, most people would recognize it as a mold.
But even though it is a fungus--as are mushrooms--the two are very
distantly related. "This stuff is as closely related to mushrooms as
human beings are to goldfish," Jacobson said. The label refers to it
as derived from mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people have had no reaction to it but others are really
thrown for a loop," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Quorn is distributed in the U.S. by Riverside, Conn.-based Marlow
Foods Ltd., a subsidiary of British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca.
In a statement, the company called "consumer health and wellness" its
"number one priority."</TE>
<TE>   An FDA spokeswoman said Quorn was allowed on the market under a
measure known as GRAS, for generally recognized as safe, based on
sales in Europe. Jacobson said he obtained reports of illness here
and abroad by establishing a Web site, www.QuornComplaints. com. The
FDA is reviewing the product and the recall petition.</TE>

<HD>Kids Need to Find Support</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aparent's Alzheimer's disease is hard enough on adult children, but
it can be even harder on kids--for whom there are few support groups
or friends who understand what they're going through at home.</LD>
<LD>   Alzheimer's Assn. chapters say they have had their hands full
trying to serve the growing number of early-onset patients and their
caregivers, and haven't had the time or money to reach out to
teenagers and younger children. That's likely to change.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Raia, a psychologist and director of patient care for the
Alzheimer's Assn., in Cambridge, Mass., started the first support
group in the country for kids about a dozen years ago. It met twice a
month at a church in Arlington, Mass., and offered intensive
counseling.</LD>
<TE>   "We saw all kinds of acute problems, depression, acting out,
truancy, drug use," said Raia. "You see the kids developing
nightmares, having difficulty in school. They have difficulty with
relationships with their peers. They may mature faster than they
should in that they're given too much responsibility for care. And
they may not really experience a childhood."</TE>
<TE>   Although the group disbanded two years ago, Raia said, the need is
even greater today, especially among the early-onset patients he sees
now: "They all have kids at home."</TE>
<TE>   Julie Noonan Lawson knows what it's like to be the child of a
parent with early-onset Alzheimer's; she was just 5 when her mother
began forgetting to pick her up from school.</TE>
<TE>   Lawson's family has been devastated by an inherited form of
Alzheimer's. In addition to her mother and aunt, who died of it,
three of her nine siblings have been diagnosed, including a sister
who died at 58 and a 53-year-old sister now in the end stage.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Lawson's daughters, Caitlin, 16, and Chelsie,14, know
that--although their 43-year-old mother is OK now--she has a 50-50
chance of eventually developing the illness if she finds out she
carries the terrible genetic mutation. The girls know that if she has
it, they, too, stand the same chance of inheriting it.</TE>
<TE>   Lawson, a national Alzheimer's advocate, says kids need
professional support. She took her daughters to a hospice group near
their home on Cape Cod, Mass., "but that was too traumatic. We're not
dealing with immediate death. Many of the kids had dads who had died
of heart attacks."</TE>
<TE>   So her daughters set up their own support group. Two registered
nurses volunteered to lead the group, which began with just Caitlin
and Chelsie.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, they've picked up a child whose grandmother has
Alzheimer's, and more recently kids from a family in which the father
has early-onset Alzheimer's.</TE>
<TE>   As Alzheimer's progresses, the patient can display anger,
hostility and aggression, emotions that can be deeply confusing to
children unless there's someone to help coach them through.</TE>
<TE>   "What they're dealing with is not a typical adult anger. It's
dementia anger," Lawson said. "This is an adult and children are
taught to respect adults. The children don't know how to deal."</TE>
<TE>   The sessions have been really helpful, she said. "They've been
able to look into the eyes of another human being who is their age
and know that they know."</TE>

<HD>Planning Ahead May Ease Some of the Burden</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Alzheimer's disease strikes a parent with children still at
home, plans must be made for the entire family.</LD>
<LD>   Social workers and Alzheimer's experts say families must set
priorities, focusing first on establishing good medical care, then on
informing the children, finding support for everyone affected, and
thinking ahead to college and financial decisions.</LD>
<LD>   * Find a primary care doctor and neurologist who can work with
you. They should establish whether you're a good candidate for one of
the three medications that can help Alzheimer's patients: Aricept,
Exelon and Reminyl.</LD>
<TE>   * Talk with your children about the diagnosis. As with a financial
crisis--such as unemployment--children need to know that life has
highs and lows, says David Troxel, chief executive of the California
Central Coast Alzheimer's Assn. in Santa Barbara. "Some of our
families have gotten closer when a family member has Alzheimer's."</TE>
<TE>   * Share your feelings with friends, family and clergy and continue
participating in social activities.</TE>
<TE>   * Seek counseling where you can. Even therapists who haven't
worked with dementia patients can help with basic issues of
isolation, loss, anger and fear in patients and their families, says
Deborah Dunn, director of patient and family services for the
California Central Coast Alzheimer's Assn.</TE>
<TE>   * Look for support groups tailored to patients who develop the
disease before 65 or to patients in the early stages of the illness.
Such groups can teach you what to expect as the disease progresses,
and offer practical advice on planning for the future and
communicating.</TE>
<TE>   * Set up reminders, systems and calendars to keep track of work
and daily appointments.</TE>
<TE>   * Record important milestones and special family events, as well
as the affected parent's recollections, feelings and wisdom. Use a
journal or scrapbook, have a family member videotape or hire a
professional videotaping service.</TE>
<TE>   * Move up special occasions to take advantage of the Alzheimer's
patient's current abilities. Parents can take short trips with the
kids, and families can take major trips together.</TE>
<TE>   * Begin thinking about how the illness will affect the children's
ability to attend college. Some families may want to consider
community colleges or having children attend school closer to the
sick parent. Ask about scholarships and grants.</TE>
<TE>   * Research early retirement as well as health and retirement
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   * Consult with an attorney or financial consultant. Elder law
attorneys can help with estate planning, IRA and 401(k) issues. Look
into government assistance programs. Organize financial records. Draw
up plans--known as advance medical directives--on care,
resuscitation, treatment, and share them with your doctor. The
healthy spouse may want to buy long-term care insurance for himself
or herself, says Laura Rice-Oeschger, a project manager with the
Alzheimer's Assn. of Los Angeles' regional office in Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   * Locate in-home help for when your spouse is away and you need
help.</TE>
<TE>   * Look for adult day-care programs and residential care facilities
that specialize in early-onset patients.</TE>

<LD>New research adds to a growing body of evidence that adult health is
set to a significant degree by conditions in the womb and suggests
the programming may start earlier in pregnancy than previously
believed.</LD>
<LD>   A study published last week in the Journal of Epidemiology and
Community Health found that fetuses with shorter thighbones at 24
weeks had higher blood pressure at the age of 6 than those with
longer thighbones.</LD>
<LD>   Understanding how life in the womb influences later health has
become a hot area of medical research. It has focused mostly on the
effect of birth weight on health and the subsequent development of
illnesses such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and
osteoporosis. But the latest study is among the first to find
evidence earlier in human life.</LD>
<TE>   Scientists believe that when a fetus is undernourished, it diverts
resources to areas it really needs at the time, such as the brain, at
the expense of organs it will need later in life. That may
permanently change the baby's structure, functioning and metabolism,
experts believe.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of work about the size at birth," said Dr. David
Barker, an epidemiologist who pioneered fetal programming research
but was not involved in the latest study. "Birth weight is a crude
measurement. It tells you very little because babies can reach the
same birth weight by many different paths of growth.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, because of technology advances, people are able to study
children who have had serial measurements of size in [the uterus]
that follow their growth, and these observations take us back into
early pregnancy," said Barker, director of the epidemiology unit at
the University of Southampton in England. "It looks as though blood
pressure may be set fairly early."</TE>
<TE>   The study, led by Dr. Kevin Blake at the University of Western
Australia, involved ultrasounds done at 18, 24, 28, 34 and 38 weeks
of pregnancy on 707 women with normal pregnancies. During each scan,
doctors measured the circumference of the head and abdomen and the
length of the babies' thighbones.</TE>
<TE>   Blood pressure was measured in about 300 of the children at age 6.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found that for every one-tenth of an inch
deviation from the typical thighbone length at key stages in the
womb, systolic blood pressure--the higher of the two numbers--was
changed by about 2 points. Shorter thighs meant higher blood
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   That effect was first seen at 24 weeks of pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   Neither head nor abdomen circumference was linked to later blood
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know whether a very small change in blood pressure at
age 6 has any value in predictability of disease, but it's still a
move forward in understanding what kind of factors we can look at
before birth and use as predictors for potential signs of disease,"
said Kent Thornburg, a fetal physiologist and director of the Heart
Research Center at Oregon Health Sciences University who was
unconnected with the research.</TE>
<TE>   The thighbone is easy to measure and skeletal growth is a good
measure of the rate a fetus is growing, said Mark Hanson, director of
the Center for the Fetal Origins of Adult Disease at England's
Southampton University.</TE>
<TE>   "Skeletal growth is not just determined by how tall the parents
are. There's a complex interaction between the fetal genetic drive to
grow--inherited from the parents--and the environment in the womb in
early gestation," said Hanson, a fetal physiologist who was not
involved in the study.</TE>
<TE>   "This study is focusing our attention on early gestation. It's
making it clear that it really is fetal growth we're talking about
here, not just some funny thing linked to birth weight itself. And
it's pointing a finger very clearly that in the fetal growth process
there's an interaction between the (genes) and the environment," he
said. Rat studies have previously indicated the womb environment,
influenced by the mother's nutrition, is important for later disease.</TE>
<TE>   One study showed that pregnant rats given a low-protein diet for
the first four days of pregnancy--before the embryo even implants in
the womb and before the placenta is formed--produced offspring with
high blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "There are extensive experiments in animals which show that fetal
programming is a universal biological phenomenon," Hanson said.</TE>
<TE>   The risk of disease in adulthood builds up over a lifetime and
experts don't know to what degree fetal programming influences the
eventual likelihood of disease, but they believe it is considerable.</TE>
<TE>   "The sort of calculations that have been done would suggest that
it's certainly a bigger effect than smoking. It's certainly an effect
at least of the magnitude of obesity and lack of exercise," Hanson
said.</TE>

<LD>Pundits recently wondered aloud (again) if John Rocker was off his. A
few weeks ago, the Texas Ranger mouthed off to some gays in a Dallas
restaurant. This is not the first time the pitcher has dug his own
grave with his tongue.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, WNBA fans were logging on to that organization's Web
site to see what Nykesha Sales and Sheryl Swoopes had to say about
that delicate balance of maintaining family, motherhood and a
professional sports career.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe sports fans have come to expect stellar and studied good
behavior from their female athletes, and the occasional randy--or
just plain stupid and wrong--acts from some of the
men-who-would-be-boys.</LD>
<TE>   Rocker said he was provoked by patrons at a Dallas restaurant, a
contention denied by the person who waited on him. As he was leaving
a restaurant, Rocker was said to have called some of the patrons
"fruitcakes," and then he exchanged harsher words with them, and
perhaps a few other people, outside. What he said exactly is unclear,
but it appeared to have something to do with his hope that the people
with whom he was arguing would get AIDS and die. He has since
apologized.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately, the folks on "Crossfire" tried to decide if Rocker
and his ilk are just regular folks behaving badly, or if maybe as
role models they should be held to a higher standard.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever. The first round of the WNBA playoffs started Thursday,
and a few weeks ago wnba.com launched "This Is What I Think," an
online series that asks players and fans to comment on topics such as
motherhood and professional sports careers, the importance of Title
IX and whether it's wrong for professional athletes to pose in
Playboy magazine. Participating players so far have included the
Orlando Miracle's Sales and the Seattle Storm's Sue Bird. (See
wnba.com, "This Is What I Think," athletes and motherhood.)</TE>
<TE>   The series has been so successful that the league is considering
continuing something like it in the off-season, says WNBA President
Valerie Ackerman.</TE>
<TE>   "This allows the fans to see the players as something more than
just athletes," Ackerman said. "They see them as people."</TE>
<TE>   It's just a continuation of the way we look at collegiate female
athletes. We want them, to the last woman, to be scholar-athletes and
well-spoken. We look to our professional female athletes for more of
the same.</TE>
<TE>   Said Sales of motherhood and professional sports: "Basketball is a
job, but what you do as a part of your life and your livelihood comes
first. You're a person first, you're a sister, a brother.... That
comes first. Playing basketball, you never know what happens. You
have to go ahead and live your life first."</TE>
<TE>   Bird's contribution was a diplomatic comment on tennis player Anna
Kournikova, who has gained much media attention without winning much:
"If she wasn't playing tennis, I think she'd still be making money as
a model. I don't think it hurts women's sports; I think she's taking
advantage of what's in front of her. We live in a man's world, so
that's what's going to make money these days, what Anna's doing. But
at the same time, I don't think they'd ever put a male athlete on the
cover of anything if he'd never won anything."</TE>
<TE>   Sales says her Miracle fan base is far smaller than it was during
her days playing for the University of Connecticut, but little girls
still come up wearing jerseys and asking for autographs. She said
that makes it pretty easy to remember to behave.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone has to tell me, 'Don't drink and drive,' "
said Sales, calling from Indiana, where that night--despite her
contribution of 15 points--the Miracle lost to the Indiana Fever,
70-63. "I don't think they have to tell a lot of us to be careful or
watch what you do or say. I think it comes naturally."</TE>
<TE>   That's kind of what I thought. There are fine, upright and moral
male athletes, sure, but why do you never read about a female Rocker?
Why don't female athletes get run up on gun or drug charges, bless
'em?</TE>
<TE>   Sales said, "I really can't explain the difference between men and
women athletes. This is how I was raised, and this is how I am."</TE>

<HD>When a Good Night's Sleep Turns Into a Nightmare</HD>
<DH>A rare disorder causes the afflicted to act out
sexually--and sometimes even violently-- toward their bed partners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For most people, the bed is a sanctuary, but for some people, the bed
can be a very scary place.</LD>
<LD>   Sleep researchers at Stanford University recently reported in the
journal Psychosomatic Medicine (April/May issue) on 11 cases of
people afflicted by a rare but treatable medical condition. Described
as "violent sleep sex," the disorder causes the afflicted to moan in
sexually evocative ways, masturbate violently and engage in rape-like
behavior toward their bedmates, some of whom developed what might be
called bed dread.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers, who examined the patients over four years, assert
that the nocturnal behavior stems from hiccups that occur in
brain-wave patterns during the sleep cycle. Although the condition is
rare, roughly 2% of the population is thought to experience "violent
sleep sex." Researchers say the estimate may be low because people
who have the condition rarely report it.</LD>
<TE>   "What was surprising to us was why it took so long for people to
ask for help," said Dr. Christian Guilleminault, a professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of
Medicine and lead researcher of the study. "One man waited 15 years.
These people may have talked to their doctor about it, but they felt
rejected by the medical establishment because their physician didn't
believe them or hadn't heard of the sleep disorder. Some of them were
too ashamed of the behavior to seek help. In some cases, the bed
partner was having a difficult time because the patient denied the
behavior because they could not remember it."</TE>
<TE>   The seven men and four women research subjects were evaluated by a
psychiatrist, neurologist and a sleep specialist, and divided into
three groups, according to the severity of their symptoms. The first
group's anomalous behavior was characterized as "annoying to bed
partner, but not harmful" and included two women in their late 20s
whose loud, sexually evocative moaning and inarticulate sounds
occurred within 20 minutes of sleep onset. One woman felt guilty
because the moaning was so loud it disturbed her spouse and children,
according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   The second group--whose behavior was described as annoying to
bedmate and at times harmful to the patient--included a woman, 26,
and a man, 31, both of whom masturbated violently while asleep. The
woman's behavior also included loud moaning and attempts at tearing
off her pajamas. When her husband tried to initiate intercourse, he
was rejected, the researchers wrote. The woman, who repeated the
behavior if interrupted, had no memory of the nocturnal activity. In
the man's case, the violent masturbation left him deeply bruised in
his groin area and anxious about "losing control" in sleep. This led
to rejection by girlfriends and caused him to avoid intimate
relationships for years, according to the researchers.</TE>
<TE>   The third group included six men and one woman who made unwanted
and sometimes violent sexual advances toward their bed partners while
asleep. In one case, a 38-year-old man had sexually assaulted his
wife for 12 years, which involved tearing off his wife's clothes,
fondling her and attempting sexual intercourse, the researchers
noted. During one episode, the man tried to strangle his wife, which
prompted a teenage child in the home to call the police, eventually
leading to a referral to Stanford's Sleep Clinic. In another case, a
man was so full of despair and shame over his sexual behavior in
sleep that he tried restraining himself to the bed, which resulted in
his breaking two fingers.</TE>
<TE>   The woman in this group, 26 years old, would initiate foreplay by
adjusting her bed partner's clothing, fondling him and uttering
sexually provocative things in her sleep. When her bed partner
responded in kind, the woman would awaken confused and accuse him of
trying to coerce her into having sex while she was asleep, according
to the study. The couple began seeing a counselor because the husband
did not believe she was unconscious, said Guilleminault.</TE>
<TE>   Although the cases sound psychological in origin, Dr. David Saul
Rosenfeld, director of the Sleep Medicine Clinic and Laboratory at
Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Los Angeles, said that most cases
of parasomnia--automatic behaviors that occur in sleep such as
sleepwalking--do not appear to have psychological causes.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no evidence to confirm that people are acting out
unconscious feelings, or sexual fantasies," said Rosenfeld, who
authored a 1998 study of two men who were engaged in sexual activity
while asleep--including biting behavior and talking dirty. "Both of
the cases we reported on demonstrated sleep behaviors that were not
characteristic of their daytime personality.... No one knows why
there is this fundamental split."</TE>
<TE>   Guilleminault and his co-researchers believe the underlying
problem of violent sleep sex relates to sleep disorders and, in some
cases, to neurological diseases (such as epilepsy). Each of the
patients in their study had additional emotional problems, which
Guilleminault said influenced the form the sleep disturbance took.
Had the patients not had emotional problems--which included
obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, generalized anxiety
disorder, and major depressive disorders--the sleep disorder, he
said, would still have existed but might have emerged as
sleepwalking, sleep eating or sleep talking. (Indeed, seven of the
patients had a history of sleepwalking too.) Sleep disturbances occur
when a person fails to seamlessly pass through the five phases of
sleep. Each phase is marked by a classic brain-wave pattern, but the
researchers noticed the brain imaging of the patients revealed that
they had unusual patterns during one of the sleep phases or had short
interruptions in their sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Audio and video recordings of the patients revealed that the
sleep-sex behavior occurred during these glitches in the sleep cycle.
The scientists determined that sleep sex, like other parasomnias,
occurs when there is a disturbance during the brain's transition from
deep sleep (non-REM sleep) to wakefulness (REM sleep).</TE>
<TE>   "When we dream, we are in REM sleep and usually our body is
paralyzed," said Guilleminault. "But there are a certain number of
people, for a lot of different reasons--some of which we don't
understand--who don't have paralysis of the body during REM sleep. So
they are able to act out their dreams. So if they are having a sexual
dream, they do the same physically."</TE>
<TE>   In every case analyzed in the Stanford study but one, the sleep
disturbances were successfully resolved with sleep-disorder
treatments, and those patients and their partners have been able to
sleep without fear even up to five years later. Therapy included
treatments for breathing disturbances such as apnea and certain
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason why we did the study was because these people felt
there was no hope and no diagnosis and no treatment," said
Guilleminault.</TE>
<TE>   "People may not hesitate to tell you that they had a fishing dream
and they were casting and doing all these physical movements in bed.
But when it comes to sexual behavior, that is taboo."</TE>

<LD>   Murder and Anti-Semitism</LD>
<LD>   in a German Town</LD>
<TE>   By Helmut Walser Smith</TE>
<TE>   W.W. Norton</TE>
<TE>   288 pages, $25.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 1900, in a small town called Konitz, then part of
Germany, now part of Poland, an 18-year-old youth was murdered and
chopped into pieces. Before long, a story began going around that the
victim had been ritually slaughtered by Konitz's Jews in order to
obtain Christian blood for the making of matzos. When the German
authorities (who knew better) did not pursue this line of
investigation, but started questioning a local Christian butcher
whose daughter might have been having an affair with the deceased
youth, there were increasing outbreaks of violence against the town's
Jews.</TE>
<TE>   This culminated in a series of anti-Semitic riots so fierce that
the Prussian army had to be called in to restore order and protect
the Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty years after the rioters of Konitz shouted 'Beat the Jews to
death,' " reflects Helmut Walser Smith, "a modern government,
supported by a cast of willing executioners and ordinary men, did
precisely that." But Smith, a German-born, American-educated
historian currently teaching at Vanderbilt University, draws
conclusions somewhat different from those in Daniel Goldhagen's
"Hitler's Willing Executioners."</TE>
<TE>   In Smith's view, the anti-Semitism that repeatedly manifested
itself in such violence was not so much a specifically German
phenomenon as a more general and insidious one pervasive throughout
much of Europe during the entire second millennium. By 1900, this
virulent brand of anti-Semitism seemed to be confined to fringe
groups. There was good reason to think--as many people did--that
sporadic outbreaks, although distressing, were vestiges of a fading
past rather than omens of an unimaginable future. "[I]n the final
analysis," Smith contends, "Hitler came from the fringe, not the
center." But how do these "fringe" ideas find their way from the
margins to the center?</TE>
<TE>   To help answer this question, Smith undertakes an investigation of
what happened in the case of one particular town: a microhistory.
Studies of German anti-Semitism, he notes, have usually focused on
"the ideas of prominent anti-Semites, on the anti-Semitism of a
particular group or institution, or on anti-Semitic politics." What
Smith hopes to accomplish by investigating at the local level is a
picture of "how anti-Semitism became part of the warp and woof of
everyday life": how rumors spread, how neighbors became feared
enemies and how some people perhaps came to believe their own lies.</TE>
<TE>   Piecing together evidence culled from newspapers, police and court
records, and other documents, Smith not only creates a painfully
detailed portrait of a backward, economically depressed small town,
but also adopts the role of latter-day detective, reopening an
unsolved case and coming up with a plausible solution. Smith's crisp
writing, his analytical mind and his skill as a storyteller make his
book as absorbing as a mystery novel.</TE>
<TE>   But there's more to "The Butcher's Tale" than its "small-scale,
high-resolution" microhistory of a small-town crime and the ensuing
crisis. Smith also pans back to give us the larger picture. In his
third chapter, he discusses the long history of the ritual-murder
myth while his fifth chapter examines the behavior of the Konitz
witch-hunters through the lens of anthropology.</TE>
<TE>   Over the centuries, the Vatican issued condemnations of this
specious and dangerous libel against the Jews. Martin Luther also
denounced the charge as utterly unfounded. Secular authorities, such
as the 13th century Emperor Frederick II, who investigated the
matter, came to the same conclusion. But the myth was not so easily
eradicated among the populace. Smith sees the myth as fed by several
streams in Christian tradition, particularly during its second
millennium: the construction of a "persecuting society" in the wake
of the Crusades and the new 12th century church doctrine of
transubstantiation, which insisted that Christian worshipers were
actually eating the body of Christ when consuming the wafer.</TE>
<TE>   Smith proposes that many worshipers were so disturbed by this
idea, they might have dealt with their anxieties about cannibalism by
projecting them onto members of an oppressed group.</TE>
<TE>   If there is such a thing as ritual murder, Smith finds it in the
anti-Semitic riots that broke out in the wake of such accusations. In
his fifth chapter, he suggests that people who stoned houses,
brandished weapons and shouted death threats at their Jewish
neighbors were enacting what anthropologists like Victor Turner might
characterize as a kind of community-binding rite: a ritual that
played at murder but stopped short of it. (As with so many
anthropological--or socio-biological--explanations of human behavior,
this seems to lead us in the dangerous direction of substituting
mores for morality. Not that Smith himself makes the argument that
this kind of "community binding" is healthy or desirable.)</TE>
<TE>   One need not, in any case, be convinced by all of Smith's various
hypotheses to find this a stimulating, thoughtfully argued,
informative and eye-opening book. In the 19th century, Smith tells
us, there were numerous works on the topic of ritual murder. Sadly,
many of the best-researched ones, which proved the speciousness of
the charges, were too dry and scholarly to win the attention of the
average reader. Fortunately for today's readers, Smith knows how to
combine sound research with pellucid prose and a spellbinding story.</TE>

<LD>"The real metaphor is Willy Wonka," aspiring filmmaker Seth Wiley
says, standing on the terrace outside the faux Tudor mansion on
Sunset Boulevard on a recent evening. "Everybody's saying it's like
'The Real World' but it's Willy Wonka."</LD>
<LD>   Wiley gropes through pop-culture touchstones, trying to find one
that can describe the last six week of his life--a Roald Dahl fantasy
for adults, he says. In Willy Wonka terms, he'd be the poor kid
hoping to win a lifetime supply of chocolate--the "chocolate" in this
case being a million bucks to make an independent film. He's one of
five movie-making hopefuls competing for film money this summer in an
"art meets commerce--in a big way" version of the Hollywood dream.</LD>
<LD>   So far, Wiley's got nothing to complain about. For a month and a
half, he's been living in a Beverly Hills mansion, driving a new car
and roaming the Universal lot. Oh, and he doesn't have to clean, cook
or worry about utility bills.</LD>
<TE>   Wiley's adventure began last fall, when the 31-year-old University
of Kansas grad submitted a short film, "The Good Things," to the
"Chrysler Million Dollar Film Festival," a competition that,
according to an early press release, would "merge independent
filmmaking with Chrysler brand vehicles."</TE>
<TE>   Along with 24 other contestants, he was chosen by a panel of
judges from Hypnotic (a marketing and production company), Universal
Pictures and Chrysler. He then made the semifinals and was flown with
nine others to Cannes during the film festival for the "Extreme
Filmmaking Competition phase," in which they had to cast, shoot, edit
and premiere a five-minute short film during a 10-day period. Mood,
concept and plot were open to the filmmakers. The only condition: The
"cast" had to include one of two new Chrysler models.</TE>
<TE>   "The casting of the PT Cruiser and Crossfire provides the Extreme
Filmmakers the opportunity to embrace and reflect the Chrysler
brand's dedication to design, romance and innovation into their
films," one company statement said. And how different would that be,
really, than making a film for Miramax that slipped in a few cans of
Coors? Corporate sponsorship, wave of the future.</TE>
<TE>   Wiley was picked as a finalist alongside Patrick Daughters,
Matthew Ehlers, Geoffrey Haley and Jeff Wadlow. Two are USC film
school grads, and among the credits listed on the collective bios are
"film production: The Thomas Crowne Affair" and "grand prize winner,
Nintendo's Eternal Darkness Films Competition."</TE>
<TE>   On July 1, in "reality" TV fashion, the five were moved into a
Sunset Boulevard mansion, adding a touch of personal contact to the
competition. Each was provided with production equipment, a movie
industry mentor and access to Universal Studios' sets, props and
costumes, as well as post-production facilities.</TE>
<TE>   By Sept. 1, each will have to finish a movie package--a pitch, a
final script and one fully developed scene that (surprise) also has
to feature a Chrysler car, even if its appearance is just a cameo.</TE>
<TE>   On this night at the mansion, there is little evidence of
competition. The five contestants are cordial, sharing hamburgers and
hot dogs on the terrace overlooking the pool, as members of the house
staff haul beer in ice buckets and turn beef patties on the grill.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't sabotage each other," Wiley says. But this is no
all-for-one, "let's make a movie" situation, either. He's circumspect
when describing his project, not wanting to tip his hand.</TE>
<TE>   "It's called 'Rx,' " he says. "It's about a middle-aged doctor ...
who meets a younger woman who takes him to a rave."</TE>
<TE>   Living with his competitors can be intimidating, and Wiley has
imagined himself going down the chute. Right now, though, he's
enjoying himself. He's impressed several friends by inviting them to
spend evenings at house parties, sipping energy drinks poolside.</TE>
<TE>   "Jewel came to play the other night," he says, adding that among
the guests were Gloria Steinem and Carmen Electra. "They were in a
corner, deep in conversation."</TE>
<TE>   It was one of those Hollywood moments that has become strangely
mundane, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Like this one:</TE>
<TE>   In the kitchen, director Doug Liman ("Swingers," "The Bourne
Identity") is chatting on his cell phone. A publicist whispers, "You
know, 'The Bourne Identity' made more than $100 million at the box
office."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just a contest," says Liman, one of the organizers. It's
helping independent filmmakers, and that's why he and other Hollywood
mentors are "rolling up the sleeves" and helping out, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Contestant Daughters, whose competition entry was "Work" (a dark
comedy about two bumbling criminals and an epileptic boy out to rob a
Mormon temple), is a little disconcerted by the experience of the
"Chrysler Summer House." (If it sounds a bit like some sort of
reality-show concept, well there's talk of a so-called reality series
next year.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's like having foster parents who are lavishing all these gifts
on you," Daughters says. "One day, these just appeared out of
nowhere," he says, picking up a colorful toy from a table. (Mostly,
table decorations are toy cars of a certain make.) "The house is a
shell."</TE>
<TE>   Or, perhaps, a set with plenty of product placement.</TE>
<TE>   The black-and-white photographic portraits on the dining room
walls depict a Chrysler from several angles. Downstairs alongside the
pingpong table, entertainment console and dart set, Smirnoff Ice has
provided a fridge full of its products, and outside, parasols
announce another sponsor, Samuel Adams.</TE>
<TE>   On a refrigerator door in the kitchen, a note reads:</TE>
<TE>   "Fellas, although you're probably just getting comfortable at the
house, I wanted to let you know what the move-out schedule is.
Friday, Aug. 30, most of the house furniture will be picked up," it
says, explaining why the interior of the house looks as though it's
been sponsored by Crate &amp; Barrel. Turns out, it was rented.</TE>
<TE>   "Corporations put a fridge full of drinks in your living room,"
Haley says. "It feels strange to be sponsored."</TE>
<TE>   Product Placement 101 for aspiring filmmakers?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, it's learning how to be diplomatic and political," he says,
diplomatically.</TE>
<TE>   For now, life is a scene from a movie, one whose end will arrive
Sept. 13, when the contest judges decide who gets the prize.</TE>
<TE>   Wiley's sad to see it end. He's grown to like the sponsored life.
"I don't even have air-conditioning" at home, he says. "I don't know
how I'll be able to go back."</TE>

<HD>She Sowed, and Reaped Life's Lessons</HD>
<DH>With grace, Mary Lou Heard faces the illness that led to
the closing of her much-loved nursery</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS CURWEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Mary Lou Heard's green world, handfuls of seeds fast become
wildflowers coloring an empty stretch of dirt. Bare-root roses bloom
through wrappings of sawdust and burlap, and saplings spread into
broad patches of summer shade, panoplies of red and yellow in the
fall.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Heard's garden is empty today. Gone are the display beds, the
broad swaths of color and contrast. Missing are the plants she so
adored: salvias, lychnis, spiraeas, viburnums, hostas and clematis
campanulas, herbs, parma violets and old-fashioned hollyhocks. A few
stragglers, growing in containers, lay on the gravel and weed cloth,
and the weathered shacks that housed supplies and accessories are
silent after years of conversation and laughter.</LD>
<LD>   After a 17-year run, Heard's Country Gardens has closed. But it is
not an occasion for sadness, for no one knows the lessons of
gardening better than Heard. Ask the dying woman what lies ahead, and
her answer is simple: She'll tell you that she's going home.</LD>
<TE>   Located in Westminster, in the midst of the blow-and-go lawns and
stucco homes of western Orange County, Heard's Country Gardens never
had the mass appeal of an Armstrong Garden Center or the elitism of
Roger's Gardens. It was instead an emporium of Heard's vision of
gardening, where she could triumph the virtues of the small and
unusual--early-blooming peonies, for instance, low-chill lilacs,
dogwoods and even blueberries--and develop a nursery that had less to
do with selling pretty plants than teaching you how to plant. No
wonder, then, so many items were sold in six-packs and easily
affordable.</TE>
<TE>   Sunset magazine frequently highlighted its stock. "More than any
other nursery I know, Heard's was stamped with the owner's
personality," said Sharon Cohoon, a senior garden writer for Sunset.
"Mary Lou saw no reason you couldn't have a slightly wild, slightly
country garden in the middle of suburbia."</TE>
<TE>   And a recent issue of Los Angeles magazine--printed before Heard
made public her decision to close--listed the nursery as No. 41 in
its Best of L.A. issue: "an American dream of an English garden club,
knowledgeable, chatty and open to all."</TE>
<TE>   Its closing--and the demise of its newsletter, spring home tour
and seminars--is a loss made all the more poignant by the fact that
Heard has cancer and doesn't expect to live to the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   An attractive woman of 56 with porcelain skin, and wispy black and
gray hair, Heard has an easy smile, a friendly laugh and an unabashed
enthusiasm for plants. As she ran around during the final days of the
sale, only the rattle of pills in the side pocket of her blue and
yellow smock suggested something was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Standing at a cash register, she stopped to admire a customer's
selection. It was an 'Annabelle' hydrangea, only 4 inches tall, its
wide lush leaves topped by a white pompom bloom. She admired the
selection so much that the customer wondered if she would let him buy
it. Of course she did.</TE>
<TE>   "If people are going to be interested in gardening," she said,
"there has to be something to anticipate, something exciting. If they
are going to be pulled outdoors, there has to be something different
or unusual. I didn't think this notion was so radical at first, but I
guess it was."</TE>
<TE>   When someone asked for a recommendation, she pointed to a mere
seedling, a Rudbeckia 'Herbstonne,' three ragged leaves growing from
the smallest stem barely rising from the dirt in a small pint-size
container. Never plant two of these side by side, she warned, and be
sure to give them plenty of room. She insisted against all doubt that
in a year they'd be more than 5 feet tall and covered with bright
yellow flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Or, if you can wait three years, she added, there's always
Baptisia australis, a small single-stem, reed-like plant that was a
mere 6 inches tall. It's not much to look at now, she admitted, but
in time, it will become a cluster of delicate green leaves, spiked by
light periwinkle pea-shaped flowers.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to learn to trust when you start gardening," she said.
"Nowadays, most nurseries do nothing to teach you this. They sell
plants in full bloom, which makes for an easy sale, but it means
you're buying the plant at the end of its life cycle. I champion the
ugly ducklings of the plant world and simply ask you to take care of
them and wait. This is something that my mother's generation of
gardeners knew instinctively: Plant in the fall, wait until spring."</TE>
<TE>   Heard came to gardening in a moment of crisis. Her first plot was
a small abandoned garden in West L.A., covered with weeds and old
flowers. Restoring it became her mission.</TE>
<TE>   She was 31, a patient at a psychiatric hospital, and the memory of
those months--stealing away from the crowded hallways and cigarette
smoke and delighting in the solitude of that small patch of
earth--still brings tears to her eyes. "I was busy and productive,"
she recalled. "I tied up the sweet peas; I asked for some flowers and
over the course of months I planted them. When you're preoccupied,
you have time to heal."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years earlier, Heard had been living in Ohio. She had married
young, become pregnant and one day her husband told her he was
leaving. He never contacted her again. She moved in with her parents,
trying to hold down a job and caring for her baby. She was in her
early 20s and desperate. California was an opportunity to begin
again.</TE>
<TE>   Settling in Anaheim, she took a number of office jobs but was
overwhelmed trying to raise a daughter by herself. When she fell in
love again, she thought that she might have been given a second
chance. But her second marriage soon failed, and her world collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   A doctor suggested she talk to someone. She took another
route, but the police arrived before the Seconal had fully taken
effect. After her recovery, she entered the psychiatric hospital to
be treated for depression. To this day, she still despairs when she
sees a young mother trying to raise a child by herself. "You see the
poverty," said Heard, who is a generous supporter of the Sheepfold in
Orange, an organization that operates safe houses for abused and
battered women and their children. "You see that she is having to
make choices. The car has bald tires. The children have bad teeth.
Nothing is well-kept. They live with a silent broken heart, but they
go on."</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the hospital, Heard still struggled to find the will
to live. Then one night her 10-year-old daughter woke up crying from
a nightmare. "I was calling your name," the girl told her mother,
"and you were walking away. I called and called, and you kept walking
away. And there was nothing I could do. You were gone."</TE>
<TE>   Heard saw her daughter as herself: alone and abandoned. It was an
epiphany. She promised she would never leave, but she knew her life
was out of control. She had nowhere to turn, and she started to pray.
"Dear Lord," she remembered saying, "I just made a promise to my
daughter, a promise that without your help I can't keep."</TE>
<TE>   She prayed all night, and when she rose in the morning, she felt a
weight lifted from her soul. She started attending church and taking
horticulture classes at Orange Coast College. On weekends, she sold
color baskets and herbs at the swap meet at the Orange Country Fair
Grounds, and they were selling out.</TE>
<TE>   She soon needed a place to keep her inventory, and when she drove
down Edwards Street in Westminster and found this vacant lot--covered
with cars, boxes, trimmings from trees and a few run-down boarded-up
shacks--her future suddenly opened up. She negotiated a lease and
carted away the debris. What had once been an abandoned chinchilla
farm, with a car shop in back, became an oasis, the result of
biweekly trips in a van to a grower in Carpinteria who was her source
for unusual perennials.</TE>
<TE>   "Any claim to retail ability would have been pretentious," she
claims. "I just wanted to sell the plants that I loved."</TE>
<TE>   What Heard didn't know when she opened Heard's was that it would
fulfill a need in the gardening community for plants and designs that
were untamed, extravagant and unusual. It was, at its heart, an
old-fashioned, eclectic, cottage-garden approach to gardening that
was just starting to have a wide appeal in the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no guidelines," she said of the early years at the
nursery. "I was allowed to grow slow. My focus was not on money, but
rather on that packet of unusual seeds. I thought at first--I was
wonderfully naive--that if we sold them, we'll be rich. I thought we
could do anything that our hearts desired."</TE>
<TE>   Heard also brought to this sensibility memories of growing up in
Ohio, of gardening at a time when nurseries--as we know them
today--didn't exist, when slips of plants were passed from neighbor
to neighbor and seeds, ordered from catalogs, from friend to friend.
A garden became a way to connect with the soil and with the
community.</TE>
<TE>   "Mary Lou's philosophy was simple," said Dustin Gimbel, propagator
at Heard's. "Don't believe what you read until you plant it yourself.
Peonies, clematis: Everyone thought that you couldn't grow these in
Southern California. But we did. We had this wonderful what-the-hell
attitude, and we just kept at it."</TE>
<TE>   "Every lesson in life I've learned, I learned in the garden, even
the stillness," Heard said. "I'm not afraid of death. I am not
afraid, simply because I walk so closely to God and have learned to
trust. I may want total control over the things in my life, but I
can't have that. Now I can rest and know that he will give me only
what is good for me."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago Heard was diagnosed with colon cancer that had
spread to her liver. She tried chemotherapy, buying some time, but
has given up on the painful and expensive treatments. They were
stealing her vitality and energy.</TE>
<TE>   Last winter, there had been a discussion of giving the business to
the employees, but everyone agreed that shutting was the better
decision. Selling plants--even with the most innovative stock--is
tough in a competitive market, and without Heard, the place wouldn't
be the same.</TE>
<TE>   The closing sale lasted three weeks, not much time to say goodbye
to a business of nearly two decades but enough for her to catch a
glimpse of the reflection of her life in the lives of so many others.
Now she waits at home, visiting doctors and taking calls from hospice
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Though she apologizes for her own garden ("just like the cobbler's
children who go shoeless," she says with a smile), she is content to
know that a little part of her is in hundreds of gardens throughout
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not called upon to think about how close to death we are,"
said Heard, "but rather to consider the gifts that have been given to
us."</TE>
<TE>   When Heard thinks about heaven, she can't tell you the names of
the flowers that are growing there, but she knows exactly which ones
she hopes to find.</TE>
<TE>   "The ones that are the most challenging to grow and take the
longest time before they bloom," she told me. "The ones that require
the most patience, the most endurance and understanding. These are
the ones that when they do bloom, it is pure heaven."</TE>

<LD>It's the Music</LD>
<LD>   Movies can make us laugh or cry. They can scare us or excite us.
But no matter what type of movie you watch, there is usually some
sort of music that helps set the mood. Scary movies often have creepy
music with lots of screeching violins and rumbling bass instruments.
Movies with car chases have exciting upbeat music with trumpets and
other brass instruments. Romantic movies have sweet sounds with soft
violins and mellow woodwinds.</LD>
<LD>   Can you think of other kinds of movies and their music?</LD>
<TE>   Now, what happens if you take the music out of the movies? There's
still a story with words and action, but the movie is not as fun or
interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Cartoons often use music to set the mood too. For example, many of
the old Bugs Bunny cartoons feature music by famous composers.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday the Pacific Symphony will perform live while Bugs
Bunny cartoons are projected on a giant screen. You can watch Bugs
make fruit salad on Elmer Fudd's head while the Pacific Symphony
plays "The Barber of Seville" from the opera by Gioacchino Rossini,
and much more. The gates open at 6 p.m., and the concert starts at 8
p.m. For tickets call (714) 755-5799.</TE>
<TE>   So now, if people ask you, "What's up, doc?" you can give them a
great answer--"It's the music!"</TE>

<HD>In a City of Skyscrapers, Space for a Museum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED BRUNING</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Maybe it was inevitable, but things are looking up for the Skyscraper
Museum.</LD>
<LD>   The not-for-profit operation has bounced from place to place to
place in the last six years. Then, after Sept. 11, it bounced again,
surrendering gallery space to emergency teams assisting
small-business owners devastated by the World Trade Center attacks.</LD>
<LD>   But next year, the Skyscraper Museum, founded in 1996 by author
and Columbia art historian Carol Willis to celebrate "the world's
foremost vertical metropolis," will move into sleek, permanent
quarters at the southern tip of Battery Park City.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a great fit for New York City," said Daniel M. Abramson,
associate professor of art history at Tufts University and author of
the 2001 book "Skyscraper Rivals," a study of the architecture of
Wall Street. "More than any other city in the world, New York City is
identified with the skyscraper and, probably more than any other
city, with the 20th century."</TE>
<TE>   The museum, which Abramson said had a mission like "no other
cultural institution," will occupy 5,800 square feet--including a
mezzanine--in a new, 38-story building that also houses the
Ritz-Carlton hotel. Millennium Partners, developers of the high-rise,
is making street-level space available to Willis so that the museum,
at last, can stay put.</TE>
<TE>   "The Skyscraper Museum has had a peripatetic existence," said
Philip Aarons, founding partner of Millennium Partners and a member
of the Skyscraper Museum board of directors. "It seemed to me we
could find an appropriate amount of space for the museum."</TE>
<TE>   Expediency is nothing new in the world of New York real estate, as
Willis knows. She wrote a 1995 book called "Form Follows Finance,"
describing how skyscraper design--"blueprints for profit," as she
says--was dictated in the prewar period by the expectations of real
estate speculators. The bottom line--not beautiful architecture--was
the priority.</TE>
<TE>   Happily for Willis, the Skyscraper Museum does not have to contend
with the exigencies of the market. In addition to rent-free space
provided by Millennium, building costs of about $3 million will be
covered by public, private and foundation sources.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the Skyscraper Museum mounted an exhibit to
commemorate what would have been the trade center's 30th anniversary.
Originally scheduled as a series of events at the Windows on the
World restaurant in Tower One, the show was moved to the New York
Historical Society, and material was added to reflect the tragedy.
"Now the history of the skyscraper takes on a whole different
dimension," Willis said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Not your ordinary man of style, James Perse, creator of sexy
T-shirts, turns 30 today but celebrated the milestone early with a
Thursday night party that was part birthday bash, part fashion promo.</LD>
<LD>   The precocious son of Maxfield boutique founder Tommy Perse
covered the lawn of his sleek, one-bedroom, glass-walled bachelor pad
in the Hollywood Hills with white tiles and cream carpet, and put
Beverly Hills chef Mako Tanaka on display in the sleek kitchen, where
he turned out crab claws, pot stickers and other delectables too
small to see in the darkness of the poolside party.</LD>
<LD>   Like a lot of events these days, it was tough to sort out the
pretty-young-things in hip-huggers from the I'm-sort-of-famous-things
in hip-huggers. Yet some notables turned out--model Tatiana Patitz,
designers Henry Duarte and Andrew Dibben and actor Matthew Perry. And
some even dropped off Hermes shopping bags full of gifts for the
birthday boy.</LD>
<TE>   Ever the master of detail, Perse personally staged dioramas in
four rooms of his immaculate house, where expansive glass walls
functioned as store windows where guests could look but not touch.</TE>
<TE>   Scene 1: A pair of kid-size mannequins, wearing his forthcoming
Baby James children's line, surround a big birthday cake.</TE>
<TE>   Scene 2: A male and female mannequin wearing his signature Ts,
hoodies and knit pants lounge in the ultramodern living room.</TE>
<TE>   The finale: Lettered onto the window is the caption: "Homage to
TP." An alabaster female mannequin stands under the running shower,
her white T-shirt wet and clingy. Her male companion sits on the
john, his Perse boxers at his ankles and JP monogrammed toilet paper
hanging off the roll.</TE>
<TE>   "TP" stands not just for toilet paper, but Tommy Perse, the dad
who helped launch his kid in business a decade ago. In addition to
the new infant and children's collections, the younger Perse is
adding hats, which were his first foray into fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "The minimum order was 100, and my dad was the only one who would
buy them from me. He started selling them to the producers and
celebrities who came into the store," he recounted.</TE>
<TE>   Pretty soon, he was making all kinds of promotional clothing items
for movie crews, industry parties and even for Martin Scorsese's 50th
birthday a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Now Perse is selling his men's and women's shirts and sportswear
in 500 stores and expects to sell $10 million of the stuff this year.</TE>
<TE>   Now you gotta wonder what Perse will do in 20 years for his own
half-century birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Fragrance du Jour</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that night at Hollywood &amp; Highland, shoppers wandered into
Sephora, sipped the free champagne--thank- youverymuch--and indulged
in the launch party for Stila cosmetics founder Jeanine Lobell's
Bouquet du Jour fragrance collection.</TE>
<TE>   The line lets users customize scents by mixing combinations of the
two $50  eaux de parfum, the three $30 lotions and the two shimmery
$28 powders.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how you wear the same thing and then you get bored and
go buy something else, but ultimately, you go back to the thing you
love," Lobell said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a way to keep the thing you love."</TE>
<TE>   The collection has been selling so well that executives worried if
they had ordered enough of the dried flowers that decorate the pink
packages.</TE>
<TE>   They had.</TE>

<DH>Part 1: Uncle Ruben teaches Maria and Alfonso how to make
an apple tree, just like Johnny Appleseed.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Maria and Alfonso were hiking along a wilderness trail in the San
Bernardino Mountains with their Uncle Ruben.</LD>
<LD>   They came to a clearing in the woods where they saw some trees.
Uncle Ruben walked over to one of them, picked off a fruit, and
showed it to the children. "Wow," said Maria. "Apples!"</LD>
<LD>   "Yes. They were planted here many years ago by Mormon settlers.
And today I'm going to show you how to make an apple tree."</LD>
<TE>   "Make an apple tree?" asked Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," said Uncle Ruben. He removed some pruning shears from his
pack and began to prune away many of the old dead branches, and
branches that were growing too close together. Soon, the apple tree
looked very good, as if a farmer had carefully pruned it.</TE>
<TE>   Then Uncle Ruben cut 10 branches from the pile of clippings. Each
cutting was as thick as a finger, and about a foot long. "OK, now
let's go back to camp and we'll make an apple tree," said Uncle
Ruben. The children just looked at each other.</TE>
<TE>   Back at camp, Uncle Ruben stuck the 10 apple branches into the
rich black soil next to the camp's compost pile. Then he watered it
well. "I'll water these every day," said Uncle Ruben, "and if we're
lucky, most of them will grow and become apple trees."</TE>
<TE>   "Really?" asked Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes! You've heard of Johnny Appleseed, right?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," said Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   "His real name was John Chapman," said Uncle Ruben. "He didn't
scatter apple seeds, but he raised apple trees like we're doing here.
He sold the apple trees to support himself."</TE>
<TE>   "That's interesting," said Maria, looking at the twigs. "When will
we have apples to eat?"</TE>
<TE>   "In a few years," said Uncle Ruben.</TE>
<TE>   "That's too bad," said Maria, "I was hoping to help mom make an
apple pie today."</TE>

<HD>A Taste of Cuba and More to Come</HD>
<DH>The duo behind a hot Westwood eatery ventures into
Hollywood, starting with a Havana-inspired club</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't meant to happen this fast. Not one, not two, but three new
hot spots in Hollywood opening back to back, all owned by the same
two South African-born entrepreneurs who just three years ago were
getting on each other's nerves--best friends sharing a one-bedroom
apartment; one sleeping on the couch, promising to move out but never
managing to do so; both collecting quarters to grab a burger at
McDonald's, all the while bickering like a married couple.</LD>
<LD>   But that was life before Tengu.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly three years after Alan Nathan and Anton Posniak opened the
popular Westwood sushi and Asian fusion restaurant named after the
Japanese god of mischief, the partners have arrived in Hollywood,
where they always wanted to be. On April 28, they opened one of the
most exclusive doors in town: the split-level, elegant,
Havana-inspired lounge Nacional, named after the Hotel Nacional in
Cuba. Next month, they plan to strike again with a double punch: an
intimate Cuban fusion restaurant called Paladar, to be Nacional's
next-door companion on Wilcox Avenue; and the Ivar, a
much-anticipated 14,000-square-foot, glitzy dance hall, 2 1/2 blocks
away.</LD>
<TE>   To say that Nathan, 32, and Posniak, 30, are busy is an
understatement, but the two say they have no choice. All around them,
Tinseltown is exploding. In the last four years, nightclubs, bars,
restaurants and shops have been popping up all over Hollywood
Boulevard. East of La Brea Avenue, where just two years ago it was
hard to feel safe among the street life, thrill-seekers now check in
and out of bars and clubs, while families and tourists go to movies
and dine at fine restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   They are part of a new wave of successful Hollywood nightclub and
restaurant owners who have helped transform the district, people such
as Loyal Pennings, owner of Las Palmas and the upcoming Corridor on
Cahuenga Boulevard; Paul Devitt, of the Beauty Bar and Star Shoes;
Richard Heyman of the Hollywood and Vine Diner, Bice Mercado and the
upcoming Ultra Lounge; Ivan Kane of Deep and Forty Deuce; and Chris
Breed of the Pig 'n Whistle, Sunset Room and the upcoming White
Lotus.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood has become a destination," says Nathan. "People know
they can come here now and park their car and they have lots of
choices of things to do. At the end of the day, when you look at the
quality of people going out in Hollywood, you know this
revitalization is going to be a success. This is something I
anticipated and dreamed about, but I also think we've gotten very
lucky."</TE>
<TE>   If it is true that people make their own luck, Nathan and
Posniak's success should not come as a surprise, said Westwood real
estate and business consultant Steve Sann, who met them before Tengu
opened. A neighborhood favorite and funky spot where A-list
celebrities, such as Cindy Crawford and Nicole Kidman, can dine
discreetly, Tengu has thrived in an obscure location that seemed to
be cursed for years, Sann said. Posniak, who lived and studied in
Japan for two years, created the restaurant's soothing Zen aesthetic
and then spiced it up with fruit-infused sakes, creative sushi rolls,
haikus on the menu, and a DJ. "What they've done in Westwood is
nothing short of extraordinary," Sann said. "They took a challenging
location, at the end of Westwood Village, and created a very hip and
beautiful interior and New York vibe. It's taken sushi to a whole new
level in Westwood, bringing their eastside Hollywood crowd into
Westwood Village. That was unprecedented."</TE>
<TE>   Several miles northeast of Tengu, Hollywood business leaders are
depending on Nathan and Posniak to hit a trifecta with their new
ventures. Kerry Morrison, Hollywood Entertainment District executive
director, says the two are a boon to the community. "They are two
high-energy guys who seem to have a passion for bringing something
special to Hollywood," Morrison said. "They are bringing something
unique and of quality. Their ideas are not flash-in-the-pan concepts.
Their businesses will endure."</TE>
<TE>   The duo may be on the roster of Hollywood's newest nightclub
owners, but they've been eyeing the scene for some time. Best friends
since they met as teens in La Jolla, where their families had
immigrated, Nathan and Posniak started dreaming of owning a Hollywood
bar while working at the landmark Garden of Eden on La Brea Avenue,
where Nathan's gregariousness turned him into a sought-after party
promoter and Posniak's intuitive business sense--he had owned a bar
in San Diego called the Pour House--led to a job as the bar manager.</TE>
<TE>   Their first attempt to open a Hollywood bar was in 1997 when they
tried to take over a bar on Cherokee for two years but gave up
because the landlord would offer them only a month-to-month lease,
Posniak said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in escrow for two years for a bar on Hollywood Boulevard
but we couldn't close the deal," Nathan said. "Anton had lived in
Japan and spoke Japanese and he had the foresight to [come up with]
an upscale restaurant in Westwood with a DJ and a scene. But we never
lost sight of what we wanted, which was to open a place in Hollywood.
Between the [delays of] permits and issues with contractors, it wound
up looking like we wanted to do this all at once. But it just
happened that way."</TE>
<TE>   With Paladar and the Ivar still yet to open, Nathan and Posniak
hope, eventually, to open similar venues on the East Coast. But for
now, they're sticking closer to home. They plan to open a Tengu in
Hollywood next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy the creative part of it," Posniak said. "When we are
building a new place, I like to be there, looking over the whole
thing. I like going out and looking for places where we can make
things happen. Alan's a great frontman. I'm more behind the scenes."</TE>
<TE>   Nathan and Posniak, in fact, are opposites who fit. Posniak is the
idea man, mindful of details with an eye for design; Nathan is the
money man, an easygoing schmoozer who can hustle for cash and keep
everybody smiling by remembering the most minute details of their
lives. Last year, Nathan raised $3 million for their three Hollywood
ventures without approaching a single bank. Their investors include
attorneys, real estate agents, and Hollywood actors and producers.</TE>
<TE>   Sanjay Kumar, 32, met Nathan when he was managing the Garden of
Eden and the two struck up a friendship based on their mutual
entrepreneurial goals. Kumar, who lives in Brentwood and is in the
process of creating a video game production and distribution company,
said he invested in Tengu because he was impressed with Nathan's
creativity and integrity.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, I wouldn't recommend investing in restaurants or
nightclubs because they tend to be very high risk," he said. "But
when you invest, you need to trust that the people you are investing
in are good business people and have honesty and integrity and are
going to treat you with respect and professionalism. Tengu has been a
very good investment to me. I would have invested in Nacional, too,
but the market crashed and I wasn't in the financial position to do
it. But I believe in all of their endeavors."</TE>
<TE>   Nathan earned his bachelor's of science in entrepreneurship at USC
in 1995; Posniak graduated from UC Berkeley in 1996 with a bachelor's
degree in Japanese history. Both tried to spark careers as
stockbrokers while in college, but sitting behind a desk 12 hours a
day was not in their natures. Posniak hated wearing the suit. Nathan
preferred his nocturnal lifestyle: "I'd much rather get home at 5 in
the morning than get up at 5 in the morning." They went to work at
the Garden of Eden, knowing their days of working for someone else
were numbered.</TE>
<TE>   Now they glide around Tengu and Nacional with ease, playing host
as if they were at a house party among friends. A nocturnal yin and
yang, they get a kick out of playing good cop/bad cop with the staff
and nagging one another. Posniak accuses Nathan of being messy;
Nathan retorts: "Anton adds to the chaos." When it comes to business,
though, they are, unequivocally, of one mind.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all very different but we have great synchronicity," says
Guy Ravid, 27, Tengu's general manager, also a South African
immigrant. "But don't get me wrong. They are not the easiest guys to
work for. They are very demanding. Anton is very intense. It can be
taxing. There's the Energizer Bunny and then there's Anton. Alan's
charismatic. He's the salesman. But neither of them lets up. It's all
business."</TE>
<TE>   And, in the name of business, they can even take the fun out of
getting drunk. Every time Ravid made a mistake as a young bar-back
five years ago, Posniak made him drink a shot. The lessons were so
"brutal" that Ravid said he often went home completely drunk after
being ordered to organize the keg room several times.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the happy-go-lucky guy, very much the artist," Ravid said.
"It was very hard for me to get used to their way of being. We didn't
sit at home talking about the sun and the stars and the moon and the
way of the world, like I like to do. The only conversation ever was
our business pursuits. I've learned so much from both of them and it
is fun. But you have to be ready for it."</TE>
<TE>   To prepare themselves, Posniak and Nathan do their homework. Tengu
was a natural, with Posniak's expertise in Japanese culture. But when
they decided to establish a Cuban-themed bar, they knew they'd need
to get an education. They flew to Havana, where they spent a week
visiting bars and hotels, shooting 2,000 photographs of the city's
1950s architecture and, in the process, discovering the concept of
the Cuban paladar, government-owned restaurants operated in people's
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Cuba has a mystique to it," Posniak said. "It's like forbidden
fruit. The people, the culture, everything about it is so beautiful,
elegant and encompassing. The beauty and flavor is really in the
imperfections, and Cuba is still trapped in time. The architecture of
the 1950s is very popular now and that's where Cuba still is. We got
most of our inspiration for Nacional just walking the streets."</TE>
<TE>   The lounge they created is a blend of old Cuban design and
architecture, and modern, sleek lines. Instead of an edgy black,
Posniak went for chocolate and rust tones that bring out the warmth
of the people and places they experienced on the island. The exterior
of the building, which looks unfinished and patchy, resembles
buildings in Havana that have remained untouched for nearly 50 years.
On a wall in the main room, a 6-foot-tall photographic-tile mosaic
depicts a Cuban man smiling in one pose, smoking a cigar in another.</TE>
<TE>   "This place has a very relaxing feel to it," said patron Amy
Richards, a 27-year-old aspiring model and actress. "It's beautiful
and it's fancy but it's also very comfortable. The best part is the
laid-back crowd. We're smack in the middle of Hollywood but the
pretension got left at the door."</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of other things get left at Nacional's door. Nathan and
Posniak are going for exclusivity, but their A-list isn't necessarily
star-studded. They are striving for six degrees of separation. That
is, to get in, you have to know one of them. Or know somebody who
knows somebody who knows one of them.</TE>
<TE>   And forget bluffing because Travis the doorman, who won't divulge
a last name, has been around and he's not falling for it. Do not hand
him a cellular phone, claiming that someone "important" wants to
vouch for you. Do not speak in codes; there are no passwords to gain
entry, and men: Do not arrive in groups or you won't get in, no
matter who you know or how hot you are. With the ladies, that's a
different story.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Friday night, Posniak's 30th birthday, a perky party
girl showed up in a mini that could have passed as a napkin and a
very tight tank. Eagerly, she said the magic words others had spoken
before her: "I'm here for Anton's birthday party," neglecting to
recognize the birthday boy standing right in front of her.</TE>
<TE>   "Anton, huh? Do you know Anton?" Travis asked.</TE>
<TE>   Her brown eyes widened. Before she could stick her foot in her
mouth, Travis nodded at Posniak and yelled, "Say happy birthday to
Anton!" Graciously, Posniak lifted the velvet rope and let her in,
even though he had no idea who she was.</TE>
<TE>   "People will try anything and I don't blame them," Nathan says,
taking a sip from his Madris, a mix of vodka, orange and cranberry
juice. "I remember when I used to climb fences to try to sneak into
the Gate. Or I'd show up and say I was on Joe's list and they'd look
at me and ask, 'Who's Joe?' "</TE>
<TE>   Next door to Nacional, Nathan hopes that Paladar will become a
neighborhood eatery known for its home-style food, Cuban hospitality
and no special list to get in. While Nathan explored ideas for their
menu in Havana, Posniak conjured up varieties of fruity sangrias, the
same way he infused his sakes at Tengu with pineapple and other
tropical fruits.</TE>
<TE>   "Interest in all things Cuba is at a high in this country, and I
don't believe that's a fad," Nathan said. "It's a very special place
and Americans are pulled by it. The energy of the people and the
music and the energy in their eyes is amazing. We want Paladar to be
cozy and small, and the menu will be Cuban with a little flair to
appeal to the Hollywood community and Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The Ivar will be far different. With five bars and a crowd
capacity of 1,000, Nathan hopes the dance club will be a Hollywood
premiere party destination as well as a hall where partyers can
groove to house and electronica. Its soaring New York-style loft
interior and industrial red brick, glass and steel will add class to
a historic building, Morrison said.</TE>
<TE>   With so many operations gearing up at once, how will the duo keep
an eye on things? "We have a very good management team in place at
all of our locations so we can delegate," Nathan said. "My goal is to
develop these locations all over the country. I don't want to have
that vanity of always being in the club so people can come and see
me. I just want people to enjoy their time when they're here."</TE>
<TE>   Ravid, who once dreamed of being a photojournalist, now owns
equity in the businesses and is being trained to become chief
financial officer of all of Nathan and Posniak's enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   "We all look forward to the day when we can sit together on the
beach and share a rum and Coke and know everything is running
smoothly and we can relax," Ravid said. "And for once, I can take the
lead and ask, 'What do you think about the sun, the moon and the
stars?' "</TE>

<HD>Aiming to Elevate the Conduct of Analysts</HD>
<DH>Securities: AIMR's Patricia Doran Walters discusses the
group's proposals for reform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stung by the conflict-of-interest controversies tainting Wall
Street's stock analysts, an association of financial professionals is
pushing for new rules of conduct that it believes go far beyond the
reforms recently adopted by major brokerages.</LD>
<LD>   The Assn. for Investment Management and Research has issued a
series of proposals it hopes will become the industry standard for
analyst practices worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   The group, which has 59,000 members and is the largest investment
analyst association, issued its plan July 17 and asked for public
comment for three months.</LD>
<TE>   AIMR, which may be best known as the keeper of the chartered
financial analyst, or CFA, designation, said it supports the
brokerage industry reforms recently approved by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in the wake of a host of scandals involving Wall
Street research practices over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Those reforms are meant to guarantee analysts' objectivity in
their stock recommendations by strengthening the wall between
research and investment banking activities.</TE>
<TE>   But AIMR suggests additional changes in how analysts recommend
stocks. The group's ideas also target the conduct of mutual fund
managers and other portfolio managers and the conduct of corporate
executives in terms of how they interact with analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the SEC, however, AIMR is not a regulatory agency. It has
no enforcement power over Wall Street brokerages. Still, about 18% of
its members work for brokerages--the "sell side," in industry
parlance--including well-known names such as investment strategist
Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman Sachs. The bulk of AIMR's members work
for institutional investors such as mutual funds and banks, the
so-called buy side.</TE>
<TE>   AIMR hopes not only brokerages but also money managers, public
companies and the news media will follow its guidelines on stock
research.</TE>
<TE>   The Times spoke recently with Patricia Doran Walters, AIMR's
senior vice president for professional standards and advocacy, about
the group's proposals and Wall Street's credibility crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Is this the worst crisis of confidence you've seen in
the investment business?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: I do think it is probably the worst ethical crisis in the
industry. The general public doesn't really understand the difference
between a research analyst and a portfolio manager and an investment
advisor. The vast majority of our members believe that the whole
profession is being tainted by a few people on the sell side, a
subset of the profession. Most investment professionals are ethical
and put their clients' interests first.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How do you feel about the reforms the brokerage industry
adopted in the wake of the conflict-of-interest charges brought by
the New York attorney general against Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in April?</TE>
<TE>   A: Basically, we would like everybody to adopt that standard--that
[an analyst] is compensated based on the quality of the job that
you're hired to do, not on investment banking deals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are the highest-profile, most controversial analysts in the
brokerage business AIMR members? For example, Jack Grubman, formerly
of Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney; Henry Blodget, formerly of
Merrill; and Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley?</TE>
<TE>   A: They are not AIMR members.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: If they and other prominent brokerage analysts aren't members,
how would your proposed standards be enforced?</TE>
<TE>   A: The idea is that you put what you consider to be the
highest-quality set of standards on the table, and you expect that
industry participants would voluntarily adopt these standards. The
New York Stock Exchange and National Assn. of Securities Dealers can
enforce their standards on their members because they're regulatory
organizations and you can't practice unless you're one of their
members.</TE>
<TE>   But you can certainly be a securities analyst or a portfolio
manager and not be an AIMR member. We just believe that our code of
ethics and standards of practice differentiate our members.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How does AIMR enforce its rules with its own members?</TE>
<TE>   A: We have sanctions anywhere from cautionary letters to public
sanctions to time suspensions of AIMR membership to revocation of
membership and the right to use the CFA designation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Explain your analyst reform proposals, starting with how you
would change stock ratings.</TE>
<TE>   A: Rating systems should include a risk dimension and a time
horizon as well as the traditional "buy," "hold," "sell" or "market
outperform" or "underperform" dimension. Companies would certainly
have the flexibility to design the rating system they want; it's just
that they would need to communicate all three of those elements.</TE>
<TE>   So, you wouldn't go on TV and say, "I think this is a 'buy.' " You
might say, "I think this is a 'buy' but it's high-risk security and I
don't think we'll reach the price target for five years."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your proposals also address the conduct of analysts and
portfolio managers on the buy side, and practices you think should be
banned. Can you give examples?</TE>
<TE>   A: If portfolio managers have a major position in a company, they
don't want to be blindsided by a change in [a brokerage]
recommendation, and therefore they can put pressure on research
analysts not to do that by threatening to redirect brokerage business
[from the analyst's firm].</TE>
<TE>   Or they've been known to basically call a company and say, "This
particular analyst is changing his or her mind about you--please do
something about it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: You're also hoping to change the conduct of corporate
executives, in terms of how companies deal with brokerages and
analysts?</TE>
<TE>   A: Right. The corporate issuers have other ways of pressuring
analysts besides threatening not to give investment banking business
to a firm, and we address these areas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How does that pressure manifest itself?</TE>
<TE>   A: Issuers can avoid taking particular analysts' questions on
quarterly conference calls. Some analysts may never get to ask a
question because the person being interviewed doesn't think they're
on "their side." Investment relations people might not call you back
if you have questions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: You also propose standards for the media.</TE>
<TE>   A: If the media truly believe that [analyst] conflicts of
interests should be disclosed to the public, then they need to
facilitate those disclosures. Whether you're having someone speak on
TV about their recommendations or writing an article about it, you
should do something to make sure that the appropriate disclosures,
even if abbreviated, reach their intended audience. If you're going
to interview somebody about their recommendations, you should at
least direct people in the article to where they can go to find out
about any potential conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   We also believe that when investment professionals appear in a
public forum, whether it's on TV or at a conference, that there be
some arrangement by the firm so that members of the audience can
purchase the research report for a reasonable fee. It's extremely
difficult for average investors to get research reports now.</TE>
<TE>   If we don't expect investment pros to make valuation decisions
based on earnings alone, we shouldn't expect the average investor to
make a decision based only on a recommendation--even if it's the
expanded rating system that we're calling for.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's a "reasonable" price for a research report?</TE>
<TE>   A: AIMR doesn't have a particular view on that. I certainly think
under a couple of hundred dollars would be reasonable. Now, you
wouldn't be able to get it at all.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Unless you're a customer of the brokerage.</TE>
<TE>   A: A fairly substantial customer. If you're a small retail
customer, you're not going to be able to get the reports. I'm
personally a customer of CS [Credit Suisse] First Boston and I don't
have a big enough account to get the reports.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: You propose prohibiting analysts from taking part in brokerage
marketing activities such as "road shows" for corporate clients'
stock or bond offerings. But you also believe that brokerage research
units don't have to be completely separated from the investment
banking business, as some Wall Street critics have suggested.</TE>
<TE>   A: We don't think it's realistic, particularly because investment
banking is going to need a research analyst to do due diligence: "Is
this a deal we should do or not do?" The firm has a reputation that
ultimately depends on whether or not the deals are good ones for
investors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Even after more than a year of criticism of analysts'
practices, the vast majority of stock recommendations on Wall Street
still are "buy." The number of "sells" has increased modestly, but
shouldn't there be a more even distribution of analysts' ratings?</TE>
<TE>   A: The analyst's job is to go find companies to recommend to their
clients to buy, unless you happen to be a "short" seller. In terms of
"sell," well, you can avoid buying if you've heard a sell rating, but
the only people who can act on that rating are the people who already
own the stock. Also, most firms don't cover every company in an
industry. So I'm not sure you really ever expect a normal
distribution of "buy," "hold" and "sell" ratings.</TE>
<TE>   We do think the AIMR proposal to have a final report [in cases
where brokerages drop coverage of stocks] would throw a few more
"sell" recommendations in there. We think firms should be a little
more forthcoming--when you discontinue coverage, basically you think
this stock is a dog now and nobody should be buying it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: In what other ways do AIMR's proposals go beyond what the SEC
has approved?</TE>
<TE>   A: An important distinction is that our standards are meant for
firms globally.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE and NASD rules cover firms that are listed only on those
two exchanges. Currently, 25% to 30% of our individual members are
outside the U.S., and by 2011 they will probably make up the
majority.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have any brokerages promised to implement your standards when
they become final?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. People are going to comment, and I'm sure they will wait
and see what the final standards are before they decide.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is the gist of the industry's comments so far?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's way too early to say. If you've ever been part of a
comment process, you know what I mean: We expect that the vast
majority will come in Oct. 18--and the deadline is Oct. 17.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Here are some of the key ideas the Assn. for Investment Management
and Research has proposed to improve the objectivity of analysts'
stock research:</LD>
<LD>   * Brokerages should establish "three-dimensional" stock rating
systems that incorporate measures of risk and a time horizon to help
investors assess the suitability of a security for their own
circumstances, rather than rely on simple "buy," "sell" or "hold"
ratings.</LD>
<LD>   * When discontinuing coverage of a stock, a brokerage should issue
a "final" research report and recommendation, explaining the reasons
for dropping the issue. Many brokerages have preferred to quietly end
coverage of stocks to avoid offending the issuing companies.</LD>
<TE>   * Brokerages should prohibit research analysts from participating
in marketing activities, including "road shows," for corporate
clients that are issuing new shares.</TE>
<TE>   * Analysts who give media interviews or make other public
appearances discussing their stock recommendations should make the
full research reports available to the public at a reasonable price.</TE>
<TE>   * Corporations should refrain from making accusations against
research analysts in the media. Some companies have publicly
criticized analysts when the firms haven't liked an analyst's rating
of the company.</TE>
<TE>   * Fund managers and other "buy side" investment professionals
should be prohibited from threatening to reduce their companies'
trading business with a brokerage in an effort to secure a more
favorable rating on a security they hold.</TE>
<TE>   * News media should establish formal policies for disclosing
conflicts of interest, or potential conflicts, when interviewing
analysts or portfolio managers.</TE>

<HD>State to Bar Andersen License</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest blow to onetime accounting giant Arthur Andersen, the
state Board of Accountancy said it will seek to bar the beleaguered
firm from practicing public accounting in California.</LD>
<LD>   The board announced its intention Friday, the same day Texas
revoked Arthur Andersen's license to practice in that state. The
California Board of Accountancy, under state law, can take a similar
step based on disciplinary action by another state, government or
agency.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen was convicted by a Houston jury in June of obstruction of
justice in a federal investigation of the financial collapse of its
client Enron Corp. The Houston-based energy trader filed for
bankruptcy court protection in December.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen, in fact, already stated last month that it was
voluntarily giving up its right to practice in California as of July
31.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen was first licensed in California in 1946 and at one time
operated 10 offices around the state.</TE>

<HD>Cuba Gets Shipment of U.S. Brand-Name Food</HD>
<DH>Trade: The purchase is the first direct sale since the
lifting of an embargo imposed more than four decades ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC FRANK</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>Tons of American food destined for Cuban supermarkets arrived here
Sunday in the first shipment of U.S. brand-name food sold directly to
the communist country since Washington imposed an embargo more than
40 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Cuba already has purchased 600,000 tons of U.S. grains, poultry
and other foods since November, taking advantage of a U.S. law passed
in 2000 that relaxed the U.S. embargo to allow agriculture-related
sales for cash.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's shipment of Marsh-brand butter, margarine, breakfast
cereals and tomato sauce was part of a $750,000 deal made by Marsh
International, a subsidiary of Marsh Supermarkets Inc. of Indiana, to
sell the first American brand-name food to Cuba since 1961.</LD>
<TE>   The company said future shipments under the contract comprised 140
products, including condiments, snack foods, baby food, cookies,
pasta, preserves and soup.</TE>
<TE>   "Cuba is a viable market with lots of potential, and we want to be
here," Mohamed Bouras, Marsh's director of international sales, said
at the Port of Havana, where the food was unloaded.</TE>
<TE>   Bouras said his company's supermarkets carried 148,000 items,
including all major U.S. brands.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason we cannot sell those items here. We hope to
sell millions to Cuba next year."</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Alvarez Borrego, head of the Cuban food-importing agency
Alimport, joined Bouras at the port and valued his company's
purchases of U.S. food this year at about $120 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should we have to buy U.S. products through third parties? It
increases the cost and keeps our two peoples apart," Alvarez said,
when asked about the many U.S. items already available in the
Caribbean island nation.</TE>
<TE>   Well-known U.S. soft drinks such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Sprite
are readily available here, as are cigarette brands such as Marlboro
and Winston, and other products, brought in through Canada, Mexico
and Central America.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar and local peso circulate freely in Cuba. State-run
stores sell most imported food for dollars, while other stores sell a
smaller variety of goods of poorer quality for pesos.</TE>
<TE>   Cuba's food purchases have fueled a growing farm and business
lobby in the United States to end the embargo.</TE>
<TE>   The House voted recently to lift restrictions on Americans
traveling to Cuba and to allow U.S. financing of food sales to
Havana, among other embargo-weakening measures, with the Senate
expected to adopt similar legislation this year.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has vowed to veto attempts to lift the bans on
trade financing and travel by Americans to Cuba until Havana makes
democratic reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez said if the embargo were lifted, his country might buy
more than 60% of its food from the United States. He said Cuba
currently imports $1 billion worth of food but that the figure would
increase to $1.5 billion over the next few years.</TE>

<HD>Insurer to Reward Illinois Druggists for Generic Sales</HD>
<DH>Health care: Blue Cross offers a $1 incentive for each
switch from a brand-name drug. Some pharmacists object.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Illinois' biggest health insurer will start paying pharmacists every
time they persuade a customer to switch from a brand-name drug to a
generic.</LD>
<LD>   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois saw its drug costs rise 26%
last year, to $701 million. Beginning in January, the insurer will
pay $1 for each changed prescription.</LD>
<LD>   Generic drugs generally cost much less than brand-name versions.
For instance, a patient taking the generic version of the
antidepressant Prozac might pay $70 a month, versus $96 for Prozac,
according to a report Sunday in the Chicago Tribune.</LD>
<TE>   Blue Cross and Blue Shield needs to counter the massive marketing
efforts of drug makers, said Brad Buxton, senior vice president of
health-care management for the organization.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to have all of these commercials driving what
everybody is taking," he told the Tribune. "We are simply trying to
encourage what is already a healthy relationship between a pharmacist
and the patient. If there is a generic drug that is as good as a
brand-name, patients could save $40 to $60 a prescription."</TE>
<TE>   The insurance company projects that some large-volume pharmacies
could make as much as $5,000 to $10,000 per quarter under the
program. But some pharmacists aren't eager. "The only people who
would benefit from this is the generic company and the insurance
company, and we don't," said Sherman White of 200 Pharmacy in
Chicago. "When you are trying to make somebody change, that takes
time, and time is money to me. It's not worth it to me anyway."</TE>
<TE>   A drug company trade group complained that the insurance company
is interfering in the doctor-patient relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think patients will want their insurance company to play
doctors," said Jackie Cottrell, spokeswoman for Pharmaceutical
Research and Manufacturers of America. "Patients have the right to
know that an insurer has put this kind of program together."</TE>
<TE>   Buxton said the pharmacists still will have to check with the
doctor before switching a prescription.</TE>
<TE>   "We never push a generic over a brand if the brand is the best
drug," he said.</TE>

<HD>ISPs Offering Slower Speeds</HD>
<DH>Access: Covad and Charter are among providers hoping to
draw customers with mid-level services that are slower, cheaper than
standard broadband.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRUCE MEYERSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High-speed Internet connections may be getting cheaper, but only if
you'll settle for a slower version of fast.</LD>
<LD>   Hoping to attract Internet users who won't pay the $50 or so a
month for a typical broadband connection, some providers are moving
away from a one-speed-fits-all approach and introducing a slower,
lower-priced level of service.</LD>
<LD>   Covad Communications Group Inc., one of the high-profile failures
of the dot-com collapse, is taking another aggressive stab at the
powerful telephone and cable TV monopolies that dominate broadband.</LD>
<TE>   Rejuvenated by a stint in bankruptcy, the company recently
launched a digital subscriber line, or DSL, service priced at $39.95
a month with an introductory rate of $21.95 for the first four
months.</TE>
<TE>   And Charter Communications Inc., the nation's fourth-largest cable
TV company, has been offering broadband for $30 or $35 a month on
most of its systems in 40 states for at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   The catch?</TE>
<TE>   With download speeds of 200 to 250 kilobits per second, these
"broadband lite" services are several times faster than a dial-up
telephone connection but perhaps only a third as fast as a typical
cable or DSL connection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little bit slower but a heck of a lot faster than dial-up
and well worth the money," said Steve Martin, a longtime America
Online customer who recently switched to Covad at his home in San
Jose.</TE>
<TE>   The speed probably won't satisfy those looking to download music
or set up a Web site.</TE>
<TE>   But Martin, a procurement officer for a technology company,
considers his Covad connection speed more than sufficient for
checking e-mail, downloading photographs and making travel
arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   "The killer application on the Internet is still e-mail, and as
long as that's the case, 200k [kilobits per second] is fine," said
Mark Kersey, an analyst for ARS Research.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether tiered broadband will help reverse the price
increases that cable and phone companies put in place as the dot-com
meltdown wiped out competition from feisty rivals.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of June, the average monthly charge for cable broadband
was $45.31, up from $37.05 at the end of 2000, according to the
latest market survey by ARS Research. DSL prices averaged $51.36 at
midyear, up from $48.84 at the close of 2000, ARS reported.</TE>
<TE>   Tiered pricing isn't new to broadband. For years, customers
willing to pay more than $50 a month have been able to get speedier
connects.</TE>
<TE>   But now, possibly because of the renewed competition, the big
players also are toying with a tiered approach at the lower end.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Broadband, which two weeks ago launched a faster tier of
cable Internet service for $80 a month, also plans market trials with
a lower-speed version this year.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the companies dabbling with a lower-priced version of
broadband are hoping to get dial-up users hooked on speed, confident
that even the most price-conscious subscribers will quickly recognize
what they were missing without an "always-on" connection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's addictive. They can never go back to dial-up," said Charles
Golvin, an industry analyst at Forrester Research.</TE>
<TE>   Because the profit margins on entry-level offerings are less than
robust, there are questions about whether such business models are
any more viable than they were during the dot-com boom.</TE>
<TE>   Covad believes that its model can work now that regulatory changes
allow it to provide DSL over a customer's existing phone line rather
than a separately installed line.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, for players both big and small, any entry-level tier of
service will serve as a steppingstone to higher-revenue plans.</TE>
<TE>   Once people convert to broadband, getting them to pay $10 more for
faster service is easier than getting them to initially switch from
dial-up, Golvin and Kersey said.</TE>

<HD>Hershey Sale Has Big Hurdle</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Potential bidders for Hershey Foods Co., the confectionary giant put
up for sale last month, are losing interest after discovering that
14,000 employees qualify for severance benefits that could add some
$400 million to the cost of buying the business, the Times of London
reported on its online edition Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The benefits are thought to give a wide range of employees up to
three times base salary and last for two years after a change of
ownership, the newspaper reported. That cost would be onerous for a
buyer looking to cut the work force to save costs, the report added.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at Hershey could not be reached for comment.</LD>
<TE>   The Hershey, Pa.-based candy manufacturer, which makes Hershey's
chocolate bars and other well-known brands, was put up for sale by
the Milton Hershey School Trust, a charitable organization that
controls 77% of Hershey's voting power.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts speculated that Hershey could fetch $12 billion or more,
with Nestle and Kraft Foods Inc. seen as likely bidders.</TE>

<HD>Lettuce Grows Into a Processed Food</HD>
<DH>Packaged salads are taking up more space in stores and
changing the farming business</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOLEDAD, Calif.</DL>
<LD>In a field near Salinas, two teams of workers move through the muddy
rows behind harvesters on a recent morning, scooping up heads of
lettuce, peeling off the bushy outer leaves and chopping off their
stumpy bottoms.</LD>
<LD>   Both are picking iceberg lettuce for their employer, Dole Fresh
Vegetables Inc. But while one team is carefully selecting the most
eye-pleasing specimens, the other is grabbing just about everything
in sight, even the smaller or misshapen heads that years ago would
have been left in the field.</LD>
<LD>   It's these leftovers that customers will eventually pay double
for, once they are washed, cut and sealed into plastic bags for sale
in the produce aisle as salad. Even as head lettuce prices recently
hit 12-year lows--the result of a flurry of new planting after the
spring lettuce shortage--bagged salad prices didn't budge.</LD>
<TE>   Salad prices have held relatively steady for years, as companies
such Dole Food Co. and its chief competitor, Fresh Express, which
together control about two-thirds of the $1.6-billion bagged salad
market, have determined how much consumers are willing to pay for
convenience.</TE>
<TE>   One of California's most volatile commodity crops is quickly
turning into a consumer good whose consistency is as predictable and
stable as floor wax or pretzels.</TE>
<TE>   "We're no longer in the farming business," said Tom Loveless, a
senior vice president with Fresh Express's parent, Dallas-based
Performance Food Group Co. Now, he said, "we sell a branded line of
products."</TE>
<TE>   A decade after the first bagged salads began landing on
supermarket shelves, these products use 40% of the lettuce grown in
the Salinas Valley, the nation's largest lettuce-growing region.</TE>
<TE>   At Dole, lettuce heads roll down an assembly line just like any
other packaged food before they are cut to size, mixed with
pre-measured spurts of other types of greens and cabbage, washed and
vacuum-packed. Some analysts contend that fresh fruits and vegetables
shouldn't be processed, sealed up and turned into slickly marketed
products, but others say consumers can't get enough. They want fresh
foods but expect it to be as convenient, safe and predictable as
anything they get out of a can or box.</TE>
<TE>   Big agricultural businesses that used to farm Monterey County's
rich but expensive land now are processors, buying and maintaining
expensive equipment and paying growers a set amount per season, per
pound. In Dole's case, a million bags of salad leave its docks here
every day, winding up in markets as far away as New York within five
days of harvest.</TE>
<TE>   It's a testament to how sophisticated the produce business has
become and which direction some of California's agriculture industry
could be headed as shippers of every commodity look for ways to cut,
mix or otherwise enhance their crops to turn a higher profit.</TE>
<TE>   In the Salinas Valley, the business system has evened out the
financial roller coaster for many growers.</TE>
<TE>   But the stability has its price. These contract growers don't gain
from big price spikes, such as those that benefited lettuce growers
in the Imperial Valley in March when cold weather drove prices to a
15-year high, said Gary Lucier, an economist with the U.S. Department
of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of insulates you from both the good and the bad."</TE>
<TE>   Some growers said they felt they had no choice but to turn to this
type of contract production, unable to compete with the clout and
marketing muscle of their larger competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "As other companies started getting larger like Dole ... and
gaining recognition all over the world, we found ourselves in a
less-than-competitive situation," said Ross Merrill of 70-year-old
Merrill Farms in Salinas, which sells all of its lettuce production
to Dole. "We looked around and said, 'How can we survive going
forward?' One way was growing for Dole."</TE>
<TE>   The ability to turn a predictable profit has made his bankers
happy, Merrill says, and it has allowed him to focus more on boosting
yields, rather than worrying about the timing of his crop and the
supply of lettuce headed to market.</TE>
<TE>   But the concentration in the salad business also makes him a
little nervous.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather see [most of] the business in the hands of three to
five people rather than two," primarily because it would provide
other markets for his production if Dole or Fresh Express decides to
lower prices paid to growers.</TE>
<TE>   Initially a hard sell, bagged salads have become a favorite of
supermarket retailers. The product is more lucrative than head
lettuce, requires less labor to maintain on the shelves and can be
kept on the shelf longer, thanks to its special packaging.</TE>
<TE>   Because consumers who buy bagged salad expect to pay more for the
convenience, manufacturers and retail chains don't feel the same
pressure to discount the items as they do bulk produce.</TE>
<TE>   At Colton-based Stater Bros. Markets there are 40 types of bagged
salad on the shelf and 135 types of bagged cut-up produce products
overall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's convenient," said Jack Brown, Stater Bros. chairman and
chief executive. "It's good for smaller households."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paying for Convenience</TE>
<TE>   And unlike a head of lettuce, which can sit in consumers' crispers
for six days and lose freshness, Brown says, a bagged salad can sit
for a couple of weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Shoppers routinely pay double for that kind of convenience. Dole
officials say most shoppers don't look to see how the price of bagged
salad relates to that of bulk lettuce.</TE>
<TE>   Dole's bagged iceberg typically sells for about $1.50 to $2 for a
one-pound bag. But its focus these days is mostly on the exotic leaf
lettuce blends, which retail closer to $3, sometimes for as little as
a 5-ounce bag.</TE>
<TE>   Dole and Fresh Express officials won't say how profitable the
bagged salad business is or how much they spend on marketing. But
competitors and government officials say they profit enough to
aggressively market their lines, giving away cases of free products
to stores and paying slotting fees to supermarkets to help their
salads get the best real estate in the produce aisle.</TE>
<TE>   These fees can range from $10,000 to a small retailer, according
to one USDA report, to $2 million to get into one of the country's
largest chains.</TE>
<TE>   The business of marketing these salads has become almost as
sophisticated as that of packaged foods, and just as secretive, given
the intense competition between Dole and Fresh Express--which both
claim to be No. 1 (Dole by units sold, Fresh Express by dollar
sales). Dole says that each year it introduces new blends, such as
the baby spinach salad it will introduce this fall, while
discontinuing slower-moving items so the number of items on
supermarket shelves remains fairly constant.</TE>
<TE>   But Dole Fresh Vegetable President Eric Schwartz acknowledges
having more ambitious plans in development.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still looking at other ways to get our name on products in
supermarkets."</TE>
<TE>   Loveless of Fresh Express said the company plans to begin selling
cut-up packaged fruit this fall, and he hinted at main-dish salads
with meat and seafood or other items that might eventually be sold.</TE>
<TE>   Some growers and brokers believe that the growth of these
convenience products will continue to eat up more space in the
produce aisle, leaving less room for inexpensive bulk fruits and
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Consumption Is Up</TE>
<TE>   Although to some extent they may be right, economists say, those
convenience products also are growing the market.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of bagged salads has helped boost per-capita
lettuce consumption in recent years to an all-time high last year of
33 pounds, just as the introduction of "baby" carrots as packaged
produce lifted carrot sales dramatically in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Brown of Stater Bros. said he is expanding the size of the produce
aisle in his new stores 25% to accommodate the growing number of
items. In old stores, the chain is adjusting racks and fixtures to
shoehorn in 450 fresh and packaged items.</TE>
<TE>   "Produce is the No. 1 reason why people choose a supermarket,"
Brown said. "If we don't do it right, we have no reason for being,"
he said, noting the intense competition from discounters such as
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Items such as bagged salad and baby carrots, which have become
lucrative products, were initially developed as a way to use produce
that would have been discarded because it was the wrong size or
shape.</TE>
<TE>   Trimmed down, cleaned up and bagged, these products look no
different to consumers from the leaves of the fully formed heads
harvested for the bulk-produce section.</TE>
<TE>   And unlike bulk lettuce, which is rinsed and wrapped in the field,
lettuce for bagged salad moves through an impressive germ-killing
gantlet.</TE>
<TE>   Moving along a conveyor belt at Dole's plant here, for example,
the loose salad first passes through a water and chlorine rinse, much
like a car wash. Then it is shot across the plant in a huge
liquid-filled tube before getting a third hose-down.</TE>
<TE>   It's tumbled in 250-pound metal drums to dry before being spit out
in pre-measured amounts into its packaging, with most of the air
sucked out and nitrogen added.</TE>
<TE>   The system isn't perfect, analysts say. It leaves some room for
contamination, and not all greens can endure the rigors of the
assembly line and weeks in an oxygen-free bag.</TE>
<TE>   Arugula, for instance, still won't work for bagged salad,
according to Dole research.</TE>
<TE>   "It just doesn't hold up," said Gil Oetzel, Dole's project manager
for research.</TE>
<TE>   Still, about 110 products are turned out of this plant, including
iceberg and endive, and special romaine and leaf lettuce blends.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is willing to be just a spoke in the Salinas
processing hub. Basil Mills, a grower-shipper in this valley for 45
years, still holds back about half of his production to sell on the
bulk market.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at the mercy of the market," Mills said. But, he said, he
prefers gambling on a bigger profit. "Year to year [the lettuce
market] can be bad or good. But if over time it didn't turn a good
profit, most of us wouldn't stay in this business."</TE>

<HD>Refinancing Surge Could Hit Some Bonds</HD>
<DH>Investing: A rush for lower interest rates may hurt mutual
funds that hold mortgage issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fixed-income investors who flocked to mortgage securities in search
of higher yields may see their returns suffer if the recent dip in
interest rates leads to a new wave of mortgage refinancings, as many
analysts expect.</LD>
<LD>   Mutual funds that invest in government-backed mortgage bonds have
posted a total return--interest plus price appreciation--of 6.1% this
year. That's "still solid ... although their performance has slipped
a bit in recent months," said Morningstar Inc. analyst Scott Berry.</LD>
<LD>   But when interest rates tumbled last week to lows not seen since
the early 1960s, lenders and investors were bracing for a new wave of
mortgage refinancing that was expected to push total mortgage volume
to the level of last year's record of $2.2 trillion, or even higher.</LD>
<TE>   Even though yields on Treasury securities had rebounded a bit by
late Friday, a key index of home mortgage rates ended the week at
6.22%.</TE>
<TE>   It's uncertain how long rates will remain at such levels. Interest
rates have been highly volatile since last fall, and many analysts
were saying last week that yields had fallen so low that investors
would be induced to pull money out of the bond market and invest it
in stocks instead. That could fuel further rises in Treasury yields.</TE>
<TE>   But if mortgage rates remain depressed long enough for home buyers
to refinance--some for the second or third time in a year--mutual
funds that hold mortgage bonds probably would see their returns slip.</TE>
<TE>   Government National Mortgage Assn. securities--known as Ginnie
Maes--that carry 7% yields are being refinanced at an annual rate of
at least 40%, bond fund managers said. That means older,
high-yielding securities are replaced with newer, lower-yielding
issues, pushing the yields on mortgage-bond funds to 5% or less.</TE>
<TE>   Even that's not such a bad yield these days, said Bill Powers, a
portfolio manager and managing director at Pacific Investment
Management Co. in Newport Beach. A fund with that much turnover in
its portfolio probably is best compared to a two-year Treasury bill,
Powers said, and two-year Treasuries are paying about 2.2%.</TE>
<TE>   But it's still far below what mortgage investors have become
accustomed to in the mutual funds that hold Ginnie Maes. These
securities, whose principal is guaranteed by the U.S. government,
have become tremendously popular because they "have offered a little
more yield than Treasuries and less volatility," Berry said. That
combination is so attractive that "a lot of bond investors use
mortgage bonds as their core government holding."</TE>
<TE>   Because the principal on these securities is secure and the yields
are higher than those on 10-year Treasury bonds, investors seeking
safety and yields sent a net inflow of $8 billion into Ginnie Mae
funds in 2001 and an additional $4.6 billion during the first half of
this year, said data firm Lipper Inc. Complete data for July aren't
available, but the inflows remained quite strong, Lipper research
analyst Martin Vostry said last week.</TE>
<TE>   But these investors increasingly have had to settle for less, as
homeowners replace higher-interest mortgages with lower-rate home
loans. In July 2000, the yield on the Vanguard GNMA Fund, the largest
holder of mortgage-backed securities, was 6.9%; it has slipped to
5.2%, Morningstar said. Fidelity's Ginnie Mae fund has seen its yield
decline from 6.6% to 4.8% in the same period.</TE>
<TE>   Another risk is that when interest rates eventually go back up,
the value of the mortgage securities paying lower interest will
decline--and they'll stay on the books because they won't be
refinanced. The only time since 1981 that the total return on the
Vanguard GNMA Fund posted a negative annual return was in 1994, when
the Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times, Berry said.</TE>
<TE>   Such a reversal seems unlikely these days, given the worrisome
weakness in the U.S. economy and the fragile nature of the equity
markets, which would be further spooked by a Fed-inspired spike in
interest rates. But many mortgage bond investors aren't fully aware
of how badly they could be whipsawed if rates rise, said Jeffrey E.
Gundlach, a senior fixed-income strategist at the TCW mutual fund
group.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think mortgage securities represent a good place to be,"
he said. "But sadly, the effect of lower rates is to make it a less
attractive place than it was."</TE>

<LD>The New York Times plans to begin publishing announcements of

<LD>   The announcements of formal gay and lesbian unions will begin next
month in the paper's Sunday Styles section, Howell Raines, executive

<LD>   "We acknowledge the newsworthiness of a growing and visible trend
in society toward public celebrations of commitment by gay and

Raines said.</LD>
<TE>   "We recognize that the society remains divided about the legal and
religious definition of marriage, and our news columns will remain
impartial in that debate, reporting fully on all points of view," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gay and lesbian couples featured in the paper will be selected by
editors under the same criteria used to choose the weddings: the
newsworthiness and accomplishments of the couples and their families,
Raines said.</TE>

<HD>Brazilian Officials to Meet With Lenders</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to ease Brazil's financial crisis, Brazilian officials
will meet Tuesday in New York with representatives of major U.S. and
foreign banks who are refusing to renew tens of billions of dollars
in loans to private Brazilian companies caught up in the crisis.</LD>
<LD>   At the meeting, arranged by interested U.S. officials, the
Brazilians hope to persuade the lenders to roll over existing loans
when they come due rather than insist on immediate repayment. The
Brazilians want to persuade the lenders that they can safely do so by
spelling out stringent actions the Brazilian government is taking to
keep the country afloat financially.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign lenders and investors have lost confidence in Brazil's
economic and financial prospects since an earlier crisis devastated
Argentina's economy. Also, some of the leading candidates running for
president in an October election have so far not indicated they would
follow the policies of the current administration, including its
tight fiscal and monetary actions.</LD>
<TE>   Brazil has been hit by a "contagion effect" from Argentina, a
banking source said. Banks that have suffered large losses in
Argentina want to reduce their exposure in Latin America. Thus, many
of the banks have been canceling lines of credit in Brazil. It could
not be learned Sunday the amount of credit that had been canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Major lenders, such as Citigroup and ABN AMRO of the Netherlands,
are expected to attend Tuesday's meeting. The site of the meeting was
not specified.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Department officials said Sunday they were aware of the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso plans to
meet today with each of the three candidates seeking to succeed him.
The failure of the candidates to fully endorse the stringent fiscal
and monetary policies agreed to by Cardoso, a former finance
minister, as condition for receiving $30 billion in aid from the
International Monetary Fund has further eroded international
confidence that Brazil's government and many of its major companies
would be able to continue to pay their debts.</TE>
<TE>   Marcos DePaiva, secretary for international affairs at Brazil's
Finance Ministry, said that Brazil's successful proposal to the IMF
for assistance was explicitly structured to address the issue of a
changing government by providing incentives for the next president to
continue the required policies.</TE>
<TE>   Just $3 billion of the $30 billion in IMF aid is to be distributed
soon, he said. Disbursement of $3 billion more would come only after
a review in November of Brazil's progress at keeping inflation low
and running a "primary budget surplus" equal to 3.75% of Brazil's
gross domestic product. A primary surplus counts all expenditures
except interest payments on government debt.</TE>
<TE>   A key incentive would be the gradual disbursement of the IMF funds
only after continued quarterly policy reviews, DePaiva said.</TE>

<HD>Leading Indicators Index to Be Released Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters, Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This week's most important economic report is set for release today:
the July index of leading economic indicators, a key gauge of
economic activity in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The index, issued by the Conference Board, a private research
firm, is expected to show a decline of between 0.4% and 0.5%,
according to economists.</LD>
<LD>   The index remained unchanged in June, amid signs that the U.S.
economy was pulling out of its recent slowdown. The recovery has been
fueled mainly by consumer spending, which represents two-thirds of
the economy. But since then the market piled on losses, carving out
fresh five-year lows in late July, and this, many fear, could hit the
economic recovery.</LD>
<TE>   Recent economic data painted a worsening picture, fueling a debate
on whether the economy would face a "double dip" or renewed
contraction after recovering from an economic slump.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve last week left interest rates unchanged but
warned of economic weakness, spurring a sell-off in the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   Also on tap are a number of second-tier economic reports.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street may cast an eye on international trade data for June,
coming Tuesday and expected to show a deficit of $37.29 billion
compared with $37.64 billion in May.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, investors get jobless claims figures for the week of
Aug. 17--the number of Americans filing for weekly first-time
unemployment benefits. The Fed keeps an eye on the labor market for
clues about the economy's health.</TE>
<TE>   The total number of people collecting jobless benefits has
declined after peaking in May at a weekly average of almost 3.8
million. Since July 1, continuing claims have averaged 3.53 million a
week, less than the 3.57-million average during the final three
months of last year, and a sign some unemployed workers may be
finding jobs.</TE>

<HD>Philip Morris Trial Set to Begin</HD>
<DH>Tobacco: The suit by a lung cancer patient will be the
first tried under new evidence rules set by the state Supreme Court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Newport Beach woman who contracted lung cancer after decades of
smoking is headed for trial against Philip Morris Cos. in a case that
could determine whether new rules of evidence in California tobacco
cases can help cigarette makers halt a string of disastrous courtroom
losses.</LD>
<LD>   Opening statements are scheduled for Tuesday in Los Angeles
Superior Court in the case brought by Betty Bullock, 63, who started
smoking in the 1950s at the age of 17 and was diagnosed with cancer
in February 2001. Bullock, whose favorite brands were Marlboros and
Benson &amp; Hedges, has accused Philip Morris of negligence, fraud and
making a defective product.</LD>
<LD>   Philip Morris has denied the claims. "We believe the evidence will
show that nothing Philip Morris did caused her to start or continue
smoking," said Maurice A. Leiter, a lawyer for Philip Morris.</LD>
<TE>   The Bullock case will be the first tried in California under
ground rules recently set by the state Supreme Court. As a result, it
is being watched closely by Wall Street and legal analysts as a test
of the industry's ability to defend itself successfully in what
probably is the country's most anti-smoking state.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court, in a pair of Aug. 5 rulings, reinstated two
tobacco cases that had been dismissed before trial. In the process,
the court declared that cigarette makers cannot be held liable for
statements or acts during a 10-year period when lawsuits against them
were banned in California.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling means that from now on, plaintiffs' lawyers can't cite
evidence of alleged industry misconduct from 1988, when the
Legislature imposed the lawsuit ban, until 1998, when it was
repealed.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the rulings, by barring some evidence used by
plaintiffs in the past, should be a boon to cigarette makers. But
it's not clear that it will make much difference.</TE>
<TE>   Since being stripped of its immunity from lawsuits in California,
the industry has been hit with three straight
mega-verdicts--reflecting jurors' reaction to documents suggesting
that cigarette makers had falsely disputed the risks of smoking and
sought to conceal and enhance the addictiveness of their products.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all such documents from 1988 through 1997 will be
removed from the plaintiffs' arsenal under the Supreme Court
decision. But the most potent of the inflammatory documents--from the
1950s, '60s, and '70s--will remain fair game.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Bullock and Philip Morris spent last week picking a
panel of 16 jurors and alternates, consisting of nine women and seven
men.</TE>
<TE>   All will hear the case, and the 12 jurors will be randomly
selected when deliberations are ready to start.</TE>
<TE>   Testimony before Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Warren L.
Ettinger could last six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Among witnesses expected to appear is Sir Richard Doll, 89, a
British epidemiologist who in the early 1950s co-authored
ground-breaking research on the link between smoking and lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris, the world's biggest tobacco company, will be
represented by lawyers from Arnold &amp; Porter, including Leiter and
Peter Bleakley.</TE>
<TE>   Bullock lawyer Michael Piuze previously represented lung cancer
victim Richard Boeken, whose case brought the industry's worst defeat
at the hands of an individual smoker. In June 2001, a Los Angeles
jury ordered Philip Morris to pay Boeken $5 million in compensatory
and $3 billion in punitive damages (the trial judge later trimmed the
punitive award to $100 million).</TE>
<TE>   Piuze said Bullock had believed "the tobacco industry's lies for
many decades" and "was horrified that Philip Morris admitted that its
cigarettes caused lung cancer at around the same time that she was
diagnosed with lung cancer."</TE>
<TE>   "Before Mrs. Bullock dies ... she'd like to do whatever she can to
help Philip Morris get its just deserts," Piuze said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Supreme Court decision does not appear to be a
significant barrier to Bullock and other plaintiffs, it could
jeopardize the previous verdicts, which used some documents and other
exhibits from the period of the lawsuit ban. Retrials could be
ordered if it is found that the verdicts were influenced by evidence
that should not have been admitted.</TE>
<TE>   In the first of the cases, in March 1999 a San Francisco jury
ordered Philip Morris to pay Patricia Henley, a longtime Marlboro
smoker, compensatory and punitive damages of $51.5 million--later
reduced by the trial judge to $26.5 million. An appeals court upheld
the award, and the case is now before the state Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds were ordered
to pay $21.7 million to Leslie J. Whiteley of Ojai, who died shortly
after the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   And last June, in the first tobacco case ever tried in Los Angeles
County, a Superior Court jury awarded more than $3 billion to Boeken,
who has since died.</TE>

<HD>Simple Sneakers Are Still In</HD>
<DH>Price, style help retro athletic shoes make inroads into
the market</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW KRAMER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Matt Nybo, a 13-year-old with spiked blond hair, came to the downtown
Lloyd Center Mall looking for a sports shoe--but not the latest Nike
Shox or Reebok Answer V.</LD>
<LD>   "I like the original shoes, the way things used to be," he said,
turning up his nose at a rack of shiny new basketball shoes at a Foot
Locker store. The newer shoes were too gimmicky, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "The new things coming out, there's a zipper over the laces. I
like the simpler shoes," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Teenagers across the country more and more are rejecting
ultramodern-looking 2002 athletic shoes in favor of what are called
"old school" sneakers in the styles of the 1970s and '80s.</TE>
<TE>   In an industry-shaking development that began with trend-setting
collectors in Japan, the throwback niche now accounts for about 25%
of the $5-billion global sports shoe market.</TE>
<TE>   Nybo settled on an old school pair of white Nike Air Force Ones
that cost $74.</TE>
<TE>   Companies have brought back dozens of sneaker styles that first
appeared years ago to capitalize on the demand.</TE>
<TE>   Shoes such as the Nike Cortez, the Converse Weapon, Adidas'
Copenhagen or Reebok's Aztec II hark back to sports stars of the
1970s and '80s and are bought for style over performance.</TE>
<TE>   Some fashion watchers say the trend is a rebellion against
technology or a desire to return to a seemingly simpler era in sports
and culture. Price also is a factor--most of the retro shoes are
priced under $100, compared with $160 for top-of-the-line shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very important trend right now," said Eric Oberman,
spokesman for the basketball shoe division at Nike Inc. The world's
largest athletic footwear maker, Nike is based in the Portland suburb
of Beaverton.</TE>
<TE>   Major U.S. distributor Foot Locker Inc. expanded its classic shoe
rack from about one-sixth to one-half of the total display for men's
athletic shoes three months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Nike rival Reebok International Ltd., based in Canton, Mass.,
believes that up to 30% of the U.S. athletic shoe market is in retro
styles, said Steve Gardner, who directs Reebok's classics division.</TE>
<TE>   And old school is the newest thing on a much bigger scale in some
markets.</TE>
<TE>   Retro sales comprise 40% to 45% of the athletic shoe business in
Los Angeles, New York, Miami and some countries such as Britain and
Japan, Gardner said.</TE>
<TE>   Industry watchers say the trend got traction in Europe and Japan.
Trendsetters bought used athletic shoes over the Internet; used shoes
still trade briskly on EBay.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the only business in Japan" for athletic shoes, Gardner
said.</TE>
<TE>   The popularity of old styles is proving serendipitous for
shoemakers. In recent years, profits have been down because of slack
sales of top-priced shoes such as the Nike Shox.</TE>
<TE>   Robert S. Drbul, an athletic footwear analyst with Lehman Bros. in
New York, said the volume of "mid-priced" shoes under $100, including
most retro shoes, have buoyed sales this year.</TE>
<TE>   In the retro category, design costs were taken care of years ago.
Companies also haven't invested in heavy marketing blitzes that are
typical with modern shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Retro shoes sell briskly with the primary market of teenage boys,
but also among older buyers. Some owned the shoes the first time
around, and enjoy finding clean, sweet-smelling new pairs for sale
today.</TE>
<TE>   "In some cases, people have an emotional attachment to when they
first bought the shoe," said Nike's Oberman. "They say, 'I was
playing high school basketball when that shoe came out. I loved it.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Nike rolled out the Cortez in 1972, soon after founder Phil Knight
started selling shoes out of his trunk at University of Oregon track
meets. Co-founder Bill Bowerman invented the shoe's waffle sole by
pouring polyurethane into his wife's waffle iron.</TE>
<TE>   Nike spokeswoman Joani Komlos said the company continues to
emphasize innovation in shoe design but isn't opposed to selling the
old styles, too.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a vault of 30 years of great Nike designs," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nike does not release sales figures for specific shoes and
declined to discuss market share for retro products.</TE>
<TE>   German rival Adidas said 20% to 30% of global sales are in its
"originals" division.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not jumping on the retro bandwagon," said Nicole
Vollebregt, spokeswoman for Adidas America, also based in Beaverton.
"Adidas originals have been a part of our business for decades now."</TE>
<TE>   The company's Rod Laver and Stan Smith tennis shoes, named after
the 1960s and '70s tennis greats, are flying off the shelves this
summer, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But they aren't technically retro because they sold in limited
quantity all along, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Converse has benefited with its canvas, ultra-retro
Chuck Taylor All Stars, sold unchanged for decades. More than 500
million pairs reportedly have been sold since 1917.</TE>

<HD>Sprint May Cut Its Dividend to Conserve Cash</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Long-distance carrier could use that money to help
pay interest on $20.3 billion in debt, investors say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sprint Corp. may cut its dividend, among the highest in the
telecommunications industry, to conserve cash as a decline in
long-distance sales makes it harder to repay debt, investors said.</LD>
<LD>   Sprint paid $226 million in dividends in the first half, three
times its net income of $72 million in the same period. Its annual
yield--the dividend as a percentage of share price--of 4.27% is the
second-highest among its peers after that paid by Verizon
Communications Inc., Bloomberg data show.</LD>
<LD>   The third-largest U.S. long-distance phone company, buffeted by
six quarters of sales declines at its main phone unit, may use that
cash to help pay interest on debt totaling $20.3 billion at the end
of June, investors said. Rival AT&amp;T Corp. cut its dividend in 2000,
and WorldCom Inc. in July said it wouldn't pay a dividend on shares
that track its consumer unit.</LD>
<TE>   Sprint "may have to reduce or eliminate the dividend," said Paul
Wright, an analyst at Loomis Sayles &amp; Co. He said his firm is holding
Sprint stock on speculation it will become a takeover target, and
"not because of the dividend."</TE>
<TE>   Telecommunications companies, with historically stable revenue,
often have paid higher dividends than companies in other industries.
Those payments can help make stock alluring to investors when shares
are down. Sprint's stock has fallen 50% in the last year and Friday
rose 96 cents to $11.71 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</TE>
<TE>   Dividends paid by phone-service providers listed on the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index offer an average yield of 3.5%. Those paid by
packaged-food companies average 2.86% and those paid by oil companies
have a 2.8% yield, according to Bloomberg data.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint Chief Financial Officer Robert Dellinger said in an
interview last month that he had no plans to cut the dividend and
that the company has enough money to repay the $1.4 billion of debt
coming due in the next 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Banks revised the terms of as much as $1.1 billion in loans,
reducing the likelihood that Sprint will have to repay them early,
the company said this month.</TE>
<TE>   Although the moves bode well for Sprint now, Dellinger and Chief
Executive William Esrey may choose down the road to trim the dividend
to stave off a cash crunch, shareholders said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can certainly see liquidity concerns producing cuts" to the
dividend, said John Maloney, chief executive of M&amp;R Capital
Management Inc., a holder of Sprint shares.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint said in June that 2002 sales at its phone business would
fall at a "mid-single-digit" percentage rate, instead of the
"low-single-digit rate" previously forecast.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's in June also lowered its rating on Sprint debt
by two levels to BBB-, the lowest investment grade, from BBB+.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service in June downgraded Sprint's debt to one
level above junk, citing concern that the company may not generate
enough cash to pay debts. Moody's also lowered its outlook on Sprint
to negative.</TE>
<TE>   The $226 million in dividends that Sprint paid in the first half
represents almost one-third of the company's $699 million in interest
payments in the same period, earnings statements show.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint would have added incentive to reduce dividends in the event
it falters in its efforts to sell the Yellow Pages directory unit,
investors said. The company has said the sale could raise more than
$2 billion after taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Sprint rivals also are paying high dividends, luring some fund
managers and investors. Verizon, the largest U.S. local telephone
company, had a dividend yield of 4.86% during the last year. SBC
Communications Inc.'s was 3.67%, and BellSouth Corp.'s was 2.99%.</TE>
<TE>   Local-phone service providers are insulated from some of the
pressures facing long-distance companies and are less likely to trim
their dividends to save cash, investors said. Sprint and its peers
have been forced to slash prices for long-distance calls as consumers
rely more on e-mail and mobile phones and as businesses fire workers
and spend less on phone services.</TE>
<TE>   Dividends for companies such as Verizon, SBC and BellSouth "are
very sustainable," said Rick Franklin, an analyst at Banc of America
Capital Management, owner of shares of all three companies. "Their
balance sheets and cash flows are strong. The cushion for Sprint
isn't as great."</TE>

<HD>Rally Spurring Belief Bear Market Is Over</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Evidence leads more experts to think bottom
has been hit. But risks still exist.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index notching four straight winning
weeks for the first time in more than a year, the stock market rally
is gaining more believers.</LD>
<LD>   July's spikes in mutual fund redemptions, trading volume and key
gauges of investor fear increasingly appear, in retrospect, to have
been the "grand capitulation" that analysts had been awaiting to
signal that the long bear market had run its course.</LD>
<LD>   The chart pattern of major indexes in recent weeks--an upward
course of "higher highs and higher lows"--looks bullish from a
technical standpoint, analysts say: It shows that investors are less
eager to sell on any advance and more willing to buy on any dip.</LD>
<TE>   From its five-year low reached July 23, the S&amp;P 500 has gained
16.4%. Small-and mid-cap stock indexes have posted more modest gains,
but they weren't as beaten down as blue chips at the July lows.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more optimistic than I've been in years. If we don't get any
climactic bad news, then we've seen the lows for some time," said Bob
Dickey, managing director at Minneapolis brokerage RBC Dain Rauscher.
"I think we're back to making money in the market, just not at the
pace of the late 1990s. That was a bubble we'll probably never see
again."</TE>
<TE>   The recent trend of sharp gains late in the trading session also
is a positive sign, Dickey said. It suggests rising confidence among
short-term market players.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were encouraged by last week's trading, which saw stocks
fade Tuesday after the Federal Reserve warned of the risk of an
economic slowdown, but then storm back Wednesday as the deadline for
corporate chiefs to certify their companies' financial results passed
with few surprises. The S&amp;P 500 gained 2.2% for the week, while the
Nasdaq composite jumped 4.2%.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense, the market has reacted to itself," said Don Cassidy,
senior research analyst at fund tracker Lipper Inc. in Denver. "It
didn't get too discouraged about the Fed release, and people started
saying, 'Hmm, maybe I'll buy a little more stock.' "</TE>
<TE>   Cassidy said July's net outflow from stock mutual funds, which
Lipper expects to have exceeded last September's record $30 billion
when results are reported later this month, looks in retrospect like
the kind of "panic selling" that often accompanies a market bottom.
He said even conservative fund categories had net outflows (that is,
redemptions exceeding new money invested).</TE>
<TE>   "I think we had the grand capitulation that everyone has been
looking for," Cassidy said.</TE>
<TE>   Stock fund outflows have continued in August, but at a far slower
pace, said AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif., which makes weekly
estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Another gauge of investor sentiment, the VIX index, which measures
investor fear levels by tracking purchases of blue-chip stock "put"
and "call" options, reached its most bearish point of the year July
23.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the VIX often has spiked at market bottoms as fear
reached a peak.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, despite paltry yields, $2.3 trillion sits in money
market mutual funds, and trillions more are in low-yielding bank
savings accounts. Analysts say that if even a small portion of that
cash enters the market, it could fuel a rally.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the encouraging signs, the market faces risks from several
directions, Dickey and others warn. If the U.S. economy slips back
into recession or investor confidence is jolted again by corporate
scandal, war or renewed terrorism, the market easily could head down
in a hurry, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Fed signaled that it stands poised to cut rates again
if needed to thwart recession, skeptics note that rates already are
at 40-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't clear how much more help the economy would get from lower
rates.</TE>
<TE>   Stock valuations remain steeper than usual for a bear market
bottom: By many estimates, the S&amp;P 500 trades for about 18 to 20
times estimated 2002 operating earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Historians also note that since 1971, September has been the
weakest month, on average, for all three major U.S. indexes--the Dow
Jones industrial average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite.</TE>
<TE>   "Traders coming back from the end of summer vacation often tend to
clean house," said Jeffrey Hirsch, publisher of the Stock Trader's
Almanac in Old Tappan, N.J. Also, Hirsch said, quarterly adjustments
by mutual funds--also known as portfolio "window dressing"--add
selling pressure as money managers unload losing stocks before Sept.
30.</TE>
<TE>   Seasonal weakness could set the stage for a retest of the July 23
market lows, Hirsch said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting pretty bullish, but we're not rushing in," he said.
"I'd feel much more confident after we get through September."</TE>
<TE>   More immediately, stocks may begin to meet what market technicians
call "overhead resistance." That's when investors who bought shares
at higher prices begin to see a rally as a chance to exit.</TE>
<TE>   The mentality, Dickey said, is that a rebound is an opportunity to
cut one's losses.</TE>
<TE>   For the Dow, which fell 40.08 points Friday to 8,778.06 but added
0.4% for the week, resistance is in the 8,800 range, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Dow could face a choppy ride in the near term, Dickey
said he expects it to break through 8,800 and surge to about 9,500 in
the next month or two.</TE>
<TE>   Although July 23 might prove to be the low of the bear market that
began in March 2000, Hirsch cautions that trying to pinpoint market
bottoms can be hard.</TE>
<TE>   In 1974, for example, at the end of a similarly brutal bear
market, stocks appeared to hit bottom in October, but the Dow's
actual low came Dec. 6, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Only two kinds of people can call the exact bottom--a liar or
someone who gets lucky."</TE>

<HD>Electronic Data Can Help Unlock Criminals' Secrets</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: But learning how to find the files and
preserve them can be tricky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CONNIE CASS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not since the glory days of letter-writing, before the advent of the
telephone, have people committed so much revealing stuff to written
form as they do in the age of computers.</LD>
<LD>   All those e-mail messages and electronic files are a treasure
trove of evidence for law enforcement officers, whether they are
targeting terrorists, crooked CEOs or local drug dealers.</LD>
<LD>   The challenge for police and prosecutors is learning how to dig up
and preserve these electronic gems.</LD>
<TE>   "Any agent can come in and look through papers, but not every
agent can do a thorough computer search," said David Green, deputy
chief of the Justice Department's computer crime section, which helps
train federal and state investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Green teaches that a mistake as simple as turning off a computer
can wipe away valuable evidence. Knowing such basics, and the ins and
outs of privacy law, is essential when electronic evidence may play a
role in so many cases.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the gift that keeps on giving," said Tom Greene, a
deputy attorney general in California, one of the states suing
Microsoft Corp. in an antitrust case built largely on computer
messages. "People are so chatty in e-mail."</TE>
<TE>   E-mail revealed the shredding of documents at Arthur Andersen and
exposed Merrill Lynch analysts condemning stocks as a "disaster" or a
"dog" while publicly touting them to investors.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-American sentiments in messages Taliban fighter John Walker
Lindh and shoe bomb suspect Richard Reid sent to their mothers were
gathered as evidence against them.</TE>
<TE>   And when Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl was kidnapped
and killed in Pakistan, investigators used e-mails from his abductors
to track them down.</TE>
<TE>   When drug dealers are arrested, police search their electronic
organizers and cell phones for associates' names and telephone
numbers. When someone is accused of molesting a child, his computer
is searched for child pornography. When a company is sued, it can be
forced to turn over thousands of employee messages.</TE>
<TE>   "E-mail has become the place where everybody loves to look," said
Irwin Schwartz, president of the National Assn. of Criminal Defense
Lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is that computer data is difficult to destroy. Just
clicking "delete" won't do it, as Oliver North learned during the
1980s Iran-Contra probe, one of the earliest investigations to rely
on backup copies of electronic messages.</TE>
<TE>   Deleted files can linger, hidden on a computer's hard drive until
that space is overwritten with new information.</TE>
<TE>   "The best way to get rid of computer data is to take the hard
drive and pound it with a hammer and throw it in a furnace," said
John Patzakis, president of Guidance Software, which makes forensic
software that helps police find hidden files.</TE>
<TE>   Even that might not work with e-mail, which investigators also may
be able to track down in an employee's office server, stored by
Internet service providers or in the recipient's computer.</TE>
<TE>   To go hunting through computer data, law officers need a search
warrant issued by a judge. Winning legal permission to eavesdrop on
e-mail as it's transmitted is more difficult because that is
considered the same as wiretapping a telephone.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators generally need a court order based on probable cause
that the wiretap will reveal evidence of a felony.</TE>

<HD>PC Relocator Makes Moving Files a Snap</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK BAJAK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I think my mother must have had the original computer. Or at least
pieces of it.</LD>
<LD>   She'd been a cautious upgrader through the years. It wouldn't do
just to buy a new box.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, she favored swapping out parts as needed. It got to where
her Cyrix 686-based system had all the zip of a three-toed sloth
rolling a wheelchair underwater.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, she got new investment management software that
absolutely required a bottom-up upgrade.</TE>
<TE>   Mom was the perfect candidate for Alohabob's PC Relocator, now in
version 4.0.</TE>
<TE>   This program from a 3-year-old Sunrise, Fla., company called
Eisenworld fills an enormous need that Microsoft Corp. has neglected:
helping us painlessly transfer our files and settings from a dying
machine to a new one.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's XP ships with the ever-unreliable File and Settings
Transfer Wizard. Some wizard. It's like Merlin with a rubber wand.
Flaccid. I've tried it several times.</TE>
<TE>   PC Relocator, by contrast, keeps getting better. The $49.95
software is not flawless but pretty darn complete. Eisenworld is
promising a range of variations--from a stripped-down basic to an
enterprise version--for October.</TE>
<TE>   What PC Relocator does, in addition to moving files and
applications, is transfer and merge software settings to your new
PC's registry, or basic instruction database, without altering the
old PC.</TE>
<TE>   The program is designed, additionally, not to overwrite any
software drivers on the new system.</TE>
<TE>   So off I go. First I connect both machines--I'll call them Sloth
(the no-name Cyrix 686) and Screamer (with a 2.26-gigahertz Intel
processor and 80-gigabyte hard drive)--to my home Ethernet network.</TE>
<TE>   You also can use a parallel cable (the slowest means, 1 gigabyte
in two to five hours) or Universal Serial Bus port (1 gigabyte per
hour). Or you can "hotel" the data in intermediate media such as
CD-RW discs or external hard drives.</TE>
<TE>   My advice: Get networked. Everything's faster.</TE>
<TE>   I install PC Relocator on both machines and perform one bit of
housekeeping before I start my transfer: Because Sloth (running
Windows 98) had three partitions among two separate hard drives I run
PowerQuest's Partition Magic utility on Screamer, creating three
partitions on its single hard drive.</TE>
<TE>   If, like most people, you've got only one hard-disk partition (C
Drive) on your old PC, you won't need to do this.</TE>
<TE>   Here's where the fun begins.</TE>
<TE>   New features in PC Relocator give you the option of separately
transferring your applications, user profile, settings and
preferences and documents and other files. Then you can choose
individual settings, applications and files.</TE>
<TE>   Some--very few--programs and files didn't transfer.</TE>
<TE>   But everything else did beautifully--480 megabytes' worth of data
moved to their new home in 11 minutes and 31 seconds.</TE>

<DH>Head of Sony's PlayStation business in N. America discusses
the console's next step</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Technology titans Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp. last week unveiled
more details of their plans to take their game consoles online,
adding to the months of chest-thumping by both companies.</LD>
<LD>   The noise will only grow as the two companies head into the
holiday season, when half of the industry's annual sales occur. Sony
will fire the opening shot this month when it releases an Internet
adapter for its PlayStation 2 consoles. The $39.99 device will come
with a free game, "Twisted Metal Black Online," to whet consumers'
appetites for online play, which will at first involve playing
opponents over the Internet and eventually include downloading
everything from additional game content to music and video.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft is set to follow in November with a $49.95 starter kit
for its Xbox console that will have a headset, a mini-game and a
one-year subscription to its proprietary online network. In 2004, the
company is expected to charge $9.95 a month for the service, sources
said.</LD>
<TE>   Each company plans to launch more than a dozen games that will
have online features by the end of the year, and their efforts will
be backed by millions of dollars in marketing hype.</TE>
<TE>   But beneath the glam of online games are some decidedly
unattractive numbers. Microsoft's internal expectations are tens of
thousands of subscribers this year and only several hundred thousand
subscribers next year.</TE>
<TE>   Sony plans to ship just 400,000 adapters this year in North
America. That means Sony expects just 3% of PS2 owners to buy the
device.</TE>
<TE>   Kazuo "Kaz" Hirai, the 41-year-old head of Sony's Play- Station
business in North America, discussed the future of the console market
as Sony envisions it.</TE>
<TE>   Question: You've set a target of shipping 400,000 adapters in the
United States by the end of the year. Are those numbers really
indicative of a mainstream technology?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Against an install base of 11 million PS2 units, 400,000
doesn't sound like very much. But the largest online game community
in the United States is "Everquest" with 425,000 subscribers. The
numbers may seem small, but it's a very large community by online
standards. Is that mainstream? I don't think it is. But you need to
start somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: When will PlayStation users be able to download music and
movies?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's always been one of Sony's visions that the Play- Station 2
play not only games but also movies and music. That's something we
already accomplished to some degree. The PS2 plays DVD movies and
music CDs right out of the box.</TE>
<TE>   As for downloading, the technology is already there to actually do
that. So now it becomes a matter of managing the copyrights, coming
up with a viable business model for content providers and waiting for
broadband Internet access to become more mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How would you define mainstream?</TE>
<TE>   A: For it to really be considered mainstream, we're talking
penetration of 40% to 50% or above. I live in Foster City, and we
can't get even DSL. In some places, the service isn't even offered.
It's no secret that some people expected broadband penetration to be
higher than it actually turned out to be. There's also demand. There
are people who are happy with what they're getting through dial-up
analog. So it will take some time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: PlayStation 3 is already in the works, and Sony has said it is
working with IBM Corp. and Toshiba Corp. to design a processor for
the new machine that will be as much as 1,000 times more powerful
than the PS2 and built for broadband networking. What can you tell
us?</TE>
<TE>   A: Generally, any future platforms will have to take advantage of
a networked environment as a basis for that platform. One of the
things we always strived for with the PlayStation was to offer a
cutting-edge platform that has as few limitations as possible for
content creators to express themselves, whether it's real-time
photo-realistic rendering or whatever.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: How will the online aspect affect your business model?</TE>
<TE>   A: It means there's an added layer of complexity to the business.
If you have an offline game, the consumers buy it at the store and
they take it home. There, you only have to deal with one-off consumer
issues such as returns, scratched discs and so on. With online, the
consumer buying the disc is only the entry point. Now you need to
support their playing it as well, and you need to support it [24
hours a day, seven days a week]. So that adds a level of complexity
to the business that we didn't have in the offline environment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Synergy has become a dirty word lately, especially with
conglomerates such as AOL Time Warner Inc. and Vivendi Universal
running into financial problems and trying to make their media empire
fit together. What do you think of synergy?</TE>
<TE>   A: If you're talking within Sony, we're consistently in touch with
other Sony companies--Sony Music, Sony Online Entertainment, Sony
Pictures--to explore ways to cross-market and cross-sell each other's
products. Unfortunately, synergy has gotten a bad rap lately because
you had forced synergy. And that never works. To give you an example,
we're always looking for music tracks for our games. Our first call
would be Sony Music. If what they have fits, that's great. If,
however, there was no artist that was appropriate at Sony Music, we
don't hesitate to go to other companies. At the end of the day, when
you start forcing that stuff, it usually doesn't work. I'm all for
synergy, but if one party thinks it doesn't work, then it's time to
wait for the next opportunity.</TE>

his contract expires at the end of next year, sources with knowledge
of the situation said.</LD>
<LD>   A renewal of Karmazin's contract would be applauded by Wall
Street, which considers Viacom among the best run and financially
sound media companies, in part because of Karmazin's strong
management. With most rivals plagued by operating difficulties, debt
crises, questionable accounting, or management upheaval, Viacom has
in recent months surpassed Vivendi Universal and AOL Time Warner Inc.
as the world's most valuable entertainment conglomerate, even though
its own stock has declined 10% over the last year.</LD>
<LD>   If Karmazin were to stay at Viacom, which is by no means certain,
it would be a surprise ending to one of the most public corporate
power struggles in recent memory. Tensions between Karmazin and his
boss, Viacom Chairman and Chief Executive Sumner Redstone, have
loomed over the company since the two became a team in mid-2000.</LD>
<TE>   Karmazin, 58, has been widely expected to leave Viacom when his
contract expires in December 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Reached at the Bel-Air Hotel on Sunday, Redstone refused to
comment. A Viacom spokesman said that Karmazin also declined to
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Karmazin became Redstone's second-in-command as part of a merger
between Viacom and CBS Corp., where Karmazin was chief executive. In
addition to CBS and its billboard and Infinity Broadcasting radio
groups, Viacom owns MTV, BET, Nickelodeon, Paramount Pictures, UPN
and Blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   The two executives have had difficulty sharing power from the
start. The conflict became public and was so disruptive to Viacom's
stock that in January independent board members intervened, ordering
Karmazin and Redstone to reconcile their differences for the good of
the company.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no public eruptions between Redstone and Karmazin
since then, and the executives agreed to table any discussion about
the issue until the end of this year. At that time, Viacom would
announce that Karmazin has a new contract or would leave the company
when his existing contract expires.</TE>
<TE>   But just last week, at two dinners with a dozen investors in New
York and Boston, Redstone said he was "hopeful that a deal would be
struck" with Karmazin, according to executives present.</TE>
<TE>   News of Redstone's remarks set off a new wave of speculation on
Wall Street that Karmazin would be staying put.</TE>
<TE>   "Sumner realizes that Mel has enormous value and significant
contributions to make to this company," said one guest at a dinner
hosted by investment banker Gerard Klauer Mattison. "But Sumner is
not willing to give up his role. So, the task of this [special board]
committee is to find a way for everybody to end up with roles and
responsibilities they're personally comfortable with."</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the conflict are the broad powers that Karmazin
negotiated as part of the CBS-Viacom merger. Karmazin has complete
authority over the company's day-to-day operations, including the
power to hire and fire executives without Redstone's approval. He
also cannot be ousted from the company without a two-thirds vote of
the board, which consists of an equal number of CBS and Viacom
directors.</TE>
<TE>   Under the merger agreement, Redstone will be allowed to
restructure the board next May. Some believe he could reduce its size
in a way that could undercut Karmazin and even oust him from the
company.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, however, Redstone has softened his position,
sources say, because he is mindful of Karmazin's reputation on Wall
Street, and he is now willing to allow Karmazin to stay on as long as
he relinquishes some of his authority.</TE>
<TE>   Redstone, 79, who controls more than 60% of Viacom's stock, makes
no secret that he wants to regain control of the company and have the
power to fire Karmazin if he so desires. These sources say that the
newly formed board committee will approach Karmazin about narrowing
the scope of his powers, including giving up majority board
protection.</TE>
<TE>   One factor in Redstone's moderating position toward Karmazin,
according to sources familiar with the situation, is the instability
at the top of rival media companies including AOL, Vivendi and Walt
Disney Co. Recent management upheaval has punished stocks of these
companies, a reminder to Redstone of the negative effect such drastic
changes could bring to Viacom.</TE>
<TE>   But the turmoil elsewhere in the industry could give Karmazin
leverage in his negotiations with Viacom, some analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation has mounted in recent weeks that Disney chief Michael
Eisner could be vulnerable because of the company's sagging stock
price and underperformance at its theme parks and ABC network.
Karmazin's name has been circulating as a possible successor to
Eisner, and some large Disney investors have been lobbying directors
about such a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Mel would get more power, not less, because he could go anywhere
and run the show," said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch. "He would have his pick of jobs. If he went to AOL Time
Warner, the stock would double or triple."</TE>
<TE>   She predicts that Viacom's stock would take a temporary 15% to 20%
hit if Karmazin leaves.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom stock closed Friday at $42 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Redstone would be unlikely to risk having Karmazin show up at a
rival media company.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Karmazin would not be free until his current contract
expires.</TE>
<TE>   The special board committee, which was set up within the last
month, is led by board director Ivan Seidenberg, co-chief executive
of Verizon Communications; David T. McLaughlin, chairman of Orion
Safety Products; and William Schwartz, a lawyer with Cadwalader,
Wickersham &amp; Taft.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say it's unclear whether the committee can strike a
compromise pact agreeable to both Karmazin and Redstone.</TE>
<TE>   So far the committee members have just been talking among
themselves, and have had no formal meetings with either Redstone or
Karmazin, Viacom sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not Karmazin stays, sources inside Viacom say Redstone
would like to reinstate an executive committee at the company similar
to one that pre-dated the CBS merger.</TE>
<TE>   Some Viacom managers have warmed up to Karmazin after initially
being put off by his combative and bottom-line-oriented style.
Company sources say Karmazin, a radio entrepreneur and inveterate
advertising salesman, has mellowed over the last two years and
adjusted to managing some of Viacom's more creative managers. A
compulsive workaholic who had lived across the street from CBS
headquarters, Karmazin has been married, bought a vacation house and
seems more relaxed since the merger, according to some Viacom
executives.</TE>
<TE>   Redstone spends about 60% of his time in New York and 40% in Los
Angeles and recently purchased a $14.5-million house from actor
Sylvester Stallone in the posh Westside neighborhood of Beverly Park,
where a number of other entertainment industry figures also reside.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi CEO Confident of Company's Recovery</HD>
<DH>Media: Board agrees to conditions with banks for $2 billion
in funding that would prevent an imminent cash crunch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The head of Vivendi Universal said Sunday he was confident the media
giant would pull through its crisis, with a $2-billion funding deal
with banks set to be finalized by the end of September.</LD>
<LD>   Jean-Rene Fourtou, appointed chairman and chief executive last
month after Jean-Marie Messier was ousted in a boardroom coup, said
in a letter to employees and shareholders that all options remained
open on how the indebted company would be restructured.</LD>
<LD>   However, a plan unveiled last week to sell about $10 billion in
assets will not include stakes in Vivendi Environnement, Cegetel,
Universal Music Group, Vivendi Universal Entertainment or Vivendi's
non-U.S. publishing activities, Fourtou said, responding to media
speculation.</LD>
<TE>   "I would like to reassure you ... the group's situation is
certainly strained, but I have identified the methods of getting out
of this crisis and the routes to recovery," Fourtou said.</TE>
<TE>   "The road remains strewn with pitfalls but I am absolutely
convinced that we will succeed," he said in the three-page letter,
which was also sent to the media.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi shares plummeted 45% to devastating new lows last week
after the group unveiled a $12-billion net loss for the first half
due to goodwill write-downs and provisions, triggering downgrades to
its stock and credit ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Jittery for months over the debt-laden company, investors took
fright last week over Vivendi's precarious cash position and the lack
of a clear plan for its post-Messier future.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou, who is due to finalize his asset sale plans by a Sept. 25
board meeting, said Sunday that Vivendi's board had agreed to
conditions with banks for $2 billion in emergency funding, on top of
an already-agreed-on $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The legal conditions and the commitments sought by the banks were
accepted by the board on Aug. 13 and signed by myself. Everything
should be in place by the end of September at the latest," Fourtou
said.</TE>
<TE>   That loan would prevent an imminent cash crunch but would not
solve all the company's problems.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi said last week it had refinancing needs totaling $5.5
billion between now and the end of March 2003.</TE>

<HD>Davis vs. C. Montgomery Burns: The Gov Has More Hair</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who knows--by now they may have been pink-slipped by the reportedly
poll-slipping Bill Simon gubernatorial campaign, which has laid off
two dozen of its employees. But before they left--or didn't
leave--some of them circulated a comparison between Gov. Gray Davis
and C. Montgomery Burns, the malevolent nuclear power plant owner and
onetime candidate for governor on the "The Simpsons."</LD>
<LD>   Comparisons include:</LD>
<LD>   Source of wealth: energy company (Burns); energy companies, other
special interests (Davis).</LD>
<TE>   Favorite saying: "Excellent." (Burns); "Implement my vision."
(Davis' still-stinging description of the role of Democratic
legislators).</TE>
<TE>   Qualities: greed, malice (Burns); greed, blind ambition, low
handicap (Davis).</TE>
<TE>   Burns' gubernatorial campaign, it notes, was "derailed by Blinky
the three-eyed fish," a terato-genetic horror from nuclear-polluted
waters, and it hints of other Blinkys "in waters polluted by Gray
Davis," a reference to a San Jose Mercury-News report that a board
with Davis appointees approved the release of refinery toxins into
San Francisco Bay after the refinery donated $70,000 to the Davis
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Kid Hears Radio Ad, Tells Dad to Pass Budget</TE>
<TE>   No wonder politicians spend so much money on electronic media
"buys"--they work.</TE>
<TE>   Paid radio ads have been airing around the state urging listeners
to call Republicans in the state Assembly and lean on them to pass a
budget.</TE>
<TE>   Why, four children not even old enough to vote were in the car
with their mother when the ad came on telling listeners to call
Republican Assemblyman Abel Maldonado right away and tell him to vote
yes. One of the boys turned to his mother and told her to get on the
phone at once.</TE>
<TE>   She did: Laura Maldonado called her husband, the Republican
assemblyman, and relayed her son's demand: "Call Dad right now and
tell him to vote for the budget so then we can go on vacation."</TE>
<TE>   Maldonado "just had a great laugh," he said, but didn't budge on
the budget.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP is naysaying the $99-billion bill, which is now more than
six weeks overdue, because of $4 billion in new taxes and revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Maldonado said he tried to explain the situation to his kids
--"the budget has a horrible structural problem that doesn't help the
state down the road"--but his argument was evidently no more
persuasive with his offspring than it has been with his Democratic
colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Billboard Bimbo Calls Anti-Secessionist a Guru</TE>
<TE>   Is she really a double agent, the Mata Hari of Hollywood
secession?</TE>
<TE>   Angelyne, Los Angeles' freakishly blimp-breasted billboard bimbo
for more than 20 years, has declared herself a candidate for the
Hollywood City Council, if such a thing ever comes into existence.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, there was speculation that her candidacy would hurt
secession more than help it, and now she has admitted that among the
community activists who urged her to declare her intentions are two
vehement anti-secessionists: John Walsh of the Hollywood Project Area
Committee and Chris Schabel, president of the Hollywood Highland
Democratic Club, who formed a group called Divided We Fall. Walsh got
a postcard from Angelyne with the message, "To John Walsh, My
political guru."</TE>
<TE>   He thinks Angelyne would make a good council member, but admitted,
"It might hurt secession and I'm not going to do anything that helps
secession."</TE>
<TE>   If Hollywood does manage to divorce L.A., he added, he wanted "to
make sure we have somebody on the council I like."</TE>
<TE>   Some pro-secessionists, like Laura Dodson, nudged Angelyne into
filing candidacy papers, because "she is not an airhead. You can take
her seriously, even though she is in pink."</TE>
<TE>   Among the other company-town candidates on a Hollywood wanna-be
slate: Neal Jano, occupation actor; William McGovern, occupation
actor/director/councilman; Richard William Eastman, costumer; Eric
DeYoung, union propmaker; and Tad Davis, film director whose credits
include a short film, "I Am Not a Lesbian," which, as a campaign
slogan, might not be a winning formula in his part of town.</TE>
<TE>   You of All People Should Know That Seat's Taken</TE>
<TE>   Not ... so ... fast.</TE>
<TE>   On a City Hall visit nearly two weeks ago for a fund-raiser and
meetings, Panorama City Democrat Tony Cardenas hung out around
council members' desks, jawboning and schmoozing--the same thing
council members often do during a council session, even as citizens
are earnestly pitching and pleading for attention.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas, who got beaten in his campaign for council earlier this
year by Wendy Greuel, got a little too comfy too soon.</TE>
<TE>   Chatting up council member Janice Hahn, he plopped down in the
empty leather chair next to her--one of the 15 off-limits chairs
reserved for council members, and this one in particular reserved for
Greuel.</TE>
<TE>   A city aide told him he had to find himself another perch.</TE>
<TE>   Picture That: Politicians Eager to Strike a Pose</TE>
<TE>   Vanity, thy name is politician.</TE>
<TE>   According to a tally prepared for The Times, Los Angeles' chief
legislative analyst found that councilman Nate Holden orders the most
photographs of himself posing with constituents, city employees and
visitors to City Hall--500 in the first six months of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Not far behind is Tom LaBonge, who has been known to chase down
tour groups for a snapshot.</TE>
<TE>   When a constituent wrote to LaBonge that her son's photos of the
Laker victory parade didn't turn out, LaBonge sent her official
photos to replace them.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge, Dennis Zine and Jack Weiss each ordered more than 400
photos in six months. The most camera-shy, apparently, is Cindy
Miscikowski, who requested a modest 69 prints.</TE>
<TE>   The six-month total for the entire council: 3,605 photos, all paid
for out of their office budgets, making the 15 council members mere
pikers compared to grandstanders of yore, like Gil Lindsay, Robert
Farrell, Art Snyder--who also arranged to have an exit on the
Pasadena Freeway named after his daughter--and the present mayor's
father, Kenneth Hahn, before he was elevated to the Board of
Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Butcher, the council's official photographer for more than a
quarter-century, figures it this way: "Every time I take your
picture," he tells the politicians, "it's a vote."</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Democratic Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante sent Republican
gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. an official commendation for
"your dedication to strengthening the economic vitality of the
region.... Your leadership sets a wonderful example for all
Californians." Bustamante's office said it was simply part of a
larger mailing to the Simon family investment firm, which the Los
Angeles Business Journal named one of the top 20 venture capital
firms in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   * Still seeking spell-check: When Bill Simon went surfing recently
with another Republican politician, the congressman from Newport
Beach, the Simon campaign misspelled the name of Dana Rohrabacher.</TE>
<TE>   * Gov. Gray Davis has signed West Hollywood Assemblyman Paul
Koretz's bill requiring pet stores to give to buyers of dogs and cats
a brochure about the health benefits of spaying and neutering their
new pets, and to encourage new ways to get owners to fix their
animals to stem the hundreds of thousands of unwanted dogs and cats
being put to death in California's shelters every year.</TE>
<TE>   * An Inland Empire family planning group, Inland PLANet, is
campaigning to get 34 million supporters to send $1 each to the U.N.
Population Fund, to make up for the U.S. share the Bush
administration revoked, overriding its own State Department findings
by contending the money could be used indirectly to support coerced
abortions in China.</TE>
<TE>   * Laker fans can vote on what they would like to name the street
in front of Staples Center: Chick Hearn's Place, Chick Hearn Court,
Chick Hearn Lane and Chick Hearn Dribble Drive. Register your vote at
www.lacity.org/council/cd14/, and please--no double-dip voting. This
isn't Florida.</TE>
<TE>   * Alpine County, California's smallest, is getting its $752,000
share of Prop. 10 campaign money for free universal preschool for its
3-and 4-year-olds--all 20 of them, compared with the 100,000 or so in
Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   * The two-bit project is moving west; the U.S. Mint will
eventually get to the 31st state in its state-design quarter program,
and California First Lady Sharon Davis has announced a design contest
to choose an image for the flip side of the coin to be issued in
January 2005.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>

<TE>   --Lodi City Council candidate JoAnne Mounce, who was arrested on
suspicion of drunken driving after a police officer twice warned her

<HD>Federal Sports Quotas Kill Young Men's Dreams</HD>

<LD>There are few scenes more heartbreaking in sports than a college
coach having to tell his players that their team has been eliminated
so that the school can comply with Title IX, the federal law applied
to gender and athletics. It is a cheerless drama that has played out
each year as tens of thousands of young men have been stripped of
their programs, scholarships and competitive hopes. Even the fabled
Mighty Casey has nothing on these student-athletes who have lost not
simply a game but their dreams.</LD>
<LD>   There has long been an outcry to examine and, yes, reform the
dubious way Title IX is enforced; schools everywhere fear that only
by adhering to quotas making their rosters "proportional" to their
enrollment can they be safe from the federal government and
plaintiffs' attorneys.</LD>
<LD>   But until earlier this year, those earnest pleas were usually
confined to the soon-to-be vacated locker rooms of teams that had
been cut. Now, a broad group of coaches from many different sports is
sticking up for the male athletes; the lawsuit they filed in federal
court in January is bringing this long-overdue discussion to the
national fore.</LD>
<TE>   Eight major sports associations have signed on to the reform
effort. And, at a Senate hearing on Title IX last month, Secretary of
Education Rod Paige announced the formation of a commission to study
how the law was being enforced, warts and all.</TE>
<TE>   Having an open discussion is crucial, and if the commission does
its job fairly, it will hear from people like Coach Sterling Martin
at Bowling Green State University, who saw his track team cut just
weeks ago, replaced by a women's rowing team. In that swift stroke,
the school chopped badly needed scholarships to minority athletes in
favor of a sport that has, safe to say, a scant following in
disadvantaged communities--or for that matter, most communities.
Beverly Brandon's son, Barrett, lost out when Nebraska eliminated its
men's swim team last year; she too would like to say a few words.
Turned away by the school, she traveled to Washington a few weeks ago
with Barrett's sister, Brooke, hoping in vain to tell lawmakers face
to face that here were two women who thought Title IX should mean
fairness for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon has organized other moms too--women like Deb Downey, whose
son lost his track team, and Gina Iamatteo, whose son was a quota
casualty at Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   Their stories give witness to the wreckage scattered at schools
across the country. UCLA's swim team, with scores of Olympic
medalists, gone. Howard University's decades-old baseball team, cut
at the end of last semester. Kent State hockey, no more. U-Mass
gymnastics, goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   And, no, those macho football guys are not to blame. The cuts take
place just as frequently at schools that don't even have football,
like Marquette University, where the athletic director had the
integrity to admit to the wrestling team that he was cutting their
program to achieve proportionality. At other schools, like Bucknell
and Yale, teams are axed even when alumni step forward offering to
fund an entire program.</TE>
<TE>   But Downey and Martin and the young men they champion will never
get the chance to tell their stories if the National Women's Law
Center gets its way. Marcia Greenberger, the head of that activist
group, which helped the Department of Education craft the quota
provision, declared recently that the Title IX Commission was
"unwarranted" and that "this law and its policies must not be changed
and there is no reason to reopen them."</TE>
<TE>   In the thinking of radical feminist groups, the coaches, students,
moms and alums are not concerned or caring voices that merit
attention. They are misguided or, worse, trying to return women to a
long-abandoned era of subservience.</TE>
<TE>   They are wrong, and their condescension has only made a determined
mother and a fired-up coach that much more focused. When Downey and
Martin finally get their hearing, listen closely and you will notice
in their voices an absence of stridence. They are not professional
ideologues but just average folks who have been steamrolled by the
kind of preference policy that we would tolerate nowhere else in
American life.</TE>
<TE>   They will say the same thing that the coaches do in their lawsuit:
Title IX is a terrific law that has been turned on its head by the
addition of a bureaucratic quota provision. Get rid of that one
dreadful element and restore the law to its original intent.</TE>
<TE>   No one is trying to deny women and girls the chance to compete.
Their growing legacy in sports is one that everybody applauds.
Instead ask: How could a law built to protect students from
discrimination become, with the addition of a few sentences, warped
into an instrument of that very purpose?</TE>

<HD>End Sea Mammal Massacre</HD>
<DH>Destructive fishing practices persist in the face of a ban.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM EICHENBERG</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 1960s, Americans were shocked to see baby seals clubbed to
death in the Arctic, whales impaled by harpoons from the bows of
speeding ships and frantic dolphins drowning by the hundreds of
thousands in huge tuna nets in the Pacific Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   Congress responded to the public outcry in 1972 by enacting the
Marine Mammal Protection Act to prohibit the killing, hunting,
capturing and harassing of all marine mammals. This landmark
legislation has resulted in progress. Dolphin deaths from tuna
fishing in the eastern tropical Pacific dropped from about half a
million per year before 1972 to about 4,000 per year today. Some
whale populations once on the brink of extinction, like blue whales,
are beginning to recover. And gray whales were recently removed from
the federal endangered species list.</LD>
<LD>   However, it's not all good news: Marine mammals are still in
trouble. Although no longer commercially hunted in the United States,
60,000 whales, dolphins, porpoises and other marine mammals die each
year worldwide as a result of a destructive fishing practice known as
bycatch.</LD>
<TE>   These gentle creatures are indiscriminately hooked on "longlines,"
entangled in nets and drowned by bottom-trawling gear. Bycatch also
includes seabirds, endangered sea turtles and large numbers of fish
species that are later discarded.</TE>
<TE>   Bycatch, or wasted catch, results in millions of fish and marine
mammals needlessly killed each year in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, more than 110,000 Americans supported the marine
protection organization Oceana's petition demanding that the National
Marine Fisheries Service implement a program to count, cap and
control bycatch. This is the largest number of comments ever received
by the government on an ocean issue.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Congress renewed its concern over marine mammal bycatch
by requiring the fisheries service to reduce the incidental taking of
marine mammals in commercial fishing operations to "insignificant
levels approaching zero mortality and serious injury" by April 30,
2001. Congress required the fisheries service to review and report
back on the progress in meeting this goal by 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The agency was also required to convene teams of scientists,
fishermen and other interested parties to develop and implement plans
to reduce deaths and to assist in the recovery of depleted
populations of marine mammals harmed by commercial fisheries.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has simply fallen down on the job; it
failed to meet these requirements. As a result, destructive fishing
practices continue to kill large numbers of marine mammals off our
coasts.</TE>
<TE>   Longlines and trawling nets are drowning pilot whales and common
dolphins in the North Atlantic. Harbor porpoise populations are
suffering from shark and halibut trawl fishing in Central California
and the Gulf of Maine. Fin whales and the gravely endangered North
Atlantic right whale are on the brink of extinction because of ship
strikes and entanglement in lobster gear and gillnets. And endangered
humpback whales in the Gulf of Maine and the central North Pacific
are being threatened by various fishing gear.</TE>
<TE>   It is sad and all too common that the federal government must be
sued to comply with its own laws to protect marine wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Oceana has, together with the Center for Biological Diversity and
Turtle Island Restoration Network, filed a lawsuit to force the
National Marine Fisheries Service to comply with the law and to
protect marine mammals from commercial fishing. The lawsuit asks the
service to convene teams to prepare plans to prevent the destruction
and assist in the recovery of the most vulnerable marine mammal
populations affected by fishing, and to submit to Congress the
delinquent report on the progress in meeting the zero-mortality goal.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high. We cannot afford to continue losing dolphins,
whales, porpoises and other marine mammals. The Bush administration
simply must do its job, and do it now.</TE>

<HD>Here's a Pitch: Blow the Cigarette Smoke Back in
Hollywood's Face</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK FREUDBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"My hands are bloody; so are Hollywood's," declares Hollywood
screenwriter Joe Eszterhas in a recent commentary piece in which he
also acknowledges he has throat cancer. "My cancer has caused me to
attempt to cleanse mine," he adds.</LD>
<LD>   In the piece, in the New York Times, the multimillionaire
screenwriter literally begs his Hollywood colleagues to stop using
alluring images of cigarettes, which, according to the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, kill 440,000 Americans
annually. The CDC also says that every day almost 5,000 under the age
of 18 try their first cigarette.</LD>
<LD>   Eszterhas, 57, has smoked most of his life. He's urging Hollywood
to put an end to the glamorization of smoking that he admits he
reinforced in many of his screenplays. Much of his larynx is gone, he
says, and it's tough for him to speak and make himself understood.</LD>
<TE>   I disagree. Although the state of his health is unenviable, he's
in an extraordinary position to make himself heard, more
effectively--and more sincerely--than ever. But to make it happen,
Eszterhas has to do something more than pen op-ed mea culpas.</TE>
<TE>   Eszterhas' list of Hollywood contacts must be incredible.
Shouldn't he be putting together a movie project that drives home his
new way of thinking? Instead, his agent, Alan Gasmer, told me that
"Eszterhas is out of the business."</TE>
<TE>   The screenwriter acknowledges that smoking was an integral part of
his writing because he says he was "a militant smoker ... part of a
bad-boy image I'd cultivated for a long time--smoking, drinking,
partying, rock 'n' roll."</TE>
<TE>   Now he believes that smoking should be as illegal as heroin.
Eszterhas says he has made a deal with God to spare him. In exchange,
Eszterhas says, he will try to stop others from following the road he
traveled.</TE>
<TE>   My sense is it's not advisable to try to strike a deal with the
almighty. This isn't, after all, a Hollywood power lunch. And so, if
Eszterhas is serious about wanting to undo some of the damage he
believes he's done, it may be time well spent for him to use his
creative genius (or at least his dead-on sense of what sells in
Hollywood) to write a film that shows the flip side of a
devastatingly gorgeous and more than somewhat exposed Sharon Stone
blowing smoke into Michael Douglas' face.</TE>
<TE>   How about Leonardo DiCaprio (who smoked charismatically in
"Titanic") on hands and knees, spitting up blood on a shiny linoleum
hospital floor; or Kate Winslet (she was smoking away on that sinking
ship, too) with emphysema and struggling for breath on a portable
oxygen system? How would those images go over with R.J. Reynolds
shareholders?</TE>
<TE>   Even a rare exception--the 1999 Al Pacino and Russell Crowe hit
about a tobacco industry whistle-blower, "The Insider," written by
Eric Roth and Michael Mann--failed to boldly go where no studio had
gone before: into the raw truth and frightening close-ups of the
human devastation spawned by smoking.</TE>
<TE>   I commend Eszterhas for coming to his senses, however late the
date. But there may be more to the story. Was Eszterhas merely a
purveyor of seductive, Humphrey Bogart-like images of the coolness of
smoking? Or could he have unwittingly been part of a filmdom culture
that choked off the creative voices over the years that had something
bad to say about the tobacco industry and its de facto advertising
agency, Hollywood?</TE>

<HD>A Stock Panic Shut-Off Valve</HD>
<DH>Insurance for 401(k) plans could be a way to prevent mass
dumping of mutual funds</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FREDERICK R. LYNCH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The long summer march of steady stock market losses and volatility
has spooked even high-level financial experts. Most know little about
crowd behavior, something that might help them understand and control
mass panic selling--the dreaded specter that flickered briefly in
late July when 41 million people with 401(k) retirement plans dumped
$18 billion in stock market mutual funds.</LD>
<LD>   Some financial gurus have now proclaimed a market bottom. But
investor anxiety continues, a potential market destroyer created by
gradual replacement of large, professionally managed collective
pension plans with millions of individually managed retirement
accounts.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently it never occurred to the Wall Street wizards that
cheerful visions of a new, democratized "investor class" might one
day dissolve into a demoralized, market-mauling mob. Yet a recent NBC
poll finds investors in a bleak mood: Only 11% of small investors are
"very confident" of making money in the stock market.</LD>
<TE>   The question of how to prevent herds of restive, do-it-yourself
retirement investors from becoming a selling stampede demands
thinking about new policies designed to preserve collective financial
security.</TE>
<TE>   Old images of angry mobs physically wreaking destruction on people
or property need to be replaced by the concept of a "diffuse crowd,"
one that is linked electronically by television, e-mail and the Web.
In today's turbocharged stock market, as "Dot.con" author John
Cassidy has pointed out, the pace of information flow has
dramatically accelerated while rational reflection-and-response time
has often dropped to seconds.</TE>
<TE>   These constraints on rational reflection feed a fundamental crowd
process termed "contagion."</TE>
<TE>   The biological metaphor is entirely apt: Threatening or extreme
situations foster uncritical psychological suggestibility and the
rapid communication of not only thoughts but also emotions,
especially via rumors--interpretations of events that are unverified
but potentially true.</TE>
<TE>   Rapid communication and action are reinforced when crowd members
have similar ideas, traits, motives and interests--the classic "birds
of a feather flock together" phenomenon.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is a diverse groups that holds 401(k) plans, a
disproportionate number of these investors are in two sociologically
similar groups especially alarmed by stock market declines: the tens
of millions of baby boomers contemplating retirement and millions
more already retired.</TE>
<TE>   Together, they constitute the core of the new market time bomb. In
his well-known collective behavior model, UC Berkeley sociologist
Neil Smelser contends that free-market, free-speech conditions
nourish crowd behavior in situations where societal strain and
discontent are mounting. These are obviously factors in today's
markets: Professionals and the public alike exchange overwhelming
amounts of information as they try to figure out what's going on
lately--even asking each other if another 1929 is at hand.</TE>
<TE>   During such periods of doubt and confusion, a "generalized belief"
may gain currency as to what is causing these problems. Thus the
current widespread explanation that crooked chief executive officers
and the super-rich are exploiting and looting a rigged system.</TE>
<TE>   Investor crowds have thus far reacted with increased, though
measured, selling while demanding reforms.</TE>
<TE>   The nightmare that flickered recently is one of mass selling
descending into panic--a rush for the exits driven by the frantic
calculation that "if I don't sell first, others will."</TE>
<TE>   The official response must restore trust in the
financial-political order. New punitive legislation and dramatic
arrests of corporate offenders are insufficient. Bitterness and
betrayal abound, and a major disaster, such as another highly
destructive terrorist attack, probably would produce a market
meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   A bold but potentially highly effective strategy for preventing
market panic might be to consider some sort of minimal, federally
backed insurance for 401(k) accounts--similar to that provided bank
accounts by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Individuals might pay
extra fees for 401(k) protection, and only relatively conservative
stock-and-bond funds might be certified.</TE>
<TE>   Such insurance would be tagged as an expensive expansion of big
government. But the costs of some sort of minimal, federally backed
insurance for 401(k) plans might be relatively small compared with a
sudden, mass stock market exit--whether that panic strikes next year
or 20 years from now, when 76 million retired baby boomers need the
funds to buy their groceries.</TE>

<LD>A comatose driver rear-ends your Corolla on the 405, catapulting you
and your beloved ride into a typical body shop, defined by the scent
of acrylic paint, the screech of grinders on fenders and a symbiotic
relationship with an insurance company.</LD>
<LD>   Many body-shop mechanics and managers say that a relationship with
an insurance company brings in more customers, who in turn get better
deals on repairs. Critics charge that to keep costs low, insurers
have begun to tell repair shops how to do their job, in some cases
pushing them to use cheaper generic parts and to lower labor costs.
In one large case, an Illinois jury fined State Farm $1.2 billion for
forcing affiliated auto repair shops to use shoddy parts.</LD>
<LD>   Now California state Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) is
offering SB 1648 to address the problem. Though her bill would not
prohibit insurance company affiliation with auto repair facilities,
it would outlaw insurance company-owned auto repair chains. Such
chains can present tough competition for independent shops.</LD>
<TE>   There is nothing inherently wrong with insurance companies owning
auto shops, so long as they don't defraud consumers--something that
independent auto shops have been known to do without prodding by
insurance companies. Speier's bill wouldn't do anything to combat
such rip-offs, nor would it address the real problem: insurers that
use such phrases as "We guarantee the work at this shop" and "No
adjuster necessary" to lure customers to preferred garages, a
practice that saves the insurer money but may not offer customers the
best repair.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate passed the bill. The Assembly shouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   A better policy would be to encourage consumer choice in auto body
repairs by keeping insurance companies from heavy-handedly directing
customers to affiliated shops.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what makes sense: Insurers tell claimants that they are
affiliated with a particular auto shop but lay off the subtle (or
overt) coercion. Unpressured customers then take their chances,
selecting either the insurance company-endorsed shop or an
independent garage.</TE>
<TE>   However, if lawmakers are really concerned about their
constituents' battered cars they will do something meaningful like
giving the Bureau of Automotive Repair and the Department of Consumer
Affairs the resources to aggressively crack down on auto
shops--insurance company-affiliated or not--that negligently cut
corners.</TE>

<LD>California risks another energy disaster--this one foreseen and
easily avoidable--if the electric power industry succeeds in blocking
an increase in solar, wind and other renewable power. Time is running
short for a measure in the state Legislature that would slowly step
up the tapping of renewable sources.</LD>
<LD>   Assembly leaders need to help pry the measure, SB 532, out of a
committee that is far too cozy with utility company lobbyists. The
bill, by Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford), has been held hostage to
utility opposition for nearly a year after passing the Senate easily.
What could give the bill a chance is that Southern California Edison
is said to be close to agreeing to support the measure.</LD>
<LD>   The utilities committee, chaired by Assemblyman Roderick Wright
(D-Los Angeles), seems more interested in pleasing the private
companies than in protecting Californians against another energy
shock in which natural gas prices would go through the roof, as they
did late in 2000. California is even more dependent now on natural
gas than it was then.</LD>
<TE>   The Sher bill would require utilities to boost their use of
renewable power sources by just 1% a year until, by 2015, at least
20% of the state's electric power would come from these sources.</TE>
<TE>   It is a completely practical goal. Cost is not the issue it once
was. Power from renewable sources is becoming price-competitive, and
the Sher legislation contains price caps to keep costs down.</TE>
<TE>   California pioneered commercial renewable energy but lost ground
during the energy crisis. The state, scrambling for energy contracts,
spent billions for future power that will nearly all be generated by
natural gas.</TE>
<TE>   A Rand Corp. report says the state faces an unstable energy future
because of its overreliance on natural gas. And a recent federal
report verified that manipulation of the natural gas market was one
cause of the 2000-01 crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The utilities have been squabbling about pricing mechanisms,
long-term contracts and other details. They need to get over this and
accept Sher's measure. So too should the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power, which wants to be exempted. There's no reason that
public power generators should get special treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The private utilities helped California get into the power crisis
and then had to be rescued by the state. Their credibility is gone.
And the Los Angeles DWP has a black eye from taking advantage of the
crisis in its sales of power to the state.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly committee's job is to protect the state's people and
businesses, not power company executives. Members can do that by
approving SB 532 at a hearing scheduled for today.</TE>

<LD>In Argentina, even in the wealthier area that includes Buenos Aires,
half of the population lives in poverty in shantytowns. In Brazil,
10% of the people control half of the wealth. In Guatemala, about
two-thirds of children under 5 years old are chronically
malnourished. In Colombia, an average of eight people a day are
kidnapped for ransom.</LD>
<LD>   To blame the United States, the free-market economy and the Bush
administration for these and other political, economic and social
ills--as some Latin American leaders and U.S. critics have done
recently--is foolish. But to ignore the problems that besiege
neighbors of the U.S. would be reckless.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the decisions made by President Bush and Congress that
harm free trade. The farm bill that the president signed into law
subsidizes U.S. farmers to the tune of $180 billion over the next
decade ... as the administration tells poor countries to lower their
subsidies to their own farmers.</LD>
<TE>   That damage is done, and, given the realities of congressional
election-year politics, Washington is not going to revisit farm aid
or eliminate unwise tariff barriers imposed on foreign steel
products.</TE>
<TE>   However, the administration must not pretend it doesn't understand
the effects of its actions on Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Protected by generous subsidies, U.S. farmers are flooding world
markets with underpriced agricultural products. Driving down prices
distorts markets and makes it impossible for unsubsidized farmers to
export, compete and sometimes even survive.</TE>
<TE>   Countries that produce corn, wheat, rice and soybeans are
suffering the consequences of U.S. protectionism. Mexico's corn
production has been negatively affected, and in Brazil and Argentina
farmers are forced to accept lower prices for their most important
export crops.</TE>
<TE>   So while the administration preaches free-market theology in Latin
America, its actions undercut its homilies. Many in the region now
believe that a free-market economy is incapable of delivering the
promised prosperity. That's wrong. The serious problems Latin America
confronts are due to a combination of historical factors and new ones
stemming from the realities of life after Sept. 11. But the fact
remains that almost every big problem in the region has a
repercussion in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Legal and illegal immigration to the U.S. from Mexico, Central
America and some countries in South America increases with every
crisis. Oil supplies to the U.S. from Venezuela could be threatened
if the political crisis there goes out of control.</TE>
<TE>   That is why the Bush administration should consider
confidence-building moves in the region. At the top of the to-do list
should be accelerating negotiations that would lead to a free-trade
agreement in the Americas. To arrive at such an agreement, the United
States must be willing to relinquish some of its protectionist
barriers.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's challenge would be to make the case that
protecting U.S. interests often requires thinking beyond the
country's borders.</TE>

<HD>Bringing Leni Riefenstahl's Tainted Talent Into Focus</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Survival, but Not Triumph," by Carol Williams, Aug. 15: The most
amazing thing about Leni Riefenstahl is her inability (I didn't say
"unwillingness") to suppress her bountiful artistic talents. Neither
a domineering father in her childhood, global politics throughout her
entire adult life nor a helicopter crash in her 90s could keep her
from pursuing her artistry. Dance, film, photography, acting, writing
and editing--she mastered them all in her century. The fact that she
accomplished this as a 20th century woman (in Germany, no less!) is
even more astounding.</LD>
<LD>   I've had the privilege of corresponding with this controversial
lady, who, I believe, will still produce more artwork in her
lifetime. And she has an unbeatable recipe for longevity and peace:
exercise, self-expression and a love of beauty. I encourage artists
and their admirers to give Riefenstahl's body of work a subjective
scrutiny. It's breathtaking. Unlike Williams, I'd call that a
"triumph."</LD>
<LD>   Nelson Aspen</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article on Riefenstahl and her absurd denial of her past
leaves out several important details about her life. Most notably,
she was asked after World War II to apologize for her work for the
Nazis and to submit to the process of Entnazifizierung, or
"de-Nazification," both of which she steadfastly and repeatedly
refused to do. Even if she was not a Nazi, she helped the Nazis
immensely; it is impossible that she could not have known this.
Riefenstahl was and is terribly irresponsible, and her persistent
denial reeks of paranoid selfishness and a ruthless ambition which,
for a concomitant lack of humanity and humility, has ultimately and
justly undermined her.</TE>
<TE>   Claudio Cambon</TE>
<TE>   Marina Del Rey</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the controversy which continues to surround Riefenstahl, she is
not alone. All through history, many great artists were attracted by
great power and used it for personal gain, and to this day their
biographies are clouded by their often childlike lack of discernment.</TE>
<TE>   However, in an area of Riefenstahl's work beyond reproach, we do
not need to wait for her underwater film. One of my treasured books
is her "Coral Gardens." First published in 1978 in Germany
("Korallengaerten," Paul List Verlag), it appeared in the same year
in its English version, by Harper &amp; Row. It is stunning in its beauty
and photographic innovation and deserves to be reprinted for her
100th birthday. Every photographer and anyone who ever snorkeled
would love it!</TE>

<LD>Re "A Void in Fiscal Leadership," editorial, Aug. 14: Why do you
refer to tax cuts as a "cost" to the government? The wealth and
income of the people are their property, not the government's. You
mention nothing about cutting spending. If the federal government
focused its efforts on its constitutional responsibilities, like
defense, foreign policy, justice, immigration and monetary policy, we
would not have to be taxed so much and our federal government would
be much more efficient.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the federal government wastes "our" money, as well as its
efforts, on social programs such as Social Security, Medicare,
welfare and education that have nothing to do with its constitutional
responsibilities or the protection of people's rights. It is because
of this governmental irresponsibility that this country was attacked
in September.</LD>
<LD>   Carl Beury</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So, our president still wants to repeal the estate or, as he like
to call it, "death" tax. Surely it is neither of the above, but an
inheritance tax. Accepting the fact that the government needs X
number of dollars to operate, can someone explain to me why the man
who makes his money by hard work should pick up the slack left by the
layabout son of a plutocrat (who makes his money by sitting on his
rear end)?</TE>

<TE>   In his Aug. 15 column ("Aloofness Puts Bush on Right Side of
History"), James Pinkerton states that Bill Clinton "must also be
blamed for the corrupt activities of a corporate few, wheedling and
deedling on his watch."</TE>
<TE>   What Pinkerton conveniently omitted was the fact that the Newt
Gingrich-led, Republican-dominated House overrode a presidential veto
of the law permitting gross misconduct in reporting income and loss
by these same corporations. I would encourage Pinkerton to do his
homework and editorialize a little more accurately.</TE>

<TE>   Pinkerton omits one important example of presidential aloofness
during an economic crisis: Herbert Hoover. And look where that left
us: the Great Depression. Contrast that with the bold steps taken by
his successor: Franklin Roosevelt. Maybe Bush is not so much aloof as
dense and lacking in basic historical knowledge.</TE>

<LD>Thank you for your thoughtful coverage of the death of mountaineer
and photographer Galen Rowell and his wife, Barbara (Aug. 13). As
anyone who has visited their Mountain Light Gallery in Bishop,
Calif., can testify, Rowell was a major artist. Their deaths, in a
light plane accident, were an artistic and a human tragedy, and raise
an issue to which The Times gave editorial attention earlier this
year (April 5): the regrettable lack of commercial air service at the
Bishop airport.</LD>
<LD>   Without question, travel by general aviation (light planes) is
much more dangerous than by commercial aviation. Moreover, the
population of the Eastern Sierra and the Owens Valley has grown in
recent years. There are proposals, as The Times noted, to develop the
Mammoth Lakes airport for large jets. Landing in a plane of any size
on that wind-swept bench at 7,200 feet of altitude is a frightening
experience. The Times, and all other interested parties, should join
in urging the counties of Inyo and Mono to cooperate in developing
the Bishop airport to handle commercial air traffic.</LD>

<LD>Question: How many terrorist attacks have been averted due to the
Bush administration's threatening posture toward Iraq? Every
terrorist organization knows that if it launches a major attack
against the U.S., then the ruling party in Iraq will be ousted along
with any financial support the terrorists receive from that source. I
consider the threatening posture toward Iraq a brilliant strategy on
the part of the Bush administration.</LD>

<TE>   Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s premise that it would be immoral for the
U.S. to remove Saddam Hussein by force is yet another example of the
political left wing's skewed ideas of morality (Commentary, Aug. 15).
We know that Hussein has used chemical/biological weapons at least
eight times. We know that he is attempting to get a nuclear bomb. Is
it not immoral not to stop him?</TE>

<TE>   Thank you, Arthur Schlesinger, for telling it like it is. Aside
from the deadly, unending morass an Iraqi invasion will get us into,
it is clear that a preemptive strike is immoral and that preventive
war violates all the precepts that have governed our democracy. We
are becoming the rogue nation, with our arrogant assumption that it's
OK to drop our bombs on countries we don't happen to like. Where's
the outrage, Americans?</TE>

<LD>I was relieved to read "State Teacher Shortage" (letter, Aug. 14).
Like Judith Backover, I was looking forward to teaching as a second
career. After a long and varied career, I thought I had a lot to
offer young people. I have been a teacher and an actor, have served
in Vietnam, have worked as an instructional designer and trainer all
over the world and am a published writer. I have a master's degree
and a current teaching credential.</LD>
<LD>   I answered many ads, posted my resume, wrote many letters, filled
out many applications. I went to many teacher fairs. I was granted
very few interviews and was never offered a contract. I guessed the
reason no school system was interested in me was age and a lack of
classroom experience. I have finally given up. It is somewhat
gratifying to read Backover's comments and to learn that I am not
alone in this frustration. But this doesn't help the school
situation. And this doesn't help students in public schools who are
being shortchanged by those "unqualified, sometimes foreign,
emergency-waiver recruits."</LD>

<LD>Steven Hatfill has joined Richard Jewell [the security guard falsely
implicated by authorities and the media after the Olympic bombing in
Atlanta], Wen Ho Lee [the scientist investigated by the FBI on
suspicion of espionage at the Los Alamos, N.M., research facility]
and undoubtedly countless others in the FBI's attempt to cover its
incompetence by smearing such people, ruining their lives and
careers, invading their persons and homes and stealing personal
property from them ("Hatfill Wrote Novel About Bioterrorism," Aug.
14). Hatfill supposedly is but one of 30 "persons of interest" and
yet he is the only one publicly fingered.</LD>
<LD>   Recently the FBI passed around a photo of him (but none of the
other "persons of interest") to Princeton, N.J., residents in an
effort to connect him to the mailing of the anthrax letters. Given
his exposure on TV over the last few days, I'd wager that if that
photo were passed around here in Atascadero, most would say, "Yep, I
saw him only a couple of days ago." At least he hasn't been given the
treatment of the Ruby Ridge and Waco victims. Yet!</LD>

<LD>So the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is planning prepaid
monthly ride cards and simplifying the process to buy bus passes
(Aug. 14). Are these MTA press releases from Aug. 14, 1962? It
astounds and infuriates me that the head of the MTA doesn't take a
trip to a place like Seattle (with an excellent transit system) and
attempt to model the MTA after King County's Metro Transit system.</LD>
<LD>   There, riders can log online and track where the bus is on the
route so as to figure when to step outside their home or office to go
to the stop to catch the bus. In L.A. this system would at least tell
riders that their bus isn't even coming. The MTA needs to enter the
21st century ... or at least the 20th!</LD>

<HD>Jeff Corey, 88; Blacklist Led Actor to Teaching</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Corey, a gifted actor who was blacklisted for refusing to name
names before the House Committee on Un-American Activities in the
1950s but emerged as one of the most sought-after teachers in
Hollywood, has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps best-known for his post-blacklist roles in "Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid," "In Cold Blood," "Little Big Man" and on the
TV sitcoms "One Day at a Time" and "Night Court," Corey died Friday
morning at St. John's Medical Center in Santa Monica of complications
from a fall earlier in the week at his home in Malibu.</LD>
<LD>   To generations of actors, directors and writers, Corey's name on
the blacklist didn't mean a thing. They came to his informal classes
for his insightful ideas on the craft of acting and views on how to
handle challenging roles.</LD>
<TE>   His list of students makes up a who's who of the Hollywood elite
since the 1950s and includes James Dean, Anthony Perkins, Shirley
Knight, Jane Fonda, Peter Fonda, Robert Blake, Leonard Nimoy, Robin
Williams, Rob Reiner, Robert Towne, Roger Corman, Penny Marshall,
Taylor Hackford and a young Jack Nicholson.</TE>
<TE>   "Acting is life study, and Corey's classes got me into looking at
life as an artist," Nicholson said years later.</TE>
<TE>   Those who knew Corey's teaching process said he was a Stanislavsky
Method teacher but with a small "m." His process was eclectic and
involved one-on-one work with an actor. He created improvisational
exercises that allowed actors to engage their imaginations and
subconscious minds in pursuit of a theme that they could apply to
their roles.</TE>
<TE>   Corey was always pursuing a current underlying emotional and
psychological theme in the actor's work. And in doing that, he was
trying to help the actor relate to the here and now rather than the
arcane notion of the character's circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell my students, 'Respect the instrument. It is you doing the
acting,' " Corey told The Times some years ago. "By all means, you
must be responsive to the meaning of the play, to what the author
meant and to what the audience will ultimately see. Engage your own
intuition, use your own frames of reference and give something which
is uniquely yours; put something rich into your performance rather
than some external result that hasn't got your face. Simplicity is
the cherished quality."</TE>
<TE>   Corey didn't set out to be a teacher. An indifferent student in
high school in New York City, he took a drama class and became
intrigued with acting. He earned a scholarship to the Feagin School
of Dramatic Arts, then a leading theater school in New York City,
which he later said kept him from a career selling sewing machines.
From there, he did work in Shakespearean repertory and then worked
with a traveling children's theater troupe. His first meaty stage
role was in Leslie Howard's touring production of "Hamlet," in which
he played Rosencrantz.</TE>
<TE>   Corey and his wife moved to Los Angeles, and he found work,
appearing in 23 films from 1940 to 1943, including "The Devil and
Daniel Webster," "My Friend Flicka," and "Joan of Arc."</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Navy in 1943 and was assigned to the ship Yorktown
as a combat photographer. He earned citations for some footage he
shot during a kamikaze attack on the ship.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Corey returned to Hollywood and resumed his busy
career playing heavies in such films as "The Killers" and "Brute
Force." He also played the role of a psychiatrist in "Home of the
Brave," one of his best performances.</TE>
<TE>   Corey seemed ready for even better film parts as the second lead
or top character actor, when he was subpoenaed to testify before the
House Committee on Un-American Activities, which had been
investigating Communist influence in Hollywood since 1947.</TE>
<TE>   The actor was scheduled to appear at the hearing in downtown Los
Angeles in September 1951. He was 37 and had a wife and three
daughters to support. But he took the 5th Amendment and didn't work
again as an actor in Hollywood for more than a decade, missing out on
countless movie opportunities and what would later be considered the
golden age of television.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of us were retired reds. We had left it, at least I had,
years before," Corey told Patrick McGilligan, the co-author of
"Tender Comrades: A Backstory of the Hollywood Blacklist" who also
teaches film at Marquette University. "The only issue was, did you
want to just give them their token names so you could continue your
career, or not? I had no impulse to defend a political point of view
that no longer interested me particularly .... They just wanted two
new names so they could hand out more subpoenas."</TE>
<TE>   He found work as a laborer earning $14 a day and enrolled as a
freshman at UCLA on the GI Bill. He eventually earned a degree in
speech therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Corey would later say that he fell into teaching somewhat by
accident. He said a student who was failing miserably in another
program organized the first class and talked him into teaching it,
which he did in the garage of his Hollywood Hills home. Carol
Burnett, then a freshman at UCLA, was among the students.</TE>
<TE>   Word of mouth kept the classes going as Corey, a self-effacing
man, didn't promote himself or advertise and did little to encourage
enrollment. By the mid-1950s, he was the most sought-after acting
coach in Hollywood. Studios that would not hire Corey as an actor
because of the blacklist actively sent their young talent to study
with him.</TE>
<TE>   Corey himself wouldn't start working again in films until 1962,
when he was offered parts in the films "The Balcony" and "The Yellow
Canary." One of his students, Pat Boone, helped him get the part in
"The Yellow Canary" by talking the legal department at Fox into
taking him on.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next 35 years, Corey appeared in more than 70 films or
television series. He also got chances to direct.</TE>
<TE>   According to McGilligan, Corey was "an actor's actor, someone that
actors loved to watch because he was always doing something
interesting in his work."</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff was articulate about ideas, provocative and inspirational,"
McGilligan told The Times on Saturday. "He was a wonderful actor who
we never fully got to see because of the blacklist."</TE>
<TE>   Corey is survived by Hope, his wife of 64 years; three daughters,
Eve Corey Poling of Atlanta; Jane Corey of Elk, Calif., and Emily
Corey of Los Angeles; and six grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial services are pending.</TE>

<HD>Donna Hall Fishburn, 74; Veteran Stunt Double Worked in
Westerns</HD>

<LD>Donna Hall Fishburn, a veteran Hollywood stunt double and horsewoman
who worked in hundreds of westerns in a 40-year career in which she
doubled for Barbara Stanwyck in "The Maverick Queen," Debbie Reynolds
in "How the West Was Won" and Doris Day in "Calamity Jane," has died.
She was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Fishburn, whose professional name was Donna Hall, died of lung
disease Aug. 7 at Providence St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Los Angeles, Fishburn was the daughter of stuntman Frank
"Shorty" Hall, a former jockey, who put her on a horse almost as soon
as she could walk.</LD>
<TE>   At 3, she was thrown from a horse for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad put me back on the saddle again and I've never been afraid of
a horse," Fishburn said when she was an 18-year-old Burbank High
School graduate and already wrangling movie horses.</TE>
<TE>   Fishburn made her movie debut at 10 when a little girl was needed
to come out of the starting gate in a racehorse picture.</TE>
<TE>   After she began her stunt career in the late '40s, she jumped off
trains, fell off horses and transferred from horses to moving
stagecoaches. She even jumped to a stagecoach while standing on two
horses.</TE>
<TE>   Fishburn once said she was too scared to become an actress. But
doing anything on horseback never frightened her, although movie work
sometimes took a toll.</TE>
<TE>   In "Cat Ballou," she jumped off a train and hit a rock. And while
she was working as a stuntwoman for Stanwyck on location for
"Maverick Queen," a horse fell on her.</TE>
<TE>   "Then," as she once recalled, "I got food poisoning from the
catering truck, and the next day they accidentally dropped me on my
head. But they paid me well--and I got to see a lot of Colorado."</TE>
<TE>   Fishburn, who did trick-riding in rodeos on the weekends and once
appeared at Madison Square Garden, was among only a dozen or so women
doing western stunt work in those days.</TE>
<TE>   Among her other feature film credits are "Annie Get Your Gun,"
"Big Country" and "The Apple Dumpling Gang." Fishburn also worked in
numerous TV westerns, including "Kit Carson," "The Lone Ranger," "The
Cisco Kid," "Wanted Dead or Alive" and "Have Gun Will Travel."</TE>
<TE>   She appeared frequently on TV's "Annie Oakley," doubling for star
Gail Davis, said her husband and only survivor, retired movie
wrangler Jay Fishburn, who said his wife did what she loved to do.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't wait for the sun to come up and hated to see it go
down," Fishburn recalled of her movie days in 2000, the year she
received a Golden Boot Award.</TE>

<HD>Valentin Pluchek, 93; Led Moscow Theater of Satire for 50
Years</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Valentin Pluchek, 93, director of the often-daring Moscow Theater of
Satire for half a century, died Saturday of natural causes at his
home in Moscow.</LD>
<LD>   Pluchek began his theater career working with Vsevolod Meyerhold,
the relentlessly experimental director who was arrested and shot in
1940, and then with playwright Alexei Arbuzov. Pluchek interrupted
his career to serve in the navy during World War II.</LD>
<LD>   He joined the Satire in 1950 and became its chief director in
1957. Under his tutelage, the Satire became one of the most popular
theaters in a city where the stage attracts intense interest.</LD>
<TE>   The Satire was known for its strong, cohesive troupe and for
bringing fresh winds of thought during stodgy and fearful times.</TE>
<TE>   Among Pluchek's best-known productions were Nikolai Gogol's
"Inspector General," Alexander Griboyedov's "Woe from Wit," and two
plays that were quickly banned by Soviet authorities: "Terkin in a
Better World" by Alexander Tvardovsky and Nazym Khikmet's "Did Ivan
Ivanovich Really Exist?" The theater also produced "Flight" by
Mikhail Bulgakov, whose works had infuriated Soviet censors for
decades.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Roger Rex Adams, 69, theatrical agent who traveled the world with
singer Glen Campbell and the entertainer's manager, Stan Schneider,
died of cancer Aug. 10 in Santa Fe, N.M.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Warren, Ohio, Adams was educated at Choate School in
Wallingford, Conn., and Dennison University in Granville, Ohio. He
served in the Army and initially worked in his family's insurance
business.</LD>
<LD>   But a chance meeting in London with a college acquaintance, Jerry
Perenchio, prompted Adams to join the Jerry Perenchio Agency in 1968.
He was immediately assigned to handle a new entertainer named Glen
Campbell, and he and the singer soon became inseparable as Campbell's
career skyrocketed.</LD>
<TE>   Through the years, Adams also represented Henry Mancini, Bob Hope
and Johnny Mathis.</TE>

<LD>Richard I. Queen, 51, one of 66 people taken hostage by Islamic
militants who seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran, in 1979, died
Wednesday in Falls Church, Va., of complications of multiple
sclerosis.</LD>
<LD>   The suburban Washington man had been a State Department consular
officer at the embassy for about four months when he was seized with
the others.</LD>
<LD>   He was released in July 1980 after 250 days in captivity when
Iranian doctors discovered an undetermined illness that turned out to
be multiple sclerosis.</LD>
<TE>   After the remaining hostages were released on Jan. 20, 1981, Queen
resumed his diplomatic career. He served as an aide to the U.S.
ambassador to Britain and as a consular officer in Toronto.</TE>

<HD>Serb Music Fest Doesn't Trumpet the Brass Ring</HD>
<DH>Yugoslavia: Annual street party is a less joyous event this
year as many are concerned about their economic and political future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GUCA, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>The smells at the legendary Guca brass band festival reach visitors
long before the music: smoke from open fires, roasting piglets,
seared lamb and stewed cabbage.</LD>
<LD>   "It smells of Serbia," said Nemnja Nikolic, 20, a university
student who drove four hours from the Yugoslav capital to hear the
music. "In Belgrade, you don't smell Serbia. This is the real
Serbia."</LD>
<LD>   Tens of thousands of people of every age mill in the broad streets
of this small town in central Serbia whose 42-year-old annual trumpet
festival recalls a time before Yugoslavia's dominant republic was
bankrupted by wars and humiliated internationally.</LD>
<TE>   This year's crowd provides a barometer of Serbia's mood before
next month's presidential election and at a time when the republic's
future seems increasingly uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a nation that would spend its last 20 dinars [about 30
cents] to hear a Gypsy band," said Dragan Dzukljev, 45, who works in
marketing. "So this festival is a valve for us. It is psychological
food."</TE>
<TE>   His worried face suggests how much he is in need of such
nourishment. Like many people here--perhaps including those rendered
incoherent by the plum brandy sold in shot glasses on the street--he
is depressed and deeply worried about the country's economy and
politics.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of seeing times improve since the ouster of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic in October 2000, many Serbs say their
buying power has eroded. The economy's slide has come against a
political backdrop of bitter infighting among the 18 parties sharing
power in Serbia.</TE>
<TE>   "We live worse and worse as time passes. The politicians who came
two years ago made big promises. We expected we would have better
lives. There would be foreign investment. But all they have done is
to sell everything for peanuts," Dzukljev said bitterly.</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to the federal government's first efforts at
privatization, which netted the equivalent of $180 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   Even the many young people at the festival have a sense of
diminished possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "People come here to escape their hard lives, but I have the
feeling people are less joyful than last year," said Nenad
Stevanovic, 19, whose mother is from Guca and who has come to the
festival ever since he could walk.</TE>
<TE>   "There are fewer brass bands, and fewer people are jumping with
joy in the streets," said Stevanovic, who hopes to become a
policeman.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the three days at Guca are the archetypal Serbian
street party. The food, the drinks and above all the music--a mix of
fast-paced trumpet and French horn and the periodic lilt of a Gypsy
melody--are ingrained deep in the Serbian soul.</TE>
<TE>   For three days in August, more than 100,000 people throng Guca's
streets to hear brass band music in this bucolic town tucked among
rolling green hills in the country's largest raspberry-growing
region.</TE>
<TE>   As musicians wander through the crowds, people form the dance
equivalent of pickup basketball. A group of four or five revelers
will offer 400 dinars (about $6.50) for a song. As the band strikes
up, often in the middle of the street, people begin to dance. Soon,
another spender stuffs bills into the bandleader's trumpet, and a
second song billows forth.</TE>
<TE>   The music is fast, loud--even deafening. Often, two bands play in
tandem at the same cafe, and on a single street it's not uncommon to
hear five or six bands play at the same time. Most bands consist of
about a dozen instruments, including at least three trumpets, three
French horns, a trombone, a cornet or two, and an accordion.</TE>
<TE>   Some bands are made up of ethnic Serb musicians, while other bands
have Gypsy musicians. The two do not mix, but the listeners have
equal affection for both.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the festival is a competition, and the best bands
and trumpeters win a prize. Although little else rewards minorities
in this ethnically divided country, the prize here often goes to
Gypsy bands, as it did this year.</TE>
<TE>   With the contentious Serbian presidential election looming, the
people dancing in the streets, working their way through vast
quantities of sliced roasted piglet and earthenware bowls of greasy
cabbage, have the desperate gaiety of those who want to escape. There
is even Serbo-Croatian shorthand for it: Obeznaniti se, roughly
translated as "to wipe out all consciousness of daily life, to forget
oneself."</TE>
<TE>   "Guca is the three days a year when Serbs enjoy themselves," said
Miroslav Prokopijevic, who was born near Guca and is an economist at
the Institute for European Studies, a research organization in
Belgrade, the Serbian and Yugoslav capital. "But it's not the real
face of Serbia. People expected huge improvements after Milosevic,
but that hope faded away in a few months, and now people aren't just
disappointed--they are worried about what's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Many people said they either don't know whom they will vote for
or, more likely, won't bother to vote because they doubt it will make
any difference.</TE>
<TE>   Even among those who said their own lives, though straitened, were
tolerable, a sense of precariousness prevailed. And it fueled a
rising resentment toward what they view as arrogant pressure from
Western governments, notably the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The signal was clear: Politicians who bow to the West risk losing
popular support.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, I think we lived a better life before the transition.
We were not free then, but our standard of living was higher. We are
selling ourselves to the West," said Milan Janic, 20, a student from
Belgrade.</TE>
<TE>   Yugoslavia, which was crushed by a North Atlantic Treaty
Organization bombing campaign in 1999 in retaliation for Milosevic's
brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Serbia's Kosovo province, has
officially allied itself with the United States. Since then, the U.S.
has used the threat of withholding foreign aid to force Yugoslavia to
hand over alleged war criminals to the U.N. tribunal in The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   Such threats are difficult to ignore in a country that was
economically devastated at the end of Milosevic's rule and in
desperate need of both the aid from the United States as well as
loans from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, which
depend on U.S. approval.</TE>
<TE>   Many Serbs have a love-hate relationship with the West. They
deeply resent being in a subservient position, but many also hope
that either they or their children will find jobs in Western Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "For more than 10 years, we have all experienced a lot of
hardship," said Novka Ilic, 46, a radio journalist at a station in
the nearby small city of Uzice, who hopes that her high school-age
daughter will find work outside Serbia. "Personally, I'm very
disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask about freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom
of expression, it's better, but everything else is worse. People are
frightened. They don't know what tomorrow will bring."</TE>
<TE>   As for the festival, even though it is harder for her to afford
than in past years, she finds solace in being here.</TE>
<TE>   "The trumpet is a very traditional instrument," Ilic said. "The
trumpet is for when a child is born, when you are getting married.
When there is a death and when there is a birth; it is the music both
for sorrow and for joy."</TE>
<TE>   The familiarity of the music seems to provide hope at a time when
there are few encouraging signs.</TE>
<TE>   "The trumpet raises your spirits. For a while, it was neglected,
but now it's coming back," she said.</TE>

Continent's major rivers.</LD>
<LD>   European Commission President Romano Prodi told the emergency
"flood summit" that regional development funds set aside in the EU
budgets through 2006 could be tapped for the massive cleanup and
reconstruction. He also outlined a package of credits and
low-interest loans for farmers and homeowners hurt by the disaster.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, EU regulations aimed at reducing farm subsidies and
putting a ceiling on national debt will be relaxed, Prodi assured the
leaders of Germany, Austria, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Of the countries inundated since torrential rains began about 10
days ago in Russia and swept westward, only Germany and Austria are
members of the 15-nation EU. The others are on track to join the
union.</TE>
<TE>   But Prodi joined Schroeder and Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel in assuring the Eastern European states that they will have
equal access to EU aid coffers.</TE>
<TE>   "The damage inflicted and the suffering of the people affect all
these countries whether or not they are yet members," Schroeder told
a news conference with the other summit leaders. By pulling together
in this time of crisis, he added, "Europe shows that it isn't just a
common market or an abstract notion but a powerful force able to
tackle even a crisis of this magnitude."</TE>
<TE>   No exact figures have been agreed to, Schroeder said, noting that
the $500 million discussed with Prodi "is very preliminary" and
clearly only a fraction of what will be needed.</TE>
<TE>   The full cost of the disaster cannot even be hinted at yet, as
flood waters continued to surge Sunday along the Danube and Elbe
rivers, respectively threatening the Hungarian capital, Budapest, and
the northern German cities of Magdeburg and Hamburg. In Brandenburg
state, which encircles Berlin, tens of thousands of residents were
preparing to evacuate the tiny Elbe riverside towns and villages
expected to be the disaster's next victims.</TE>
<TE>   In Budapest, Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Medgyessy said he
remained confident that the city would escape major damage even as
the swollen Danube was rising precariously close to waterfront
landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   The river level dropped for the second day in the devastated
German city of Dresden, where the Zwinger Palace art museum and
Semper Opera both suffered heavy damage. But mud covered much of the
historic Old Town, and officials were unsure whether it was safe for
evacuees to return. The seven bridges straddling the Elbe in Dresden
were being inspected for structural damage.</TE>
<TE>   The floods ravaging the Continent have killed more than 100
people, forced hundreds of thousands from their homes and inflicted
double-digit billions of dollars in damage. They have also caused
ecological damage not yet assessed, including a chlorine gas release
north of the Czech capital, Prague, and coal-laden soil now washing
into the Elbe.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder said environmental protection will be a priority in the
rebuilding effort, adding that Germany remains ever more committed to
the Kyoto Protocol aimed at fighting global warming--a treaty the
Bush administration has abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   With the Mulde River, which feeds into the Elbe, still rising
Sunday around the city of Bitterfeld, home to a sprawling chemical
industrial park, army helicopters were ferrying sandbags at a furious
pace to the site where more than 1,000 compounds, many of them
volatile and toxic, are in storage. Despite the feverish activity,
officials insisted that there remained no imminent ecological hazard.</TE>
<TE>   Evacuations and dike reinforcement were also underway in Torgau,
the Elbe town where U.S. and Soviet troops met after defeating the
Nazis in World War II, and in Wittenberg, where Martin Luther
launched the Reformation in 1517.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the worst disaster our generation has seen," said
Schuessel, the Austrian chancellor, echoing Schroeder's observation
that European states are showing the solidarity amid hardship that
until now has been only a noble concept of social and economic
integration.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have been giving reconstruction figures as high as $15
billion in Germany alone, an amount that would probably force the
federal government to borrow beyond the deficit level--3% of gross
domestic product--that nations using the euro common currency are
required to maintain in the interest of collective solvency.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder, showing testiness after days of hectic travel and
crisis management, refused to say whether the flood bills will
undermine Germany's already difficult struggle to stay within the EU
budgetary parameters.</TE>
<TE>   "What we needed to talk about here today was how to help people,
not about abstract matters," the chancellor snapped when asked
whether the deficit limit would be ignored.</TE>

<HD>21 N. Korean Refugees Sail Into South</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The largest group of North Korean defectors ever to escape to the
South by boat arrived this morning at the port city of Inchon on a
dilapidated wooden fishing vessel after a perilous two-day journey on
the Yellow Sea.</LD>
<LD>   Although record numbers of asylum-seekers are arriving in South
Korea this year, the 21 people, including 10 children, who arrived
today are among the few who have dared sail along the heavily
patrolled maritime border.</LD>
<LD>   "We escaped from the hunger," 70-year-old Soon Jong Shik, the
oldest of the defectors, reportedly told South Korean naval police.</LD>
<TE>   The defectors set off at 4 a.m. Saturday from Hongundo, a port
village 60 miles northwest of Pyongyang, the North's capital, with
enough fuel for a week. They sailed out to international waters to
avoid North Korean authorities, then turned south. About 7 p.m.
Sunday, they were spotted by the South Korean naval police, who
thought they were trying to catch crab.</TE>
<TE>   "Where are you from?" South Korean naval police Capt. Kim Jae Man
shouted when the boat came within a stone's throw, according to South
Korean television. "Is your boat in trouble?"</TE>
<TE>   "We are from the North. We escaped. We want to live in the South,"
came back the reply.</TE>
<TE>   Pointing rifles, the police boarded the boat to search for weapons
and drugs. Instead, they found frightened defectors, the youngest an
8-year-old girl, hiding in fish storage rooms. Most members of the
group were moved to the naval vessel, where they were served instant
noodle soup and questioned.</TE>
<TE>   In a heavy rainstorm, the fishing boat was towed to Inchon, west
of Seoul. There, the asylum-seekers were taken into custody by South
Korean intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   This has been a banner year for defections, with nearly 600 people
coming south so far--more than the 583 in all of 2001. One reason for
the surge is an aggressive campaign by human rights activists and
Christian missionaries. But activists here said this group escaped on
its own.</TE>
<TE>   "All indications are that this was a spontaneous effort by
desperate North Koreans. It came as a big surprise to us," said Tim
Peters, an American who works with Norbert Vollertsen, a German
physician who had said he would help "boat people" escape to South
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all the North Koreans seeking asylum in the South lately
have gone through China. In the most publicized cases, activists have
helped some people storm foreign embassies and consulates in China,
demanding asylum.</TE>
<TE>   Although fishermen occasionally manage to navigate their way
south, there have been only two other instances in which large groups
have escaped by boat. In 1997, 14 members of two families came to
Inchon, and in 1987, 11 people escaped by boat to Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of the Korean War in 1953, the South and the North
have been separated by what is reputed to be the world's most heavily
armed border.</TE>
<TE>   Activists predict that the success of this latest defection will
encourage others.</TE>
<TE>   "The North Koreans don't have sophisticated equipment to stop
small fishing boats. The biggest problem is that the North Koreans
don't have the money for fuel to make the trip," said Douglas Shin, a
Korean American minister who works with defectors in Seoul. "But the
North Koreans know that their country is the opposite of a paradise.
Many more of them will try to get out."</TE>
<TE>   The 70-year-old and his 46-year-old son, the boat captain,
reportedly organized the escape. Family members from the South are
said to have given them money for the trip through intermediaries in
China.</TE>
<TE>   According to South Korean media, the elder Soon was born in the
South Korean town of Nonsan but was conscripted into the North Korean
army when he was a teen.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to step on the ground of my hometown before I died," he
told South Korean reporters in Inchon. "We planned a long time for
this."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli and Palestinian security officials reached agreement Sunday
on a plan for Israeli troops to withdraw from parts of the Gaza Strip
and from the West Bank town of Bethlehem, Israeli and Palestinian
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement was reached Sunday evening between Israeli Defense
Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Palestinian Interior Minister Abdel
Razak Yehiyeh, the Defense Ministry said in a statement. Israeli
forces will withdraw on the condition that "the Palestinian side
takes responsibility to calm the security situation and reduce
violence," the statement said.</LD>
<LD>   The pullout was to begin today. Nabil abu Rudaineh, an aide to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said the withdrawal would "prepare
the atmosphere" for troop pullbacks elsewhere. Both sides had agreed
that the withdrawal would be completed within 48 hours, he said.</LD>
<TE>   If Palestinian attacks stop after the troops leave, the army will
gradually pull out of other areas supposed to be under Palestinian
Authority control.</TE>

<HD>Colombia's Drug War Attracts Dubious Ally</HD>
<DH>Policy: Paramilitary force is backing U.S. program to help
farmers give up illegal coca crop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SIMITI, Colombia</DL>
<LD>A fledgling U.S. program to eradicate cocaine in central Colombia has
gained a notorious ally: a right-wing paramilitary army that the
State Department has labeled a terrorist organization.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called self-defense forces, responsible for the majority of
massacres in Colombia's bloody internal conflict, have thrown their
support behind a U.S. alternative development program that seeks to
persuade farmers to give up their profitable coca crops for legal
products such as beans, chocolate and cattle.</LD>
<LD>   The paramilitaries, who fill a power vacuum left by the
ineffectual Colombian army, have sponsored community workshops to
educate farmers on the environmental and social destruction wrought
by cocaine. They have begun distributing fliers asking farmers to
give up their coca crops.</LD>
<TE>   Chillingly, however, they also have warned that those who continue
planting and harvesting coca will no longer be welcome in this
region, which is almost completely under their control. Their stated
enemy, the nation's leftist guerrillas, control most of southern
Colombia, the nation's dominant drug-producing region.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they have had no direct contact with
paramilitary members, although local community leaders say they
passed on news of the right-wingers' support. And top paramilitary
commanders insisted in interviews that theirs is an independent
effort to rid the region of cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Still, their enthusiastic embrace of the program puts the
Colombian and U.S. governments in an awkward position. At best, it
offers the promise of coca-free communities. At worst, it makes the
United States an unintentional partner of terrorists--and complicit
in their attempts to become "respectable."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and alternative development officials acknowledged that they
are concerned about the possibility that paramilitary soldiers might
force out or even kill those who don't cooperate with the eradication
plan but say that they see no way to stop such help.</TE>
<TE>   They said, however, that the militia's cooperation might help the
success of their alternative development program, which has failed to
live up to expectations in southern Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   "We're certainly happy that anybody is saying they support this
and will work toward manual eradication," said one U.S. State
Department official. "It remains to be seen if it will help."</TE>
<TE>   The development especially concerns human rights groups, because
the plan's success might turn on paramilitary muscle.</TE>
<TE>   However noble the goal, human rights officials said, the U.S. plan
has the potential to increase the region's instability and provide
legitimacy to a violent private army seeking to improve its
international reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "What this means for Colombia is poison," said Adam Isacson, the
Colombia expert at the Center for International Policy, a
left-leaning Washington think tank. "The Colombian government is
supposed to be making sure [alternative development] happens, not a
bunch of men with guns who follow their own law."</TE>
<TE>   It also remains to be seen how committed the paramilitary forces
will be to the strategy.</TE>
<TE>   The paramilitaries maintain that their main goal is to combat the
leftist guerrillas who have waged war against the Colombian
government for 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders Split on Drugs</TE>
<TE>   Paramilitary leaders have long admitted that they rely on profits
from drugs to support the estimated 11,000 paramilitary soldiers
fighting throughout Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   But recently, the paramilitaries have split over the issue. Their
former leader, Carlos Castano, dissolved the umbrella group
coordinating military operations, saying too many fronts were too
deeply involved in drug trafficking. Now the paramilitaries have
broken up into a series of private armies.</TE>
<TE>   The second largest of those armies, known as the Central Bolivar
Bloc, has said it will continue to rely heavily on drugs to finance
operations in some areas of southern Colombia under its control. But
in several interviews, leaders of the bloc argued that it makes sense
to give up coca, at least in the central Colombian region known as
Sur de Bolivar.</TE>
<TE>   First, it's a military strategy. Ridding the region of cocaine
makes it a less attractive target for leftist rebel groups, who also
exploit the profits from drugs to finance their operations.</TE>
<TE>   Second, most of the paramilitary fighters are from the region.
Getting rid of coca for legal crops improves their own community.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the plan also seems part of a series of recent moves made
by the paramilitaries to improve their image. It makes them allies
not only in Colombia's war against the guerrillas, but in the United
States' war against drugs.</TE>
<TE>   The paramilitaries have taken other steps, including giving up
headline-grabbing massacres and focusing instead on less noticeable
selective killings. In the end, such measures could help them win a
seat at peace negotiations and possibly amnesty for their acts.</TE>
<TE>   Here in the Sur de Bolivar region, bloc commanders said they hope
to rid the area of drugs and guerrillas in two years.</TE>
<TE>   But, they warned, the plan will only work with the help of the
U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   "The support of the national government, the private sector and
decisive international cooperation headed by the United States is
fundamental," Ernesto Baez, the political commander of the Central
Bolivar Bloc, said in an e-mail interview conducted with the help of
armed paramilitary fighters at a base just outside this colonial
Spanish town.</TE>
<TE>   Sur de Bolivar is a crossroads of violence, drugs and danger.</TE>
<TE>   The region runs along the Magdalena River, Colombia's version of
the Mississippi. The river is a crucial transport corridor for nearly
everything made in Colombia, from petroleum to African palm oil to
cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   The wide, dark river threads through jewel green lowlands.
Dirt-poor towns made of wood shacks cling to its banks. Banana
plantations and dense jungle line the long unpopulated gaps in
between. To the west, the San Lucas Mountains poke up like the edge
of a rusty saw blade.</TE>
<TE>   The region was long under the control of the country's smaller
leftist guerrilla army, the National Liberation Army. But two years
ago, the government proposed handing over part of Sur de Bolivar to
the guerrillas as a demilitarized zone for peace talks. Locals
rebelled, blocking roads and marching in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   They found ready help from the paramilitaries, who moved in and
within a matter of months had cleared the guerrillas from much of Sur
de Bolivar.</TE>
<TE>   "They control everything here," said Jorge Enrique Gomez, the
regional representative for the government's human rights office.
"We're not talking about paramilitaries. We're talking about a
para-state."</TE>
<TE>   The Rise of Coca</TE>
<TE>   As the paramilitaries consolidated control over the region by the
early part of last year, they also took control of its drug
trafficking. Sur de Bolivar accounts for almost 10% of the coca crops
in Colombia, which in turn produce 90% of the cocaine consumed in the
United States. The bright green bushes dot the hillsides throughout
the fertile region, although fumigation efforts last year severely
cut into the crops.</TE>
<TE>   Coca, which arrived in force in the mid-1980s, made some people in
Sur de Bolivar rich. But it also brought thousands of transient
workers, guerrilla conflict and aerial fumigation that killed
legitimate crops.</TE>
<TE>   In a matter of a decade, the once productive cattle and
agriculture zone had become a killing field.</TE>
<TE>   "More than 10 years of the production and exploitation of coca in
Sur de Bolivar has only left us with poverty, violence, prostitution,
alcoholism, ignorance and isolation," Baez said. "The narco-economy
completely distorts the ideals of progress and development."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in January, the paramilitaries began holding meetings
with local mayors, community leaders and dirt farmers to discuss
their plans to rid the region of cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   They helped local nonprofit groups organize a signature drive in
which they successfully won a promise from the Colombian national
government to temporarily suspend U.S.-backed aerial drug spraying in
Sur de Bolivar to give their plans time to work.</TE>
<TE>   They also made clear that those who continued to plant coca would
face the wrath of the community--and the paramilitaries.</TE>
<TE>   The local paramilitary commander in Sur de Bolivar, known as
Comandante Gustavo, said in an interview that there would be no
forced displacements of people.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he predicted that transient laborers who work as coca
pickers--an estimated 4,000 people--would simply pick up and leave.
The rest, he said, would bend to community pressure.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't spell out what would happen in case of resistance, but
those who have defied paramilitary demands in the past have often
been killed.</TE>
<TE>   "We realize that not all coca growers are going to want to give up
what they're doing," said Gustavo, noting that a farmer with 50 acres
can make about $40,000 a year on coca, an astronomical sum in the
area.</TE>
<TE>   "If they don't, we'll have a little meeting with them," he said.
"We, and the local farmers, will apply pressure."</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how many farmers actually would hesitate to give up
their coca. In numerous interviews throughout the region, no one
expressed reluctance to give up the crop.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't like seeing our children and our brothers and sisters
working with coca," said Hernando Ospina, a 52-year-old coca farmer
who heads a group of about 100 families seeking to replace their coca
plants with cattle. "We want to do things legally."</TE>
<TE>   Alternative development programs have largely failed in southern
Colombia, where leftist rebels have refused to cooperate and local
farmers have been unwilling to exchange their coca crops for less
profitable legal ones. The rebels could also prove a danger in Sur de
Bolivar if they manage to get a foothold and insist that coca
continue to be planted.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the U.S. Agency for International Development told
the Pan American Development Foundation, a nonprofit group tied to
the Organization of American States, in early June that it would be
interested in trying alternative crops in the northern part of
Antioquia state and in Sur de Bolivar--both paramilitary strongholds.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the first major push into the region by the United
States. The European Union has been active there for some time and
has pledged to provide $20 million to make the zone a "laboratory of
peace."</TE>
<TE>   In July, the foundation met with leaders from Asocipaz, a
nonprofit group in the region that has long been accused of being a
paramilitary front, who told the foundation that the paramilitaries
would support alternative development.</TE>
<TE>   Also in July, U.S. Ambassador Anne W. Patterson visited Sur de
Bolivar to review an ongoing program funded by the Colombian
government.</TE>
<TE>   Community leaders there told a member of her delegation that the
paramilitaries would support alternative development projects,
according to a local mayor present at the discussions.</TE>
<TE>   Both the foundation and U.S. State Department officials denied
that the paramilitary offer of support affected their decision to
launch the new program in the zone.</TE>
<TE>   Beto Brunn, the foundation's country director for Colombia, said
other factors influenced the decision. "We chose this area because
the FARC did not have a big presence," Brunn said, referring to the
country's largest leftist rebel army. "We picked an area where there
was a lot of coca."</TE>
<TE>   The $4-million project will begin later this month with the paving
of roads in the hills around this town perched above a broad estuary
just off the Magdalena River. The aim is to take out nearly 5,000
acres of coca in 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Weighing the Risks</TE>
<TE>   Brunn said he was uncertain about how to deal with the
paramilitaries' offer of cooperation. But he said he was worried
about the dangers it might bring.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, nobody will get killed for not eradicating coca," he
said. "That would be a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   But those who live and work in the area said it may be difficult
to avoid providing legitimacy to the paramilitaries.</TE>
<TE>   Father Francisco de Roux, a Franciscan priest who has long worked
in the area to promote human rights and alternative development,
acknowledged the complexity of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring the region would mean turning it over forever to control
of paramilitaries. But working in it means tolerating the active
support of lawless killers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   De Roux said the U.S. must choose its partners carefully. It must
work closely with local community members. And most of all, it must
in every instance try to refuse the help of the paramilitary forces.</TE>
<TE>   "If the U.S. is not very clear about avoiding deals with the
paramilitaries, it will be complicit with criminals," De Roux said.
"It will help destroy the rule of law in Colombia."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Court Bans Use of 'Human Shields'</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The temporary injunction comes after seven rights
groups complained about the army's use of unwilling Palestinian
civilians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israel's Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction Sunday barring
the army from using unwilling Palestinian civilians to knock on
suspicious doors, enter buildings it believes might be booby-trapped
and pick up dubious packages.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling came in response to a filing earlier in the day by a
coalition of seven human rights groups.</LD>
<LD>   Charges that the army has been using "human shields" hit the
headlines last week when a 19-year-old Palestinian, Nidal abu Muhsein
from the West Bank village of Tubas, was handed a bulletproof vest
and sent by the army to knock on the door of a nearby house. Wanted
Hamas leader Nasser Jerar was holed up inside.</LD>
<TE>   Muhsein--who had no police record and was never under
suspicion--knocked, the door opened, and the teenager fell dead in a
hail of bullets. It's a matter of debate who started the shooting.
The Israeli military then bulldozed the house and killed Jerar, who
was wanted on suspicion of planning several attacks against Israelis,
as Muhsein's body lay amid the rubble.</TE>
<TE>   The high court will decide at an as yet unscheduled hearing what
limits, if any, should be placed on the army's growing use of
Palestinian civilians to serve against their will as deterrents,
advance scouts and early warning systems.</TE>
<TE>   The seven human rights petitioners, led by the Legal Center for
Arab Minority Rights in Israel, or Adalah, say such tactics are
illegal under both the Geneva Conventions and Israeli law.</TE>
<TE>   The army, which terms its use of civilians a "neighbor practice,"
argues that the policy provides a necessary and effective deterrent
under extreme circumstances, and one that saves both Palestinian and
Israeli lives.</TE>
<TE>   Muhsein's family sees the matter differently.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lost our eldest son. We are in so much pain," said Abdul
Raouf abu Muhsein, Nidal's father, who says his child was chosen at
random because of his sturdy physique. "I can hardly bear to go into
my own house anymore. I still see him here, even though he's gone."</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Jacob Dallel, an army spokesman, said the military will
abide by whatever decision the high court hands down. He declined to
comment further, citing the ongoing judicial review.</TE>
<TE>   The seven human rights groups first filed a petition opposing the
use of human shields on May 4. Five days later, the army pledged to
stop all use of "living shields," and in response the groups set
aside their petition.</TE>
<TE>   The army now argues that it hasn't reneged on that pledge because,
according to its own definition, the civilians it continues to use
aren't human shields. A military official who requested anonymity
said human shields are civilians put in a direct line of fire, as for
instance when someone is tied to the front of a jeep that's being
shot at.</TE>
<TE>   When Palestinian civilians "help out" by entering houses ahead of
soldiers at the behest of local commanders, on the other hand,
they're not human shields since there's no imminent danger, military
officials argue. Furthermore, their use helps defuse a volatile
situation by making armed Palestinians think twice before shooting,
these officials add.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'neighbor practice' has a calming element," one military
official said. "Rather than having a soldier barge in and create
tension, this has been proven very effective. Often the wanted person
comes out."</TE>
<TE>   Others don't buy it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear from what happened in Tubas that the [military] broke
its promise," said Haaretz newspaper columnist Zeev Schiff, under an
article headlined "A Totally Unnecessary Death." "The army can win
and tactically overcome various obstacles without having to resort to
using civilians as 'human shields.' "</TE>
<TE>   The petition before the Supreme Court, drawing on material from
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, cites 40 recent
examples in which Palestinians from young boys to elderly
grandmothers were reportedly put in dangerous situations against
their will.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the examples, soldiers had 43-year-old Kamal Tawalbi and
his 14-year-old son stand in front of them on a balcony while using
their shoulders as gun rests to shoot at Palestinian gunmen.</TE>
<TE>   "These are all cases of human shields," said Marwan Dalal, an
Adalah staff attorney. "Calling this a 'neighbor practice' is a most
banal definition of human shields."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the army has expanded its use of Palestinian
noncombatants in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   "They're using it quite a bit," said Amos Harel, military
correspondent with Haaretz. "Their giving an answer to the Supreme
Court and still doing it says they think it's important. It probably
saves some lives, but it also costs some lives."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat Hinno, a 36-year-old Palestinian, says he was forced by the
army on April 8 to enter a series of houses as soldiers patrolled his
neighborhood in the West Bank city of Nablus. He scoffs at the idea
that such practices save Palestinian lives.</TE>
<TE>   "How can they say they're saving Palestinian lives when they're
taking me, an innocent civilian, who has nothing to do with the
resistance," he said Sunday. "They're saving their lives by putting
mine in danger. They believe Israeli lives are worth more than
Palestinians, which is not true, of course."</TE>
<TE>   A broader question that Israel, and indeed the United States, is
grappling with these days is how far to go in suspending civil
liberties in the name of security.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald Steinberg, head of conflict management at Bar Ilan
University near Tel Aviv, said that Israel is at war and that its
primary concern is to kill or capture terrorists. Ultimately, this is
a heavy counterweight to any human rights objection, he argues.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously there are red lines," he said. "You don't carpet-bomb
Gaza. But you also don't say you're not going to bomb anyplace where
you'll kill civilians."</TE>
<TE>   Others are more skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time you further bend the rule of law, it's a slippery
slope," said Uri Dromi of the Israel Democracy Institute. "It's never
enough. You find yourself in a place where democracy doesn't like to
be."</TE>
<TE>   Many ordinary Israelis seem to see little need for debate,
however.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen any polls on this, but I'd venture a guess that
the public is quite indifferent to the loss of Palestinian life,"
said Joseph Alpher, a political analyst. "They're so security-minded
at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Grossini, a 48-year-old electrician juggling a cell phone
en route to his next appointment, said that it's easy for outsiders
to sit in judgment but that Israel needs a strong hand. "If I can't
get my kids to school safely, I'll do what I have to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Sunday, Israeli security forces arrested 16 Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip suspected of being militants. And
Israel's national bus cooperative, Egged Co., announced that it plans
to sue Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat this month for
damages caused by Palestinian attacks on its vehicles, including
suicide bombings.</TE>

<HD>End of the Road for the Olds</HD>
<DH>With the 105-year-old brand slated to end in 2004, car
dealers such as Donny Ethington have a tough selling job.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHELBYVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>The manicured green pastures and white fence posts stretch over the
gentle hills of Kentucky's horse country all the way to Donny
Ethington's tidy car dealership with its fleet of new Aleros, Auroras
and Intrigues.</LD>
<LD>   It's not exactly bustling these days on the showroom floor
alongside U.S. Highway 60. Ethington manages to sell only one new car
about every two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is largely the brand. Ethington is selling the last of
the Oldsmobiles, the 105-year-old nameplate that General Motors Corp.
has put on death row after an unsuccessful effort to make it a viable
alternative to imports such as Honda, Volvo and Audi.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't do a lot of volume out here," Ethington says, chuckling
wearily.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always that way. For decades, Olds was known for
innovative cars, such as the 1949 Rocket 88 that inspired a blues
song by Ike Turner. But more recently, such models as the Omega and
the Achieva became odes to mediocrity.</TE>
<TE>   Oldsmobile is the most visible casualty yet in the intensifying
30-year battle waged against American brands by imports. While the
Olds brand fades out and sales drop through the floor, dealers such
as Ethington are left stranded, faced with one of the toughest
selling jobs in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Ethington represents the antithesis of the stereotypical car
dealer--the sweet-talking, crafty and deal-hungry salesman, the
perpetual bottom-dweller of surveys that measure consumer trust.
Ethington is a soft-spoken Southern gentleman, with wavy gray hair
and a brown vest, something of a father figure to his 30 or so
employees.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere at the dealership more resembles a living room than
a high-pressure sales office. Two teenage girls, Ethington's nieces,
are in a nonstop gabfest as they answer phones, chatter with friends
and keep a buzz going. A friend stops in to smoke a cigarette.
Salesmen shuffle around in the background, waiting--and waiting--for
a prospect.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough," Ethington says in his windowless office above the
showroom, worried about his extended family supported by the Olds
dealership in Shelbyville, population 10,085. Across the country,
sales of Oldsmobile's current models fell 36% over the first five
months of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Many upscale buyers wouldn't be caught dead in an Olds.</TE>
<TE>   The most loyal customers and the biggest market these days are in
Flint, Mich., the grimy GM factory town that has fallen on hard times
as the company has retrenched. By contrast, Los Angeles ranks among
the places a buyer would least covet the brand.</TE>
<TE>   The last Olds is due to roll off the assembly line sometime in
2004. As the brand travels down the highway to oblivion, the days
have grown darker at Ethington Oldsmobile, where Olds is the only
new-car brand the dealership carries. Resale prices of the five
models--the Alero compact, the Intrigue mid-size, the Aurora
full-size sedan, the Silhouette minivan and the Bravada sport utility
vehicle--have fallen significantly. "I've never seen them so cheap,"
Ethington says.</TE>
<TE>   It's not even worth it to Ethington to spend money on advertising
Olds; he relies on the national ads that GM puts out. Members of the
extended Ethington family nonetheless keep busy throughout the
dealership.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-year-old Donny has been in the car business since 1960 and
now owns the dealership with his brothers Jake, 52, and Jimmy, 44.
Donny's son Tim, 35, works full time in the financing department, and
a cousin, Hubert, 67, is a salesman. A niece works in finance and
insurance, and a nephew in wholesale. Jake's and Jimmy's 16-year-old
daughters, Casey and Jamie, work the desk at the showroom part time.</TE>
<TE>   With the economic crunch, things were difficult anyway. But GM's
decision in December 2000 to kill the Oldsmobile division pulled the
livelihood out from under dozens of new-car dealers who will have no
other brands to sell, or just one other brand that would have
difficulty sustaining a business on its own, such as low-volume GMC
or Cadillac.</TE>
<TE>   The Ethington brothers grew up in Shelbyville, where their father
was a tobacco farmer. They started out selling used cars; business
was good, but they wanted a new-car franchise. In 1985 Oldsmobile had
a banner year, selling nearly 1.1 million cars. The next year the
Ethingtons invested in their own dealership, a modest, stand-alone
Oldsmobile shop a quarter of a mile down the road from a Chrysler
dealer and across the street from a small local restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Ethington's not sure what will become of his family's dealership.
There isn't another car brand the family can take on to replace Olds.
All the others are represented in town except Cadillac, and the
brothers aren't likely to rope in Caddy.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a Cadillac dealer 17 miles one way and another 20 miles
the other way," Donny says.</TE>
<TE>   Other Olds dealers are in the same boat, wondering what will fill
the void left by Olds.</TE>
<TE>   "How can I make up the volume? That's a prime question," says Alan
Starling, an Oldsmobile-Chevrolet dealer in St. Cloud, Fla. "GM
expects me to reduce overhead and my expense structure. So, how can I
increase revenue? Work with Chevy and used cars, I guess. I need to
find a business or legal solution."</TE>
<TE>   The hard feelings are a sorry end to Oldsmobile, founded by Ransom
E. Olds in 1897 and taken over by investors in 1904 when Olds left
and formed the REO auto company.</TE>
<TE>   The legendary Billy Durant bought Oldsmobile in 1908, combining it
with Buick, which he already owned, thus forming General Motors,
today the world's largest auto maker.</TE>
<TE>   Olds put out some legendary cars in its time. The 1904 Curved Dash
was the first mass-produced vehicle in America, preceding the Model
T. It was powered by a one-cylinder, four-horsepower engine, weighed
650 pounds and cost $650--$1 per pound.</TE>
<TE>   In 1949 the Rocket 88 became a hit with the industry's first
high-compression V-8 engine. The car won six out of nine NASCAR Grand
National races in 1949, and more than a third of all Olds sales that
year were 88s.</TE>
<TE>   Then in 1951, Ike Turner penned the song "Rocket 88" for singer
Jackie Brenston: "You women have heard of jalopies / You've heard the
noise they make / Well let me introduce my new Rocket 88.... V8 motor
and this modern design, / Black convertible top and the gals don't
mind."</TE>
<TE>   Then came the 4-4-2 in 1964, named for its four-barrel carburetor,
four-speed transmission and dual exhaust. The 1966 Toronado was the
first modern-day front-wheel-drive vehicle and had sleek, new
styling.</TE>
<TE>   But there were duds too, especially from the '70s to the '90s. The
Firenze, Calais and Cutlass Ciera were part of a long slide down. The
1977 Delta 88 spurred a class-action lawsuit because it came with a
Chevy engine, not the Rocket 350. Later the Achieva became a staple
of rental car lots.</TE>
<TE>   "There were some really dreadful cars put out by Oldsmobile back
then," says Jim Hossack, vice president of consulting firm
AutoPacific Inc.</TE>
<TE>   GM had spent billions updating the Oldsmobile fleet but not
modernizing its image. In the last several years, Oldsmobile tried to
reposition the brand as an import fighter that would appeal to
younger buyers, with sleeker designs and catchy marketing such as
tie-ins with Olympic beach volleyball and rock concerts as well as
the "This is not your father's Oldsmobile" ad campaign. It also
invested in Internet advertising. The idea was to get the "old" out
of Oldsmobile.</TE>
<TE>   But GM didn't give the made-over Oldsmobile a chance to catch on
with consumers, says Jos Ferguson, who founded the Web site
www.saveoldsmobile.org, which has accounted for about half the 2,000
e-mails that GM has received lamenting the brand's demise.</TE>
<TE>   All of Ferguson's family bought Oldsmobiles. He gushes about the
1998 Intrigue he had, noting that it didn't have the word Oldsmobile
on the outside, and most of his friends thought it was an Acura.</TE>
<TE>   "We finally found a way for us to buy American and find dealer
service we like. Then they yanked it," says Ferguson, a 30-year-old
who works for an Internet company in Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Ethington agrees that GM improved the Olds line. He drives a 2001
Aurora, which he says "is a lot more car than the Cadillac Catera."</TE>
<TE>   But one of the Aurora's problems is its price, $30,000 to 35,000,
where it's outclassed by competitors such as the Lexus ES 300 and the
Acura TL. Olds also missed the truck boom, only in the last several
years offering an SUV, basically re-badged from Chevrolet.</TE>
<TE>   As imports won over more American buyers, Oldsmobile sales sank
quickly to 500,000 in 1990 and then 289,000 in 2000 when the plug was
finally pulled, despite the company's having completely redone the
product lineup to generally good reviews.</TE>
<TE>   GM's marketing effort was showing some results: The average age of
the Oldsmobile customer fell from 60 in 1996 to 49 in 2000, and 25%
of buyers were 35 or younger. But the momentum fell short. Basically,
"they still catered to the older market," Ethington says. "It's still
the 60-, 65-year-olds who come to shop."</TE>
<TE>   And Olds' efforts gained little notice outside the Midwest.
Besides Flint, Olds' top markets are Saginaw and Bay City, along with
seven other cities in Michigan or Ohio, according to the market
research firm R.L. Polk.</TE>
<TE>   The chief of Oldsmobile is general manager Debra Kelly-Ennis, who
works at GM headquarters in downtown Detroit. A former marketing whiz
at Procter &amp; Gamble Co., she describes GM's withdrawal of Olds as
something being done with "grace and dignity"--evoking images of
President Nixon's speeches about the end of Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   It's "certainly an unprecedented challenge," Kelly-Ennis says.
"People are sad, and you can't minimize that."</TE>
<TE>   Oldsmobile's marketing staff has been slimmed to just 16 from
about 50 when the announcement was made, though no assembly workers
have lost their jobs at plants in Michigan, Kansas, Georgia and Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of the Oldsmobile dealers have signed or have agreed to
sign separation agreements that provide compensation based on a
complex formula involving factors such as dealers' volume, product
mix and investments in renovation.</TE>
<TE>   But many are dissatisfied, even bitter, at GM's attempts to settle
and move on.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's absolutely criminal. It's like you killed my dog and
left $20 on the porch," says Leo Jerome, who owns two large
dealerships in Lansing, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   For the Ethingtons, GM's settlement offer isn't much. "It's very
little money, around $125,000," says Donny, who hasn't done any
remodeling in the last five years that would increase what is in
effect severance pay. "They want you to keep the parts. But I don't
think I need all those parts," he says of the $60,000 worth of motor
and transmission components, alternators, spark plugs and assorted
body parts he has in stock. "It would be kind of foolish for me to
keep the parts if I'm not an Olds dealer anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The Ethingtons are trying to boost their used-car business. Jake
roams car auctions several days a week, traveling from St. Louis and
Indianapolis to Atlanta and Harrisonburg, Pa.; they also sell used
cars wholesale to dealers in Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana and Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   But it's hard to swallow after hoisting the Oldsmobile flag for 17
years.</TE>
<TE>   Muses Donny, still incredulous: "How could a manufacturer screw it
up so bad it had to discontinue them?"</TE>

<HD>Isolated Forests Get Most Fire Aid</HD>
<DH>Funding: The bulk of U.S. money distributed in California
goes north. The Angeles National Forest, near millions of people,
lags far behind.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when national fire policy is emphasizing the importance of
reducing the threat of wild fires to nearby communities, the U.S.
Forest Service in California is spending the biggest chunks of its
fire prevention funds in some of the least populated parts of the
state.</LD>
<LD>   Nowhere is that pattern more starkly reflected than in the Angeles
National Forest. Backdrop, playground and watershed for millions
living in the Los Angeles Basin, the forest ranks at the bottom of
the funding ladder. The Angeles this year received less money for
reduction of hazardous fuel than any other federal forest in the
state. Its major thinning project last year consisted of sending in a
hungry herd of sheep to munch on the chaparral.</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, the Plumas National Forest, in a Northern California
county of 21,000 people, got $9.8 million, or about 21 times as much
as the Angeles. Plumas' neighbor, the Lassen National Forest,
collected $8.9 million.</LD>
<TE>   Fire prevention funding for forests in the central and southern
Sierra Nevada, where development is creeping up the foothills into
the woods, also trailed well behind Plumas and Lassen.</TE>
<TE>   So generously have those two out-of-the way forests been funded
that their fuel reduction budgets rival those of Colorado and
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   In large part, the Plumas-Lassen windfall represents a hard-won
political triumph for an unusual coalition. In a rural region, where
environmentalists, loggers and civic leaders tend to be at each
other's throats, all sides agreed on a forest thinning plan that
captured Washington's attention in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   It is that project, known as the Quincy Library Group after the
small-town coalition that helped craft it, that is funneling money to
the Plumas and Lassen forests and part of the Tahoe. Lately, the
project has been included in the National Fire Plan, a
multibillion-dollar program adopted by the forest service in 2000 to
accelerate thinning and controlled burning on federal land.</TE>
<TE>   The fire plan is an effort to reduce the wildfire threat in the
West, where some spectacularly large blazes have galloped across the
landscape in recent years. The fires have focused attention on what
is generally considered to be unnatural denseness in the region's
forests. For a variety of reasons--most notably a century of fire
suppression policies--many forests are thick with fire-prone smaller
trees and brush. The General Accounting Office in 1999 reported that
nearly 40 million acres of national forests in the West are at high
risk of devastating wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   While the National Fire Plan bumped up forest service spending on
fuel reduction projects throughout the state, the Quincy funding
kicked Plumas and Lassen onto a plane of their own.</TE>
<TE>   Last year 25,556 acres were thinned or subjected to controlled
burns in Lassen, the most of any forest in California. Plumas treated
nearly 21,000 acres, the second highest figure. None of the national
forests in Southern California treated more than 4,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   The disparity is particularly noticeable against the backdrop of
national fire policy, which says that a top priority of
fire-prevention work should be forests and brush next to homes and
communities. Similarly, a 10-year wildfire strategy recently endorsed
by Western governors names community protection as a primary aim.</TE>
<TE>   Communities of a few hundred or a few thousand people are
scattered around the Plumas and Lassen forests. Lassen National Park,
surrounded by the national forest, is among the least visited parks
in the national system.</TE>
<TE>   The Angeles, Cleveland and San Bernardino forests, on the other
hand, sit cheek by jowl with the second-largest metropolitan region
in the country. Housing tracts butt against them, busy roads slice
through them, and millions visit them.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at where fuel [reduction work] would do the greatest
good for the greatest number, that would probably be in Southern
California brush forests," said John Buckley, a former forest
firefighter who heads the Central Sierra Environmental Resource
Center.</TE>
<TE>   But the proximity of so many homes and people makes it harder to
do the necessary thinning and burning. Heavy equipment must share
suburban streets with throngs of impatient commuters. Strict
air-quality regulations limit the days when burning is permissible.
Moreover, the very nature of some forests, more brush than trees,
provides less economic incentive to do thinning. The companies that
contract for that work want to make a profit, and there's not much
profit in manzanita.</TE>
<TE>   Forest Service officials also point out that the Quincy funding
was directed by Congress, which responded to years of lobbying by the
coalition members who came together seeking a truce in the timber
wars of the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we've gotten the money we've gotten is because of the
community activity," said Merri Carol Martens, forest service
spokeswoman for the Quincy pilot project. "Quincy Library Group
members pursued that and had been pursuing that since 1993, long
before the headlines of catastrophic fires came into play."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who was instrumental in Quincy's
passage and remains its staunch protector, said the pilot project is
not just about about reducing fire risk. "That is for timber too--to
be able to do some selective logging. It's much more complicated than
just directed at fire."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if it made sense to locate a major fuel-reduction project in
some of the most sparsely populated reaches of the state, she
replied, "It makes sense to carry out the pilot project. It makes
sense to have a much bigger program of fire reduction throughout the
state."</TE>
<TE>   Figures from individual national forests in California indicate
that they thinned and carried out controlled burns on about 123,000
acres last year. That reflects a steady climb since 1993, when 11,500
acres were treated. But the acreage is expected to drop below 100,000
this year, as the forest service concentrates more on areas near
communities, where work is typically more costly and time-consuming
because added precautions are necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Most of California's 20 million acres of national forest are
considered to be at high or moderate risk of destructive fire. Kent
Connaughton, deputy regional forester in charge of fire programs in
California, estimated that a third to half of the forest land needs
thinning or controlled burns to clear out the most flammable growth.
To do that would require treating at least 300,000 acres a year, at
$200 million a year--more than four times what the forest service in
California expects to get this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased with the increases we've seen over the last couple
of years, but it doesn't give us everything we need," Connaughton
said. "We'd like to spend more money in Southern California, and
there is not a debate about that."</TE>
<TE>   Fire officers in Southern California said money is not the only
thing dictating how much they can do. "Some of it's money. Partially
it's not having the funding to do a large number of acres," said Don
Feser, forest fire chief for the Angeles. "But more restrictive is
just the few days that we can burn."</TE>
<TE>   The 600,000-acre Angeles is mostly chaparral, where fire
prevention consists primarily of prescribed burns to clean out dead
brush, along with some mechanical clearing to maintain fuel-break
openings along ridges. The forest also has used sheep, usually near
Santa Clarita in less steep terrain, to thin brush. "They eat
everything," Feser said.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, he said, the Angeles would like to treat about 10,000
acres a year, which would cost $2 million. He has not seen, nor does
he expect to see, that sum. "Two million dollars for fuels treatment?
Nah. It's a pipe dream."</TE>
<TE>   Last year the Angeles conducted prescribed burns on 1,663 acres
near development. Sheep thinned 2,000 acres. This year, because of
the record dry conditions, virtually no burning is being done.</TE>
<TE>   The work that could be considered the most urgent--near houses and
urban areas--can be the most difficult. If a controlled burn escapes,
it can destroy homes. If the wind blows the wrong way, it can blow
smoke into someone's living room. If clearing is done just beyond
someone's backyard, the residents may not like the way it looks.</TE>
<TE>   "Because you are operating near people's homes and residences,
people are more sensitive. It takes a lot more work," said Mike
Dietrich, fire management officer at the San Bernardino National
Forest. "You hang yourself out for public criticism. Under one
circumstance you can be a hero and another you can be a scapegoat."</TE>
<TE>   The forest service believes that it can treat more of the forests
more easily in remote regions.</TE>
<TE>   Compare the budgets of the San Bernardino, which at $1.2 million
received the most hazardous-fuel money this year of any Southern
California forest, and of the Modoc. Sprawled across California's
nearly empty northeast corner, much of it in a county of fewer than
10,000 people, the Modoc got $2.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   One central Sierra national forest that has tapped into the flow
of funds to the far north is the Stanislaus. Just north of Yosemite
National Park, it is collecting $2.4 million this year and last year
treated more than 15,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   That is not an accident. Stanislaus started paying attention to
fire prevention work after a 1987 blaze blackened 147,000 acres.
"When that fire hit, we all felt it, saw it and lived it," said Pat
Kaunert, acting public affairs officer for the Stanislaus.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officers said that communities scattered around the forest
support thinning and burning projects, and Buckley said his group,
which monitors the Stanislaus, agreed not to appeal fire hazard work
as long as it did not involve old-growth trees. With such support and
interest, the Stanislaus has moved ahead of many other forests in
California.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of where the project is, forest officials said, a year
or two of planning and environmental analysis is required before work
can start on the ground. The Bush administration would like to
streamline the process.</TE>
<TE>   "[We're] looking at our own decision-making and seeing if we're
spending too much time and agony in justifying these things," said
Mark Rey, U.S. Department of Agriculture undersecretary in charge of
the forest service. "Many of these fuel treatments are very similar,
whether in Lassen or Tahoe. Can we be looking at a template that
reduces the time to do them?"</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the forest service's job has not been cleaning out
the woods near communities for fire protection. It cut down trees for
timber and put out wild fires as quickly as possible to avoid
destroying the timber.</TE>
<TE>   "The ship of the forest service is hard to get turned in another
direction," said Sue Husari, until recently the service's deputy
director for fire and aviation management in California. "We are
trying to go in that direction as quickly as we can."</TE>

<HD>Inequities in Pedestrian Deaths</HD>
<DH>Safety: Times study finds Latinos, seniors at highest risk.
L.A. County leads in walker fatalities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN and MALOY MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Luis Bosch Guzman served as a U.S. Army sergeant in Panama and Pearl
Harbor before moving to Echo Park to enjoy retirement with his three
children and wife of nearly 50 years. But on a rainy February morning
in 1996, he became another pedestrian fatality on the increasingly
crowded streets of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The 77-year-old native of Puerto Rico was hit by a speeding pickup
truck as he crossed busy Alvarado Boulevard to buy a newspaper near
his Echo Park home. The driver, who was never cited, told police he
was in a hurry to get to work and didn't see the man in the crosswalk
until it was too late.</LD>
<LD>   In several respects--his age, his ethnic background and the
location of the accident--Bosch's death is typical of those that have
made Los Angeles County the nation's leader in pedestrian fatalities.</LD>
<TE>   A Times analysis of more than 2,500 pedestrian deaths from 1993
through 2001 found that although the fatal accidents are concentrated
in densely populated urban neighborhoods, the county's deadliest
streets are not necessarily its busiest. The study also found that
government efforts to improve pedestrian safety have not always
occurred in areas with the most deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The deaths occur in crowded urban neighborhoods that, like Echo
Park, are bisected by busy thoroughfares that commuters use to avoid
crowded freeways. The communities of Westlake, Hollywood, Boyle
Heights and South and Central Los Angeles have been especially hard
hit.</TE>
<TE>   African Americans and Latinos are killed in disproportionate
numbers in pedestrian accidents and particularly in hit-and-run
collisions. And older pedestrians, like Bosch, also suffer
disproportionately. The analysis found that nearly 30% of pedestrians
killed from 1993 through 2001 were 65 or older, even though that age
group represents only 10% of the population.</TE>
<TE>   Who is at fault is not always clear. The point of impact in more
than 80% of the accidents was outside an intersection, where traffic
moves faster and where pedestrians aren't expected, according to the
study.</TE>
<TE>   Still, police say motorists often share the blame by speeding or
driving drunk.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic planners say they have taken steps to improve pedestrian
safety, from adding pavement striping at intersections to installing
so-called smart crosswalks that flash overhead warnings when someone
steps off the curb.</TE>
<TE>   Police sting operations at crosswalks and pedestrian safety
classes at local schools have also become common.</TE>
<TE>   But The Times' analysis shows that the streets with the most
pedestrian deaths have not always been at the top of the list for
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The computer-assisted analysis studied the dates, locations and
circumstances of each pedestrian death during the nine-year period,
as well as the age and race of the victims. Each death was also
mapped to identify patterns.</TE>
<TE>   According to the analysis, the most dangerous streets and
intersections in Los Angeles County include:</TE>
<TE>   * Vermont Boulevard from Hollywood Boulevard to the Santa Monica
Freeway. There were 17 fatal pedestrian accidents in that 3 1/2-mile
stretch during the nine-year study period. The thoroughfare, which
runs through Westlake, the most densely populated neighborhood in Los
Angeles, is often plagued by speeders, according to police.
Pedestrian fatalities have been particularly heavy around the Metro
Rail station at the corner of Sunset Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   * The intersection of Alvarado and Glendale boulevards in Echo
Park, a few blocks south of where the Glendale Freeway ends abruptly,
dumping nearly 30,000 cars per day into a heavily residential
neighborhood. Speeding is a stubborn problem on both streets,
according to police. Nine pedestrians--including Bosch--were killed
on those two streets between the Glendale Freeway and Sunset
Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   * Whittier Boulevard in East Los Angeles between Goodrich
Boulevard and the Long Beach Freeway. The four-lane road runs through
a busy shopping district and is heavily used by commuters heading
into downtown Los Angeles. Eight fatal pedestrian accidents took
place on that stretch of road.</TE>
<TE>   * Near the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard and Western
Avenue in Hollywood. Both streets are wide, busy roads that have
become popular commuting routes for motorists heading to West Los
Angeles. Five pedestrians have been killed in the quarter-mile around
that intersection in the last nine years.</TE>
<TE>   John Fisher, assistant general manager of the Los Angeles
Department of Transportation, said the city is concerned about
protecting pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he concedes that his department often struggles to strike a
balance between improving traffic flow and safeguarding pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to provide pedestrian amenities, but the policymakers
don't want more congestion," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County regularly leads every county in the nation in
pedestrian fatalities--with 230 deaths last year. In fact, the
county's pedestrian death toll surpasses that of all but three
states.</TE>
<TE>   When adjusted for population, however, the county ranks seventh,
behind the Detroit area's Wayne County, the Phoenix area's Maricopa
County and San Bernardino County, among others.</TE>
<TE>   And the county's pedestrian death toll has declined steadily, from
310 in 1993 to 230 last year. Experts attribute the decline to
improved police enforcement, an overall drop in fatal street
accidents and greater spending on pedestrian safety improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest city in the county, Los Angeles, has not followed that
trend.</TE>
<TE>   According to coroner's records, the number of pedestrian deaths in
the city of Los Angeles seesawed between 1993 and 1997 but has
remained steady for the last four years, with 104 fatalities last
year.</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder Los Angeles has earned a national reputation for
being a place where cars are king and pedestrians are often
second-class citizens. That image was even put to music in the 1980s
pop hit with the lyric, "Nobody walks in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Transportation officials and law enforcement agencies throughout
the county have attacked the image with several tactics.</TE>
<TE>   City and county records show that dozens of pedestrian improvement
projects are planned throughout the region in the next two or three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most popular are smart crosswalks, which use flashing
lights to warn drivers when a pedestrian steps off a curb.</TE>
<TE>   But such upgrades are scarce or nonexistent on the streets and
intersections where The Times' study has determined that pedestrian
fatalities have been heaviest.</TE>
<TE>   For example, on the 3 1/2-mile stretch of Vermont Boulevard that
has claimed 17 lives, there are no smart crosswalks, flashing lights
or ladder-striped crosswalks.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, at the city's Transportation Department, said the city has
never created a map that identifies the location of each pedestrian
death. Instead, he said, the city regularly examines streets and
intersections where pedestrian deaths occur to determine whether
street improvements will reduce future fatalities.</TE>
<TE>   Safety improvements are sometimes rejected, he said, when it is
determined that the accident was due to human error that could not
have been prevented by a costly fix.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes when people dart out at mid-block, we can't control
that with a new crosswalk," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pedestrian activists have demanded more spending for extensive
improvements, such as extending curbs to force motorists to slow when
making right turns, landscaping medians to give pedestrians a refuge
when crossing streets, and narrowing wide streets to reduce vehicle
speeds and shorten the distance pedestrians must cross.</TE>
<TE>   But some transportation experts say such improvements, which are
more commonly found in smaller cities like Santa Monica and West
Hollywood, would be prohibitively expensive in Los Angeles, a city
that maintains about 6,400 miles of streets and 40,000 intersections.</TE>
<TE>   "If you consider the miles of street and the number of
intersections in Los Angeles, it's more than what the city can
afford," West Hollywood City Engineer Sharon Perlstein said</TE>
<TE>   Fisher agreed, noting that the city can afford to install only 10
smart crosswalks a year, at a cost of $45,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say that it's for lack of effort that we have some of
these accidents," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   The city more than doubled its spending on new sidewalks from $8.2
million last year for 46 miles of sidewalks to $17.6 million for 98
miles this year.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time the city has received less funding for
pedestrian projects from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority,
the regional agency that distributes federal and state transportation
dollars. The agency approved $21.3 million for pedestrian projects
countywide last year--more than double the amount spent in 1995--but
the city's share dropped from $8.4 million in 1995 to $8 million last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Murphy, founder of LA Walks, a pedestrian advocacy group,
charges that transportation officials in Los Angeles won't invest in
such expensive improvements because the city is primarily concerned
with improving traffic flow. She noted that Los Angeles has removed
dozens of pedestrian crosswalks between intersections on busy streets
in the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires motorists to yield to pedestrians in crosswalks
and at intersections, even if there is no crosswalk painted at the
intersection.</TE>
<TE>   But pedestrians also bear the responsibility of crossing at
crosswalks and intersections and only when conditions are safe.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher confirmed that the city removed 21 crosswalks last year. He
said studies have shown that pedestrian accidents are reduced when
mid-block crosswalks are removed, forcing pedestrians to cross at
intersections.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also point out that spending on pedestrian improvements
does not always guarantee a drop in pedestrian deaths.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Santa Monica has spent $2.5 million since 1998 to
install flashing pedestrian crossings, extend curbs, landscape
medians and make other improvement on several major streets. But
since the improvement campaign began, pedestrian deaths there
increased from four in 1998 to seven last year.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Rambeau, a Santa Monica spokeswoman, said street improvements
help reduce pedestrian accidents but often do little to change the
dangerous behavior of drivers and pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the worst spots for pedestrian deaths has been the Echo
Park neighborhood where Bosch was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Bosch's daughter, Lourdes Bosch-Taylor, said that even though her
father was aware of the dangers of crossing Alvarado Boulevard, he
continued to make it part of his regular morning walk.</TE>
<TE>   On that dreary February morning six years ago, Bosch had almost
made it all the way across the wide boulevard when the traffic signal
changed, according to police reports.</TE>
<TE>   A landscape worker in a pickup truck, who later told police he was
running late for work, hit Bosch in the crosswalk, throwing him to
the pavement. He died five hours later.</TE>
<TE>   "Something has to be done because innocent people are being killed
because other people are late for work," Bosch-Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the elderly are more likely to be victims of fatal
pedestrian accidents because they take longer to cross a street and
are less likely to survive their injuries than younger victims.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Officer Carlos Sanchez, who patrols that Echo
Park neighborhood, blames such deaths on speeding commuters who drive
Alvarado and Glendale boulevards as if they were freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, this neighborhood is dead center of a major
artery," he said. "The attitude of commuters is: 'I have to get to
work.' "</TE>
<TE>   The higher speeds have turned some city streets into
mini-freeways, putting pedestrians in mortal danger just by standing
on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Three months after Bosch died, two toddlers, Luisa Cornejo, 2, and
Edwin Camacho, 3, were killed at the same intersection. The children
and their parents were standing on the corner, waiting to cross
Alvarado Boulevard, when the driver of a Chevy van made an illegal
turn and struck an oncoming car that went spinning into the group of
pedestrians, according to a coroner's report.</TE>
<TE>   The impact threw Luisa out of her stroller and up against a
concrete retaining wall. Edwin, who was standing alongside his
father, suffered severe head injuries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Latinos and African Americans make up 55% of the county's
population, but they represent 59% of the victims of fatal pedestrian
accidents and 70% of the victims of fatal hit-and-run accidents,
according to the Times analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Why do these groups suffer in such disproportionate numbers?</TE>
<TE>   Police and transportation experts say blacks and Latinos often
live in densely populated communities and typically have less access
to a car than whites. Thus, they have a greater tendency to walk and
use public transit to get around, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The Times' analysis of pedestrian deaths in Los Angeles County
supports that conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Fatal pedestrian accidents, including hit-and-run deaths, are
heaviest in communities with large black and Latino populations, such
as South and Southeast Los Angeles. In contrast, the analysis found
that pedestrian deaths occurred infrequently in high-income,
predominantly white communities such as Marina Del Rey, Beverly Hills
and Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher said his department plans to launch a pedestrian safety
campaign that will include literature in Spanish to reach the
region's growing Latino population.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a quarter of all pedestrian deaths in Los Angeles County
are blamed on hit-and-run drivers, according to the analysis. Police
say hit-and-run drivers often flee because they have no license or
insurance or are wanted by the police for other offenses.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows why the driver who killed 8-year-old Ionon Harris Jr.
fled.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 5, 2001, Ionon, his sister, I'yana, 7, and their father,
Ionon Harris Sr. were returning to their Compton home after spending
a Sunday afternoon at Earvin "Magic" Johnson Recreation Area. The
three were crossing busy El Segundo Boulevard at Clovis Street--an
intersection without a painted crosswalk--when a man in a white Ford
Tempo struck the boy and sped away. A $25,000 reward has been offered
for information leading to the driver's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Det. Scott Sherman said it is common for motorists who hit
children to panic and flee. "When you run over a child, there is a
certain stigmatism," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ionon's mother, Audrey Kay Ellis, described her son as loving and
generous.</TE>
<TE>   "He would go to McDonald's and if he saw a homeless person, he
would give them his hamburger," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A week after Ionon died, a 55-year-old woman and her 7-year-old
granddaughter were struck and killed while crossing El Segundo
Boulevard, just three blocks west of Clovis Street.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County officials say that stretch of road does not
meet state standards for a crosswalk. Instead, county crews recently
installed flashing pedestrian warning lights and a plaque in memory
of Ionon Harris Jr.</TE>

<HD>Fear of Disease Triggers Order to Kill 25,000 Deer</HD>
<DH>Wisconsin: The move has sparked an outcry, as few animals
have been found to have chronic wasting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BARNEVELD, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Desperate to control a mysterious wildlife disease, Wisconsin
authorities have set out to kill 25,000 deer at the epidemic's
epicenter, in a mass slaughter that sickens even those who support
it.</LD>
<LD>   Chronic wasting disease has been identified in just two dozen deer
here. But the fatal brain illness, related to "mad cow" disease, has
hunters spooked about eating local venison. Hundreds of thousands
could stay away from the Wisconsin woods this fall, devastating the
state's $1-billion-a-year hunting industry. So, although they are not
at all sure the plan will work, state wildlife managers are trying to
destroy every deer that could have been exposed.</LD>
<LD>   The state has hired teams of sharpshooters to patrol the wooded
hills of southwestern Wisconsin at night, picking out deer with
spotlights. In an unprecedented summer hunt, private citizens are
being asked to kill even fawns.</LD>
<TE>   At carcass collection centers, technicians methodically decapitate
deer 15 hours a day to test the brains for chronic wasting. On a
blood-slick table, they plunk down those shot the previous night: A
buck, his antlers soft with velvet fuzz. Two fawns with spotted
hides. A doe, her swollen tongue protruding from clenched teeth.
Without a word, the technicians saw through the spinal columns, deer
by deer. They wrap the severed heads in trash bags and pack them into
a cooler to send to the lab. A musty smell, curling toward putrid,
hangs thick in the hazy dawn.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't make anyone feel good," says Carl Batha, a supervisor
for the state Department of Natural Resources, which is overseeing
the kill.</TE>
<TE>   Adds Meg Zigler, pulling on her gloves to wrap a head: "It's
pretty sad."</TE>
<TE>   Chronic wasting is not new: First identified in 1967, the disease
has been endemic for decades among the sparse deer herds that
straddle northern Colorado and southern Wyoming. It also has popped
up on commercial deer and elk ranches in Nebraska, Montana, Kansas,
Oklahoma and South Dakota, prompting authorities in those states to
kill thousands of captive animals.</TE>
<TE>   But the discovery this year of three bucks infected with chronic
wasting in southwestern Wisconsin set off a panic. It was the first
time the disease had been spotted east of the Mississippi River,
where deer herds are so dense that chronic wasting could spread
rapidly. It also was the first time that the disease had shown up in
a heavily hunted wild deer population. (More recently, one mule deer
in New Mexico has tested positive for the disease; scientists are
examining other animals in the region.)</TE>
<TE>   Chronic wasting has never been shown to sicken humans. But
scientists note that mad cow disease jumped the species barrier and
infected at least 125 Europeans with an agonizing, fatal brain
disorder. No expert will say with complete assurance that chronic
wasting can't do the same.</TE>
<TE>   So politicians and biologists alike warn of disaster if the
disease gains ground in Wisconsin. The state's whitetail herd is
famously abundant; hunters come from all 50 states and from half a
dozen foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   Hunting deer in the frosty nip of a November dawn is as much a
family tradition in the state as madly cheering the Green Bay
Packers. Already facing a record budget deficit, Wisconsin
politicians did not want to lose millions in hunting license fees and
millions more in lodging and equipment sales if a large number of the
state's 690,000 hunters gave up their fall ritual.</TE>
<TE>   And biologists warned that if the deer were not hunted, the
population would explode out of control.</TE>
<TE>   More motorists would be endangered by collisions with deer. More
farmers would lose corn and soybeans to hungry interlopers. Disease,
including chronic wasting, would spread more rapidly through the
overcrowded herds. "It's not a real rosy picture," says Tom Hauge,
the state's wildlife director.</TE>
<TE>   So authorities, grimly, set a course for slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   After routine testing of dead deer found the three infected bucks
in February, the state moved quickly to test several dozen other
whitetail in the area. Pinpointing each infection on a map,
scientists identified a 400-square-mile "hot spot" of infection. That
became known as the kill zone.</TE>
<TE>   All 25,000 deer within it are marked for extinction.</TE>
<TE>   Live animals cannot be tested for the disease; their brains must
be sliced, stained and studied under a microscope. So every deer
killed within the zone will be decapitated and their brains sent to a
lab in Madison. Scientists need to test every one to find out how far
the disease has spread and to estimate how long it may have been
incubating in the herd.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to eradicate the disease is to eradicate the
transmitters of the disease, and those are the deer," says Tom
Howard, a state biologist. "It seems like a real harsh thing to do,
but it's necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Experts acknowledge that even killing every deer in the infected
zone may not vanquish chronic wasting.</TE>
<TE>   The disease is caused by a mutant protein, called a prion, that
infects healthy brains and converts normal proteins to its own
twisted, deadly form. Prions are incredibly hardy: They can survive
in soil for years and can withstand high temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   Even with all the sick deer dead, prions could persist in the
environment--deposited there by infected saliva, feces or carcasses.
Healthy deer moving into the region years later could pick up the
infection. Wisconsin officials are hoping that the disease hasn't
been established here long enough for prions to build up in the soil.
The truth is, though, no one can be sure.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know," says Beth Williams, a Wyoming researcher who is
perhaps the nation's top authority on chronic wasting.</TE>
<TE>   "But we do know, if we don't eradicate the deer, [the disease]
will persist for sure," Hauge says.</TE>
<TE>   So the state Department of Natural Resources has declared killing
and testing deer its top priority. River experts have been reassigned
to the decapitation tables. Forest and prairie specialists have been
ordered to set aside the tasks that usually occupy them in
summer--clearing trails, planting habitat, tracking duck
migration--for a single-minded focus on chronic wasting.</TE>
<TE>   They answer dozens of phone calls a week from panicked citizens.
They plead with landowners to allow state hunters on private
property. They pack blaze-orange backpacks for the sharpshooters:
latex gloves, drag ropes, walkie-talkies, searchlights, extra
batteries.</TE>
<TE>   In the rolling fields and forests of the eradication zone, the
agency has organized one-week public hunts in June, July and August.
A fourth hunt will take place in September. In addition, the fall
hunting season has been extended from the traditional nine days to
more than three months.</TE>
<TE>   Come winter, the state may send in helicopters to do an aerial
kill. For now, it has hired dozens of sharpshooters to hunt at night,
when deer are often more active. The shooters flood the shadowy woods
with spotlights. The deer freeze. The men poke rifles out their truck
windows and take them down. No one relishes the job.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taking the deer in ways that are not ethical," Batha says.
"You can't dwell on that, because you'll get depressed."</TE>
<TE>   As the eradication campaign revs up, so has criticism. Opponents
point out that chronic wasting has been around for decades in the
West. In Wyoming's hot spot, about 12% of deer are infected. Where
the disease is endemic in Colorado, 5% of the herd is sick. Those
numbers are inching upward, but slowly.</TE>
<TE>   So why not learn to live with a small percentage of infected deer
in Wisconsin? "Let the sick ones die," urges Linda Derrickson, a
vocal critic. "Our herd will get stronger in the long run."</TE>
<TE>   If action must be taken, why not wait a few months for more data?
critics ask. Wisconsin officials hope to test another 25,000 deer
that are killed in a normal fall hunting season from outside the
eradication zone--at least 500 from each county. Until those results
are in, authorities cannot say for sure whether southwestern
Wisconsin is the most critical place to take a stand.</TE>
<TE>   "They're pulling the trigger a little too quick on mass
extermination," complains Mark Sherven, an avid hunter who founded
Citizens Against Irrational Deer Slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Other critics express fear that the all-out hunt could endanger
public safety. Every government sharpshooter must walk his territory
during daylight and write up a safety plan. Still, local resident
Ross Reinhold says he and some buddies were "knocked off our feet" by
a shot that was "way too close" to his back deck one recent evening.</TE>
<TE>   "All I could think about was that when my boys were young, they
might have been out there catching fireflies, or camping, or just
goofing around," Reinhold says.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to gauge how deep such opposition runs. Just half the
landowners in the eradication zone have given permission for summer
hunting on their property. On land that homeowners have declared
off-limits, deer graze placidly in plain sight, fawns tucked up close
to their mothers. But officials expect many more landowners to allow
hunting this fall.</TE>
<TE>   At public forums to press their case, state experts explain that
Wisconsin's deer population is so dense, there's little hope that the
disease would hold steady at 5% or 10% of the herd, as in the West.
Left unchecked, they say, it could decimate the state's entire
population of 1.5 million whitetails. The best bet is to wipe it out
now before the prions get established in the soil.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, they ask, what do they lose by trying? At most,
25,000 deer in the kill zone and another 25,000 brought in for
testing from elsewhere in the state. That is a lot.</TE>
<TE>   But state officials point out that about 40,000 deer die each year
in Wisconsin after being hit by cars. And 400,000 are slain in a
typical hunting season, a sizable kill that wildlife biologists
believe is necessary to control the size of the herd.</TE>
<TE>   Most hunters understand those numbers. It's not the deaths that
bother them. It's the idea that tens of thousands of healthy animals
will be tossed into an incinerator, shot not to feed families but to
try to stop a disease that might be unbeatable.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, the hunters who stalk the kill zone could eat the meat.
In practice, frightened by the possibility of infection, just 12% of
summer hunters have kept their venison.</TE>
<TE>   Hunters who swear by the ethic of using what they kill find the
waste of all that venison almost sacrilege.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I did this, I was thinking, this is great, I'm
going to get to hunt and be paid for it," says Charles Kilian, a
state biologist tapped as a sharpshooter. "Then I went to collect the
doe I shot. I looked at her and realized I wasn't going to use her,
and it was an emotional crash."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Davis, a retired biology professor, echoes that experience.
Convinced that the slaughter is necessary, he sits for hours at dusk
in a field near his house, bolt-action Remington across his knees,
scouring the weedy brush for deer. But he is repelled by the idea of
shooting an animal he will not eat. This to him is not hunting--it's
killing. "You have to close your mind to it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   A shot rings out down the road. Davis keeps his hand on the rifle.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something you just have to do," he says. "And you do it."</TE>

<HD>French Quarter Icon Loses Je Ne Sais Quoi</HD>
<DH>New Orleans: At Galatoire's, ice cubes, Visa and jeans
aren't as bad as Gilberto's absence, some gripe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>If you didn't know any better, you might think the trouble began when
a beloved, bespectacled waiter named Gilberto got fired. But in
truth, the storm over this antique French eatery had been gathering
for years.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe the fracas was inevitable. How could Galatoire's, a last
bastion of French Quarter gentility, expect to slip gracefully into
another century? When machine cubes took the place of hand-chipped
ice, the clientele griped. When the dress code weakened, they
groused. When the restaurant accepted credit cards, they groaned. The
changes were subtle--just the passing of time, really. Nevertheless,
they blew an unnerving whiff of extinction into the air, and like
some great endangered pack, the elite of New Orleans girded for a
proper French Quarter revolution.</LD>
<LD>   "I wouldn't dream of going to Galatoire's without a coat and tie,"
said Kenneth Holditch, a retired American literature professor who's
writing a book about the 97-year-old restaurant. "And then to have to
sit next to people wearing culottes!"</LD>
<TE>   The rumblings of discontent exploded into a melee of manners after
iconic waiter Gilberto Eyzaguirre was fired. The highly educated
Peruvian immigrant started waiting tables at Galatoire's a week after
he arrived in the United States in 1979. To his customers, Eyzaguirre
had been the incarnation of Galatoire's. He remembered their drinks,
whisked their appetizers to the table before they'd ordered, gave
them lifts to appointments on his days off.</TE>
<TE>   "I was part of the life there," said Eyzaguirre, 56. "It wasn't
just business, and it wasn't just friendship. It was even more
profound."</TE>
<TE>   Eyzaguirre said he was fired for sexual harassment this spring
after two women on the wait staff accused him of touching their arms
and backs inappropriately. The restaurant won't discuss the
dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   As news of the decidedly modern scandal rippled through the silks
and tweeds of Galatoire's, turmoil broke loose. Some of the eatery's
oldest patrons cried for a boycott pending the return of their
favorite waiter. More than 100 letters of protest poured in. The
complaints came from Sweden and Montana and Tucson, but mostly they
came from New Orleans, penned in calligraphy on monogrammed
stationery, signed by doctors and professors and military men.</TE>
<TE>   A Web site, WeloveGilberto.com, shows off photographs of a
grinning Eyzaguirre, letters from the disgruntled diners and an
"action plan" that--genteel to its core--stops short of proposing any
actual labor of either the physical or mental variety.</TE>
<TE>   Le Chat Noir cabaret has a lengthy waiting list for the "Galatoire
Monologues," a piece of impromptu performance art in which the
protest letters are read aloud--by the rabble-rousers themselves,
sometimes--while an interpretive dancer arches and stomps.</TE>
<TE>   "We are so vain in New Orleans--just give us a mirror and we're
happy," said stage manager Su Gonczy. "They all feel royal, descended
from kings, and anything that talks about them is fabulous. But
there's this drumbeat of losing their old world, this comfortable,
elegant, very slow world. And that's where the grief comes from."</TE>
<TE>   To understand why any of this matters, one must first relinquish
the notion of Galatoire's, the restaurant. Eating the lauded Creole
cuisine is a side amusement here; Galatoire's is really a sanctuary
for old-fashioned, unapologetic elitists, who counted on the
brilliant roomscape of light and crystal to stand firm against New
Orleans' riotous, restless jubilee. "It was a time warp," said a
wistful Holditch.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an icon," maitre d' Arnold Chabaud said. "It doesn't happen
anyplace else, and there's no explanation for it."</TE>
<TE>   The traditions are rigid and plentiful: You waited in line to get
into Galatoire's. Or, more probably, you paid somebody else to stand
in the queue. Once inside, you requested your waiter--the one who has
been dishing your shrimp remoulade, crabmeat sardou and banana bread
pudding for decades. You tipped more than generously, because you
understood that Galatoire's was staffed by career waiters and
operated in a system of old-fashioned patronage.</TE>
<TE>   You paid cash or ran a house account. You whispered about the
other diners, which was easy, because the mirrored walls of
Galatoire's let you cast an eye over every face in the room without
so much as turning your head. You came for lunch, but you stayed
through dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "My contention," Chabaud said, "is Galatoire's began when people
were dirt poor, and it was the one place they could go and be treated
like they were somebody. If a lady had just one nice dress in the
closet, she'd wait all week to put it on and come out to
Galatoire's."</TE>
<TE>   The Galatoire family still runs the bistro, and much of New
Orleans' upper crust still jockeys to lunch in the lively first-floor
dining room. But the apparition of blue jeans at the next table, the
disappearance of embroidered napkins--these things are ominous
augurs, all, to the hard-core traditionalists. The changes mean one
thing: Old-timers are losing ground in the long and painful battle to
preserve the soul of the French Quarter, a strip of stone, soft wood
and sweaty humanity that is arguably the nation's most defiantly
anachronistic swath of real estate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part and parcel of what's happening to the French Quarter,"
said Holditch, who stopped dining at Galatoire's after Eyzaguirre's
dismissal. "It's losing its old traditions. A lot of things have
suddenly disappeared."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the Old Town Praline Shop on Royal Street--the
one with the fresh pralines, the one that shunned air conditioning in
favor of a vast ceiling fan--shut down. The family that ran the
Chinese laundry sold it off. The Bourbon Street curio shop where the
mythical Blanche DuBois bought her paper lantern is long gone. The
department stores on Canal went under. New hotels cropped up. Francis
Ford Coppola bought a house, and so did Nicolas Cage.</TE>
<TE>   Modernity comes right up to Galatoire's threshold. It's in the
mango daiquiris peddled for $7 on the corner. It's in the polyester
lingerie and Candy Pants laid like pirate's booty in the window case
of Bourbon Strip Tease next door. It's in the twinkling riot of beer
signs--Miller Lite! Coors! Budweiser!--in the window of the oyster
bar across the street. It's shuffling past in flip-flops and tank
tops, circling too close for comfort.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter posted on Gilberto's Web site, Jules Jordy Jr. dubbed
the evolution of Galatoire's "an inexorable slide of Western culture
toward a so-called classless, lowest-common-denominator type
society."</TE>
<TE>   "Just imagine some sweaty tourist in a baseball cap and sneakers,
from Dallas or Kansas City, with toothpick twirling between his lips,
demanding A-1 sauce for the trout amandine and ketchup to put on the
souffle potatoes," Jordy wrote.</TE>
<TE>   From the streets outside, the dull pump and moan of a blues bass
seep through the dining room walls. Sometimes the sound comes through
so loud that an interloper might mistake it for muted dinner
music--but that would be a mistake, indeed. There is not now, nor has
there ever been, dinner music at Galatoire's.</TE>
<TE>   "Galatoire's," said manager Melvin Rodrigue, "has its own music."</TE>
<TE>   And so it does. Voices clatter off the flat ceiling like marbles
scattered on a floor. A pleasant porcelain cacophony pours forth from
the kitchen. If you aren't expecting it to look the way it did 10
years ago, it's a vista so convincingly ornate the exit signs stand
out as peculiarly contemporary. This is a screen on which the
tragicomedies of New Orleans have been played out for decades, for
generations. Tennessee Williams, they say, had a table here.</TE>
<TE>   The brooding mahogany pillars and brass light fixtures still
gleam. The somber black-and-white mugs of the founding family still
glower down from the walls. You can't see Bourbon Street from the
dining room. The windows are delicately frosted, filmed with
just-barely-opaque curtains--which, incidentally, Holditch referred
to as "those godawful drapes. Pretty tacky, I think." The old ones,
he explained, were better.</TE>
<TE>   At the front door, Chabaud is standing hawkish guard. When the men
push inside clad in shorts, he pulls them aside--sometimes back onto
Bourbon Street--and mutters in their ear. They flush and slip back
into the passing throngs. Long pants are still required, and jackets
for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   This, after all, is Galatoire's.</TE>

<HD>Fewer Blunt Truths for Paul O'Neill</HD>
<DH>Profile: Treasury chief speaks his mind on globalization,
the U.S. economy, off the record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Paul H. O'Neill is in his element. After plodding through a prepared
luncheon address in a room full of suits, the U.S. Treasury secretary
has the run of a honking big truck factory.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill peppers plant manager Doug Maugh with questions. What's
the order book look like? What about working capital turnover? Are
workers in a variable compensation pool? Maugh, who oversees
production of 26 Kenworth Truck Co. rigs a day, gamely supplies the
answers until O'Neill manages to stump him: What, he asks, is the
plant's lost work time rate? Maugh will have to check.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a plant freak," O'Neill tells a group of Kenworth employees
who stay after work to meet him. "I love manufacturing." O'Neill's
affinity for assembly lines was on full display as he hit the road to
sell America on President Bush's economic program after last week's
forum in Waco, Texas. As long as he is prowling truck plants and
cardboard box factories, exchanging information with people who make
the economy tick, the former CEO of Alcoa and International Paper Co.
is on safe and familiar ground.</LD>
<TE>   But as he maneuvers through public appearances and responds to
loaded questions under the harsh glare of media klieg lights, a less
secure side of O'Neill's persona is apparent. During an initial swing
through Seattle, Denver and Portland, Ore., Bush's famously blunt
Treasury chief struggled to avoid saying or doing anything that might
offend a key constituency or create an unwelcome distraction from the
message he is supposed to deliver.</TE>
<TE>   For a man who has elevated candor to a martial art, it's not much
fun.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard for me to live in a world where you can't tell the
truth because somebody will stick a javelin in your heart for doing
it," he tells workers at the truck plant.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill occupies one of the world's most influential public
offices, has an impressive record as a corporate manager and is a
persuasive advocate of global development. He would like to share
what he's learned about the powerful forces shaping the world economy
and the changing nature of the U.S. workplace. But he can't seem to
find the right words to say, at least not for mass consumption.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that if I came and I told the truth and I tried to do
an education job for the American people, there would be a big market
for that. There's not a big market for that, because I can't get
people to put what I say in context or report all of what I said in
response to a question," he tells reporters during his post-Waco
tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I've touched the hot burner so many times, I'm doing my best not
to touch it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   But the burner comes with the job, and O'Neill's reticence could
limit his ability to articulate the administration's economic policy
at a critical time. The White House is under fire for not doing more
to respond to new signs of economic weakness, gut-wrenching declines
in stock prices and continuing revelations of corporate chicanery.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have characterized the president's economic team as
inarticulate, inept and in need of a shake-up. Some of the harshest
criticism has been aimed at O'Neill, who has angered lawmakers,
rattled financial markets and antagonized foreign officials with his
off-the-cuff comments and unvarnished critiques. Some political
analysts have speculated that he might be the first high-ranking
official to leave the administration, once the November congressional
elections are out of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials, including the president, insist
that O'Neill's job is secure. Asked Friday whether he had told
O'Neill to stop being so straightforward, Bush laughed and said, "No,
I didn't. Listen, Paul O'Neill is doing a fine job as secretary of
Treasury.... I find him to be refreshingly candid. I appreciate his
judgment. He's a man of great experience."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill's critics say he lacks the tact, discretion and finesse to
interact comfortably with the financial community. Last year, for
example, he told a German reporter that the administration was not
trying to pump up the dollar's value because economic fundamentals
ultimately would prevail. The remark, while accurate, momentarily
roiled currency markets. In another gaffe, O'Neill alienated security
traders by suggesting that he could learn their jobs "in about a
couple of weeks."</TE>
<TE>   He is sometimes compared unfavorably to Robert E. Rubin, a Wall
Street luminary who received high marks as President Clinton's second
Treasury secretary.</TE>
<TE>   There is no question that O'Neill, 66, is cut from a different
cloth. He was a corporate CEO before joining Bush's Cabinet, while
most of his recent predecessors were financiers, politicians or
professional economists. Although he got his start as a government
number-cruncher, he is best known as the man who rescued Alcoa from
industrial lethargy, boosting the aluminum producer's sales, profits,
stock price and market share after taking over in 1987. He enriched
himself in the process, receiving stock and options worth more than
$100 million. He didn't always have it so good. When O'Neill was a
young boy, his father worked for starvation wages as an orderly in a
St. Louis veterans hospital, and the family learned to do without.</TE>
<TE>   "We were really poor," O'Neill says. "It's not where you want to
live your whole life, but recognizing that it's possible to succeed
and do things that you want to do and having to work for it is not
such a bad thing."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that's why he feels so comfortable rubbing elbows with
line workers. "I love going to factories," he tells an audience in
Portland. "It's the heartbeat of America to go see plywood mills and
cardboard container plants, and talking to workers on the floor about
how they feel about what they're doing. An awful lot of folks in
Washington and New York think the sun only rises and sets in those
two places. I don't believe it."</TE>
<TE>   At the Kenworth Truck Co. plant, he displays concern when workers
tell him that future production is threatened by the failure of
diesel engine makers to comply with new federal emission standards.
When employee Janis Brown questions the wisdom of Bush's decision to
place tariffs on imported steel, making Kenworth's trucks more
expensive to manufacture, O'Neill mentions the plight of the "real
human beings" who lose their jobs when U.S. mills can't compete
against low-cost foreign steel.</TE>
<TE>   He begins to outline his views on the future of U.S. workers in an
increasingly globalized world, but he insists on doing so off the
record, so his comments won't appear in print.</TE>
<TE>   The same thing happens at other stops. In Portland, Michael and
Pam Didner, a husband and wife who work for Intel Corp., ask O'Neill
what should be done about U.S. technology jobs that are migrating to
such countries as India, Russia and China. O'Neill responds with an
articulate overview of globalization's long-term benefits, but he
asks reporters to leave it out of their stories.</TE>
<TE>   At breakfast with Oregon farmers and foresters, O'Neill clams up
when asked about the dollar. "This is the most dangerous territory
for me because everything and anything I say about foreign exchange
rates gets blasted across the world and unsettles markets," he says.
"So I'm not going to engage this subject directly."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill blames his communication problems in part on the media's
propensity to reduce lengthy, nuanced explanations to short, stark
sentences and sound bites. Even more troubling, he says, is a
dramatic pendulum swing from the late 1990s, when dot-com hucksters
became cultural heroes, to the early 2000s, when every CEO is
suspected of being a crook.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like there's an endless quest to find the next
corporate wrongdoer. Somebody who can find that is going to get
promoted and get more responsibility and a better beat or something."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, O'Neill will try to continue preaching the
administration line without sounding like a robot.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate doing the scripted stuff," he tells reporters in Seattle.
"When I see people doing scripted stuff, I don't know whether they
can think or not. All I know is that they can read. When people start
reading to me, I turn my mind off because I figure they don't really
know anything."</TE>

<LD>The U.N. World Food Program is cutting rations for millions of hungry
Afghans because international donors have failed to deliver promised
cash, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Some 6 million Afghans will need food aid in the next year, the
U.N. said. The WFP has appealed for $285 million this year but is
short $90 million.</LD>
<LD>   Refugees returning from abroad used to receive a one-time handout
of 550 pounds of wheat to get them back on their feet. That was cut
this month to 220 pounds, and Guy Gauvreau, the WFP's representative
for northern Afghanistan, said he feared a cut to 110 pounds within
two weeks if aid does not arrive.</LD>

<LD>The new Afghan government has "largely failed" in its 4-month-old
effort to eradicate the cultivation of opium poppies, the raw
material for heroin, U.N. crop experts said.</LD>
<LD>   Their figures show the 2002 crop is close to the high levels of
the late 1990s and could be worth more than $1 billion at the farm
level in Afghanistan--about 5% of the nation's gross domestic
product.</LD>
<LD>   The former Taliban regime had banned poppy cultivation in 2000,
and production dropped to near zero. But the fall of the Taliban late
last year prompted farmers to plant poppy again over tens of
thousands of acres.</LD>

Says</HD>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Threats of a U.S. invasion will not help persuade Iraq to allow
investigators in to verify whether Baghdad has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction, the chief U.N. arms inspector said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview with BBC television, Hans Blix reiterated earlier
statements that Iraq's latest overtures about allowing teams of U.N.
arms inspectors to return were not acceptable as they stood, but said
Baghdad might eventually agree to more rigorous terms.</LD>
<LD>   However, he warned, "if the Iraqis conclude that an invasion by
someone is inevitable, then they might conclude that it is not very
meaningful to have inspections."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bahrain, a key U.S. ally in the Persian Gulf region and
the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, said along with Iran
that it would oppose American military action against Iraq.</TE>

<HD>Krakow Crowd Urges Pontiff to Stay</HD>
<DH>Religion: John Paul II speaks of his desire to return to
Poland but also of his own mortality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KRAKOW, Poland</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass here Sunday for more than 2 million
people, as the largest crowd of all his homeland pilgrimages gathered
for an extraordinary display of mutual affection between an ailing
pontiff and a nation he has profoundly shaped.</LD>
<LD>   In a day of deep poignancy, John Paul, 82, made repeated
references to his desire to visit Poland again but also to his own
mortality.</LD>
<LD>   "I would like to add, 'Until next time,' " he said near the end of
the open-air Mass, looking out over a vast sea of humanity gathered
in an open field. "But this is entirely in God's hands."</LD>
<TE>   And in a homily built around Jesus' command to "love one another
as I have loved you," John Paul declared: "I embrace with affection
my countrymen, particularly the suffering and the sick, those
struggling with various difficulties, the unemployed, the homeless,
the elderly and the lonely, and families with many children."</TE>
<TE>   About 1.6 million people fit into the city commons, where a
flower-bedecked stage, an altar and huge video screens had been set
up, while half a million more were gathered in surrounding streets
and on a hillside overlooking the site, police said. Hundreds of
thousands of Poles traveled here by bus Saturday. Many thousands
carrying backpacks and mats had slept outdoors overnight.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere was joyous, despite the tough physical conditions
and the fears of some that this might be the pontiff's last visit
home.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul, who played a key role in undermining communism in
Poland, warned in his homily of dangers in the new society emerging
here, stressing that secularism should not replace the nation's
traditional Roman Catholic faith.</TE>
<TE>   "When the noisy propaganda ... of freedom without truth or
responsibility grows stronger in our country too, the shepherds of
the church cannot fail to proclaim the one fail-proof philosophy of
freedom, which is the truth of the cross of Christ," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The pontiff also criticized human genetic engineering and
euthanasia, complaining that "frequently man lives as if God did not
exist, and even puts himself in God's place."</TE>
<TE>   A prayer read during the Mass asked God to heal "the sorrow of
nations in the darkness of wars and the suffering of people who are
threatened with hunger and terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Krakow Archbishop Franciszek Macharski told reporters that
"the Holy Father knows that the fate of the twin towers on Sept. 11
in New York is what the world can come to" without God.</TE>
<TE>   As the morning service drew to a close, the crowd chanted, "Stay
with us!" Many well-wishers have cried out this phrase on the pope's
eight previous visits to Poland since his elevation in 1978. This
time he replied, half-jokingly yet overcome by emotion, "Well, you
are trying to persuade me to abandon Rome!"</TE>
<TE>   At an afternoon visit to a church where he worked as a young
priest, John Paul said, "I'm asking for a prayer for those who are
alive and for those who are dead, and for the pope, during his
lifetime and after his death."</TE>
<TE>   Then, Sunday evening--in perhaps the most moving moment of the
day--John Paul greeted a crowd of mostly young people from a window
of the church residence where he is staying. As he appeared, the
crowd sang, "We love you! Hallelujah! We welcome you! Hallelujah!"</TE>
<TE>   The first words from the pontiff, who was scheduled to return to
Rome today, were: "Unfortunately, this is a farewell meeting."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd responded, "No!" But the pope broke into song, using
different words but the same tune they had been singing.</TE>
<TE>   "We bid you farewell, hallelujah!" he sang in a faltering voice.
"We bid you farewell, hallelujah! We bid you farewell. Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! We bid you farewell."</TE>
<TE>   John Paul pledged "my heart and my thoughts, forever."</TE>
<TE>   He went on: "The farewell wish to one who departs is, 'May you
come again.' I wish this to myself too. I do think that this is your
wish to me.... May God bless you."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the evening, the pope visited the Rakowice Cemetery,
where he blessed the graves of his parents and older brother. He
prayed briefly and lighted a candle but did not get out of his
popemobile. He also visited the Wawel Cathedral, where he celebrated
his first Mass as a priest in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   During Sunday's outdoor Mass, John Paul beatified three Polish
priests and a Polish nun. They included an archbishop of Warsaw,
Zygmunt Szczesny Felinski, who was exiled to the interior of Russia
for 20 years after he openly defended participants in an unsuccessful
1863 uprising against czarist rule.</TE>
<TE>   "Archbishop Felinski gave himself fully in defending the freedom
of the nation," John Paul said. "This is necessary today also."</TE>
<TE>   Many Poles credit John Paul himself with having played the key
role in freeing their country from Russian and Communist control
through the inspiration of his early visits here as pope, the first
in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   His role in bringing democracy to Poland was even greater than
that of the Solidarity trade union that led the anti-Communist
struggle, said Romuald Siwiec, 45, a businessman in the crowd Sunday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1970s, "nobody could imagine there might be a change in
the system, a change in the whole world," explained Siwiec's wife,
Barbara Piga, 45, who as a student had seen John Paul during his
first trip home as pope. "He gave people the faith that they could do
it and that it was worth doing."</TE>
<TE>   In his homily, John Paul also called on his countrymen to show
greater love and charity toward those who have fallen behind during
Poland's economic transformation.</TE>
<TE>   "We [should] be aware of the neighbor by our side who feels a
sense of abandonment, of being lost, of distrust, because of the loss
of work, home, the possibility to maintain his family in a decent
manner and to educate his children," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Wapiennik, 25, an unemployed computer specialist who came
to the outdoor Mass, said he wanted to hear John Paul "to get
spiritual guidance from him for the coming years of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Wapiennik said he was thankful for John Paul's historical role,
despite his own current economic problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a free man," he explained. "If there were no Polish pope, I
don't think those changes would have taken place, or they would have
come much later. The pope came to Poland and somehow managed to move
the people, to inspire them. I think because of that, people
themselves made the change."</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Plan Focuses on Bicycle Commuters</HD>
<DH>Transit: Commission approves $37-million proposal to add 55
miles of special lanes and improve safety for pedestrians and
cyclists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's close to 9 a.m. on a recent weekday, and Jose Ramirez is weaving
in and out of heavy traffic in downtown Oxnard. He suddenly jolts to
a stop at a busy intersection and waits for the light to change.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm late to work," Ramirez said on the way to his job as a meat
cutter at a supermarket.</LD>
<LD>   Then with a heavy foot to the pedal he rides off on his bike.</LD>
<TE>   Ramirez is among hundreds of bicycle commuters who are prompting
city leaders to include their needs in long-range transportation
plans. In Oxnard, where a majority of the city's 170,000 residents
are Latino, those commuters are often working-class immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The Planning Commission recently approved a newly updated
$37-million bicycle and pedestrian master plan that would add 55
miles of bike lanes and paths throughout the city over the next 20
years. The City Council is expected to vote on the matter later this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Funding would come from a variety of local, state and federal
sources, said Cynthia Daniels, a local transportation planner.</TE>
<TE>   One aspect of the city's ambitious plan is to improve the safety
of some bike paths and lanes by shielding riders from vehicle
traffic, Daniels said. Commuters such as Ramirez are glad about that.</TE>
<TE>   The 22-year-old Mexican immigrant lives three blocks from work and
says he rides his bike only when his car doesn't work. He said he
would use his bike more often if he did not have to swerve between
narrow sidewalks and fast-moving SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it's not worth it," he said. "It gets really bad."</TE>
<TE>   Others have no choice but to ride.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Barrera, 44, rides his bicycle each day to work, or at
least on days when he can find work. A strawberry picker, he has
ridden as far as Santa Clarita on his Huffy in the early morning
darkness because he needs the money, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You run a risk, but then you just go to the side and wait for the
cars to go by and, well, hope they don't hit you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Like other low-income immigrant workers, he cannot afford a car or
legally own one, he said. And he would rather face traffic and rain
than risk having a car that could be impounded if police stopped him,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "To go run a quick errand, [a bicycle] is more fun anyway,"
Barrera said.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard's plan calls for paths along the beach, with connections to
agricultural fields east of the city. One of the first major
improvements, called for in 2004, would be a bike path that connects
immigrant communities in south Oxnard to those in downtown and La
Colonia.</TE>
<TE>   A planned bike path along Oxnard Boulevard would also help protect
commuters around intersections that have the highest number of
bicycle-and pedestrian-related accidents in the city.</TE>
<TE>   The plan includes education programs for bicycle riders hailing
from countries such as Mexico who are often not aware of state laws
that prohibit them from traveling against the flow of traffic,
Daniels said.</TE>
<TE>   Most county cities have focused more on recreational facilities
than commuter lanes, said Judy Willens, who sits on the board of the
Ventura County Bike Coalition. Ventura and Camarillo, for example,
have been praised for adding bike trails that border the coast and
lush farmlands. Yet commuters in cities may need the most help, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Recreational bikers avoid places that are not safe. Commuters
have to get through no matter what," Willens said, pointing to the
Five Points intersection in downtown Oxnard, which saw seven
bicycle-related collisions between 1997 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But the tide is shifting in favor of commuters. Santa Paula is
developing a bike path that cuts across the city, running east to
west. There are Metrolink projects in Ventura and Camarillo that will
make it easier for bicyclists to get from station to station. And
more Vista &amp; SCAT buses are offering bike racks for commuters.</TE>
<TE>   The changes have been long in coming throughout the state, said
James Rojas, a member of the Latino Urban Forum. Immigrant bicycle
commuters have not had the clout or knowledge to ask for better
conditions, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "These are people who don't have the power to vote or change
policy," Rojas said. "They don't realize they deserve better."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, there is also increasing interest in
studying street conditions for people who do not travel by car, Rojas
said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Gloria Molina is proposing regional plans to improve
pedestrian safety, including pathways for immigrants on busy
thoroughfares on the city's eastside. The MTA has allocated about $7
million a year to bicycle-related projects, including facilities for
bike commuters.</TE>
<TE>   And Los Angeles City Council members are including facilities for
bike commuters in downtown and East Los Angeles as they plan
revitalization projects along the Los Angeles River.</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California, cities such as Sacramento are building
extensive networks of bike lanes for commuters, said Steve Hoyt, land
use planner with the Sacramento-based Local Government Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Our experience is that Latinos are generally biking and walking
more than the general population," Hoyt said. "There is the 'smart
growth' movement that calls for designing cities to be more bike-and
pedestrian-friendly, and then you find some communities are doing it
already."</TE>
<TE>   In the city of Reedley in Fresno County an old rail line converted
into a bike trail connects factory workers downtown to canneries in
industrial areas, Hoyt said. Similar projects are underway in the
city of Manteca in the San Joaquin Valley and unincorporated areas in
Tulare County.</TE>
<TE>   For activists like Ron Milam, executive director of the Los
Angeles County Bicycle Coalition, any local plan that includes
bicycle commuters is a welcomed alternative in a region plagued by
traffic and pollution, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I see a great potential in Southern California. We have good
weather, wide streets and flat terrain," Milam said. "When cities
like Oxnard pledge $37 million [to bicyclists], that's a great sign
to me."</TE>

<HD>Raking in Millions? State Should Raise Your Taxes</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Two months after hearing the renowned civics lecturer Shaquille
O'Neal, his words still ring in my ear. You may also recall his
comment:</LD>
<LD>   "This is what I want you to teach your children today: Sacramento
will never be the capital of California. Los Angeles is the new
capital of California."</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. Lakers center, of course, was referring to the state of
basketball, which he dominates.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers had just three-peated as NBA champs. Their crucial win
had been over the upstart Sacramento Kings in the Western Conference
finals.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's little joke at the L.A. victory celebration got me
thinking: The real Capitol of California should tutor Shaq in civics
by raising his taxes.</TE>
<TE>   OK, let's also raise the state income tax of Kings' forward Chris
Webber.</TE>
<TE>   And home-run king Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, all big-bucks earners should be paying more. That
includes investor Bill Simon, the Republican candidate for governor.
And actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who might be the GOP candidate in
four years.</TE>
<TE>   This simply is because it's a bad system that taxes a struggling
schoolteacher or a nurse at the same rate as a super-rich athlete.</TE>
<TE>   The state's hurting--suffering a revenue shortfall of about $24
billion--and everybody should be required to help. Not just hapless
nicotine addicts, as Assembly Democrats propose.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers already have been forced to surrender their unique tax
credit. The six-and-seven-figure guys also should give up a little.</TE>
<TE>   Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) had a plan: For two
years only, raise the top income tax rates on roughly 2.3% of the
richest Californians. That would generate up to $3.3 billion
annually.</TE>
<TE>   The current top rate is 9.3%. This kicks in on all taxable income
above $37,725 for a single filer and $75,450 for married couples.</TE>
<TE>   Burton wanted to add two higher brackets: 10% for singles' income
exceeding $130,000 and for couples' of more than $260,000; and 11% at
$260,000 and $520,000 respectively.</TE>
<TE>   It's not as if this is unprecedented, Burton noted. Gov. Ronald
Reagan, the conservative icon, imposed the 10% rate in 1967 and
boosted it to 11% in 1973. Gov. George Deukmejian dropped it to 9.3%
in good times. But Gov. Pete Wilson, balancing the books during a
recession, raised rates again to 11% between 1991 and 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe this is going to lead to a mass exodus out of the
state," Burton asserted during Senate debate.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it's impossible to envision Shaq demanding a trade to,
say, the Memphis Grizzlies to avoid paying a higher tax.</TE>
<TE>   But anti-tax Republicans would hear none of it. Cut spending, they
cried, without specifying which spending. The bill stalled on the
Senate floor for lack of even one GOP vote.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis also opposed it, claiming that California already
is too dependent on the volatile income tax.</TE>
<TE>   Davis never has been a tax-the-rich populist.</TE>
<TE>   He has been running from Gov. Jerry Brown's tax-and-spend image
ever since serving as Brown's top aide back in the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Davis has been convinced by his chief of staff, former
U.S. Rep. Lynn Schenk of San Diego, that tax hikes are political
killers. Schenk is convinced that voters bounced her from Congress in
1994 because she supported President Clinton's tax increase.</TE>
<TE>   But, come on,  Shaquille O'Neal!  He made $21.4 million last
season and is working on a 10-year, $208-million deal, according to
USA Today.</TE>
<TE>   Lakers guard Koby Bryant got $11.3 million. Webber: $12.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball's Bonds: $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon: $7.1 million in taxable income in 2000. He still
hasn't reported for 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger: $30 million for "Terminator 3."</TE>
<TE>   Higher tax brackets would not just nail players for California
teams. The state has a "jock tax"--so named by economist David
Hoffman of the Tax Foundation--which taps all major league players in
basketball, baseball, football and hockey when they compete in
California.</TE>
<TE>   When Texas Rangers shortstop Alex Rodriquez plays in Anaheim
Stadium, the state tax collector grabs part of his $22-million
salary.</TE>
<TE>   Which is how it should be.</TE>
<TE>   Many stadiums and arenas are partially subsidized by the public.
And that helps push up athletes' salaries.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature and the governor tremble at taxing these rich
folks. But after the November election, as tax revenues continue to
fall short, the politicians will need to summon up some Reagan-and
Wilson-like courage. They'll need to rethink this. Now, all they can
think about is slinking through the election.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq actually may be onto something.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than the capital of California, Sacramento is acting like
the capital of cowardice.</TE>

<HD>Pedestrian Killed, 2nd Hurt; 2 Bus Drivers Held</HD>

<LD>Two Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus drivers were jailed
over the weekend in unrelated traffic accidents that killed one
pedestrian and injured another.</LD>
<LD>   Police booked Cruz Vaca, 39, on a murder charge early Sunday
morning after the bus he was driving ran over a vagrant, who later
died.</LD>
<LD>   A Los Angeles Police Department spokesman, Eduardo Funes, said the
victim, whose identity had not been released late Sunday, was trying
to catch the eastbound bus near the intersection of Wilshire
Boulevard and Wilton Place about 6:30 p.m. Saturday. When the bus did
not stop, the man hopped onto the bike rack at the front of the
moving vehicle, Funes said. He fell and was crushed under the bus.</LD>
<TE>   Bus riders told police that the driver and the victim had argued.
One witness, David Thompson, said that he had seen the victim
knocking on the door to be let on the bus as the vehicle was moving
slowly. The driver did not open the door, so the man stood in front
of the bus.</TE>
<TE>   "He essentially told the bus driver, 'You either have to stop or
run over me,' " Thompson said. "The man was angry because the driver
wouldn't let him on the bus. It came down to a matter of two wills."</TE>
<TE>   Vaca remained in jail Sunday, with bail set at $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials would not comment on the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Another MTA driver, Debra Johnson, was arrested on suspicion of
hit-and-run after she reportedly struck a pedestrian and kept going
near the community of Lennox shortly before midnight Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   An MTA spokesman, Jose Ubaldo, said Johnson, 47, was driving north
on Western Avenue at 112th Street when someone called in a
bus-pedestrian collision. She returned to the scene and was arrested
by the California Highway Patrol, Ubaldo said.</TE>
<TE>   The CHP did not release its report over the weekend, and the
nature or extent of the victim's injuries could not be determined,
although officials said they apparently were not life-threatening.
Both MTA and CHP officials were investigating.</TE>
<TE>   Ubaldo said conflicting reports from witnesses have led the MTA to
question whether the injured man had been struck by the bus or
another vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was being held on $35,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>'What Ifs' Loom Over El Toro Park Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As plans for a Great Park at the closed El Toro Marine base take
root, anxious whispers of "what if" are blooming:</LD>
<LD>   What if terrible things lurk beneath the weeds and asphalt on the
thousands of acres that the Navy says don't need to be tested for
toxic contamination?</LD>
<LD>   When it comes to rehabbing military installations that were used
as far back as World War II, such "what ifs" have been known to lead
to huge problems.</LD>
<TE>   Just ask around at McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Federal environmental investigators were moving along with cleanup
there in September 2000 when they came across a mysterious 20-gallon
drum. When they opened it, they discovered half a dozen glass vials
containing weapons-grade plutonium. There were no records that
plutonium was ever manufactured or disposed of anywhere on the site.
The finding could set cleanup back decades and is expected to
increase cleanup costs on that area of McClellan from $10 million to
$54 million.</TE>
<TE>   Such surprises are the norm in base redevelopment. Those involved
with the process say it is wishful thinking to assume things will be
different at El Toro, which is already on the federal Superfund list
as one of the nation's most polluted sites.</TE>
<TE>   "These sites are full of uncertainty," said Jody Freeman, a
professor of environmental law at UCLA. "They have been contaminated
over the decades, and it is very rare that we know precisely what was
dumped in them."</TE>
<TE>   Unexpected contamination is the reason the process has been
excruciatingly slow at so many base sites.</TE>
<TE>   And it is why some reuse experts warn that much of the Great Park
plan that voters approved in March, ending a decade-long political
battle to build a commercial airport at the base, could be delayed
for years.</TE>
<TE>   The cleanup at El Toro is following the Superfund routine.
Investigators look for documents that tell them where waste is buried
and direct their cleanup to those areas. The documents suggest that
toxic chemicals and low-level radioactive waste contaminate about 13%
of the 4,700-acre property, and the federal government is paying to
clean that up.</TE>
<TE>   But the documented contamination isn't what worries critics of the
Navy's cleanup plan. It's the undocumented material that might be
beneath the remaining 87% of the base where investigators aren't even
looking.</TE>
<TE>   Among the places federal officials have yet to thoroughly
investigate is the ground under the expansive runway system, although
the Navy says it is satisfied with samplings it has done alongside
the runways. Experts who have observed base closures warn that the
area is a likely depository for thousands of gallons of fuel that
leaked as jets gassed up, as well as dangerous chemicals used in
degreasing.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the Orange County Board of Supervisors unanimously
approved a ballot measure for November that asks voters to demand
that the Navy conduct the most thorough cleanup possible, one that
would presumably involve extensive soil sampling throughout the
property. In pushing her measure, Board Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad
told about her experience with buying a supposedly cleaned-up chunk
of San Diego's Camp Elliott in the mid-1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Houses were built on the former Marine boot camp and nuclear
propulsion laboratory and everything seemed fine--until two
8-year-old boys were killed in 1983 when an anti-tank shell that the
military had left on the property exploded while they were playing
with it.</TE>
<TE>   "Experiences at other closed bases should be a wake-up call," Coad
said.</TE>
<TE>   Great Park boosters say the warnings are the work of politicians
who are angry that their plan for a commercial airport was defeated.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a continuing case of the doubters and defeatists and
professional pessimists we have to deal with day after day," Irvine
Mayor Larry Agran said.</TE>
<TE>   Under a deal worked out with the Navy, Irvine is spearheading the
base redevelopment and hopes to annex the property next year. It will
allow developers to build 3,400 homes and 2.9 million square feet of
retail space to fund the park project.</TE>
<TE>   "The operating reality is that as far as we know, 87% of the land
is free of toxic contamination," he said. "If more land is discovered
to be contaminated, then it will be the federal government's
obligation to clean it up."</TE>
<TE>   Agran acknowledges that it could be years before the site is fully
clean but says that will not slow progress of the park plan. He said
construction can start on various pieces of the base as soon as they
are cleared by the Navy and federal environmental officials.</TE>
<TE>   And if a lot more contamination is discovered than expected?</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government has not indicated in any way, shape or
form that they intend to shirk their responsibilities," Agran said.
"If the cleanup takes three, five, even 20 years, they will provide
the funds that are needed."</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the Navy anticipates that the cleanup will almost be
completed by 2008. Spokeswoman Lt. Cmdr. Pauline Storum said the Navy
is confident that no unexpected contamination will be found. "The
Navy has no current reason to anticipate an unforeseen circumstance
that would slow down the current cleanup efforts at El Toro," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Storum added, however, that if additional contamination is found
after the property is transferred, the Navy is required by federal
law to return to clean it up.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have lived through a base cleanup, however, caution that
it's unwise to take the Navy at its word. They applaud the county for
putting the cleanup measure on the ballot as a way to keep the
pressure on. Cleanup standards vary widely, they say, and local
communities need to push the military to poke holes into the ground
early.</TE>
<TE>   "The military is reluctant to dig in too many places because they
are likely to find stuff," said Chris Shirley, a staff scientist at
Arc Ecology in San Francisco, a nonprofit group that monitors base
conversions. "Most of the places we have worked on, when the military
dug a hole they generally found more than they expected."</TE>

conversions. "Most of the places we have worked on, when the military
dug a hole they generally found more than they expected."</TE>
<TE>   Case in point, Shirley said: The Navy had assured a developer that
the contaminants had been removed under military housing being
rehabilitated for public use on the former Treasure Island Navy base
in the Bay Area; but the company did its own testing anyway, and
found that the soil was tainted with a mix of hazardous chemicals.
The Navy had to return to excavate tons of dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Some local studies already criticize the Navy for not accounting
for all the toxic material at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reports, which came from Irvine, warned that 700,000
pounds of toxic solvents could have leaked from the sewer system
below the base--nearly 100 times the amount the Navy acknowledges.</TE>
<TE>   Another, written by a member of the county advisory board
overseeing El Toro reuse, warns that it would require 2 million soil
samples just to get a picture of what contamination is on the site.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy investigated those concerns," said Nicole Moutoux, the
Environmental Protection Agency's project manager at El Toro. "We do
our investigation as thoroughly as we possibly can. If people have
information we haven't heard before, we will look at it."</TE>
<TE>   Agran says that developers who buy base land will get built-in
environmental insurance. If waste surfaces after the site is declared
free of contaminants, the Navy will return to clean it up.</TE>
<TE>   That's not much comfort to people who have done the math. They
wonder if the money for additional cleanup will really be there. The
Navy's entire budget for closed base cleanup in fiscal 2003 is $249
million. That must cover cleanup costs at every closed base, not just
El Toro.</TE>

<HD>Officials Guard Against Leaks at Gas Stations</HD>
<DH>Regulation: Water contamination at issue as officials crack
down on owners who disable sensors that detect underground problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Khosrow Lashkari decided to hose down the parking lot of his Oxnard
service station two days before his annual fuel tank inspection.</LD>
<LD>   Water trickled through a manhole cover and triggered a tank alarm
system that warns of leaks. Lashkari moved the system's sensor out of
the way so he could shut off the alarm and keep his pumps flowing.</LD>
<LD>   He said the action was temporary until he could get the water
pumped out. He told tank inspectors of his plan, assuming they would
understand.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, Lashkari became the first gas station owner to be sued by
the Ventura County district attorney's office for tampering with a
fuel tank's alarm sensor. He settled the case last month, admitting
no wrongdoing but agreeing to pay the county and the city $15,000 in
fines.</TE>
<TE>   California has long required gas stations to attach leak-detecting
alarms to their underground fuel storage tank systems. But as
regulators grow more vigilant about stopping the spread of
contaminants into ground water, they are cracking down on what they
see as a frustrating form of subterfuge by service station owners.</TE>
<TE>   Across the state, regulators have fined dozens of operators they
believe deliberately disabled their tanks' leak-detection systems.
They say most tampering isn't done to cover up leaks. Instead,
station owners may be convinced, like Lashkari, that their alarms are
responding to false threats. They simply want to avoid the nuisance
and disruption of business.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, officials say, is that once an alarm is disengaged,
it is unable to sound if a real leak occurs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like deactivating the smoke alarm in your house," said
Shahla Farahnak, an engineer with the state Water Resources Control
Board.</TE>
<TE>   Tampering typically involves moving sensors to tank levels where
they won't detect liquid. Although in some cases, regulators say, gas
stations disconnect the alarm's wiring altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say sensor tampering has occurred since alarm systems
were mandated in the 1980s. Mobil Oil Corp. was sued for allowing
widespread monitoring lapses at stations in Orange County in the
mid-1990s, and settled for more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   With a maze of underground tank regulations to enforce, and tight
staffing levels, most local regulatory agencies long maintained that
they were too strapped to focus on individual sensor tampering cases.</TE>
<TE>   But that began to change three years ago. Prompted by a state
mandate requiring annual tank inspections, local regulators began
increasing tank permit fees, adding inspectors, coordinating with
prosecutors and cracking down on sensor tampering.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Wold said several
additional cases are pending, including some that could yield higher
fines than Lashkari's.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento County began a formal crackdown in January. Since then,
inspectors have cited 13 violators, including gas stations and
private firms that provide on-site fueling for company vehicles.
Those cited were not required to admit wrongdoing, but were fined
$2,500, program supervisor Anthony Chu said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking into other cases now," Chu said. "If the facility
chooses not to settle, we would take it to the district attorney."</TE>
<TE>   Larger jurisdictions are less likely to involve prosecutors unless
a fuel leak actually occurs, but they are beefing up inspections
nevertheless. Orange County environmental health inspectors find
sensor tampering on a weekly basis, said Denise Fennessy, the
county's hazardous materials manager. In Los Angeles County, the
public works division identified more than 300 sensor tampering cases
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Brown, an attorney with Cal-EPA's enforcement division, said
cases are difficult to build because gas station owners profess
ignorance or blame their employees or service technicians. "Everybody
points the finger the other way and says, 'Oh, Joe did it,' or, 'Oh,
those darn vandals!' " Brown said. "But it's a serious problem."</TE>
<TE>   The tanks under gas stations hold thousands of gallons of fuel.
The fuel contains hazardous chemicals, including the additive MTBE,
or methyl tertiary butyl ether, a suspected carcinogen. Fuel that
seeps out of tanks and into soil can find its way into ground water.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1984, when California began regulating fuel storage tanks,
the law has required each to be fitted with a monitoring device to
warn of a possible leak.</TE>
<TE>   Lashkari learned his lesson at a price. It will take him months of
work to cover his $15,000 fine. He is frustrated, he said, because he
received bad advice from a service technician, and then Oxnard and
Ventura County officials decided to make an example of him.</TE>
<TE>   "I called a guy and said, 'Do we need to pump the water out before
the test?' He said, 'No they're not there to check for water; you can
wait until they do the test and then pump out the water.' "</TE>
<TE>   When the city inspector arrived, Lashkari said, "I told him
exactly what happened, but he said, 'No, no, it's leaking gasoline.'
They wanted to make it a big deal. They just came down on me. Really,
it was unfair."</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, he's not the world's worst offender," said Wold,
the deputy district attorney. "But I want people to understand, if
they tamper with their sensors to avoid leak detection, they will be
prosecuted. People have to stop doing this. It's too important to our
environment."</TE>

<HD>Secession Fears Stir Up Allies of Mayor</HD>
<DH>Politics: Hahn's drive against city's breakup wins
supporters--even if some have been drawn in part by the desire for
favors on other issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn forges an ideologically broad,
multiethnic coalition to fight secession, he has assembled a group of
leaders with their own agendas and interests in city business--and
some frankly acknowledge they want the mayor to return their favors.</LD>
<LD>   They are a diverse collection of politicians, business executives
and former adversaries who are joining the mayor to persuade voters
to reject cityhood proposals in Hollywood and the San Fernando
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Some have donated money; more are adding their stature and
influence to the campaign.</LD>
<TE>   But many of them are standing beside Hahn with other concerns in
mind as well.</TE>
<TE>   Former basketball star and business entrepreneur Earvin "Magic"
Johnson wants more African Americans hired to top administration
positions and perhaps also a favorable look by the mayor at his
development deals.</TE>
<TE>   County labor leader Miguel Contreras expects a warm reception when
public employee contracts come up for renewal.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina says she wants Hahn to
be sympathetic to the county's concerns over a redevelopment area in
downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Ed Roski, the largest single contributor to the
anti-secession cause, is hoping to build a football stadium in Los
Angeles--possibly with public money.</TE>
<TE>   Others, including former Hahn mayoral rival Antonio Villaraigosa
and former Mayor Richard Riordan, are helping to lead the campaign
against secession in part as a way to remain involved in civic
matters, according to members of the anti-secession team.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those supporting Hahn's anti-secession efforts are blunt
about their reasons. Above all, they say, they are adamantly opposed
to a breakup of Los Angeles. Their reasons for joining forces with
the mayor don't end there, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of them are not doing it because they love Jim Hahn," said
billionaire business executive Eli Broad. "They're doing it because
it's in their self-interest."</TE>
<TE>   Broad sees no problem with that, but others do.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not coalition-building," said Richard Katz, a former
longtime state assemblyman who is leading the campaign for a Valley
city. "It's coalition by self-interest. The only criteria for being
in this coalition is need or greed."</TE>
<TE>   Some Hahn allies say secession actually has had a positive effect
on the mayor and his administration, forcing him out of City Hall and
back onto the campaign trail, where they believe he is most
effective.</TE>
<TE>   Repairing Wounds</TE>
<TE>   The need for friends in the anti-secession effort has pushed Hahn
to repair wounds from the 2001 mayoral campaign and from his decision
this year not to endorse Police Chief Bernard C. Parks for a second
term.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of secession has brought back to the fold some of those
whom Hahn angered in the campaign and during the controversial
removal of the police chief--even if they have been drawn in part by
the promise of favorable consideration on other issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is," said Bill Carrick, who is managing the mayor's
anti-secession campaign, "nobody's been hard to get."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor acknowledged in a recent interview that he will be
expected to return some favors, but said he does not believe he will
be locked into any decisions that could harm the city or its coffers.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wants to have a strong relationship with the mayor of
Los Angeles," Hahn said. "I think many of these individuals will
command the mayor's attention anyway....During this time there will
be issues we agree on and disagree on. But I think [the threat of
secession] supersedes all the other issues where we may not have
agreement."</TE>
<TE>   The collection of secession opponents under Hahn's leadership does
not surprise many political analysts and consultants. They say it's
the nature of politics both for people with business interests to
seek the mayor's attention and for the mayor to seek theirs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's basic politics: You help me and I'll help you," said veteran
city political consultant Rick Taylor. "I think it's smart politics
of the mayor to invite people back in."</TE>
<TE>   But whether he can maintain these relationships is perhaps more
difficult and less certain.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he really wants to use this campaign as an opportunity to
build bridges," said Fabian Nunez, a political consultant who is
running for state Assembly. But, he cautioned, "Bringing people
together is easier than keeping them."</TE>
<TE>   As the campaign has unfolded, some of those around Hahn credit him
with improving the style and substance of his approach, partly in
response to complaints from other members of his coalition who found
him too passive and too negative at the outset.</TE>
<TE>   Secession, the mayor said early in the effort, would be "a
disaster of biblical proportions." He then described it as "a one-way
ticket to financial disaster."</TE>
<TE>   More recently, he has said: "I want to continue bragging about the
city," and "Let's stop bashing Los Angeles and start celebrating Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   That shift could give Hahn's coalition staying power, according to
some outside it.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be looking at the big picture of how does this help me
govern the city, mobilize interest groups in the city to fulfill the
agenda I have, use this opportunity to convey my vision, and then
position myself for reelection," said Los Angeles County Supervisor
Zev Yaroslavsky, who has not joined the mayor's coalition against
secession. "Other people can scare the public....He would serve
himself and the campaign that he is leading well by being positive
and articulating a broader vision."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some of Hahn's allies have their eye on issues that go
beyond the rhetoric of the campaign--or even its outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this gives us an opportunity to work together, to develop
a relationship," said Contreras, the executive secretary-treasurer of
the Los Angeles County AFL/CIO who fought hard for Villaraigosa in
last year's mayoral race. "He's the mayor, and we're supporting the
position of the mayor."</TE>
<TE>   Support for Contracts</TE>
<TE>   Contreras also said he expects Hahn to be helpful as municipal
employees' contracts are renewed. To that end, the mayor sent a
letter last month to encourage a speedy resolution to the
longshoremen's contract dispute at the Port of Los Angeles. That
contract has expired and negotiations are stalled.</TE>
<TE>   Molina, the county supervisor, said she is organizing a coalition
of Latino elected officials to work with the mayor's campaign against
secession.</TE>
<TE>   But in one meeting with Hahn, Molina described a contentious
discussion about downtown redevelopment.</TE>
<TE>   "He and I agree on this," she said, referring to secession. "But
on [redevelopment] we're going to be adversaries in court."</TE>
<TE>   And Johnson, the Hall of Fame Laker turned businessman, said he
supports the mayor on secession but that he remains bitter about
Hahn's position on the police chief's second term.</TE>
<TE>   He said he will fight efforts to split up the city in the hope
that Hahn will listen to his concerns about diversifying his staff.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has been defensive about his staff, saying that he has
gathered a group of ethnically and racially mixed advisors but that
he will consider Johnson's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson Backs Mayor</TE>
<TE>   The mayor was eager to win the support of Johnson, who is black,
believing that his reputation makes him an asset throughout the city,
particularly with African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Others are taking a lower-profile position on the coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, for example, supported
Villaraigosa but has met with the mayor and pledged to help
financially on secession.</TE>
<TE>   Roski, the owner of the Los Angeles Kings hockey franchise who
helped build Staples Center downtown and now wants to build a hotel
and entertainment complex nearby, has appointed one of his company's
top officers to be a point person on secession, bringing him up to
speed on the issue and helping him find ways to get involved in the
mayor's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Roski has donated generously. In papers filed last month, Roski's
company, Majestic Realty, gave $250,000 to Hahn's L.A. United
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very involved and, financially, we're very committed," said
Fran Inman, the senior vice president of Majestic Realty who is
handling anti-secession duties for Roski. "It's a wonderful
opportunity for us to work together.... We're building bridges for
tomorrow.''</TE>

<HD>Where Gang Members Must Behave--and Do</HD>
<DH>Crime: Joplin Youth Center, the Trabuco Canyon camp whose
expansion plan is controversial, teaches even rivals to interact.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first glance, nothing seems out of the ordinary with the lunchroom
or its diners. There's quiet conversation at standard-issue tables,
an orderly clatter of silverware. And when the meal is over, the
diners stand up almost in unison and march off for naptime on their
bunk beds.</LD>
<LD>   What makes the scene extraordinary is that the diners are rival
gang members. Under real-world circumstances, most agree, they would
never break bread together. But here, at Orange County's Joplin Youth
Center, learning to suppress hostilities is part of the
rehabilitation process.</LD>
<LD>   As one 15-year-old from Costa Mesa put it: "I don't want to have
no problems. I just want to do my time and get out."</LD>
<TE>   Of the county's 351 recognized criminal street gangs, experts say,
as many as 35--or about 10%--are represented here among the 64
teenage boys occupying the buildings at Joplin. It is easily the
highest density of gangs in the county.</TE>
<TE>   The boys share an old military barracks transformed into a
dormitory. They take their meals in the same tiny cafeteria. They
line up single file every morning and afternoon on the same
basketball court and learn English and math in the same classrooms.
Sometimes, center Director Joe Salcido said, they even serve on the
same work crews, carrying blunt shovels and sharpened scythes into
the fields surrounding the camp.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unavoidable that we have rival gang members sleeping in
bunks next to each other," Salcido said. "They have to interact with
each other."</TE>
<TE>   And they do so with few altercations. It's all part of the program
at the center, operated by the county Probation Department in the
hills of Trabuco Canyon overlooking Rancho Santa Margarita. The goal:
to teach young lawbreakers how to live without violence or crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Expecting them to turn their backs on their gangs is
unrealistic," Salcido said. "The best we can do is give them some
strategies" for staying out of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   The program has been under special scrutiny lately because of the
county's controversial plans to expand it into a new 90-bed coed
youth treatment facility a quarter-mile away, a prospect that has
drawn the ire of neighbors. "We're tired of being the county's broom
closet," one of them said last year when county supervisors approved
the expansion.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal to build that new facility, however, may have been
dealt a death blow last week when a San Diego Superior Court judge
threw out the county's plans, saying the environmental impact report
was inadequate and that the project was not in keeping with planning
regulations for the area.</TE>
<TE>   Joplin staff members insist, however, that the services provided
by both the existing facility and the proposed one are necessary to
the community at large. The program turns young lives around,
staffers say, by forcing offenders "to interact with each other to
get what they want," Salcido said. "In the process they learn that
they don't have to share spit, but they don't have to resort to
violence either."</TE>
<TE>   As modest as it sounds, that goal was forged from years of
experience.</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, when the center opened on the once-private 240-acre
Joplin estate, it was a working ranch on which wayward minors--mostly
truants and runaways--raised much of their own food. The youngsters,
generally about 17 years of age, also received training in such
vocations as auto mechanics, cement work and carpentry.</TE>
<TE>   About 1980, the center began dealing with more hard-core
lawbreakers. Most of the farm animals were eliminated, and the age of
participants began to drop.</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, as juvenile crime rose and Joplin's mission
continued to evolve, job training was dropped in favor of a strong
emphasis on academics. And in response to the increasing influx of
young offenders in serious trouble with the law, staffers began
focusing on building social skills, teaching values and instilling
respect for authority.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Salcido said, the age of Joplin residents ranges from 12 to
17, with the average about 15 1/2--all there by order of the juvenile
court, usually for sentences of two to 12 months. About a third of
the boys are incarcerated for property crimes such as burglary or
auto theft; another third for probation violations; and the final
third for serious weapons-related offenses, including assault,
robbery and possession of illegal firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 80% of Salcido's young charges are in gangs. "Most of the
kids up here are core gang members or associates," he said. "About
half the gangs here are rivals in the streets. If they saw each other
in the community, the potential for violence would be there."</TE>
<TE>   To minimize that possibility at Joplin, the residents are divided
into "family" groups of about 13 apiece, each accompanied at all
times by a deputy probation counselor. The group members eat, work
and bunk together. On the rare occasion that a fight breaks out,
authorities said, it doesn't have time to escalate. "Most of the
altercations get stopped in 10 seconds," said Mark Peeples,
supervising probation counselor.</TE>
<TE>   More than just keeping flailing gang members apart, however, the
program is aimed at addressing some of the root issues fueling the
violence. To help foster a sense of personal responsibility and
consequence, residents are awarded status and privilege through
color-coded shirts. Everyone starts out wearing green. Those
presenting special disciplinary challenges descend to yellow, while
boys cooperating and staying out of trouble graduate into the more
desirable hues of red, burgundy and, finally, light or dark blue.</TE>
<TE>   Each color represents a level of achievement and corresponding
privilege. "We let out the line," he said, "and then, when they mess
up, we reel 'em back in."</TE>
<TE>   The residents participate in a variety of seminars dealing with
such issues as anger management, victim awareness, substance abuse,
values and parenting. And, at the upper levels of the shirt color
scheme, they go on field trips, such as touring area military bases,
attending sporting events, visiting the Museum of Tolerance and
feeding the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to point out alternatives," Salcido said. "Most of
these kids have lived their entire lives in a 10-block area--their
idea of a good time is sitting on the porch drinking beer with their
cousin who's on parole from the Youth Authority."</TE>
<TE>   Even while trying to instill higher goals to work toward, however,
program directors say they realize that the odds are against a
resident abandoning his gang. So rather than encourage their charges
to turn their backs on their homeboys, Salcido said, teachers,
therapists and probation counselors at Joplin try to give them
strategies to stay out of trouble. "We teach them how to make excuses
for not being in that car touring a rival's neighborhood with the .22
under the seat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although they don't have hard statistics to prove it, Joplin
officials believe they are achieving some success. About 70% of the
kids, they say, never come back, 22% return one to three times, and
about 8% make more than three returns. But even with the repeat
offenders, he said, "You don't know when the light's going to come
on. We tend to see a [reduced] severity of offenses. Who says that a
kid's supposed to get all this in 90 days?"</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen-year-old Thang certainly didn't. A Vietnamese gang
member from Garden Grove, he entered Joplin the first time at age 12
after being convicted of attempted murder during a street fight with
Mexican rivals. Two years later, he was back for making threats
against another gang member. At 15, he was arrested for violating
probation, and seven months ago returned for what he hopes is his
last visit, for "a little argument between me and another group"
ending in assault and battery.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in his Joplin experience, Thang is wearing a
coveted dark blue shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Thang said Joplin has made him more tolerant. "I've learned a lot
about the other races," he said. "When I was in the streets, I put
them down. I thought that we were the best, but I was wrong--all of
us are the same."</TE>
<TE>   But the real test of his resolve to stay out of trouble, Thang
admits, will come when he gets back home. "The big problem with
getting out," he said, "is that all your homeboys are around. There's
lots of temptation. I'm going to keep myself busy--by the time I get
out, I hope to have a job. I'm going to make my own decisions from
now on because I'm on thin ice--this is my last chance."</TE>
<TE>   Garrett, 16, at Joplin for vandalism and illicit drug use, says he
intends to never return. "This place gives you good discipline," he
said. "It's nice here, but it makes you not want to come back."</TE>
<TE>   And, finally, there's Rodolfo, the 15-year-old gangbanger from
Costa Mesa recently convicted of assault. His plan to reform: "We
moved away," he said of the family waiting for him on the outside. "I
have four brothers all in the same gang--I'm hoping to stay out of it
and get a job."</TE>
<TE>   What was it about the Joplin experience that turned him around?</TE>
<TE>   He gives the question some thought. "I don't know," he said after
a moment. "After being here so long, you think about what you did and
just change your mind."</TE>

<HD>Judo Club Puts Hold on Alleged Carjacker</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 20-year-old Los Angeles man was arrested Sunday on suspicion of
carjacking and kidnapping after a series of alleged crimes that ended
when he tried to take the minivan of a university judo club and was
forced into submission.</LD>
<LD>   After he was treated for minor injuries, Tyrone Hogan was being
held on $1.2-million bail, said LAPD Sgt. Alan Hamilton of the
Hollywood Division.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged crimes--which included a carjacking, a mugging and a
kidnapping--concluded at a gas station at Santa Monica Boulevard and
Highland Avenue when Hogan tried to carjack a vehicle that carried a
judo club from Florida International University, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   "He was detained, to say the least," Hamilton said. A bloodied
Hogan was treated at the scene and taken to Los Angeles police
headquarters downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The events began around 1:30 p.m. when Hogan allegedly carjacked a
man and woman outside their Hollywood-area home in the 1100 block of
Gordon Street, Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   After pulling the man out of the vehicle, Hamilton said, Hogan got
into the driver's seat and drove off with the woman inside.</TE>
<TE>   Hogan tried unsuccessfully to grab the woman's purse, Hamilton
said. Hogan then forced the woman out of the vehicle while it was
still moving, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton said police soon received a 911 call from a Mobil gas
station. Hamilton said Hogan had apparently pulled into the station

<TE>   Hogan tried to take a beige minivan that contained the judo club,
which was in town to teach a class in Long Beach, officials said. The
club had just completed a tour of Hollywood and was about to head to
Los Angeles International Airport, Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   Hogan asked a member of the coed judo club for money and then
became involved in a struggle with some of the others as he tried to
get the minivan, Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   It was then, police said, that several members of the judo club
used their skills to restrain Hogan.</TE>
<TE>   "We had this guy like a pretzel on the ground," said Nestor
Bustillo, the club's judo instructor. Team members placed Hogan in
what Bustillo called a body hold.</TE>
<TE>   "Judo team, 1; carjacker, 0," Hamilton said.</TE>

<HD>Returning to Echo Park, Jessica Greeted With Cheers,
Prayers and Some Lessons</HD>
<DH>Abduction: The smiling 4-year-old charms the crowd and
shows off a new haircut. Adults say they will be more wary of
strangers.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One week after being abducted from Echo Park, Jessica Cortez returned
Sunday to a joyous greeting by hundreds of well-wishers.</LD>
<LD>   They gave the 4-year-old talking dolls and stuffed animals. They
lined up to plant kisses on her cheek. And some children couldn't
wait to ride the swings with her again.</LD>
<LD>   "Ella es mi amiguita," said 3-year-old Yareth Leon. "She's my
little friend. I'm glad she's back."</LD>
<TE>   Jessica allegedly was kidnapped from the park by Patricia Cornejo,
a South Los Angeles mother of four.</TE>
<TE>   Cornejo allegedly held her for two days before being reported to
police by workers at a medical clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Cornejo, 34, has been charged with kidnapping, and her motive
remains unknown, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica appeared to have been unharmed, but her curls were cut. So
one of the first things her parents did when she was returned was to
give her a new haircut.</TE>
<TE>   Did she like it?</TE>
<TE>   "No!" yelled Jessica, smiling, as cameras rolled during one of
several interviews for television news crews.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica lifted the crowd's spirits with more mischief and
affection. Wearing a blue-and-white striped dress, she waved and blew
kisses, and tousled her 5-year-old brother's hair in front of the
cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica's parents, taco vendors at the park, thanked the police
and the media several times for helping with the citywide search.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica echoed their sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to say that I love everybody," she said in Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   The event, attended by police and civic leaders, included prayers,
speeches and lessons for children on how to avoid abductions.</TE>
<TE>   Parents were pleased to hear that police would be increasing
patrols in the park, but said Jessica's abduction had taught them to
be more wary of strangers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the feeling was one of relief, and thanks.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been so much bad news recently regarding child
abductions, and it just warmed everyone's heart that she is safe,"
said LAPD Dep. Police Chief Margaret York.</TE>
<TE>   "And you can see from her personality that she hasn't been
traumatized."</TE>

<HD>Pit Bull Badly Mauls Boy, 3</HD>
<DH>Safety: Doctors say La Habra incident left preschooler from
Orange with 'massive' lacerations. Dog has been quarantined.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 3-year-old boy visiting relatives in La Habra was mauled by a
neighborhood pit bull Saturday afternoon and was hospitalized with
"massive" lacerations, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Neighbors restrained the dog until police and animal control
officers arrived in the 600 block of Rye Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Macias of Orange was in stable condition at the UC Irvine
Medical Center in Orange on Sunday, a hospital official said.</LD>
<TE>   The boy's mother, Suzette Macias of Orange, said the dog attacked
after they got out of their car at a relative's house.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's grandmother tried to lift Michael over her head to
shield him, but the dog knocked her over, Macias said.</TE>
<TE>   "This should never have happened. Pit bulls should not be
domesticated at all," Macias said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were just having a day out and this happened."</TE>
<TE>   The dog may have belonged to a neighbor and was quarantined by La
Habra animal control officers, police said. The investigation is
continuing.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jay Calvert, a UCI assistant professor of clinical surgery in
the division of plastic surgery, treated Michael. The wounds show the
dog "intended to kill this child," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The dog meant business," Calvert said Sunday. "There are massive
lacerations. It was a vicious attack."</TE>
<TE>   The boy's left eyelid was pierced, but his vision appears
unaffected, Calvert said. Michael could have permanent scarring on
his forehead and right cheek, Calvert said.</TE>
<TE>   Calvert said a portion of the boy's scalp was torn off, but
doctors reattached it.</TE>

<HD>Tentative Pact OKd by MTA and Key Union</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The county's transit agency and the union representing its bus and
train supervisors have reached a tentative contract agreement, ending
the prospect of a bitter strike, a union official said.</LD>
<LD>   About 500 members of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees union are slated to vote today on the tentative
agreement, which was finalized late last week, according to union
spokeswoman Susan Greenwood.</LD>
<LD>   Greenwood said she expects union members will vote to approve the
deal and put an end to two years of negotiations in which both sides
repeatedly failed to find common ground on pay and benefits issues.</LD>
<TE>   The union is small but important because its members are
front-line supervisors, key to the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority's bus and train operations. Greenwood said the tone of the
talks changed in recent weeks after union members voted to prepare
for a strike.</TE>
<TE>   Under the tentative deal, union members, who make an average of
$63,000 a year, will be getting raises that will "balance out
inequities in pay," she said. It also calls for the stickier matter
of improved benefits to be hammered out by a special task force of
union and MTA leaders over the coming months, Greenwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations with the supervisors union are regarded as a litmus
test for the MTA. If the agency were unable to reach agreement with
its supervisors, upcoming talks with its drivers and mechanics unions
could prove to be more difficult.</TE>

<HD>Protesters Defend Man Facing Bomb Charges</HD>
<DH>Rally: Van Duc Vo is not a terrorist for his alleged
attempt on a Vietnamese embassy, supporters say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of Vietnamese protesters rallied outside the federal
courthouse in Santa Ana on Sunday, demonstrating against the
extradition of a Southern California man who allegedly tried to bomb
the Vietnamese Embassy in Bangkok last year.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters from as far as Utah and Seattle attended the peaceful
protest, which included a candlelight vigil and a planned one-day
hunger strike by some demonstrators.</LD>
<LD>   The protest was in support of Van Duc Vo, a member of a Little
Saigon-based organization dedicated to overthrowing Vietnam's
Communist government.</LD>
<TE>   Although Vo has agreed to be extradited to Thailand to face
bombing charges, a hearing on the matter is scheduled today before a
federal judge in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Vo's supporters gathered in a park next to the Ronald Reagan
Federal Building and Courthouse and chanted anti-Communist slogans,
waved American flags and flags of the former South Vietnam and
carried banners seeking the release of dozens of Vietnamese
dissidents.</TE>
<TE>   "We're overwhelmed by all the attention our family has gotten from
this. I'm really proud of my father," said Vo's daughter, Jennifer
Nguyen, 19.</TE>
<TE>   Vo's parents, wife and children received a roar of applause when
they spoke at the protest, where they were joined by religious and
community leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "He told us don't worry about him and everything will be OK. He
wanted to make sure that we didn't let this matter get in the way of
our schoolwork," Nguyen said. "We all miss him and want to see him
home soon."</TE>
<TE>   Vo, a U.S. citizen, was arrested by the FBI at John Wayne Airport
in October. Federal prosecutors allege Vo tried to bomb the
Vietnamese embassy in Bangkok in June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   He was charged with use of a weapon of mass destruction by a U.S.
citizen in a foreign country, but the U.S. attorney's office dropped
the charges after Vo agreed not to fight extradition to Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   His family and supporters said they fear that if Vo is extradited,
Thai officials may send him to face trial in Vietnam, where he would
probably face harsh punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's rally was organized by the Government of Free Vietnam, a
Westminster-based group dedicated to overthrowing Vietnam's communist
government.</TE>
<TE>   Vo is a member of the organization.</TE>
<TE>   The group's president, Chanh Huu Nguyen, arrived at the protest
with an entourage of armed bodyguards dressed in black.</TE>
<TE>   He stressed that his group did not sanction the embassy incident,
which he said was designed not to blow up the building but simply
cause a "bomb scare."</TE>
<TE>   "We want Vo and his family to know that we all stand behind him,"
said Chanh Huu Nguyen.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make a plea to the U.S. court justices and government
to not extradite Mr. Vo to Thailand and dismiss the case against him,
because he is not a terrorist but a freedom fighter."</TE>
<TE>   The protesters were both young and old. They hunkered down for
what they promised will be a 24-hour demonstration, chanting "Freedom
for Vietnam" and holding signs that read "Democracy for Vietnam" and
"Communism Is the Enemy of Humanity."</TE>
<TE>   Trinh Nguyen, 57, of San Diego, who said her son was arrested two
years ago in Vietnam and sentenced to 16 years in prison for passing
out anti-Communist fliers, sympathized with Vo and his family.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel so sad that my son is a prisoner, but at the same time I'm
proud that he, like Mr. Vo, loves his country so much and feels such
a strong connection that he is willing to risk his own life in an
attempt to free his people from Communism," she said.</TE>

<HD>Teachers Learn High-Tech Skills on Summer Jobs</HD>
<DH>Education: Employers say they get good communicators, and
the educators get great information to take back to school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>MOUNTAIN VIEW</DL>
<LD>With a Hello Kitty poster on the wall and daily motivational messages
taped to the window, the tiny office that E'Leva Hughes and Patti
Forster share looks more like a cheery classroom than a hard-driving
Silicon Valley technology company.</LD>
<LD>   That's because Hughes and Forster are middle-school English
teachers. But come September, these two will have plenty to tell
their students about what they did on their summer vacations--thanks
to an unusual program that puts Bay Area teachers to work at
technology companies.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the dramatic downturn in the region's high-tech economy,
the Silicon Valley nonprofit Industry Initiatives for Science and
Math Education found jobs for 130 teachers this summer, a record for
the 18-year-old program.</LD>
<TE>   Hughes and Forster work for Synopsys Inc., an electronic design
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers say they learn scientific and technological skills as
well as a better understanding of how corporate America functions.
That's valuable insight that they can take back to their students.</TE>
<TE>   For employers, the teachers bring a breath of fresh air and useful
approaches to training and communicating with other employees.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Hughes and Forster, that has meant promoting their
Synopsys Web site for information technology and training employees
to use it. To get out the message, they launched a "road show" within
the company, complete with massage therapists to help employees relax
in the face of so much new information.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, a first-time fellow in the program who teaches
eighth-grade language arts at Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School in
San Francisco, will use her experience to create a more realistic
business environment for her students.</TE>
<TE>   She believes business skills will help them as they study social
problems such as homelessness and drug abuse and try to come up with
solutions.</TE>
<TE>   To create a businesslike environment, she even plans to set up a
teleconference between her students and the school principal.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives me the opportunity to be the liaison between the
corporate world and school. I want them to have options," Hughes
said.</TE>
<TE>   Forster teaches seventh-grade English at Joaquin Moraga
Intermediate School in Moraga. This summer marked her fourth year as
a fellow in the program. In addition to her work for Synopsys, she
created a Web page to help other teachers make their information more
accessible on the Internet, and she filmed a documentary about
Hughes' experience at the nonprofit.</TE>
<TE>   Each teacher in the program is paired with a mentor from a host
company. The teachers also spend about five hours a week developing
lesson plans for their school classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Those who want to participate in the program post their
applications on the nonprofit's Web site. Employers select their own
fellows. This year there were three times as many applicants for the
program as there were positions.</TE>
<TE>   The program pays participants as much as $7,000 for their summer
work, which is meant to help them meet the high cost of living in the
Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   The extra income has enabled Charles Mosher, a sixth-year fellow
who teaches high school technology in San Jose, to qualify for a
mortgage on his Scotts Valley home.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this program is more important than ever," Mosher said.
"After the baby boom of the 1950s, we hired a bunch of teachers. Now
they're all retiring. Those are the folks that got cheap houses. Now,
we're looking at a bunch of new teachers who are renting because they
can't afford homes."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers say they enjoy interacting with other adults for a
change, but, by the end of the summer, most are eager to get back to
their classrooms. A cubicle, no matter how cheerfully decorated, is a
poor substitute for the lively give-and-take of a high-energy
classroom, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "You go from being in your own classroom, where you get to make
all the big decisions about what's going to happen in the course of
the day, to the corporate world, where you're generally just one
little piece of the whole office," said Deborah Frazier, a high
school math teacher in Cupertino.</TE>
<TE>   She just completed her third consecutive summer as a fellow at
NASA's Ames Research Lab in Mountain View.</TE>
<TE>   "Other jobs don't have the same emotional return as teaching,"
Frazier said.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Guichard, a high school math teacher from Livermore who
worked at Intel in Santa Clara this summer, agreed. "With kids,
you're always needed and you're always moving," he said. At a
company, "it's a lot more about the product."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, when the product is a giant underground machine for
smashing atoms, the product can be pretty cool. A San Jose high
school chemistry teacher, Earl Roske, spent the summer at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, a facility he always wondered
about as he drove past on the highway.</TE>
<TE>   After spending a week at a training lab in Chicago, he's been
working with two physicists who are studying how a certain part of
the accelerator's equipment is aging.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys don't work individually; they work together. They're
just so geared toward solving problems and working in a group. That's
the kind of philosophy I want in my classroom," Roske said.</TE>
<TE>   "I began to think about how I can get my kids to work together to
see lab as more of a collaboration."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a win-win situation on our end," said Rhodora Antonio, a
recruiter for National Semiconductor Corp. in Santa Clara, which
hired 11 teacher fellows this year.</TE>
<TE>   "These people are very good communicators, both written and
verbally. They're used to having an audience every day, and
communicating information in ways that people will understand."</TE>

<HD>Trailer Park Is Heaped With Violations</HD>
<DH>Health: Officials are trying to clean up North Hollywood
site, long known for drug dealing, rubbish and unsafe conditions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police, other city and state officials, and most
residents of Valley Village Mobile Home Park in North Hollywood say
the same thing: The place is a mess.</LD>
<LD>   Rusted jalopies are scattered about. Tattooed hookers and
in-your-face drug dealers regularly are seen there. Occasional sewer
backups and mounting litter make for a fetid atmosphere on hot summer
days.</LD>
<LD>   "This spot is a straight-out nightmare," resident Angel George,
38, said on a recent 100-degree day. "It's one step up from being
homeless."</LD>
<TE>   State and city officials say the 197-space park ranks among the
worst mobile home parks in the city because of its high number of
health and safety code violations.</TE>
<TE>   In May, in response to a rash of complaints from residents,
inspectors with the state's Housing and Community Development
Department found more than 465 violations. More than 300 residents of
the mobile home park in the 8200 block of Lankershim Boulevard were
cited for leaks, hazardous wiring and excessive rubbish.</TE>
<TE>   While the park owners, Valley Village Ltd., are obligated to
maintain the common areas, residents are responsible for their
individually rented spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "It's safe to say it has one of the highest [number of violations]
in the Los Angeles area," said Dan Rivers, field manager of the
department that regulates 3,800 mobile home parks throughout the
state.</TE>
<TE>   In June, inspectors found little improvement at the park. "The
results of the latest inspection showed not too much had been done,"
said administrator Adrian Perez.</TE>
<TE>   If another inspection within a month shows too few improvements,
the park owners and residents could face civil charges and fines,
Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   On-site manager Steve Drewry, who has been on the job for three
months, knows the park has problems.</TE>
<TE>   "This place has been run down for a long time, but I think it's
getting better," he said in a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what, in particular, had improved, Drewry hung up.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous residents, most lower-income and many retired, are
unhappy with their surroundings and say management should do more to
improve the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I came here to relax and enjoy life, but since I've been here,
I've had nothing but problems with management," said retired
long-haul trucker Dick Babb, whose trailer is a sort of unofficial
headquarters for park complaints.</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, residents are upset by the lack of security
and the profusion of narcotics dealing, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's too many drug addicts around here," said a 10-year-old
resident.</TE>
<TE>   Retired photographer George Axt, 81, said, "The worst thing about
the park is there is absolutely no security. The kids run wild
through the streets. There's a steady stream of traffic night and
day."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department Capt. Bruce Crosley, who commands
the North Hollywood Division, said the park is "a big place with lots
of vice," ranging from prostitution to drug-dealing.</TE>
<TE>   In the LAPD district that includes the park, one rape, eight
robberies, 17 assaults and 19 burglaries were reported between Jan. 1
and Aug. 7, and 25 people were arrested for drug-or alcohol-related
offenses. Last year, one rape, 10 robberies, 12 assaults and 29
burglaries were reported in the district.</TE>
<TE>   Residents and authorities say the number of arrests for drugs and
prostitution is low because police, like everyone else, have to enter
through a security fence.</TE>
<TE>   "The gate keeps some people out, but for a black-and-white [patrol
car], it kind of announces to everyone that we are coming in," said
Senior Lead Officer Pablo Monterossa.</TE>
<TE>   When crimes occur inside trailers, it's difficult for officers to
enforce the law, unless they have a search warrant. "Once they are
inside their trailer, there's not much we can do," Monterossa said.</TE>
<TE>   It is not unusual, he said, for a prostitute to pick up a customer
on San Fernando Road and bring him back to her trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "But as much as we can, we are trying to tell people, once they
bring the crimes outside their trailer, we are going to be there and
take action," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Undercover narcotics officers are in the park nearly every day,
but dealers and users know the residents and are leery of new people,
Monterossa said.</TE>
<TE>   In January, 56 residents filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior
Court against the park owners, claiming breach of contract, nuisances
and negligence. The suit claims that owners forced residents to live
in filth and degradation by ignoring the conditions there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable, the type of stuff that goes on over there,"
said attorney George Kaelin III, who represents the residents.</TE>
<TE>   In a response filed in court, David Bregman, attorney for the
owners, said his clients deny the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Bregman  blamed the residents for many of the park's woes. "The
residents are responsible for their trailers, and that's where the
problems are," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A trial date may be set at a court hearing on Sept. 10, lawyers
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the majority of violations are written to residents, some
blame the shabby trailer conditions on lax screening by management.</TE>
<TE>   "There's residents here that shouldn't be here, and they are a big
part of the problem," Axt said. "The owners should be more careful
about who they let in."</TE>
<TE>   Don Castleman, the managing partner of the group that owns the
park, did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors have granted extensions to residents, many of whom
don't have the resources to fix the problems. But the extensions are
drying up and civil court action will be taken, if necessary,
inspectors said.</TE>
<TE>   The mobile home park, built in 1952, has long had a reputation as
a troubled spot. State Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) said he
remembers the trailer park as a place to avoid when he was growing up
in Sun Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were young, there were certain places we knew we
shouldn't go and [that] was one of them," he said. "It's the most
problematic trailer park in my district. It has a history of crime
and drug-related problems."</TE>
<TE>   Alarcon's deputy, Manny Figueras, has worked with residents to
help resolve many of the issues there.</TE>
<TE>   He introduced one resident to a representative of the city
attorney's office to help deal with his concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the problems, many residents who own their trailers say
they can't afford the $4,000 it costs to move them. Others say they
can't afford to pay any more rent, which is about $300 to $650 a
month.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm stuck here and trying to get the heck out of here," Babb
said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Atty. Martha Gutierrez said finding a solution to the
mobile home park's problems has proved difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "If these people had anywhere else to go they would, but these
people are on the fringe," she said. "I really feel for them. I am at
a loss how to help them."</TE>

<HD>More Campsites and Trails Proposed for Santa Cruz Island</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Park service is catering to back-country hikers
in an effort to attract more visitors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Catering to those seeking a more isolated wilderness experience,
Channel Islands National Park hopes to expand the length and number
of trails on Santa Cruz Island while building several remote
campsites in the back country.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, put forward by park Supt. Tim Setnicka, is part of a
plan to attract more visitors to Santa Cruz, the largest of the
Channel islands. The park service controls about 25% of the
62,000-acre island, while the Nature Conservancy owns the rest.</LD>
<LD>   Setnicka wants to create an 18-mile loop trail from existing roads
and trails on the isthmus section of the island. The trail would
begin and end at Prisoner's Harbor.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal also calls for four primitive campgrounds offering
alternatives to the two often-crowded campgrounds on the island.</TE>
<TE>   "Every national park has some sort of option for backcountry
campers," said Tom Dore, park spokesman. "This plan gives people who
want isolation and to be truly alone in a secluded natural setting
the chance to have that experience."</TE>
<TE>   Dore said campsites on all the islands suffer from close proximity
to one another, and those on Santa Cruz can get up to 250 people at a
time. The new proposal would set up sites along the 14-mile hike
between Scorpion and Prisoner's harbors, giving trekkers a place to
spend the night during the journey.</TE>
<TE>   The east end of Santa Cruz was chosen for expanded hiking because
the island isn't as ecologically fragile as other islands in the
chain, such as Anacapa, Santa Rosa and Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "Human impact will show least in a place so devastated by feral
sheep and pigs," Dore said. "If there is a problem, we can stop it at
any time."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Cruz averages between 22,000 and 26,000 visitors a year,
compared with 99,000 last year at Anacapa, Dore said.</TE>
<TE>   An environmental assessment of the proposal is available for
public review until Sept. 6. Officials say trails and campgrounds
could affect some historic and archeological sites on the island.
There is also a danger that hikers could bring in nonnative seeds on
shoes and clothing that could sprout and cause damage, like the
fennel that continues to plague the island.</TE>
<TE>   If the plan is approved, the trail and campsites could be
completed as early as next spring, Dore said.</TE>

<HD>Girl's Murder Shatters Neighborhood's Tranquillity</HD>
<DH>Sabre Springs: Since the day 7-year-old Danielle van Dam
disappeared, the planned community has been the object of curiosity
and ridicule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Barbara Baker was visiting friends out of state and told them she
lives in the same neighborhood as the family of the murdered
7-year-old Danielle van Dam and her accused killer, David
Westerfield.</LD>
<LD>   "One friend said: 'Not that terrible place!' " said Baker, a
freelance writer. "I said, 'It's really not terrible. There were just
bad decisions by people on both sides of this tragedy.' Sabre Springs
is a wonderful place."</LD>
<LD>   Until Feb. 2, the day Danielle disappeared, few would have
disagreed with Baker's assessment of Sabre Springs, a planned
community of about 9,000 people on the city's northern edge along
Interstate 15.</LD>
<TE>   Part of the horror has been the incongruity of its location.</TE>
<TE>   "Until Danielle disappeared, Sabre Springs' idea of crime was when
a couple of teenagers toilet-papered a house as a joke," said real
estate agent Sam Rasoul.</TE>
<TE>   Its tranquillity shattered, Sabre Springs has become an object of
curiosity and even ridicule.</TE>
<TE>   One radio talk-show host calls the community Sabre Swings, a dig
at the sexually permissive lifestyle of Danielle's parents and the
fact that Brenda van Dam was dancing, drinking, shooting pool and
smoking marijuana in nearby Poway on the night Danielle was abducted.</TE>
<TE>   Two other talk-show hosts play the theme music from the television
series "Twin Peaks" when they discuss the case against Westerfield,
the respectable-looking neighbor who, according to prosecutors, was
seething with sexual fantasies about young girls.</TE>
<TE>   And one Sabre Springs resident complained that a story done by a
weekly newspaper made the neighborhood sound as if it was populated
by Stepford wives, a reference to the zombie-like characters in the
movie.</TE>
<TE>   Even after months of massive media coverage and with the jury set
to resume deliberations today, it remains shocking to many that a
young girl could be kidnapped from her bed in the middle of the night
in a community thought to be a haven.</TE>
<TE>   "Who would ever believe it could happen in Sabre Springs?" asked
Martin Kruming, editor of San Diego Lawyer Magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad whenever something like this happens anywhere, but it's
doubly sad when it happens in a place so focused on protecting
children," said San Diego Councilman Brian Maienschein, who
represents Sabre Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Sabre Springs' squeaky-clean image made revelations about the Van
Dams' lifestyle even more tantalizing to the media.</TE>
<TE>   "We never suggested they were responsible" for the murder, said
talk-show host Rick Roberts. "We just said they aren't Ward and June
Cleaver putting Beaver to bed and being surprised in the morning that
Wally is gone."</TE>
<TE>   Built by one of the region's premier development firms, Sabre
Springs offered the idyllic, child-centric version of Southern
California suburbia that was part of Steven Spielberg's vision in
"E.T."</TE>
<TE>   Spacious homes with tile roofs, wide and curving streets perfect
for kids riding bikes, mini-parks with playground equipment, and
brushy canyons for hide-and-seek.</TE>
<TE>   The parents leave each morning for high-paying jobs in the city's
glamour industries, and the gardeners arrive in their trucks. In the
evening, a parade of sport-utility vehicles and minivans returns.</TE>
<TE>   Life is centered on youth sports and the neighborhood elementary
school, part of the high-achieving Poway school district.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen years ago, the area was a grazing spot for cattle. Then
came Sabre Springs and other communities to provide upscale housing;
anyone who bought more than a decade ago in Sabre Springs is called a
"pioneer."</TE>
<TE>   The community's most celebrated resident is professional soccer
star Brian Quinn, now coach of the San Diego Spirit. Second place may
go to high-school pitching star Cole Hamels, just drafted by the
Philadelphia Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   "Sports was what Sabre Springs was known for before this tragedy,"
said Rick Smith, chairman of the Sabre Springs Planning Group, which
advises city government.</TE>
<TE>   The cliche about suburbia is that people are emotionally isolated
and unconcerned about their neighbors. That was not the case when
Danielle disappeared and for the 25 agonizing days before her body
was found in a rural area far away.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first things that made police suspicious of Westerfield
was that while other neighbors came running to help, he packed his
recreational vehicle and left.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of volunteers from Sabre Springs and elsewhere mounted a
massive search.</TE>
<TE>   "Danielle really woke everybody up into realizing that they're a
neighborhood that should hang together," said Pat Kumpan, who covered
Sabre Springs for the weekly Corridor News that covers communities
along I-15.</TE>
<TE>   But there are limits to compassion. When Maienschein suggested
that residents consider renaming a park for Danielle or erecting a
memorial, response was swift.</TE>
<TE>   "People didn't want their kids walking by and being reminded every
day of the tragedy," Smith said. "That seems reasonable to me."</TE>
<TE>   Media mockery aside, Sabre Springs has not lost its allure. Helped
by low interest rates, the real estate market is hot. Among homes for
sale is Westerfield's, deeded to his attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   A four-bedroom, 1,800-square-foot home runs between $450,000 and
$480,000, said Rasoul. A two-story 3,500-square-foot
Mediterranean-style home around the block from the Van Dams is listed
at $675,000 to $725,000.</TE>
<TE>   If there were any initial support for Westerfield, it seems to
have declined. "Prior to the trial, I think people were definitely
split," said Susan Wintersteen, a friend of the Van Dams. "But not
since the evidence has been coming out."</TE>
<TE>   The trial is a constant topic of discussion at the Sabre Springs
retail center, the parks, and even school events.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something in the air," Baker said. "People want
resolution. Sabre Springs has been through a lot."</TE>

<HD>Critics Call Utah Land Swap Unfair</HD>
<DH>Trade: Agency officials complain about a deal they say
undervalues federal parcels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration recently agreed to a massive land swap with
Utah even though the federal government's experts had warned that the
deal amounted to a $100-million giveaway by U.S. taxpayers, documents
show.</LD>
<LD>   The deal would exchange 135,000 acres of federal land for 108,000
acres of state parcels, many of them surrounded by federal areas.
Utah would get commercially attractive land that would pump taxes
into its school system. The federal government would get scenic
red-rock bluffs for a possible national monument as well as prime
habitat for the threatened desert tortoise.</LD>
<LD>   At least six officials at the federal Bureau of Land Management,
including its chief real estate appraisers for Utah and the nation,
have complained internally that the swap offers a windfall to the
state. They said several parcels of mineral-rich federal land had
been counted as having little or no mineral value, and they issued
blistering critiques of "one-sided and inaccurate" information in an
official white paper justifying the deal.</LD>
<TE>   BLM negotiators and their bosses in the Interior Department valued
the state and federal lands at about $35 million for each side. But
the BLM's Utah office concluded that the federal land's worth ranged
from $97 million to $117 million more. One of Utah's top officials
bragged that the oil, gas, coal, tar sands and oil shale deposits his
state would obtain through the deal "could bring in hundreds of
millions of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   "This is like Enron all over again," said Kent Wilkinson, a BLM
appraiser in Utah who gave documents and e-mail messages to the
Washington Post. "They're cooking the books, and it's all to the
detriment of the public."</TE>
<TE>   This is the third controversial state-federal land swap in Utah in
four years. An audit last year by the Interior Department accused the
BLM of approving a lopsided deal with private Utah landowners.
Environmental groups have sharply criticized the agency's deal, while
Western conservatives complained throughout the Clinton
administration about federal efforts to lock up land as monuments and
wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Wilkinson and lawyers with the group Public Employees
for Environmental Responsibility filed a complaint, which could hold
up the latest trade.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Fulton, a deputy assistant secretary of the Interior, said
Friday that the department will reconsider one slice of the deal as a
result of BLM's concerns, reevaluating a coal-rich 4,000-acre tract
that was inaccurately designated as mineral-free. But he defended the
exchange as mutually beneficial, giving the federal government more
manageable land, the state more commercially attractive land.</TE>

<LD>Police investigating the disappearance of a 9-year-old girl in
Bassett whose parents were slain in their home said they were
focusing on several new leads as officers continued a frustrating
search.</LD>
<LD>   Henry County Sheriff Frank Cassell said authorities were looking
into "fairly promising leads" regarding Jennifer Short, who police
believe was abducted early Thursday after her parents were shot. He
declined to elaborate.</LD>
<LD>   "There's very little physical evidence," Cassell said. "We have
two bodies, a missing child and little else. We've had no sightings,
we've had no vehicle descriptions. All we've got is what we're
running down right now."</LD>

<LD>President Bush will meet Wednesday at his ranch with Vice President

Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but officials said Iraq
was not on the official agenda.</LD>
<LD>   White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said the meeting at Bush's
ranch near Crawford, where he is on vacation, would focus on military
reforms and missile defense. Bush has made ousting Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein one of his priorities, but Buchan said "that is not
the purpose" of the meeting.</LD>

<LD>At least one of the Fire Department of New York's most senior
officers should oversee large-scale emergencies from its remote
operations center instead of the disaster scene, according to a
five-month study of the department's response to the Sept. 11 attacks
on the World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   The report to be released today recommends overhauling many
systems and procedures to prepare for emergencies that could be more
daunting than even the twin towers' collapse. Recommendations include
a more rigorously structured command system to ensure tight control
of equipment and personnel. Dozens of firefighters directed to
staging points around the towers instead went straight into the
buildings. The department lost 343 members that day.</LD>

<DH>Disease: Deaths in 1990s prompt concern that brain illness
may have spread from deer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Botts could not make his hand obey. He was trying to write a
grocery list, and the words kept trailing off into scribbles. He
figured that he was just tired. A few days later, though, he was
riding his bike and one hand kept flying off the handlebar. Then he
tried to put up a window screen and found that he couldn't grip the
stapler.</LD>
<LD>   Within weeks, Botts lost vision and speech; he began shaking so
violently, his wife and four kids had to take turns holding him down.
On his 55th birthday, his wife spoon-fed him. He died within days,
July 27, 1999.</LD>
<LD>   An autopsy confirmed that Botts had Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a
fatal brain disorder that afflicts roughly 1 in 1 million people
worldwide. His suffering seemed to be a random twist of fate. Then
Judy Botts got a call from the son of an old family friend. His dad
had died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob in 1993, after years of hosting
wild-game feasts at his Wisconsin cabin--feasts that Jim Botts had
often attended. Could there be a link?</LD>
<TE>   The question startled Judy Botts. And it intrigued state and
federal researchers who read the speculation in local newspapers this
summer, because chronic wasting disease was detected in Wisconsin
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which can incubate for 10 or 15 years before
causing any symptoms, belongs to the same family of ailments as
chronic wasting disease, which afflicts deer and elk. Another related
illness is "mad cow" disease: bovine spongiform encephalopathy. In
Europe, mad cow jumped the species barrier and infected at least 125
beefeaters with Creutzfeldt-Jakob. Could chronic wasting have made
the leap from deer to humans as well?</TE>
<TE>   To find out, epidemiologists from the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta recently ordered an analysis of
preserved brain specimens from Botts, from game-feast host Wayne
Waterhouse, and from Roger Marten, who also enjoyed the spreads of
deer and elk at the Waterhouse cabin. Marten died in 1993 of a rare
brain disorder; it was diagnosed as Pick's disease, but scientists
say it could have been Creutzfeldt-Jakob.</TE>
<TE>   The European victims infected by beef all came down with a variant
of Creutzfeldt-Jakob distinguished by a particular combination of
amino acids. If Waterhouse, Botts and Marten were infected by a
common source--such as venison--the disease would probably turn up
with the same genetic markers in the men, said Jim Kazmierczak, a
Wisconsin epidemiologist.</TE>
<TE>   But Kazmierczak cautioned that the cluster of brain disease could
turn out to be coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC has investigated other suspicious cases of venison eaters
coming down with Creutzfeldt-Jakob; so far, there has not been proof
of a link.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials warn hunters not to eat meat from any deer that
looks ill. They also suggest not eating brains or other organs from
any animal, as the prions that cause the illness lodge there. Beyond
that, they say it's up to each individual to decide whether to eat
venison.</TE>
<TE>   The uncertainty has created a widespread fear that Wisconsin
officials dub "prion paranoia." One recent poll found that 36% of the
state's deer hunters might not pick up their guns this fall. State
biologists field dozens of calls a week from worried citizens, some
afraid that even walking on deer droppings could kill them.</TE>
<TE>   Though he watched his father suffer for nearly a year with brain
wasting, Randy Marten refuses to give in to such fear. He still eats
venison. "If I was going to fear the unknown," he said, "I wouldn't
get out of bed."</TE>

<HD>Terrorism Insurance Bill Revived</HD>
<DH>Congress: Government would become insurer of last resort in
event of an attack. A compromise measure is expected to become law by
October.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a significant turnabout, legislation to make the federal
government the insurer of last resort for damage caused by terrorist
attacks is gaining new momentum and could soon become law.</LD>
<LD>   The measure had stalled in Congress several months ago and was
almost given up for dead. But supporters, through aggressive
lobbying, seem to have made the case that the federal role is
important to protect businesses and the economy.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, President Bush also reiterated his backing for the
legislation. He said in a speech in Texas that billions of dollars'
worth of commercial construction projects have been shelved because
of a shortage of affordable terrorism insurance. The reason: Banks
will not lend money to developers who can't obtain adequate coverage.</LD>
<TE>   "We need a terrorism insurance bill to get American hard hats back
to work," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   With the Republican-led House and Democratic-controlled Senate
each having approved terrorism insurance bills, lawmakers late last
month agreed to begin negotiations on a compromise that could be
approved in both chambers by October.</TE>
<TE>   Walloped by an estimated $40 billion to $50 billion in losses
stemming from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, industry leaders began
clamoring for the government to assume some risk in case of future
strikes.</TE>
<TE>   The industry leaders, supported by state insurance regulators,
warned that many commercial policies covering terrorism would expire
in January and would not be renewed without government intervention.
They predicted devastating effects on the economy.</TE>
<TE>   But Congress, quarreling over whether to set limits on damages in
terrorism-related lawsuits, failed in December to finish the
legislation. When the new year arrived, the insurance issue faded on
Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, meanwhile, the insurance markets responded,
mainly by making terrorism coverage expensive or impossible to get.
Insurers claimed that they lacked the resources to offer coverage for
singular, unpredictable catastrophes on the scale of the collapse of
the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-five states agreed to allow insurers to write standard
language into policies that would limit or exclude terrorism
coverage. California and New York were major exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   However, there are indications that terrorism coverage is becoming
more scarce in California as well. A spokeswoman for the California
Department of Insurance, Nanci Kramer, said the state had approved,
through July, 392 requests for terrorism exclusions filed by
individual insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   The Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers found in July that 80%
of brokers surveyed nationwide also were reporting drops in terrorism
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Other reports, though, have found evidence that such coverage is
slowly reemerging. All sides agree that the market remains in great
flux.</TE>
<TE>   Coletta Kemper, the council's vice president for industry affairs,
said government intervention is crucial to help insurance companies
respond to the changing demands on their industry.</TE>
<TE>   What the companies want is assurance that Washington will step in
with a "backstop" if losses exceed a certain threshold. Both the
House and Senate versions envision such guarantees.</TE>
<TE>   "What it would do at least is give them some certainty," Kemper
said. "If there's a terrorism event, they know what their losses
would be to a point. That's real important when you're trying to
price a product."</TE>
<TE>   Under the House bill, passed in November by a vote of 227 to 193,
the government would cover 90% of property and casualty claims after
losses in a terrorist attack exceed $1 billion. But insurers would be
required to reimburse the government.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Senate bill, passed in June by 84 to 14, the government
would cover 90% of claims after total losses top $10 billion. But the
Senate version would not require repayment. Both bills envision some
government aid for less catastrophic attacks. The programs would last
a year or two. The industry would then be on its own.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional aides say a key sticking point is whether to limit
civil liability in terrorism-related lawsuits and, if so, by how
much. The House bill would allow punitive damages to be assessed only
against terrorists and their accomplices, not against businesses they
hit. The Senate bill is largely silent on the matter. The Bush
administration favors the House position.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators will also have to decide how much, if anything, the
insurance industry should be required to repay the government if
federal aid is needed.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the sense on Capitol Hill is that a deal will be struck--if
not by Sept. 11, then soon afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely a commitment on the part of Congress to get
something done," said an aide to one House Democrat involved in the
talks. Republicans agree.</TE>
<TE>   The bill may have been hampered by last year's dire warnings.
Predictions of economic disaster in January, another congressional
aide acknowledged, were "overplayed." But aides say that doesn't mean
the insurance shortage is not a threat to the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Credit rating agencies, for example, are giving scrutiny to
whether property holders are adequately covered. And deal-making for
"trophy" properties in New York and other cities has been
complicated. The sky may not have fallen, one congressional aide
said, "but it's beginning to rain."</TE>

<LD>Is there anything more petty than a politician arguing about the
process of making policy?</LD>
<LD>   Excluded last week from President Bush's feel-good economic summit
in Waco, Texas, leading Democrats still had their moment in the
spotlight when the national press asked them what they would have
said had Bush invited them to the meeting.</LD>
<LD>   And one by one, starting with House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt of Missouri, top Democrats trooped before the microphones
and solemnly declared they would have asked Bush ... for another
meeting. A meeting with everyone invited and "everything on the
table."</LD>
<TE>   More meetings: Now there's a rallying cry for workers worried
about their jobs and retirees watching their 401(k) plans melt.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what they might say at such a meeting, should the president
agree to one, Democrats demurred. "I think we make a mistake if we
announce ahead of such a possible meeting what ... we think ought to
be done," Gephardt insisted on CNN.</TE>
<TE>   This certainly qualifies as a unique strategy for an opposition
party just before an election. On every other conceivable
issue--prescription drugs, energy, Social Security--Gephardt and
other Democrats are happy, eager, even desperate, to announce what
they think should be done. From coast to coast, Democratic candidates
are emptying their wallets on television ads to tell voters what they
think ought to be done. But on the economy, the country's top
domestic concern, mum's the word.</TE>
<TE>   The subtext in all this isn't too hard to read. It turns on a
single word: taxes. Democrats understand it's virtually impossible to
articulate a coherent alternative to Bush's economic agenda without
reclaiming some of the revenue from his $1.35-trillion tax cut, both
to reduce the federal deficit and to invest in programs, such as
education and scientific research, that they believe will strengthen
long-term growth.</TE>
<TE>   But many Democrats (especially in the party's congressional
leadership) are extremely reluctant--"terrified" might be a better
word--to propose retrenching the tax cut unless Bush is on board.
Hence the talk of another meeting to formulate a new economic plan.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats have in mind the precedent of 1990, when the Democratic
Congress pressured the first President Bush into a budget summit
where Bush repudiated his "no new taxes" pledge from 1988 and
accepted a tax increase as part of a sweeping budget package.
Together with the deficit reduction plan that President Clinton
pushed through in 1993, that package eventually contributed to the
economic boom of the 1990s--but it also fractured Bush's coalition
and alienated conservatives heading into the 1992 campaign. Democrats
wouldn't mind a repeat.</TE>
<TE>   Well, here's a bulletin for the party brain trust: George W. Bush
also remembers what happened to his father. And that means he'd
probably appoint Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Supreme Court
before he'd convene another budget summit. If congressional Democrats
are waiting until Bush invites them to the Camp David retreat in
Maryland to share their vision on how to invigorate the economy, they
will be keeping their light under a bushel for a very long time. Like
forever.</TE>
<TE>   With Democrats muted, the economic dialogue has been more of a
monologue. Bush blames the terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, the stock market scandals and a slowdown
that began under President Clinton for the sluggish economy.
Democrats don't point to the long-term threat of renewed
deficits--even though Robert E. Rubin, Clinton's Treasury secretary
and the party's most respected economic voice, recently identified
the deficits as "once again the biggest threat to the
economy"--because that would raise the question of what they intend
to do about them.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Bush is increasingly blaming congressional overspending
for the return of federal deficits. Democrats last week didn't
emphasize the role of his tax cut--even though the administration's
own figures show it is the single largest factor in the long-term
collapse of the federal balance sheet--because it would raise the
question of what they intended to do about that. And for now, the
answer is: nothing.</TE>
<TE>   If Democrats wanted to articulate an economic alternative, they
might not have to look too far to find one. Consider these key
elements of the economic landscape today: mounting federal deficits,
an uncertain stock market and a recovery proceeding too slowly to
generate jobs. (The U.S. has lost an estimated 1.6 million jobs since
Bush took office.) With unemployment up, wage growth is down. And if
economic growth accelerates, increasing the demand for credit, the
looming federal deficits will force up interest rates,
short-circuiting the recovery.</TE>
<TE>   All of that is eerily similar to the conditions the first
President Bush left behind. The economy faces some new challenges,
particularly the fallout from the stock market scandals. But the
problems now resemble those under the last Bush closely enough that
Democrats could argue for adapting the solutions Clinton proposed in
1993: deficit reduction coupled with trade promotion and targeted
investments in areas such as education to encourage long-term growth.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) has made the most progress in
updating the Clinton approach into a contemporary plan. In a recent
speech, Lieberman called for capping the growth of overall domestic
spending and freezing the next installments of the Bush tax cut aimed
at the highest earners. (Under that proposal, no one, not even the
wealthy, would pay more in taxes than they do today.) With the money
saved, Lieberman would reduce the deficit, invest in education,
provide tax incentives to spur scientific research and try to
resuscitate the Internet economy with a coordinated effort to deploy
broadband technology. "In this century," Lieberman said, "focused
government investments in education, training and innovation will
drive economic growth worth many times their initial expense."</TE>
<TE>   Most Republicans, of course, would say tax cuts spur growth more.
That's an argument worth having. But right now, there is no argument
because so few Democrats are joining Lieberman in saying publicly
what almost all believe privately: that it won't be possible to
stabilize the federal budget or accelerate long-term growth without
reconsidering the next stages of the Bush tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   Until Democrats bite that bullet, they'll be left talking about
meetings. Probably to empty rooms.</TE>

<HD>Suspect in Shooting Also Wounds 5 Officers</HD>
<DH>Mississippi: Police chief is hit trying to arrest a man in
an earlier assault. Others hurt in standoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FRIARS POINT, Miss.</DL>
<LD>Five law enforcement officers were wounded during a bloody 36-hour
saga that ended Sunday morning with the arrest of one man in this
small Mississippi Delta town.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Herbert Thomas said none of the officers was killed, and the
man suspected in all five shootings--as well as in the shooting of a
man Friday--was in custody.</LD>
<LD>   Friars Point Police Chief Anthony Smith had been trying to arrest
Patrick Harper in connection with Friday's incident when the chief
was shot in the neck Saturday, Thomas said.</LD>
<TE>   Smith remained hospitalized Sunday in satisfactory condition. The
other officers were in satisfactory condition or better.</TE>
<TE>   After the police chief was shot, officers from the Coahoma County
Sheriff's Department were called in and tracked Harper to a nearby
home in Friars Point, a town of about 1,400 people 200 miles
northwest of Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   As officers tried to enter the ramshackle home just after
midnight, gunshots rang out, and Friars Point Officer John
Martin-Harris and sheriff's Deputy Victor Randle were shot, Thomas
said.</TE>
<TE>   With Martin-Harris hurt and apparently taken hostage inside the
home, police units from surrounding counties, the Mississippi Bureau
of Narcotics and the Mississippi Department of Corrections were
called in.</TE>
<TE>   "The suspect took the officer's radio and handcuffs and his gun
and he started making demands that he wanted all the police cars
except for two to leave," Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   About 3 a.m. Sunday, officers wearing bulletproof vests and armed
with shields used a battering ram to break through the door,
Mississippi Department of Corrections officer Kenny Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   "We got the door opened, and that's when the shots started," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott was hit in the thigh. Sheriff's Deputy Neal Mitchell also
was wounded.</TE>
<TE>   About 5:30 a.m., Martin-Harris called from inside the home and the
officers discovered that the suspect had slipped away.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, the suspect escaped with about 100 officers surrounding
the home. Neighborhood lights had been shot out during the nighttime
confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, about 80 officers surrounded the home of Harper's
grandmother, with the suspect inside. After two more hours of
negotiations, Harper surrendered, Thomas said. Harper was being held
at the Coahoma County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't immediately clear what led to the shooting Friday night
of Doyle Hunter, the Friars Point resident. He was shot in the face
and shoulder and remained hospitalized Sunday.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>CNN on Sunday broadcast excerpts of tapes it said it had obtained in
Afghanistan that appear to show Al Qaeda members testing chemical
weapons on dogs.</LD>
<LD>   The cable TV channel said it had obtained 64 videotapes made over
a decade, nearly all of them shot before the Sept. 11 attacks blamed
on Osama bin Laden's network.</LD>
<LD>   "Among the most frightening scenes in the collection of tapes are
those of testing of a poison gas on three dogs," CNN said. "The
disturbing images show the dying moments of the defenseless, enclosed
animals."</LD>
<TE>   It quoted a senior Bush administration official involved in
weapons issues as saying he was "very troubled" by the footage,
particularly as it related to chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The official told CNN that the video of chemical tests on the dogs
suggested "a very strong desire to acquire the capability to use such
weapons against humans."</TE>
<TE>   "This tape is unquestionable documentation that [Bin Laden] has
some capability," the official said. The tape showed "some level of
sophistication and indicates they were trying to get results."</TE>
<TE>   One tape shows men wearing Afghan-style sandals rushing out of an
enclosure where one dog is penned. A white liquid that gives off a
gas seeps in, and the dog begins showing physical discomfort.</TE>

<DH>Colorado: A wealthy owner of 860 acres outside Telluride
has big ideas for his parcel. The tiny, affluent town poses a
formidable opponent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TELLURIDE, Colo.</DL>
<LD>The drive to Telluride is a journey through beauty. The long snaking
road climbs through a crack in the angular San Juan Mountains and
finally issues out to the valley floor, a 3-mile-long swath of green
where cattle graze amid wildflowers.</LD>
<LD>   This is the frontyard to Telluride, a storied mining settlement
where ascending tiers of violet-and green-painted Victorian homes
cling precariously to the mountainside and the entire town backs into
a box canyon.</LD>
<LD>   The only way in and out of town is to cross the narrow valley
floor. It may be the most disputed slice of property in Colorado.</LD>
<TE>   Fights over land are hardly new in this region, where such
disagreements were once settled with guns. What's happening now is an
updated Western duel in which a wealthy resort town is pitted against
a rich absentee landowner, with each party claiming the right of
self-determination and each motivated by power and money.</TE>
<TE>   At stake are 860 acres of meadows and wetlands leading into one of
the most spectacular settings in the Rockies: a town hemmed by
sandstone walls, sheltered under a waterfall, and home to movie stars
and corporate honchos.</TE>
<TE>   The valley floor is more than Telluride's front door, it is a
habitat for diverse species of plants and animals, including a
squadron of rare butterflies that lured writer Vladimir Nabokov, an
avid lepidopterist, to town in the 1950s. The land gives rise to the
San Miguel River, one of the last in Colorado that hasn't been
dammed.</TE>
<TE>   The owner of the contested property is Neal Blue, a defense
contractor and maker of nuclear reactors. The San Diego
multimillionaire wants to build on his parcel, which some have valued
at $60 million, if it is developed.</TE>
<TE>   Opposing him is Telluride, a tiny town with outsized power and an
abiding aversion to development. After years of wrangling, both sides
are entrenched. The town wants control of the land. Blue says it's
not for sale.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Telluride raised the stakes. In a special election,
voters overwhelmingly gave approval for the town to condemn Blue's
property.</TE>
<TE>   Condemnation is seen by some as an audacious maneuver, especially
considering the valley floor property lies not in Telluride but in
the jurisdiction of San Miguel County and anyway is somewhat larger
in area than Telluride.</TE>
<TE>   But this town's ambitions have never been limited by its size.</TE>
<TE>   A Mid-1800s Theme</TE>
<TE>   Telluride is but a mile long. A jumble of homes and condos radiate
from Main Street, maintaining an architectural theme from the
mid-1800s. Driving is discouraged: Most people walk or bike. Neither
bikes nor homes are locked here.</TE>
<TE>   The entire town is on the National Register of Historic Places
and, through restrictive zoning, zealously maintains its quaintness.</TE>
<TE>   But character comes at a cost. The average home price last year in
Telluride was more than $800,000. In Mountain Village, the settlement
atop Telluride's ski mountain, the average price for a house is more
than $3.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors flock here in the winter for skiing and the rest of the
year for music and cultural festivals. Telluride is also a magnet for
those who see the laid-back town as a model of progressive
government.</TE>
<TE>   Street corner debates concerning current events are common, with
locals emphatically gesturing with cups of latte. Politics is taken
seriously. Things were so contentious at town council meetings this
summer that a shaman was brought in to perform a ceremony to rid the
council chamber of bad vibes.</TE>
<TE>   "The town of Telluride is one of the most politically volatile
places you can imagine," said Tom Ragonettie, the lawyer who
represents Blue and the San Miguel Valley Corp., which is the
landowner of record. "It's a very small and very incestuous place."</TE>
<TE>   Yet enormously powerful. Arrayed behind the condemnation effort
are entertainers Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer and Daryl Hannah, all
residents of the area. Few of the very rich live in the town itself,
preferring the mesas above it.</TE>
<TE>   Other wealthy landowners are EBay Chief Executive Meg Whitman,
AT&amp;T Chief Executive C. Michael Armstrong, and Robert W. Pittman, who
until last month was chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner.</TE>
<TE>   In a battle of deep pockets, Telluride can more than hold its own.
The town has socked away about $6 million to buy land for open space,
and a local environmental group has raised about $5.6 million to
purchase the valley floor, back when that was still a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   With money from a bond measure and other funds, Telluride has a
war chest of nearly $19 million. This from a town that has barely
2,000 full-time residents.</TE>
<TE>   "People see this as David versus Goliath," said Telluride Mayor
John Steel, an East Coast transplant who favors a white cowboy hat.
"But it's really Goliath against Goliath."</TE>
<TE>   An Opaque Personality</TE>
<TE>   As long as anybody can remember, there have been arguments about
the future of the valley floor. The Idarado Corp., which for decades
mined gold in the region, sold the tract to Blue in 1983 for about $7
million. The land essentially has remained unchanged since then.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Blue owns the property, he seldom visits Telluride.
Former Mayor Amy Levek remembers meeting Blue more than 10 years ago
when he met informally with people in town to sound them out on
development of the valley floor. His was an opaque personality, Levek
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He struck me as a person who has a very strong idea of what he
wants to accomplish," she said. "One person I know who knows Neal
Blue pretty well has described him as a character in an Ayn Rand
book. He's used to getting his way."</TE>
<TE>   Things went sour for Blue's interests in 1993, after a bizarre
foul-up. A San Miguel Valley Corp. consultant prepared development
plans, including draining wetlands "under the guise of agriculture,"
buying the pesky local newspaper and using mine tailings to line the
bottoms of four artificial lakes.</TE>
<TE>   The consultant intended to fax that document to the SMVC office in
Telluride. Instead, it was sent to exactly the wrong place: the San
Miguel County Planning Office.</TE>
<TE>   The misfired fax stirred the passions of anyone left in town who
had failed to form an opinion on the matter. The general feeling was
that Blue had finally tipped his hand and shown that he planned to
erect a monstrosity that would essentially trash the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "The fax was a turning point. Everything fell apart after that;
the middle ground was lost," Levek said. "Telluride can be very
difficult, very involved and opinionated. After the fax, things were
more polarized."</TE>
<TE>   Levek, who supports condemning the property, said the goal is to
preserve the essential character of Telluride. Others see an economic
element at work: Telluride earns its tourism income because of its
pristine setting. That makes the town willing to spend nearly $20
million to protect that revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Although the majority in town are clearly in favor of
condemnation, some believe that Telluride is spending too much money
to trample on someone's rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand all the arguments, but I still think the
guy--whoever he is--has a right to do what he wants with his
property," said Elizabeth, who would not give her last name because
her employer is a strong supporter of condemnation. "It's rich people
willing to spend money to preserve their self-indulgent way of life."</TE>
<TE>   But to others, the fight is about drawing the line against
development and preserving the last best place.</TE>
<TE>   "From an outside viewpoint, I think a lot of people would look at
this as a bunch of spoiled people who want everything," said Joan
May, executive director of Sheep Mountain Alliance, a citizens group
that began the movement to preserve the valley floor. "But this
community is dedicated to open space, and we have the resources to do
it. Once something is developed, it's gone forever."</TE>

<LD>Question: Do the electrical devices that stimulate muscles work?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Only to prevent muscle atrophy in patients who are unable
to move about on their own, experts agree, and even then they produce
only small effects. Without regular exercise, the devices--which
cause muscles to contract repeatedly--don't noticeably increase
muscle size or strength, or burn enough calories to be of value. A
recent study of one popular device found that stimulating the major
muscles of the arms, legs and abdomen for 45 minutes three times a
week for two months did not change the subjects' strength, weight or
overall appearance.</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A geological fault discovered beneath the sea near Japan poses the
threat of generating giant waves, a study reports. Such waves, called
tsunamis, could pose a threat to densely populated coastal cities in
southwestern Japan. Researchers led by Jin-Oh Park of the Japan
Marine Science and Technology Center in Yokohama discovered the fault
using a seismic reflection profile, developed by measuring vibrations
from the surface that are reflected back by deep rock formations.
Their findings were reported in Friday's issue of Science.</LD>
<LD>   The fault is in an area where the Philippine Sea plate is sinking
below the Eurasian plate. Movement of the plates deep within the
Earth can travel up the fault, where it has the potential to trigger
earthquakes and could generate tsunamis, the researchers say.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Birds check out the chicks before they move to a
neighborhood--assessing how many nestlings there are in the homes of
older residents, researchers report. When researchers stole baby
birds from nests in one area, new birds avoided moving there and some
birds left, the researchers report in Friday's Science. This shows
that counting chicks may be a shortcut for birds trying to figure out
the best places to live, according to Blandine Doligez of the
University of Bern and her colleagues.</LD>
<LD>   Working on the Swedish island of Gotland, Doligez and colleagues
manipulated the nests of collared flycatchers--migrating birds that
live in holes in trees. They moved baby birds from nests in one
plotted area to nests elsewhere. "We tried to mimic predation,"
Doligez said in an interview. "This sometimes happens in this
population."</LD>
<LD>   Sure enough, birds moved away from areas where the young were
stolen and moved to areas where baby birds were added to nests.</LD>

vaccinating against malaria, which has so far been impossible to

more debilitating effects of infection.</LD>

<HD>An Innate Ability to Smell Scams</HD>
<DH>Brain: Two studies suggest that humans have developed a
special mechanism to detect cheaters over the millenniums.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY SINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You've probably received e-mail messages just like this one: A
stranger has lots of money in a Nigerian bank account and you can
have half of it--if you just provide your account information to help
make the bank transfer.</LD>
<LD>   Most people who have encountered the Nigerian bank scam are
automatically skeptical of such a request--and there could be a good
reason that goes far beyond common sense.</LD>
<LD>   Two studies, published in the current issue of the journal
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, show that human
brains may be wired with a special mechanism to detect cheating.
While the exact mechanisms are still hazy, researchers found that a
patient with damage to parts of his frontal lobe and amygdala
(sometimes known as the fear center of the brain) was unable to see
through such scams.</LD>
<TE>   In the other study, scientists found that the ability to detect
cheaters exists across very different cultures--a group of Harvard
University undergraduates and a tribe of Amazonian
hunter-agriculturalists.</TE>
<TE>   A Key to Cooperation</TE>
<TE>   Leda Cosmides, an evolutionary psychologist at UC Santa Barbara,
said humans may have evolved the strategy to detect cheaters as a
necessary component of cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   In order for cooperation to evolve as a beneficial tactic, people
needed to be able to weed out those who aren't willing to pay for the
benefits they receive. People who always cooperate, without getting
favors in return, would be open to exploitation, Cosmides said. Over
the course of evolution, they are likely to be selected out of the
population, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lance Rips, a professor of psychology at the University of
Chicago, said the findings could have another explanation. The
ability to detect cheaters may be related to more general logic
mechanisms rather than an innate cheater detector, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Cosmides said the ability to detect cheating appears to be
distinct from general logical processes. The findings of the studies
suggest that the mechanisms used for this type of social exchange are
specialized, much like the programs on a computer, Cosmides said.</TE>
<TE>   "You would use [Microsoft] Word for writing articles and
[Microsoft] Excel for crunching numbers because they are specialized
for these types of problems," Cosmides said.</TE>
<TE>   Cosmides likened the cheater detection ability to language, which
is learned across cultures and without going to school. People
develop cheater detection instinctively, in the same way they develop
language.</TE>
<TE>   A 'Reasoning Instinct'</TE>
<TE>   Cosmides called this type of ability a "reasoning instinct." While
most people traditionally think of reason and instinct as
diametrically opposed, there are logical mechanisms that can develop
without being taught, she said. "They have the characteristics of an
instinct, but the program produces a form of reasoning."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have found a brain-damaged patient who may help them
to understand just how this reasoning instinct works. The patient,
who is referred to as R.M., suffered brain damage in a bike accident.</TE>
<TE>   R.M. had most cognitive functions intact and seemed to function
normally. But he had difficulty understanding what people were
thinking and feeling: He couldn't understand their intentions, said
Valerie Stone, an evolutionary neuroscientist at the University of
Denver, who led the study.</TE>
<TE>   R.M. had problems detecting dishonesty in people and was often
exploited. Eventually, his family had to take over his finances.</TE>
<TE>   Stone presented R.M. with two types of statements, each following
the same type of logical rule. One described a detail of the physical
world--"If you work in the lab with viruses, you must wear gloves."
The other described a type of social contract--"If I give you a
watch, then you give me $100." R.M. was then given different
scenarios and asked to determine which ones followed the rule.</TE>
<TE>   Both problems make the same types of demands on memory, language
and logical processing, Stone said. But while R.M. could easily do
the problems about the physical world, he could not figure out the
ones involving social contracts. The results show that there is a
difference in how the brain thinks about people and how it thinks
about the physical world, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "When a part of the brain is injured, it can knock out certain
aspects of mental function while it leaves others completely intact,"
Stone said. "You can then develop a picture of which mental abilities
are independent."</TE>
<TE>   In a second study, Cosmides and colleagues took the cheater
detection idea one step further. They hypothesized that if this type
of "mental program" is required for the evolution of cooperation, the
program should exist across cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers tested cheater detection ability in the Shiwiar, a
relatively isolated tribe in the Amazon. "The Shiwiar are a
nonliterate society ... and are living a life much more similar to
our hunter-gatherer ancestors," Cosmides said.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers found that the Shiwiar had the same cheater detection
capabilities as a group of highly educated Harvard undergraduates.</TE>
<TE>   Cosmides and Stone said the findings may help people with brain
damage or disorders who have difficulty with social interactions and
judgments. Doctors may be able to make a more precise diagnosis and
to help them better adapt to social situations.</TE>

<LD>Oops.</LD>
<LD>   It's one of those worrisome sounds you don't want to hear during
surgery, or as your plane takes off.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists and newspaper reporters tend to be especially
oops-averse because their work is valued precisely for its
reliability.</LD>
<TE>   But as we all know, oops happens. And it's not necessarily a bad
thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Science is inconceivable without mistakes," a physicist friend
said to me recently. "You have to push things until they break down.
It's the same with people: If we don't push ourselves, we don't know
what our limits are."</TE>
<TE>   Then she added: "Being right stokes your ego, but being wrong
teaches you something."</TE>
<TE>   She was telling me this in part because I was agonizing over two
mistakes that slipped into a recent column, one entirely mine, one
the inadvertent result of editing. Both were instructive.</TE>
<TE>   In the first case, I'd written that while light can't escape from
a black hole, "gravity waves can and do." I knew it was stretching
the point unacceptably when I wrote it (gravity waves are emitted
only from the edges of black holes), but I liked the way it sounded,
and I told myself I'd go back and modify it later.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 1: If you don't correct mistakes immediately, they have
a way of settling in until even the most egregious errors begin to
seem maybe-just-OK-after-all.</TE>
<TE>   In the second case, the correct application of an editing rule
that changed a "like" to a "such as" altered the sense so that the
statement, in context, was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 2: Even good rules can have bad outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   On the same day, I'd received an e-mail from a friend agonizing
that he'd made a fool of himself by mistakenly believing he could
restart a failed romantic relationship. I told him I was proud that
he would take such risks. As a scientist, he knew it was true.
There's no progress without risk, and if you don't make mistakes,
chances are, you're not risking enough.</TE>
<TE>   What better time than this--my last Mind Over Matter column--to
revisit some of my favorite personal oopsies, and what I (should
have) learned from them.</TE>
<TE>   My all-time favorite was the time I wrote a long article about
scientific fraud and used the deliciously ambiguous example of the
Millikan oil drop experiment. Robert Millikan was the physicist who
founded Caltech. But with "fraud" resonating in mind, I referred to
him throughout the piece as Michael Millikan--a twisted hybrid of
Caltech's founder and junk bond king Michael Milken, who pleaded
guilty to fraud charges in 1990. (The one person who really seemed to
enjoy this "oops" was Millikan's grandson, whose name really is
Michael.)</TE>
<TE>   Next in line probably is the time I referred to a subatomic
particle called "tau" as "tao." (Tao of physics on the brain, no
doubt.)</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 3: Even when you think you're concentrating on the task
at hand, your brain may be pulling ideas in from entirely different
contexts.</TE>
<TE>   In other words: You don't always know what you're thinking
(witness the Freudian slip).</TE>
<TE>   My most humiliating mistake was the column I wrote about how easy
it is to fool ourselves by listening to higher authorities--only to
make an error because I listened to a higher authority. (I stated
that an article on tabletop fusion appeared on the cover of the
journal Science because someone "high up" told me it had. Actually,
it ran inside.)</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 4: Simply being aware of pitfalls doesn't make you
immune from them.</TE>
<TE>   I also felt pretty silly a few weeks ago when I described the sun
as a star "93 million light-years away," only to have an editor save
me. ("Er, did you really mean light-years?")</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 5: Difficult tasks take concentration. The routine
seems so simple that we don't think twice when we most need to.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, of course, a mistake is a matter of perspective. After
all, it was certainly an "oops" moment for the dinosaurs when that
meteor hit Mexico, but it was pure serendipity for mammals like us.
Genetic "mistakes" produce genius and beauty as well as disease.
Alexander Fleming mistakenly let a foreign mold waft in through his
open window and discovered penicillin.</TE>
<TE>   And Einstein's most famous mistake may have recently turned out to
be a major discovery. Unaware that the universe was expanding, he
inserted a term for a "repulsive force" into his equations to prevent
the universe from collapsing. These days, cosmologists think this
strange force may account for most of the energy in the cosmos.</TE>
<TE>   This inescapable "oops factor" is wisely acknowledged in the
"checks and balances" built into our system of government. If the
president makes mistakes, the congress is supposed to correct them
(and vice versa).</TE>
<TE>   Alas, it's not recognized in policies such as "zero tolerance" or
the death penalty. By definition, they don't allow for error.</TE>
<TE>   Oops.</TE>

<HD>Officers' Shooting of Woman Was Justified, Long Beach
Police Say</HD>
<DH>Violence: Chief tells NAACP members that the
knife-wielding, mentally ill woman posed a threat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach police officers were justified in the fatal shooting of a
knife-wielding schizophrenic woman in January, according to a
department report that triggered an angry response at an NAACP
meeting where it was released Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In a presentation to the Long Beach chapter of the National Assn.
for the Advancement of Colored People, Chief Jerome E. Lance said
officers shot Marcella Byrd, a 57-year-old black woman, after
determining that she posed a threat to bystanders near a busy
downtown intersection where they had cornered her.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a split-second decision to counter the threat to the
community," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Byrd was shot on Jan. 19 after she reportedly brandished and
refused to drop an 8-inch knife in a three-minute standoff with
police after she had taken a cartful of groceries from a store
without paying. Byrd's refusal to cooperate with officers and the
threat she posed dictated the incident's outcome, Lance said.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as it pains me to say this, she's the one who caused this
to happen," Lance said. "We wanted her to talk to us. We didn't want
to do this."</TE>
<TE>   A report by the county district attorney's office also determined
that the shooting was justified.</TE>
<TE>   The audience was quiet during Lance's presentation, but the mood
became confrontational during an hourlong question-and-answer
session.</TE>
<TE>   Montebello lawyer Luis Carrillo walked out of the meeting after
decrying the report.</TE>
<TE>   "This investigation is a total whitewash," he said. "Things like
this happen because you train your officers to dehumanize people by
calling them suspects. You're just trigger-happy."</TE>
<TE>   Lance remained composed, even as some in the audience yelled and
one woman started repeating: "trigger-happy, trigger-happy."</TE>
<TE>   Some questioned why officers, who shot two rounds of beanbags at
Byrd, didn't try other means to subdue her, such as tackling her or
aiming their guns at a less deadly location than her torso.</TE>
<TE>   Lance said those options would have increased the threat to
bystanders or the officers.</TE>
<TE>   With only three minutes elapsing between the arrival of the first
officer on the scene and Byrd's raising the knife toward the sergeant
with the beanbag gun, officers didn't have time to consider other
courses of action, Lance said.</TE>
<TE>   Race was not a factor in the incident, Lance said in response to a
man who said the officers would have tried harder to avoid violence
had Byrd been white.</TE>
<TE>   "They were only looking at her as an armed suspect who attempted
to steal a cart of groceries," he said. "They were not looking at the
color of her skin. They were doing their duty to protect people from
an attack."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was critical of the officers' actions.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't have time to sit there and talk to her," said
Tymeshia Beeks, 26, of Long Beach. "I'm glad they thought of the
community's protection first and took action rather than wait too
long."</TE>
<TE>   Lance said he wished that more people would empathize with the
officers.</TE>
<TE>   "The community and people who are not in our business don't
understand," he said. "It's difficult for them to put themselves in
our shoes and understand the speed of this sequence of events."</TE>
<TE>   During his presentation, Lance cried as he spoke of his sympathy
for the officers who killed Byrd.</TE>
<TE>   "That action will make indelible impressions on them," he said,
taking long pauses as he wiped away tears and tried to compose
himself. "You never forget. You simply--you simply live with that sad
fact you have taken a human life."</TE>
<TE>   Lance presented his department's findings first to the chapter
membership Sunday because he had been unable to answer their
questions at a meeting in February and thought that it was his duty
to address the NAACP first, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also at the meeting, an NAACP-led task force formed after Byrd's
shooting recommended that the Police Department bolster training on
dealing with the mentally ill and increase staffing of the county
mental-health professionals who work with the department.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is preventing something like this from happening
again," said Naomi Rainey, chapter president.</TE>
<TE>   "The training procedures have got to change. We don't know what
the outcome would have been had the officers really understood what
kind of person they were dealing with."</TE>

<HD>Fresh Water Sought at Sea</HD>
<DH>Health: A growing need forces agencies to look at a huge
new source, just as advancing technology reduces the costs of
desalination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With other sources of drinking water drying up, water districts from
Los Angeles to San Diego are hoping to build desalination plants to
tap the vast resources of the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   Straining the salt from the seawater has long been a dream in
drought-prone and fast-growing Southern California. But the costs
have always been prohibitive. Now, a new generation of super-fine
filters has sharply cut the expense of purifying saltwater, so much
so that five local water agencies hope to build plants that would
create a supply for more than a million people.</LD>
<LD>   "Ultimately, it is the future of Southern California," said Steven
Erie, director of the Urban Studies and Planning Program at UC San
Diego. "No water, and there's no great Southern California
civilization or economy. It's pretty simple. That's why they call it
'liquid gold.' "</LD>
<TE>   Desalination, expensive and energy-consuming, has long been a
popular water source in the oil-rich nations of the Middle East.
During desperate droughts, a handful of California cities, such as
Santa Barbara, built expensive plants but quickly mothballed them
because of the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Advances in filtration technology over the past decade have
drastically reduced the price of desalinated water, though it is
still about four times more expensive than groundwater. However,
population growth and reduced water from the Colorado River means
Californians are thirsty for new sources. Some scientists predict a
drought in California and reductions in mountain snowpacks that
provide drinking water, making the supply even tighter.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California water officials are embarking on plans to make
sewage water clean enough to drink and are even talking about
floating bags of river water from Northern California. Scenarios like
those make desalinated water look a lot more palatable.</TE>
<TE>   About three years ago, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California started encouraging local districts to make the move and
formulated a plan to subsidize some projects.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a growing sentiment that perhaps desalination could be
feasible," said Adan Ortega Jr., MWD's vice president for external
affairs. "The heart of the strategy for Southern California's
long-term reliability ... is not to put all of our eggs in the
proverbial basket. What we need to do is spread our dependence among
a variety of resources so that in the event of a prolonged drought,
we have more options already in place."</TE>
<TE>   Around the world, 13,600 desalination plants produce 6.8 billion
gallons of water daily, according to U.S. Water News Online, a trade
publication. California water officials know of no major seawater
desalination plants currently operating in this country, aside from a
few tiny facilities on Catalina Island, the Monterey Bay Aquarium and
the visitors center of a state park at San Simeon.</TE>
<TE>   Desalination of briny groundwater is relatively common; the Orange
County Water District does it to get rid of the minerals from dairy
cow waste that contaminate groundwater.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara opened a $34-million seawater desalination plant in
1992 but shut it after three months because of the expense.
Eventually, parts of the plant were sold off to other countries. The
city keeps the facility in "long-term storage mode," and will be
forced to spend $3 million to reactivate it if a new water supply is
needed. Morro Bay also built a desalination facility during the
drought of the early 1990s but has not used it since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Despite those setbacks, the idea of desalination is making a
strong comeback.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's largest seawater desalination plant currently is
being built on the east side of Tampa Bay. The plant became necessary
even though Florida is engorged with water because so much of the
region's groundwater was being consumed that fragile ecosystems were
being dramatically altered. Ponds were disappearing, and swamps were
drying up. The $108-million project will create 25 million gallons of
drinking water a day--10% of the local supply--when it opens in
December and a second plant is under consideration, said Don
Lindeman, project manager at Tampa Bay Water.</TE>
<TE>   Last April in Texas, Gov. Rick Perry asked the Texas Water
Development Board to study the viability of seawater desalination. In
California, hundreds of millions of dollars will be available for
desalination projects if voters in November approve Proposition 50, a
$3.4-billion water-quality bond measure.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys) has proposed the creation
of a state task force to assess seawater desalination throughout
California. Though his bill unanimously passed the Assembly, it has
stalled in the Senate because of its $600,000 price tag.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, MWD is reviewing proposals to build plants
in Dana Point, Carlsbad in San Diego County and several coastal
locations in Los Angeles County. This fall, the agency will decide
whether to subsidize some or all of these plants.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has proposed a
$70-million plant in Playa del Rey that would produce 12 million
gallons of water a day.</TE>
<TE>   West Basin Municipal Water District has proposed building a
20-million-gallon per day plant in either Redondo Beach or El
Segundo, and the Long Beach Water Department wants to build a
$74-million plant that would create 10 million gallons of water a
day.</TE>
<TE>   Municipal Water District of Orange County's proposed plant in Dana
Point would supply 27 million gallons of water a day, enough for
250,000 people. The plant, expected to be up and running in 2007,
would cost $130 million to $200 million.</TE>
<TE>   Though that's a huge expenditure, local officials say in case of
severe shortage, the plant's value would be immeasurable.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the attractions of a desalination plant in Orange County
is that it would be drought-proof. If you had an earthquake that
severed aqueducts from the Colorado River or [Northern California],
you would still have a source of water in Orange County," said Keith
Coolidge, spokesman for the district.</TE>
<TE>   As in other desalination plants, ocean water off Dana Point would
be pumped through ultra-fine filters to remove the salt and other
minerals, a process known as reverse osmosis. The water would then be
piped to reservoirs, and eventually to South County homes and
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego County Water Authority announced earlier this month
that it supports building two plants in the area. The first, a
proposed $242-million plant in Carlsbad, would create 50 million
gallons of drinking water a day by 2006. The proposal has been
submitted to MWD to see if it is eligible for a subsidy. The second
is slated for Chula Vista.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the technological improvements, desalination has critics,
who say that it is extremely energy-consuming and produces a
super-salty brine that must be disposed of.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Bernosky, a water-quality engineer with the American Water
Works Assn., said that as the technology becomes more commonplace, it
will become more energy efficient. Still to be addressed, he said, is
what to do with the brine removed by the filters.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a consideration, but it tends to be less so than most
people think," Bernosky said. In Tampa, the brine will be discharged
into the ocean with the cooling water from a power plant, which
dilutes it immediately. The resulting addition of brine to the ocean,
according to Bernosky, would be so diluted that it would have no
impact.</TE>
<TE>   Others worry that creating more water dilutes the emphasis on
conservation that some people feel is key to long-term planning.</TE>
<TE>   "It would [create] a false sense of security," said Jay Negrin, a
Southern California water-quality biologist. "I think the perception
could easily be that the infrastructure is in place and now we don't
have anything to worry about. The bottom line is we still live in a
desert."</TE>

<HD>Lions Live Near Los Angeles, Oh My</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Ecologists say there may be eight big cats in the
Santa Monica Mountains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HYMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his disheveled National Park Service uniform, minus the funny hat,
Seth Riley stands in the parking lot of a Starbucks coffeehouse. He
is waving a large radio antenna at the nearby hills, listening
intently on his headphones. This being Malibu, no one pays Riley any
heed.</LD>
<LD>   A wildlife ecologist, he wouldn't notice anyway. He's
concentrating on a series of beeps emanating from the Santa Monica
Mountains. The beeps are coming from a mountain lion wearing a radio
collar.</LD>
<LD>   The 150-pound, 6-to 8-year-old lion is part of the first study of
the big cats in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.
Until a few months ago, Riley and his colleagues say, no one had been
sure the animal even existed.</LD>
<TE>   Riley is at Pacific Coast Highway and Trancas Canyon Road, a
stone's throw from Zuma Beach and just miles from the nation's
second-largest metropolis.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people know what the antenna is for, because they've been
watching the Discovery Channel and they'll make the connection we're
tracking some critters," says Eric York, Riley's research partner.
"If people are interested, we'll tell them the whole story."</TE>
<TE>   For years, officials with the park service and California State
Parks had been hearing about mountain lions in the western Santa
Monicas but had never seen one.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed unlikely that lions still lived there. The animals need
a lot of space, and the range is not only well-stocked with homes,
cars and people but also surrounded by freeways, suburbs and ocean.
Occasionally a hiker or resident claimed to have seen a cougar, but
no one ever managed to get a photo.</TE>
<TE>   That changed last spring, when remote cameras triggered by
motion-control sensors took two pictures of a male lion. Riley and
York began laying traps and, in mid-July, the lion stepped into a leg
snare near Mulholland Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Tracking Collar</TE>
<TE>   After being tranquilized and fitted with the collar, the animal
was released. The collar is linked to a global positioning system, or
GPS, that records where the lion has been every day. All Riley and
York have to do is get their antenna close enough to the lion to
download the data occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers, naturally, are thrilled to get a glimpse of how a
large predator carves out a living in the range. But a little
knowledge, they concede, can be a dangerous thing.</TE>
<TE>   The park service's main fear is liability. "What happens," York
asked, "if a lion wearing our radio collar decides to eat someone's
$200,000 horse?"</TE>
<TE>   It was a difficult question for the park service. Officials wanted
to know what animals live in the national recreation area so the
agency could protect them, which is its mission. They wondered aloud
what to do if a collared lion bunked down near a school or in
someone's backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see a lion with a radio collar any differently than any
other lion," said Ray Sauvajot, the research chief of the recreation
area. "What would determine any actions is the behavior of the lion
and not where it is."</TE>
<TE>   Park officials, in fact, are more worried about how to protect
cats from people than vice versa, especially because there have been
no attacks on humans in the area in recent memory.</TE>
<TE>   The GPS data, thus far, show the lion's range to be
impressive--covering about 125 square miles, from Malibu Canyon to
Point Mugu. He is crossing roads, approaching people's backyards and
doing the things a mountain lion does. Last week, for example, Eric
York found a deer the cat had killed in a canyon near Kanan Road. The
western Santa Monicas are, in effect, an island--not a very big
one--formed by Sunset Boulevard and the Pacific to the south, the San
Diego Freeway to the east, the Ventura Freeway to the north and the
Oxnard Plain to the west. There probably aren't many lions there, and
their number is unlikely to grow much.</TE>
<TE>   "At the most, there's room for another male and two to three
females per each male's range," Riley said. "So, at the most, there's
maybe eight lions, and that's not enough to maintain a population."</TE>
<TE>   Linking Habitats</TE>
<TE>   To survive over the long term, mountain lions need to be connected
to larger chunks of habitat. In this case, that means the Santa
Susana Mountains and Los Padres National Forest. But there are only
two undeveloped corridors linking the Santa Monicas to those areas.</TE>
<TE>   The wider of the two corridors is through the Simi Hills, on the
other side of the Ventura Freeway. The freeway is an imposing
obstacle, and park officials doubt that lions can get under or over
it. Researchers say the proposed 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch
development, which would be built where the Simi Hills funnel into
the Santa Monicas, could extinguish any chance of the lions' using
that corridor.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmanson "is outside the national park boundaries, but it's in a
critical position to affect the health of wildlife resources in the
Santa Monica Mountains," said the park superintendent, Woody Smeck.
"I appreciate the social discussion going on, in terms of the housing
crunch, but I hope that will be balanced with considerations about
wildlife."</TE>
<TE>   Riley and York try to remain hopeful that lions are getting across
the freeway. The two are up nearly every morning well before dawn, to
check traps and then to track the male they've collared. If there's a
male in the Santa Monicas, they say, there must be a female.</TE>
<TE>   Life Without Lions</TE>
<TE>   Polishing off his iced coffee--studying urban wildlife has its
advantages--Riley is asked the question that all ecologists hate to
answer: Why protect the lions?</TE>
<TE>   "Will the mountains' ecology fall apart around here with no
mountain lions?" he asks. "The answer is no. But I think we're all
the poorer for it if there aren't mountain lions in the mountains."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the lions have made it this far. Somehow, this
creature survived the roads, subdivisions, even the coming of
Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   With that, Riley and York load up their trucks and head north on
Pacific Coast Highway, chasing a lion once believed to be a ghost.</TE>

<HD>Jurors Asked to Look Into Mind of a Killer</HD>
<DH>Murder trial: Specialized testimony delves into whether
Cary Stayner was sane when he killed a woman and two teens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>This much is certain: Cary Stayner committed a heinous crime, slaying
three vacationers outside Yosemite National Park in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   What remains to be settled is whether the motel handyman was in
his right mind when he did it.</LD>
<LD>   After five weeks of trial, Stayner's sanity is the salient issue
as a nine-man, three-woman jury prepares for closing arguments this
week in a wood-paneled courtroom in San Jose.</LD>
<TE>   They've already heard more than two hours of Stayner's taped
confession, his chilling description of how he used the ruse of a
leaking pipe to get into the motel room of his victims: Carole Sund
of Eureka; her 15-year-old daughter, Juli; and a family friend,
Silvina Pelosso, 16.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner, who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, plugged
his ears with his fingers while the tape played.</TE>
<TE>   But the trial has been dominated as much by psychiatric jousting
as by physical evidence. At stake is whether Stayner should be put on
San Quentin's death row.</TE>
<TE>   A parade of mental-health professionals has detailed a disturbing
childhood. There has been talk of psychotic behavior, of Stayner's
predilection to pull out his hair, of daydreams about rape and
torture.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors have heard experts in nuclear medicine debate Stayner's
brain composition. They have gazed for hours at color slide
projections of cranial cross sections, sliced up like potato chips.</TE>
<TE>   All this has left the families of the victims angry and troubled.</TE>
<TE>   "The horrible part for us," said Francis Carrington, father of
Carole Sund and grandfather of Juli, "is to sit through weeks and
weeks and weeks of psychiatric testimony that doesn't get to the
nugget--this man killed four women brutally and with a level of
careful planning that makes him seem all too sane."</TE>
<TE>   It began in February 1999, when the Sunds and Pelosso went missing
from their room at the rustic Cedar Lodge in El Portal, a tiny
community nestled in the deep gorge where the Merced River pours from
Yosemite's valley floor.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest manhunts in state history ended four weeks
later and a county away, when the torched hulk of the women's rental
car was discovered on a forest logging road with the charred remains
of two of the victims in the trunk. An anonymous note--Stayner later
admitted to having dispatched it, even to having asked someone else
to lick the stamp--led authorities a week later to the shore of a
nearby lake, where they found the nude body of Juli Sund, her neck
sliced open.</TE>
<TE>   Five months after the tourists went missing, Joie Ruth Armstrong,
26, became Stayner's fourth victim. The Yosemite naturalist's
beheaded body was found near her cabin in a remote corner of the park
in July 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of that gruesome killing, authorities caught Stayner.
He pleaded guilty in federal court to Armstrong's murder to avoid the
death penalty. But state prosecutors pressed ahead with their
death-penalty case.</TE>
<TE>   Intended Victim Testifies</TE>
<TE>   Under intense media scrutiny, the trial was moved from Mariposa
County to San Jose. Television news crews and reporters flooded the
start of the trial July 15 at Santa Clara County Superior Court. The
judge is Thomas Hastings, the same jurist who presided over the death
penalty trial of Richard Allen Davis, who killed 12-year-old Polly
Klaas in a widely publicized 1993 case. Hastings established a yellow
tape line outside the courthouse, marking where interviews could be
conducted, so jurors wouldn't be tainted by overhearing them.</TE>
<TE>   Since those circus-like opening days, the criminal court fight has
trundled on in front of scant spectators and only a handful of
newspaper reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors took about seven days to lay out their case in
exhaustive detail. They called 30 witnesses, including a teenage girl
Stayner had intended to be his first victim. He decided not to strike
after discovering that the girl's father was staying at the Cedar
Lodge, where Stayner worked as a handyman.</TE>
<TE>   George Williamson, the lead prosecutor in the case, described
Stayner as a methodical killer who carefully hatched a plan to hunt
down young women like prey, sexually assault them and then kill them.
Stayner, he noted, had gone to the trouble of leaving wet towels in
the motel room to make it look as if the three women had showered and
left.</TE>
<TE>   The defense team conceded from the beginning that Stayner had
killed the three tourists. Attorneys Marcia Morrissey of Los Angeles
and Michael Burt of San Francisco zeroed in on Stayner's mental
health, trying to portray a twisted mind incapable of the forethought
and intent needed to justify a conviction for first-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   "They seem to want to demonstrate that he is seriously mentally
ill, and that we shouldn't execute someone who is seriously mentally
ill," said Donald Heller, a Sacramento criminal defense attorney
following the case.</TE>
<TE>   If the jury finds Stayner guilty of the murders, it will be asked
in a second phase of the trial to determine whether he was sane when
he committed them.</TE>
<TE>   Morrissey has argued that Stayner kept his mental disorders in
check for decades, but eventually succumbed to inner demons in the
months before the Yosemite slayings. His mind, Morrissey said in
court, had "broken down. There was no right or wrong for him."</TE>
<TE>   Psychiatrists who examined Stayner said he had experienced vivid
imagery of sex and violence since an early age. His family tree is
littered with relatives who suffered from mental illnesses, including
depression and pedophilia, they said.</TE>
<TE>   And tragedy dogged his family life. Stayner's younger brother,
Steven, was abducted at age 7 by a pedophile and held as a sex slave
for seven years before escaping. Steven Stayner later died in a
motorcycle accident.</TE>
<TE>   As an adult, Cary Stayner had a fixation on Bigfoot and the
apocalyptic prophesies of the 16th century astrologer Nostradamus,
one psychiatrist testified, and had nightmares of being pursued by
disembodied heads.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jose Arturo Silva, a court-appointed forensic psychiatrist,
testified that Stayner--who had been molested by an uncle in his
youth--showed signs of pedophilia, voyeurism, social dysfunction and
other disorders. Silva said Stayner dreamed about watching
neighborhood girls being raped. Sometimes he envisioned himself
rescuing the girls; other times he joined in the rapes, Silva said.</TE>
<TE>   Was His Brain Damaged?</TE>
<TE>   After the defense played a portion of Stayner's taped confession,
in which he bartered with FBI interrogators for child pornography in
exchange for telling all, Silva suggested those demands demonstrated
his many psychoses.</TE>
<TE>   Experts also testified that Stayner's brain may have been damaged
when his mother fell during a softball game while pregnant with him.
Stayner, they said, has a visibly misshapen head. One
neuropsychiatrist testified that his brain was probably damaged in a
region that controls emotional impulses.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the defense, Stayner underwent a positron emission
tomography, commonly known as a PET scan, at the UC Irvine brain
imaging center.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Joseph Wu, the center's clinical director, testified that
Stayner had abnormalities in several portions of his brain.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors countered with Dr. Alan Waxman, a USC clinical
professor of radiology.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman, who often battles Wu in criminal court cases over the use
of PET scans to correlate mental abnormalities with criminal
behavior, said Stayner's brain appeared normal when compared with
those of 56 other people.</TE>

<HD>This Time, Martinez Helps Beat Clemens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edgar Martinez, for once, was a big hit against Roger Clemens.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez homered, doubled twice and drove in three runs and the
Mariners beat Clemens and the Yankees, 5-2, Sunday at Safeco Field in
a matchup of AL division leaders.</LD>
<LD>   The loss ended the Yankees' six-game winning streak.</LD>
<TE>   "He is just a great hitter," Clemens said. "He is patient and a
student up there."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez got to the major leagues with Seattle in 1987, three
years after Clemens got to Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez came into Sunday's game with a career .220 batting
average against Clemens. The designated hitter finished the day
21-for-86 (.244) with three homers vs. Clemens.</TE>
<TE>   "I got lucky, I guess," Martinez said with a grin. "He's been very
tough through the years. I mean, the guy is going to be a Hall of
Famer and I don't think many hitters do well against him."</TE>
<TE>   Yankee Manager Joe Torre said Clemens didn't have anything to be
ashamed about.</TE>
<TE>   "He was fine," Torre said. "I thought he pitched well. It is no
embarrassment when Edgar gets a couple of base hits off you."</TE>
<TE>   Joel Pineiro (13-4) outpitched Clemens (10-4), who lost for the
first time in three decisions since coming off the disabled list Aug.
6. He'd had tightness in his right groin.</TE>
<TE>   Pineiro, in his first full season in the majors at 23, improved
his record against New York to 2-0, both wins coming this year.</TE>
<TE>   In 6 1/3 innings, he gave up two runs, five hits and a walk. He
had five strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens was taken out after seven innings and 125 pitches. He gave
up five runs and nine hits and walked three. He struck out nine.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 6, Boston 2--Rick Reed (11-6) pitched seven strong
innings and Doug Mientkiewicz homered at Minneapolis to lead the
Twins, who won for only the fourth time in 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota extended its lead over the Chicago White Sox to 14 games
in the AL Central. The Red Sox fell three games behind the Angels in
the wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 10, Toronto 7--Alex Rodriguez tied a major league record
with his fifth home run in two games and the Rangers completed a
three-game sweep at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez homered twice to pass Sammy Sosa for the major league
lead with 44. Rodriguez homered three times Saturday night and once
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   With six home runs over three games, Rodriguez matched the AL
record set by Tony Lazzeri of the New York Yankees (1936), Gus
Zernial of the Philadelphia Athletics (1951) and Manny Ramirez of the
Cleveland Indians (1998).</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 7, Baltimore 4--The Tigers overcame three homers by the
Orioles to win two of three and improve to 19-46 on the road this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Fick, who had been hitless in 12 at-bats, had three hits
and two RBIs. Detroit had 18 hits.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 8, Kansas City 6--Tanyon Sturtze ended his nine-game
winless streak and Aubrey Huff homered and drove in three runs for
the Devil Rays at St. Petersburg, Fla. Sturtze (2-13) gave up four
runs and five hits over seven innings for his first win since June
26.</TE>

<HD>Long Does His Share for the A's</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Terrence Long kept to his routine, and for one day it worked.</LD>
<LD>   Long homered twice and drove in four runs to break out of a
lengthy slump and the Oakland Athletics completed a three-game sweep
of the Chicago White Sox with a 7-4 victory Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I live and die by what works for me," Long said. "I'm not
changing anything. I know what works for me."</LD>
<TE>   Barry Zito (17-5) matched his career high for victories, giving up
three runs and four hits in 5 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   The A's, who have won five in a row and 11 of 14, remained two
games behind first-place Seattle in the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland's Scott Hatteberg tied a career high with four hits.</TE>
<TE>   Long was three for four after getting only four hits in his
previous 47 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been struggling basically the whole season," said Long, one
of two A's (along with Miguel Tejada) to play in every game this
season. "I keep doing the same thing, but it just wasn't happening
for me."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Manager Art Howe was obviously glad to see Long break out
of his slump.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he wants to be part of the offense," Howe said. "He hasn't
been, and that's frustrating. Now he can breathe a lot easier. He
needed that and we needed that."</TE>
<TE>   Zito won despite his third-shortest outing of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the frustrating thing," Zito said. "I shouldn't have to
come out that early, but I understand why."</TE>
<TE>   David Justice robbed Tony Graffanino of a home run in the first
inning, reaching over the left-field wall to haul in the drive.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a great catch," Zito said. "It was discouraging to me to
give up that pitch on the first hitter of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Royce Clayton homered for the White Sox, who lost their fourth in
a row.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Wright (8-11) gave up seven runs--five earned--and 10 hits to
lose for the third time in four starts.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept making more mistakes as the game wore on and they took
advantage," Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   The White Sox have lost nine consecutive games in Oakland since
June 30, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Wright was just inconsistent," Manager Jerry Manuel said. "He got
behind hitters and couldn't put them away."</TE>
<TE>   Clayton's seventh home run of the season, a leadoff shot in the
third, gave Chicago a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The A's batted around in the bottom half of the third and took a
4-1 lead, highlighted by Long's two-run homer.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Ellis walked to open the inning, and Long hit a 2-and-0 pitch
into the left-field bleachers.</TE>
<TE>   "He left it over the plate," Long said. "I don't think he wanted
it there."</TE>
<TE>   After Ramon Hernandez singled, Ray Durham was safe on second
baseman Graffanino's fielding error.</TE>
<TE>   Tejada followed with a sacrifice fly, and Jermaine Dye added a
run-scoring single.</TE>
<TE>   Long's two-run homer in the fourth put Oakland up, 6-1, and Ellis
singled home a run in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Bradford, Ricardo Rincon and Billy Koch combined to yield one
run in 3 1/3 innings of relief for the Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   "Our bullpen has been lights out lately," Howe said.</TE>

<HD>Angels' Pain Gain</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Despite nagging muscle strains, Appier combines
with bullpen to limit Indians to two hits in 4-1 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saturday, Kevin Appier had what he thought was a migraine.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday, he suffered muscle strains in his left groin and left hip.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe the Angel starter should stub his toe on his way to the
mound for his next start. It couldn't hurt. Because pain isn't
stopping him.</LD>
<TE>   Appier survived a rocky first inning Sunday in which he walked
Cleveland's leadoff batter on four pitches and surrendered a run
before settling down to combine with three relievers and give the
Angels a 4-1 victory over the Indians, who managed only two hits.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of ugly surrounding it," laughed Appier (11-9),
who left the game after the sixth inning because of the muscle
strains. "But you've got to look at the overall [picture]. It was a
pretty good game."</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, Appier was effective ... and effusive as he
battled in front of 41,059 at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander, who won his fifth consecutive decision against
Cleveland, talked to himself often as he got himself out of jams,
while giving up one hit in six innings. He struck out four, walked
three, threw two wild pitches and hit a batter in his 98-pitch
outing.</TE>
<TE>   Angel relievers Brendan Donnelly and Ben Weber each threw a
perfect inning, and Troy Percival, who gave up a one-out double to
Jim Thome, closed the game for his 30th save. That made it the fifth
consecutive season Percival has had at least 30 saves and the sixth
season in his eight-year career.</TE>
<TE>   With the win, the Angels (74-49), remain half a game behind the
American League West leading Seattle Mariners and maintain a 1
1/2-game lead over the Oakland Athletics for the AL wild card as they
prepare for a seven-game trip to New York and Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Indian starter C.C. Sabathia (8-10) took the loss in the first
complete game of his career. The left-hander gave up four runs and
eight hits in eight innings, striking out four and walking three.</TE>
<TE>   With Appier's slow start, though, the Indians (54-68) were primed
to take advantage.</TE>
<TE>   After drawing the leadoff walk, Cleveland rookie Coco Crisp, who
had advanced to third base on Ellis Burks' one out-single, scored on
Thome's sacrifice fly to center field. A laboring Appier then struck
out Karim Garcia looking to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a veteran guy, and he knows when he's doing something bad,"
said Angel catcher Jose Molina. "He got out of that jam in the first
inning and got his rhythm back. He was a little wild in the
beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Said Angel Manager Mike Scioscia: "[Appier] pitched a terrific
ballgame today against a lineup that really can hurt you from top to
bottom. He knew what it was going to take for him to get back on his
game. That first inning could have been tough ... and I think, in
that context, he showed how his experience helps him."</TE>
<TE>   Appier, who made his major league debut in 1989, said his
mechanics were off in the early going.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought my stuff was good," he said. "It was just a matter of
getting it located ... my timing was off and I was rushing and my
shoulder was leaking out, but a little refinement and it came
together.</TE>
<TE>   "My stuff was fine, but my timing and mechanics made my stuff go
all over."</TE>
<TE>   The Angel batters, meanwhile, were busy getting a lead for Appier.</TE>
<TE>   After tying the score in the second on Benji Gil's sacrifice fly
to center that scored Garret Anderson, whose single led off the
inning, the Angels took over for good in the fourth with two runs.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Glaus walked to lead off, then scored from first on Shawn
Wooten's double into the left-center gap.</TE>
<TE>   Wooten crossed the plate three batters later on Alex Ochoa's
two-out double to the same spot.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels added another run in the eighth when Glaus' two-out
double into the right-field corner scored Scott Spiezio, who had
walked.</TE>
<TE>   Appier will be reevaluated Tuesday in New York, and if he's unable
make his next scheduled start, Saturday at Boston, Scioscia said he'd
most likely look to his bullpen for a spot start out of either Al
Levine, Scot Shields or Scott Schoeneweis.</TE>

<LD>Growing more frustrated by his sore left hand and questions about it
and his return to the field, Tim Salmon sat out Sunday, making it the
seventh consecutive game he has missed.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't hurt any worse so that's a good sign, I guess," Salmon
said. "I'm still just doing grip-strengthening exercises."</LD>
<LD>   Salmon, who was hit by a pitch on the bottom of the hand Aug. 10,
has not taken full-scale batting practice since, although he hopes to
take some cuts Tuesday at New York.</LD>
<TE>   "Unless he really picks it up, he's still doubtful [to play
Tuesday]," said Angel Manager Mike Scioscia. "We're still looking
day-to-day, so hopefully we'll know something soon."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon will be examined further this week by team medical director
Lewis Yocum.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fan backlash? What fan backlash? In the three-game weekend series
against Cleveland at Edison Field after the players' union
established an Aug. 30 strike date, the Angels averaged 40,760 in the
45,030-capacity stadium, including 6,080 walk-up customers Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-handed relief pitcher Terry Mulholland says he has no hard
feelings toward the Dodgers after being traded from a playoff
contender to the rebuilding Indians on July 28. Besides, Mulholland
said, he wasn't pitching enough, or up to the Dodgers' or his
standards.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was 30 years old and right in the middle of my career and
had the opportunity to go to the World Series, [being traded] would
be frustrating," said Mulholland, playing with his ninth team in 16
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been to two World Series--I haven't won one yet--but I've
learned in this game that if you sit around and feel sorry for
yourself, feel frustrated about the situation you've been placed in,
you're going to flounder in that situation longer than you need to.</TE>
<TE>   "The big picture was that the Dodgers came first and Terry
Mulholland came second, and I always accepted that. I regret that I
wasn't able to contribute more."</TE>
<TE>   Mulholland, 39, had a 7.31 earned-run average in 21 appearances
for the Dodgers. With Cleveland, he is 1-0 with a 4.97 ERA in seven
games and has taken on the role of mentor.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that's kind of nice is that there are a whole lot of
young guys here, a lot of young pitchers that are real receptive to
wanting to learn things, asking for help," Mulholland said. "I had
the same thing in L.A. with the Dodgers, but we didn't have as many
young guys and it was more about winning games and not just learning
the game.</TE>
<TE>   "You're looking at two different situations. The Dodgers are
battling for a playoff spot and the main concentration is to win
every game ... whereas these guys here, it's an organization in
transition. They haven't lost the competitiveness, it's just that
they have a few less horses to compete with now."</TE>

<HD>Mariners Add Valdes to Staff</HD>

<BD>Form Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American League West-leading Seattle Mariners, looking for
another starting pitcher for the stretch run, acquired right-hander
Ismael Valdes on Sunday in a trade with the Texas Rangers.</LD>
<LD>   The Mariners gave up two minor leaguers, infielder Jermaine Clark
and left-hander Derrick Van Dusen.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think you see a sad face on me," Valdes said in Texas,
before the last-place Rangers played Toronto. "I'm excited about
this. It's tough to leave my teammates. I've made good friends here.
But they understand I have a chance to go and win a ring and for that
I'm excited. That's the ultimate for every ballplayer."</LD>
<TE>   Valdes will go right into the Mariners' rotation as their No. 4
starter, pitching Wednesday night at Detroit in place of left-hander
John Halama.</TE>
<TE>   Valdes, who turns 29 on Wednesday, was 6-9 with a 3.93 earned-run
average in 23 starts for the Rangers. To make room for Valdes, Halama
was optioned to triple-A Tacoma.</TE>
<TE>   "We think having another veteran in our starting rotation will
help us down the stretch," General Manager Pat Gillick said. "Our
pitching is our strength and adding Ismael gives us even greater
depth in our pitching staff."</TE>
<TE>   Valdes is 2-1 with a 2.55 ERA in five starts this season against
AL West contenders Oakland and the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows how to pitch and compete well," Seattle Manager Lou
Piniella said. "He'll give us some depth and some experience and
hopefully will come here and throw the ball well. According to
reports that we have, he's been throwing the ball well over there in
Texas. He should help us."</TE>
<TE>   Valdes has a career record of 78-83 with a 3.73 ERA in 247 games,
including 220 starts, with the Dodgers, Chicago Cubs, Angels and
Texas.</TE>

<TE>   Dick O'Connell, the former Boston Red Sox general manager who
helped build the teams that played in the 1967 and 1975 World Series,
died Sunday. He was 87.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell, who died at a Lexington, Mass., nursing home, had been
very ill recently, Red Sox spokesman Kevin Shea said, although he did
not give a cause of death.</TE>

<HD>Tiger Hopes It Won't Become Second Nature</HD>

<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>We know that when Tiger Woods was a kid, he taped a list of Jack
Nicklaus' accomplishments on the wall. Let the record show that after
the PGA Championship ended at Hazeltine National Golf Club, Woods is
now only 18 short of Nicklaus in majors.</LD>
<LD>   That's right, Tiger needs to finish second 18 more times and he'll
catch Nicklaus.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that easy to decide which was the bigger upset Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Was it Rich Beem winning or Tiger not winning?</TE>
<TE>   On paper, you would have to say that Beem vs. Tiger looked like a
mismatch. It might as well have been Beem vs. Laser beam.</TE>
<TE>   Their recent experiences are sort of different. Six years ago,
Beem was making $7 an hour selling car stereos. Woods was signing a
$45-million deal and turning pro. This week, Beem was playing in his
fourth major. Tiger has won eight majors.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if we had been paying attention to who has been winning
these PGA Championships the last several years, it should have been
clear that this thing had Rich Beem written all over it. Beem is the
sixth player in the last eight years to win his first major at the
PGA Championship, thus making this tournament the undisputed
coming-out party among the four majors.</TE>
<TE>   As for Tiger being a runner-up for the first time in a major, it's
nothing to be ashamed of. Nicklaus is the greatest major-championship
winner of all time with 18 of them, and he was still second in 19
others.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, most figured it was only a matter of time until Woods
didn't win a major when he was in contention.</TE>
<TE>   And the odds that someone as relatively unknown as Beem would be
the guy to beat him should also come as no great surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Something similar could have happened in this tournament two years
ago at Valhalla.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Woods needed to shoot a 31 on the back nine on the
last day just to catch Bob May and force a playoff, where Woods
prevailed by one shot over the three extra holes.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the matter of contrasting personalities, with Beem
the light-hearted Everyman who seems on the verge of doubling over in
laughter after every shot, matched up against Tiger's no-nonsense Mr.
Methodical, who has the sense of humor of a guy in a hood operating a
guillotine.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to gauge how much personality comes into play on the
course, so let's put that category aside for the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Still, how do you figure that Tiger's hugely regarded powers of
intimidation were such a non-factor? Are they overrated or was Beem
too clueless to notice that he should have been shaking in his
polyester pants?</TE>
<TE>   Whatever kind of spin you want to put on it, Woods remains golf's
premier performer in major championships.</TE>
<TE>   He did nothing to harm that reputation at Hazeltine. Woods started
the day five shots back, birdied the last four holes, shot a 67 and
lost by one shot when the winner three-putted the 18th for bogey.</TE>
<TE>   Only one other player shot a 67 Sunday ... 52-year-old Tom Watson.
It was his 30th PGA Championship, the only major title Watson hasn't
won. He did finish second once, in 1978, when he lost to John
Mahaffey in a three-man playoff with Jerry Pate at Oakmont Country
Club.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Woods has his own second place in the PGA Championship, not
that he's very happy about it.</TE>
<TE>   Woods waited in the scoring trailer for Beem to finish and watched
on TV as Beem closed out the victory. Woods took a sip of water,
walked out and started explaining what happened.</TE>
<TE>   To hear Woods describe it afterward, his emotions were
geographically challenged. They were going everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   He was seething inside for the three-putt that cost him a bogey at
the 13th hole, but at the same time he was happy with himself for
pulling it together and making a run with four consecutive birdies
coming in.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Tiger was thoroughly semi-satisfied but not really. There
is only one measure for greatness in golf and it's no secret to
anyone.</TE>
<TE>   How many majors did you win? That's why young Tiger made Nicklaus
his target and it's also why Woods is a cinch to win his fifth player
of the year award.</TE>
<TE>   The way Woods sees it, winning one major a year is a great
achievement and he won the Masters and the U.S. Open this year, so
adding a second place at the PGA Championship looks good in his book.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, Tiger has spoiled us so in the majors that many
expect him to win them all. Not even Nicklaus, the standard by whom
all major champions are judged, could manage that.</TE>
<TE>   With 19 seconds, Nicklaus showed that you can still be the best
ever, even if you don't win them all. Just win your share.</TE>
<TE>   And if you're Tiger Woods and you're used to a steady diet of
winning, you remember that. It's all right to have seconds, just push
yourself away from that table and fill up on something else as soon
as you can.</TE>

<HD>Their Touch Is Back</HD>
<DH>Baseball: With shades of first half, Dodgers beat Mets,
2-1, for series sweep. Even call on tag goes L.A. way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A six-game trip that began on such a sour note, with closer Eric
Gagne giving up a stunning, game-winning two-run home run to
Montreal's Troy O'Leary last Tuesday night, couldn't have ended
sweeter for the Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   Andy Ashby chilled the New York Mets on a steamy afternoon, giving
up one run and four hits in seven innings; Marquis Grissom tripled,
doubled and scored two runs; and Gagne provided the finishing
touches, striking out Mike Piazza and Mo Vaughn to close the Dodgers'
2-1 victory Sunday before 42,386 in Shea Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Gagne's 43rd save moved him within one of Todd Worrell's franchise
record of 44 set in 1996, extended the Dodgers' win streak to five
and closed a 5-1 trip. The Dodgers' first Shea Stadium sweep since
1995 cut Arizona's lead in the National League West to seven games
and increased the Dodgers' wild-card lead over San Francisco to four
games.</LD>
<TE>   The Mets, in last place in the NL East, have lost eight in a row
overall and their last 11 games in Shea, their longest home skid
since losing a franchise-record 13 consecutive in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   "We were one pitch away from winning all six games on the trip,"
Manager Jim Tracy said. "We're getting back to playing the way we did
in the first 88 games, when we had a lot of success."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were 8-17 after the All-Star break, going from first
place in the NL West and 2 1/2 games ahead of Arizona to third place
and seven games back, but they have righted themselves, winning eight
of their last 10. They are 21-11 in one-run games. Starting pitching,
as it did most of the first half, has keyed the recent surge. Dodger
starters are 4-0 with a 1.70 earned-run average in the last seven
games, and Ashby was in command Sunday, allowing only one runner to
reach third base.</TE>
<TE>   August and September have not been kind to Ashby, who entered 2002
with a 58-50 record and 3.94 ERA in the first four months of the
season and a 28-37 record and 4.68 ERA in the final two months.</TE>
<TE>   But after a six-game lull, when he had a 7.22 ERA from June
23-July 23, Ashby (9-9) found a burst of energy and a groove that has
resulted in a 1.54 ERA in his last five starts.</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing is I'm not thinking about mechanics like I was 1
1/2 months ago," said Ashby, who missed all but two starts last
season because of major elbow surgery. "I tried to feel for the right
way to pitch instead of just letting it happen. It's getting better.
It's much more consistent."</TE>
<TE>   So is the umpiring in the eyes of the Dodgers, who felt they were
burned by several blown calls in July but can't complain much about
the officiating in August. They caught a huge break Thursday night
when a sure double hit the third base umpire and turned into a
Montreal out, and they were on the receiving end of a questionable
call Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   With runners on first and second and no outs in the second, New
York's Vaughn tagged from second on Jeromy Burnitz's fly to deep
right and slid safely into third. But Vaughn slipped off the bag as
he popped up from the slide, and Dodger third baseman Adrian Beltre,
with the ball in his bare hand, motioned slightly toward the runner.</TE>
<TE>   Third base umpire Brian O'Nora called Vaughn out, and John
Valentin grounded to short to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't touch him," Beltre said. "The umpire was behind Mo, and
from his angle, it looked like I tagged him, but I didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "When things are going good, they're going good. When they're
going bad, they're bad."</TE>
<TE>   Things have been going good lately for Beltre, who is batting .407
(33 for 81) with five homers and 20 runs batted in over his last 20
games, and he had a hand in both Dodger rallies Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, whose two-week surge may result in reducing left fielder
Brian Jordan's playing time, tripled over center fielder Timo Perez's
head in the third and scored on Beltre's single to left-center. The
Mets' Roberto Alomar walked, stole second and scored on Perez's RBI
single to make it 1-1 in the bottom of the third, but Grissom doubled
to right-center to lead off the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre lined a single off the right-field wall, advancing Grissom
to third, and Shawn Green hit a sacrifice fly to left to drive in the
winning run, sending the Dodgers on their way to their first series
sweep since June 21-23 against Boston. Next is a nine-game home stand
against Florida, Atlanta and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a weird trip," said Gagne, who saved four of the team's
five wins. "I felt so bad after the first day and better the next.
There were all kinds of emotions. But we won the last five games.
That's all that counts."</TE>

<HD>It's Troubling to Jordan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>That didn't take long. What Manager Jim Tracy termed "a good problem
to have" on Saturday did not seem like a good problem to left fielder
Brian Jordan on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan, who played Friday night after sitting out the previous six
games because of a lower-back injury, did not play Saturday or
Sunday. When approached before Sunday's game, the normally
approachable and affable Jordan walked right by a group of reporters,
saying, "Talk to the manager, man. He makes the lineup."</LD>
<LD>   Jordan didn't elaborate, but it was clear he was not pleased, a
sentiment he expressed during a closed-door meeting Sunday with
Tracy.</LD>
<TE>   "He is not real happy," Tracy said. "I don't expect anyone to be
happy about not being in the lineup. I understand how he feels, and
we will get back to him in a big way. But I can't make a case for
myself to remove Marquis Grissom from the lineup, and I can't take
[leadoff batter] Dave Roberts out."</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, who spent most of the season in a center-field platoon
with Roberts, scored the only runs in Sunday's 2-1 victory over the
Mets after hitting a third-inning triple and a fifth-inning double.
In his last 14 games, Grissom is batting .408 (20 for 49) with four
home runs, 12 runs batted in and 15 runs.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts has provided a spark at the top of the order and ranks
second in the National League with 34 stolen bases, and removing him
would greatly upset the chemistry of the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan has played an integral role in improving team chemistry
from last season. Could Tracy risk upsetting that harmony by
potentially alienating one of his clubhouse leaders?</TE>
<TE>   "He's a professional, and he handles things in a professional
manner," Tracy said of Jordan. "He's been in pennant races, he knows
what it's like to win, and we will get back to him. The fact is
simply this: The guy in left field [Grissom] is swinging the bat so
well, I can't take him out."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy preferred to address the situation Sunday before letting
Jordan's frustration fester.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you sit down and talk about it and say what you want or
pretend like it's not there and let it filter through the room?"
Tracy said. "I know the kind of competitor he is, and it's a tough
situation right now."</TE>
<TE>   Not for Grissom.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be an everyday starter, that's what I've been my whole
career," Grissom said. "I'm an everyday player, point blank. I'm
healthy, I'm going out and playing, I've got to help the team every
day. I don't care about my status. I'm all right.... All I want to do
the rest of my career is win and put up numbers."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Met Manager Bobby Valentine's suggestion that Odalis Perez was
tipping pitches during his seven-inning, one-hit, seven-strikeout
performance in a 10-4 victory over New York Saturday night raised
some eyebrows but not the ire of the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever he says about tipping pitches, I don't care, because
even if I was tipping pitches, they couldn't hit them," said Perez,
whose perfect game was broken up with one out in the seventh. "I'd
like to keep tipping pitches and throw the same game I did [Saturday]
night."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how dominant he would have been if he hadn't tipped any
pitches, Perez joked, "Oh, it definitely would have been a perfect
game."</TE>
<TE>   When told of Valentine's comments, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca
said, "Really? How many guys did he strike out? How many hits did he
give up.... The guy almost threw a perfect game and they knew what he
was throwing? I find that hard to believe. I don't know if he's
trying to test his players or put his guys down, but I don't get it."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger pitching coach Jim Colborn said most pitchers, from time to
time, will tip pitches, but he doesn't think Perez has had any
significant problems this season. "Maybe they know something I
don't," Colborn said. "But even when you know what's coming, you
can't always hit it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger first baseman Eric Karros was ejected when he argued umpire
Gary Cederstrom's called third strike in the third inning Sunday.</TE>

<HD>This Time, Barrichello Prevails</HD>
<DH>Formula One: Unlike Austrian Grand Prix finish, he protects
lead and doesn't let teammate Schumacher pass him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BUDAPEST, Hungary</DL>
<LD>Rubens Barrichello wasn't about to surrender his lead in the
Hungarian Grand Prix.</LD>
<LD>   Barrichello edged teammate Michael Schumacher to win the race
Sunday, and their 1-2 finish allowed Ferrari to clinch the Formula
One team title with four races left.</LD>
<LD>   Barrichello, starting from the pole, cruised to his second victory
of the season and third of his career, only losing the lead during
his two pit stops in the 77-lap race.</LD>
<TE>   At the Austrian Grand Prix in May, Barrichello obeyed team orders
and moved over on the final straightaway to let Schumacher take the
checkered flag.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the Brazilian driver protected his lead on the tight
2.47-mile Hungaroring circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing was to win the constructors' title,"
said Barrichello, who finished in 1 hour 41 minutes 49.001 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a great car, great pit stops, everything was great today.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the best car out there, it was just a matter of bringing
it home. Winning 1-2 is just great."</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher moved within a half-second of Barrichello with five
laps remaining, but seemed happy to let his teammate lead the way.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no intention to pass, I was just having some fun,"
Schumacher said. "After that, I just drove safely home. Second place
was the maximum I could get today."</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher already had assured himself of a record-tying fifth
drivers' championship.</TE>
<TE>   By finishing 0.4 of a second behind Barrichello, he barely missed
becoming the first to win 10 races in a season.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher's younger brother, Ralf, was third in a BMW-Williams,
13.3 seconds off the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Barrichello moved into second place in the drivers' standings,
five points ahead of Ralf Schumacher and his BMW-Williams teammate
Juan Pablo Montoya, who finished 11th.</TE>
<TE>   Former Formula One champion Jacques Villeneuve pulled out after 20
laps with an engine breakdown in his BAR-Honda.</TE>

<DH>In the lowly Appalachian League, aspiring major leaguers
and their fans won't be affected by a strike</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHNSON CITY, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Here in the low-rent district of professional baseball, where players
travel by bus from town to mountain town, eat at Taco Bell and borrow
a few bucks to make it to the next payday, word that millionaire
major leaguers might go on strike Aug. 30 seems as weird and remote
as chatter from outer space.</LD>
<LD>   "If they strike, they strike," said Vance Spinks, the Johnson City
Cardinal general manager who quit a lucrative computer job eight
years ago for a minor league career that started as a ballpark usher.
"It wouldn't impact us. If anything it could help. We could make the
pitch: 'The majors aren't playing anymore. Come on out and see us.' "</LD>
<LD>   It is an hour to game time. Spinks, who is also the team's public
address announcer, is in the tiny press box, fiddling with some
wires. His assistant GM is grilling hamburgers near the ticket booth.
Fans are trickling into the 2,200-seat park, many carrying two cans
of food for the homeless as part of a free-ticket promotion. The
usher, Don Stephens, a retired railroad worker, knows all the
regulars by name.</LD>
<TE>   In an era when baseball's major leagues are beset by work
stoppages, reports of widespread steroid use, debt-burdened teams,
stagnant attendance, sinking TV ratings and soaring salaries, the
Appalachian League, where Johnson City has fielded a team on and off
since 1921, harks back to a bygone time half a century ago when the
French-born author Jacques Barzun advised, "Whoever wants to know the
heart and mind of America had better learn baseball...."</TE>
<TE>   The fields in the 10-team Appy League, as it is known, are named
for local civic leaders, not corporations. Everyone stands hatless
and still during the national anthem. For $20, a family of four can
see a game, buy hot dogs, sodas and a program and leave with change.
Parking is usually free. Players earn $850 a month and they all show
up when the local church or chamber of commerce puts on a picnic for
them.</TE>
<TE>   One young infielder, now in his second season with Johnson City,
said he was sure he'd move above the poverty line one day. Yes, a
visitor replied, if he played 40 seasons in the Appy, or until he was
61, he would have ended up earning, in all that time, what Alex
Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers does in a day.</TE>
<TE>   "Say again, please," the young player said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Tyler Adamczyk, 19, of Westlake Village, was unconcerned.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really looked at baseball in terms of money," he said.
"Every kid dreams of having this opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Added Mitch Maio, 23, a University of Utah graduate, "Even if all
this ended tomorrow, my time in the Appy League wouldn't have been
wasted. I can always tell my kids someday I was a professional
athlete, that I was paid for doing something I love. No one can ever
take that away from me."</TE>
<TE>   "Well said," said Matt Lemanczyk, 21, of Rockville Centre, N.Y. "I
couldn't have put it better myself."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the words of young men who do not yet wear the perfume
of heroic deeds. Here in the lowest level of the minor leagues, on
the first step toward a major league dream few will fulfill, these
players remain a world apart from fame and fortune--and the devilish
influence those twin companions exert on those who flirt with them.
But the dream is real. Just ask the 14 major leaguers who once
labored for the Johnson City Cardinals in the long summer nights of
the Appalachian League.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone offers you $40 million, you can't blame players for
taking it," said hitting coach Tommy Kidwell, a 1998 graduate of Yale
University, who had shown up at the park lugging his dirty laundry
from the trip to Pulaski, Va., to dump into the locker-room washing
machine.</TE>
<TE>   "But to be on strike Sept. 11, when the country is trying to put
everything in perspective, I think it could be suicide for baseball.
Because part of that perspective is to understand that we just play a
game."</TE>
<TE>   Decades before the major leagues ventured west of the Mississippi
in 1958, towns across America, particularly in the then-isolated
West, considered having a baseball team a mark of progressive spirit
and civic pride, just as Appalachian League communities in Tennessee,
West Virginia and Virginia do today.</TE>
<TE>   "Salt Lake has for a number of years fostered the game of
baseball," editorialized the Salt Lake Tribune in 1887. "In fact our
city would not be up in modern ideas did she not do so. In these
times baseball clubs are almost an imperative necessity."</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1940s, 464 minor league teams stretched from coast to
coast and so many prospects showed up at the Brooklyn Dodgers' spring
training camp that players wore uniforms with triple-digit numbers.
Forty-two million Americans attended minor league games in 1949. The
golden age died with the advent of television and within a decade,
teams were folding faster than afternoon newspapers. Attendance
plummeted below 9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Today the minors are again a hot-ticket item. Spurred by
affordability, savvy marketing, new ballparks and a sense of
intimacy, attendance has increased 29% since the 1994 strike that
interrupted major league baseball for 232 days and forced the first
cancellation of a World Series in 90 years. Major league attendance
rose 3% in that period. The 160 teams that are the training ground
for prospects paid by major league affiliates and reach from Rancho
Cucamonga to Winsooki, Vt., are expected to top 38 million in
attendance this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I come out here with my wife and son, and it's like sitting on
your front porch--but with entertainment," said high school teacher
John Freeman, 56, who spent $60 for a season ticket and dutifully
records each play of the Cardinal-Ranger game at Calfee Park in
Pulaski. "But I'd have to acknowledge football is king now. People my
age may think of baseball as the national pastime, but I don't think
young people do. Major league baseball has cut its own throat."</TE>

<HD>Jarrett Takes a Spin Before Winning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dale Jarrett rebounded from a spin on the 12th lap and passed Jeff
Burton with five laps left to win the NASCAR Winston Cup Pepsi 400 at
Michigan International Speedway on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Jarrett's 30th career victory--and fourth at Michigan--came on the
11th anniversary of his first one, when he edged the late Davey
Allison by inches on the two-mile track in Brooklyn, Mich. Jarrett
also won this race in 1996, the last time it was held on Aug. 18.</LD>
<LD>   The Ford driver has two victories this year, also winning the June
race at Pocono.</LD>
<TE>   Burton stretched his fuel for the final 53 laps, but an
overheating engine was a bigger concern. With two laps to go in the
200-lap race, Burton's car began spewing water and trailing smoke,
but he held on to finish fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Stewart finished second in a Pontiac, about two seconds back,
and Kevin Harvick was third in a Chevrolet. Mark Martin trailed
Burton to the line with point leader Sterling Marling sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "Who'd have thought when I spun out earlier that we'd be right
here?" Jarrett said in victory lane.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrett's team decided to take four tires during the sixth caution
on Lap 164, while the rest of the front-runners--except Burton--took
only two. The decision put Jarrett back to 17th on the restart, but
he steadily progressed through the field.</TE>
<TE>   He took fifth from Bobby Labonte with 20 laps to go, then passed
Kevin Harvick for fourth three laps later.</TE>
<TE>   A final caution for Derrike Cope's crash on Lap 186 set up a final
dash for the checkered flag, with Burton leading Stewart, Dale
Earnhardt Jr. and Jarrett. Earnhardt got by Stewart with 10 laps
left, but neither could hold off Jarrett.</TE>
<TE>   He moved past both to second on Lap 192, then closed in on Burton.
With four laps to go, Jarrett drove to the inside in Turn 4 and
pulled easily into the lead, leaving Burton to race with the others.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Jimmie Johnson finished seventh, followed by Johnny Benson,
Jeff Green and Earnhardt, who fought an ill-handling car over the
final laps.</TE>
<TE>   The race was the first run under a rule change by NASCAR that
allowed General Motors teams to bump their front air dams out
slightly; Chevrolet was given an extra inch, and Pontiac a half-inch.
Although Ford and Dodge teams speculated the move would leave their
cars uncompetitive, all manufacturers had cars near the top of the
leaderboard.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cristiano da Matta returned to form, ending a three-race slump
with a victory in the Motorola 220.</TE>
<TE>   The CART series leader won for the first time on the scenic
four-mile road course at Road America in Elkhart Lake, Minn., earning
his sixth win in 12 starts this season and the 10th of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very satisfying, because we had a couple of bad races
together, and it's very rewarding to be back in first place," Da
Matta said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a dominant victory, as were some the Brazilian driver
has had this season. Paul Tracy actually led the most laps (24) in
the race, which was extended this year from 55 to 60 laps, and
pole-winner Bruno Junqueira and Alex Tagliani both were contenders to
the end.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy, who started fourth in the 18-car field, got a great start
and passed Junqueira on the fifth turn of the first lap to take the
lead. He led easily until making his first pit stop on Lap 25,
building margins of up to 2.3 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Junqueira inherited the lead and stayed in front until he pitted
on Lap 39. Da Matta, who had been lurking near the leaders throughout
the early going, took the lead at that point and never lost it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Force drove his Ford Mustang to a 5.405-second pass at 216.62
mph to beat Gary Densham (6.929 at 130.27) in the finals of the funny
car division at the NHRA Rugged Liner Nationals.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Bernstein won the top fuel division and Jeg Coughlin won the
pro stock division in the $1.9-million event at Brainerd, Minn.,
International Raceway.</TE>

<LD>Amelie Mauresmo defeated Jennifer Capriati, 6-4, 6-1, Sunday in the
final of the Rogers AT&amp;T Cup at Montreal, a hard-court tuneup for the
U.S. Open.</LD>
<LD>   The seventh-seeded Mauresmo of France earned $182,000 for her
eighth career WTA Tour title and second of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   "I just wanted to play a few matches and get my game in order and
see how I'm doing against the best players," Mauresmo said. "I guess
it went pretty well. The main thing is to be ready for the U.S.
Open."</LD>
<TE>   Serving at 4-4 in the first set, Mauresmo won two points on serves
the second-seeded Capriati argued were out and took a 5-4 lead. She
then took the set by breaking serve when a Capriati backhand flew
wide.</TE>

<TE>   James Blake won his first ATP Tour title, beating Thailand's
Paradorn Srichaphan, 1-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4, in the Legg Mason Tennis

<TE>   The sixth-seeded Blake broke Srichaphan's serve to tie the second
set, 3-3, and took the tiebreaker when Srichaphan's backhand sailed
long.</TE>
<TE>   Blakeimproved to 3-0 lifetime against the 14th-seeded Srichaphan.</TE>

<TE>   Greg Rusedski of Britain produced the only two service breaks and

his second title of 2002 and 12th of his career.</TE>

<TE>   Even with two quarterbacks sidelined by injuries, the Pittsburgh
Steelers handled the Washington Redskins--until Sage Rosenfels and
the backups led a three-touchdown rally in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenfels completed a five-yard touchdown pass to Darnerien
McCants with 2:11 left at Landover, Md., as the Redskins overcame a
20-point fourth-quarter deficit to beat the Steelers, 35-34.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Steve Spurrier's team is 3-0 and has scored 110 points in
exhibitions, but it was dominated by the Steelers, who led, 17-0,
when the starters were playing in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Kordell Stewart sustained a mild concussion and Charlie Batch cut
his chin, but it didn't matter who the Pittsburgh quarterback was
early on. Batch capped an 83-yard drive with a one-yard touchdown
pass to Dan Kreider and rookie Antwaan Randle El ran 32 yards on a
reverse to finish a 99-yard drive--both against the Redskins'
first-string defense. The Steelers gained 221 yards in the first
half.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenfels struggled against Pittsburgh's starters in the second
quarter--completing six of 10 for 54 yards with an interception and a
fumble--but he returned in the fourth to throw touchdown passes to
Leonard Stephens, Derrius Thompson and McCants. In all, Rosenfels
completed 17 of 25 for 244 yards.</TE>

<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal rested at home Sunday after a high fever forced
him to spend about 24 hours in an Orlando, Fla., hospital before
being released Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Laker officials on Sunday night awaited results of tests they
hoped would reveal the cause of a 103-degree temperature that, in
part, caused him to miss a weekend event in Tampa.</TE>
<TE>   "We're waiting the results of the tests," Laker General Manager
Mitch Kupchak said. "Right now, that's where it stands. It is our
assumption he would not have been released had there not been some
improvement. That being said, we still don't know what caused the
fever."</TE>
<TE>   The results were expected today.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, O'Neal suffered a spike in his body temperature,
which eventually dipped and then rose again before doctors controlled
it. He was released with instructions to rest and take fluids,
according to Perry Rogers, O'Neal's agent.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Lakers and Rogers said they hoped O'Neal's illness would
not complicate plans for O'Neal's toe surgery, which is not yet
scheduled.</TE>

<HD>Burnett Is Too Tough for Giants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The strikeouts, the shutouts and the complete games are starting to
pile up for A.J. Burnett. So are the wins.</LD>
<LD>   Burnett pitched a three-hitter for his major league-leading fifth
shutout as the Florida Marlins beat San Francisco, 3-0, Sunday at Pro
Player Stadium in Miami, handing the Giants their fourth consecutive
loss.</LD>
<LD>   Burnett helped the Marlins to their fourth consecutive victory and
knocked the Giants another game back in the NL wild-card race. They
are four games behind the Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm getting pretty confident out there with myself and being able
to throw that pill where I want to," Burnett said. "I don't get
caught up in all the other stuff around me. You've got to do your
job, and five days later, do your job again."</TE>
<TE>   Burnett (12-9) struck out nine, walked two and set a career high
for wins. He also tied Montreal's Bartolo Colon with seven complete
games, most in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   The hard-throwing right-hander retired 12 of his final 13 batters,
yielding only a walk to Barry Bonds in the seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   Burnett is third in the league in innings pitched (191) and
strikeouts (183), trailing only Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling of
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Arizona 2--Joe Girardi hit a game-winning single in the
bottom of the ninth to give the Cubs the victory despite losing right
fielder Sammy Sosa in an outfield collision. The loss ended Arizona's
eight-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Gonzalez led off the ninth with a single off Matt Mantei
(2-2) and stole second. After missing a bunt, Girardi singled to
center.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa and second baseman Mark Bellhorn collided when chasing a fly
ball hit by Damian Miller in the sixth inning. Sosa held up at the
last second, trying to avoid the collision.</TE>
<TE>   The ball nicked Bellhorn's glove in fair territory as of their
shoulders collided. Sosa and Bellhorn were down for several minutes,
while Miller scored on an inside-the-park home run, giving Arizona a
2-1 lead in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa and Bellhorn remained in the game for the rest of the inning
before being removed with headaches.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 9, San Diego 2--A crowd of 24,872 on Vladimir Guerrero
bobblehead day raised the Expos' attendance through 63 home games to
653,203, surpassing their total of 642,748 for the 2001 season.</TE>
<TE>   They watched Jose Vidro hit two homers and Jose Macias hit a
three-run shot to lead the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-largest crowd of the season at Olympic Stadium saw
Guerrero, who sat out Saturday's game because of a strained left
shoulder, make a shoestring catch in right-center to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, Philadelphia 1--Edgar Renteria hit his first grand
slam, leading Matt Morris and the Cardinals before a sellout crowd of
58,493 at Veterans Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies honored Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Kalas and fans
got dual bobblehead dolls featuring the popular announcer and Hall of
Famer Richie Ashburn.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd did not get another chance to boo former Phillie star
Scott Rolen. The third baseman, traded to the Cardinals on July 29,
did not play because of a sore left shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 2, Houston 1--Sean Casey hit a one-out homer in the
bottom of the 10th inning, the fourth time this season that the Reds
have ended a game with a home run.</TE>
<TE>   Austin Kearns hit a solo homer in the second inning and the
Astros' Jeff Bagwell matched it in the seventh in a game dominated by
pitching.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, Milwaukee 2--Adam Hyzdu homered and drove in two
runs and Mike Williams set a team record with his 35th save,
preserving the Pirates' win at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Williams pitched a perfect ninth inning to break the club mark of
34 saves set by Jim Gott in 1988. Williams has blown only two chances
this season.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The Atlanta Braves have such a big lead in the National League East,
they might be getting a little bored.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Walker homered twice and Jay Payton had four hits as the
Colorado Rockies handed Atlanta consecutive losses for the first time
in more than a month, beating the Braves, 6-3, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Atlanta still has an 18 1/2-game lead over the Montreal Expos in
the NL East.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think we have a problem with a letdown or lack of
intensity," said pitcher Tom Glavine, who will try to end the
mini-slide today. "We still have the best record to play for, the
home-field advantage to play for. The intensity level is the same."</TE>
<TE>   He blamed nagging injuries and several draining games--twice in
the previous three nights the Braves waited through rain delays--for
the closest thing to a slump in these parts. Atlanta has lost four of
its last seven.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies had 13 hits off Greg Maddux, who came in leading the
league with a 2.51 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   The four-time Cy Young winner had not given up that many hits in a
game since the New York Yankees also had 13 on June 3, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Walker, who had four RBIs, hit a tie-breaking homer in the seventh
against Maddux (11-5) on an 0-and-2 fastball. He added his 25th of
the season in the ninth off Kerry Ligtenberg.</TE>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>John Dutton passed for 236 yards and five touchdowns and the San Jose
SaberCats won their first ArenaBowl, shutting out the Arizona
Rattlers in the first three quarters of a 52-14 victory before 16,942
at the Compaq Center.</LD>
<LD>   James Hundon caught three touchdown passes for the SaberCats, who
capped a 16-1 season with one of the most remarkable achievements in
Arena League history: 50 shutout minutes in a league where teams
often score 50 points a game.</LD>
<LD>   The SaberCats avenged their only defeat--a 59-52 loss at Arizona
last month.</LD>
<TE>   The Rattlers trailed, 24-0, at halftime and 38-0 after three
quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "I was enjoying seeing that zero up there," San Jose Coach Darren
Arbet said. "All year, we hadn't put together a complete game. Today,
I think we did it."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona avoided the second shutout loss in Arena football's
16-year history when Maurice Bryant caught a 30-yard touchdown pass
from Sherdrick Bonner with 9:24 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Arbet became the first black coach to win a pro football title. He
guided the team to the best record in Arena history.</TE>

<HD>Star Is Beem at Hazeltine</HD>
<DH>Golf: Former car stereo salesman joins growing list of
little-known PGA Championship winners, holding off Woods by a shot in
year's final major.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Rich Beem holds off Tiger Woods to win major golf championship ...
now there's one for the book.</LD>
<LD>   You wouldn't believe it except stuff like this happens all the
time at the PGA Championship, sort of the Star Search of the four
majors.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Tway chips in to beat Greg Norman in 1986. John Daly comes
from ninth alternate to win at Crooked Stick. Paul Azinger breaks
through in 1993, Mark Brooks in '96, Davis Love III in '97 and David
Toms last year.</LD>
<TE>   It happened again Sunday, at Hazeltine National Golf Club, at the
84th PGA Championship, on a pretty postcard/scorecard day.</TE>
<TE>   Beem, a 31-year-old ex-car stereo salesman, a guy who six years
ago was out of golf unless you count hitting drives off his
second-floor balcony into Puget Sound, survived a furious rally by
Woods on the last four holes to win his first major championship.</TE>
<TE>   Beem shot four-under 68 in the final round and finished 10-under
278 for the tournament, one life-altering shot better than Woods, who
shot five-under 67 and finished at nine-under 279.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost indescribable," Beem said of his win. "To win any
tournament is unbelievable. I don't know when this is going to sink
in. Right now, I am so flabbergasted about this you have no idea."</TE>
<TE>   Woods, seeking to become the first golfer to twice win three
professional majors in the same season, closed with four consecutive
birdies to force Beem to reach often for his bottle of Pepto Bismol.</TE>
<TE>   Beem had a five-shot lead on the field after he made birdie on the
par-three 13th, a seemingly insurmountable lead, yet after Woods made
birdie on No. 18, Beem stood in the 18th fairway with only a two-shot
lead.</TE>
<TE>   He still needed only a bogey to win, but Jean Van de Velde could
tell you leads like this have been blown before.</TE>
<TE>   Beem left his approach shot short but on the green, then
knock-kneed home the most glorious three-putt of his life for bogey
to collect his check.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Riley, who started the day six shots behind third-round
leader Justin Leonard, shot two-under 70 and finished third at
five-under 283.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Funk and Leonard finished tied for fourth at 284.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard began the round with a three-shot lead, but finished six
shots out after a wheels-came-off 77. Only 10 players in the field
shot a worse round.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how difficult it was to take, Leonard said, "I don't know,
the getting-over-it part is only about two minutes old. Ask me in
another couple of weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Beem, meanwhile, was beaming.</TE>
<TE>   He earned $990,000 for his victory and a free pass into major
tournaments for years to come. Beem now has a lifetime exemption to
the PGA Championship, five-year exemptions to the Masters, U.S. Open
and British Open and a five-year PGA Tour exemption.</TE>
<TE>   And this doesn't even count the bragging rights he retains for
having slammed the door on Woods' bid to win his ninth major title.</TE>
<TE>   At his post-victory news conference, Beem searched the crowd for
an editor from Golf Week or Golf Digest.</TE>
<TE>   "I've won twice on tour and I haven't been on the cover of either
magazine," Beem joked. "Is there any way you guys can get me on the
cover this time? Seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Beem's story reads like the rough draft of "Tin Cup."</TE>
<TE>   He was born in New Mexico, but traveled the world as an "Army
brat" with his serviceman father, a former All-American golfer at New
Mexico State.</TE>
<TE>   Beem returned home to finish high school in Las Cruces, then took
a crack at eclipsing his dad's shadow by playing golf at New Mexico
State.</TE>
<TE>   From there, though, his life moved fast into a cycle of booze,
fast women and mediocre golf. He tried to scrape out a living on
mini-tours in South Dakota and Nevada, but eventually quit the game
and moved to Seattle, where he took a job in stereo sales making $7
an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Beem was plopped on the couch on Easter Sunday in 1996 when he
watched Paul Stankowski win the BellSouth Classic.</TE>
<TE>   It was his clarion call to give golf another shot.</TE>
<TE>   Beem moved back to New Mexico and honed his game while working as
an assistant pro at El Paso Country Club. He was so lousy at his job
that his boss told him to get serious about golf or get out the
business.</TE>
<TE>   Beem earned his PGA Tour card at qualifying school in 1998 and
then earned a two-year exemption for winning the 1999 Kemper Open.</TE>
<TE>   Beem called it a career-saving victory.</TE>
<TE>   After the Kemper, Sports Illustrated writer Alan Shipnuck pursued
Beem to do a book about life as an under-the-radar player on the PGA
Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "Bud, Sweat &amp; Tees" was published in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Shipnuck was drawn to Beem because of his personality and a
raucous, week-to-week lifestyle that was light years from the
glamorous life Woods was carving out.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the antithesis of that," Shipnuck said by phone Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Shipnuck thought Beem had the talent to win. "The only question
was whether he could keep his head on straight."</TE>
<TE>   Beem's head was locked on target Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone kept waiting for the collapse after Beem bogeyed the
par-three No. 8 hole and dropped to eight-under, only one shot ahead
of Woods, who blistered the front nine with a 33.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Woods who faltered, first when he whacked his tee shot
right and had to scramble for par on the par-five 11th.</TE>
<TE>   Playing with Leonard in the group behind Woods and Funk, Beem
followed Woods down the 597-yard hole with two mammoth shots that put
him on the green.</TE>
<TE>   Beem then rolled in his eagle putt from six feet to widen his lead
over Woods to three shots.</TE>
<TE>   Beem extended his lead to six shots at one point after he birdied
the par-three 13th and Woods fell to five-under with a bogey on No.
14.</TE>
<TE>   Woods then put on a final, punishing push.</TE>
<TE>   After Woods jerked his tee shot left on 15, he turned to caddie
Steve Williams and said, "If we birdie in, we'll win the tournament.
Let's just suck it up and get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Woods got it done, making birdies on 15, 16, 17 and 18. But it
wasn't quite enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't miss a shot coming in," Woods said. "I gave it
absolutely everything I had.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way I play each and every time I tee it up, and this
was no exception."</TE>
<TE>   Beem wasn't really out of the woods until he cleared his tee shot
over Hazeltine Lake at the par-four 16th, the toughest hole on the
course. Beam said Saturday he "might puke" if the tournament came
down to No. 16, yet he knocked his tee shot on the fairway, found the
green with his second shot and rolled in a 35-footer for birdie, then
hurled his ball in the water.</TE>
<TE>   "What can I say about the putt, it was unbelievable," Beem said.</TE>
<TE>   Some guys play their whole life trying to win a major. Phil
Mickelson has tried 42 times and failed, yet Sunday, Rich Beem held
up the Wanamaker Trophy in only his fourth major tournament
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Funny how life goes.</TE>
<TE>   Beem knows his life has forever changed.</TE>
<TE>   For years, he has kept the work identification card he had while
working as a stereo salesman in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Time to lose the card?</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely not," Beem said. "Don't ever forget where you came
from, and that's where I came from.</TE>
<TE>   "I came from a job that served its purpose, but not a chance. I'm
going to keep that card forever, just as a reminder it could always
be worse, you could be working for Magnolia Hi-Fi."</TE>

<HD>Funk Doesn't Lose His Mojo</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>THOMAS BONK and CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>Fred Funk didn't close the deal on Sunday, but no golfer had more
fun.</LD>
<LD>   Funk shot one-over 73 and finished tied for fourth, yet the
46-year-old thoroughly enjoyed the round he played with Tiger Woods.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't want the day to end," Funk said. "It was such a great
atmosphere. I was having a good time. I heard one of the best chants
from this guy who said, 'Freddie for governor.' Is Jesse out? I'm not
fighting him."</LD>
<TE>   Funk had his share of fun, starting on the first hole, after Woods
pumped his fist after chipping in to save par.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be outdone, Funk threw up his arm after he made his par.</TE>
<TE>   Woods broke out in a broad smile as the players walked to the
second hole.</TE>
<TE>   Funk told Woods, "I got that out of the way," but Woods would have
the last laugh, saying of Funk that "gravity has taken its toll on
him."</TE>
<TE>   Funk is one of the tour's shortest players at 5 feet 8.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whither Butch?</TE>
<TE>   He has been Woods' only coach since Earl Woods handed him the
reins when Tiger was a teenager, but Butch Harmon's influence is
going to be reduced. Woods says his working relationship with Harmon
is different now.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it has changed," Woods said. "Every player, as you get a
little bit better and you understand your own mechanics, you
understand your game, you don't rely on a teacher quite as often.
That's what has transpired with me.</TE>
<TE>   "I still need Butch, yes, but as not as much as I used to."</TE>
<TE>   There was speculation after last year's PGA Championship at
Atlanta Athletic Club that Woods and Harmon were going to take
separate paths, but both denied it. Harmon is the only remaining
member of Woods' original entourage from 1996, when he turned
professional.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what the cure is for a lot of my faults that I have while
I'm playing," Woods said. "But Butch, he's got a great eye for the
swing, there's no denying that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The surprise performance of the week belonged to Chris Riley, who
came from nowhere, it seemed, to finish third at five-under 283.</TE>
<TE>   By finishing in the top four, Riley earned a spot in next year's
Masters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the hardest major to get into," Riley said. "It would be a
dream come true to play at Augusta. It is the pinnacle."</TE>
<TE>   The 28-year-old Riley, from Las Vegas, has not won a tournament
since joining the PGA Tour in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Riley said he was happy just to make the cut.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never been in an experience like this," he said. "It is a
tremendous feeling, something you can't describe. The people back
home are going to ask me how it is playing in a major. It was a lot
of fun."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He had a 71 in the first round, but closed with a 78 and wound up
at 11-over 299 in a tie for 60th, so Nick Faldo had no problem
assessing his performance.</TE>
<TE>   "It started great and finished very badly.... This was a horrible
week."</TE>
<TE>   At 45, Faldo says he isn't putting Hazeltine on his schedule when
the PGA Championship returns here in 2009.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be fishing by then," he said. "I'll be on the Nick Faldo
World Fishing Tour by then. Come and join me if you've got a fishing
rod."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charles Howell was all over the place the last three rounds--69,
80, 69--to finish his second PGA Championship at two-over 290, tied
for 17th. Howell blamed his driving and not his putting, which has
not been his strong point this year.</TE>
<TE>   Howell said shooting 80 after being at par through seven holes was
"just like putting a bullet through your foot."</TE>
<TE>   Added Howell: "Actually, putting a bullet in my foot probably
would have felt better than an 80."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Appleby on Hazeltine: "When you start out at Augusta, then
Bethpage was just phenomenal, I couldn't stop raving about that. I
like the [Hazeltine] course, but I've played a lot better."</TE>
<TE>   And from Vijay Singh: "It's been the easiest course of the majors
this year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Phil Mickelson pulled himself together with a four-under 68 and
wound up tied for 34th at six-over 294. Mickelson said his coach,
Rick Smith, helped him work out what was going wrong when they met
for dinner Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "We kind of clicked on something," Mickelson said. "I started to
hit the ball very well, so that is a plus."</TE>
<TE>   In the other three majors this year, Mickelson was third at the
Masters, second at the U.S. Open and tied for 66th at the British
Open.</TE>

<LD>Saul Shechter struck out in his lawsuit against Billy the Marlin in
the case of the flying souvenir T-shirt.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors took more than 7 1/2 hours over two days to decide in favor
of the Florida Marlin mascot, the Marlins' baseball club and Pro
Player Stadium in the negligence case that arose from a baseball game
two years ago at which Shechter was injured.</LD>
<LD>   Shechter, 77, of Pembroke Pines, Fla., attended a Marlin game on
July 20, 2000. He was hit in the eye by the shirt, which Billy the
Marlin fired into the crowd through a pressurized gun.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody was happy Mr. Shechter got injured--least of all Billy,"
John McClure, Billy's attorney, said after the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins have twice lost million-dollar lawsuits filed by
spectators hit by balls during batting practice. Shechter claimed he
suffered permanent eye damage and was seeking about $250,000 in
damages.</TE>
<TE>   Billy said of the verdict: "It's one small step for a fish and one
giant leap for mascot-kind."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: When Luis Gonzalez of the Arizona Diamondbacks sat
out last Tuesday's game, it ended his consecutive games streak at
446, best among active major league players. Who now has the top
spot?</TE>
<TE>   Damaged goods: The Denver Broncos will pay for damages associated
with a prank in the players' dormitory at the University of Northern
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Several rookies were awakened Wednesday by buckets of water, then
covered with flour and maple syrup. The rookies retaliated by
spraying a fire extinguisher into the room of Shannon Sharpe, the
alleged ringleader.</TE>
<TE>   Damage was estimated to be from $1,000 to $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing was destroyed, but they made a mess," said Jim Saccomano,
Bronco vice president of public relations. "It wasn't like when you
hear about a rock band destroying a hotel room or something."</TE>
<TE>   Rock on: Knute Rockne III, the grandson of the famed Notre Dame
coach, is a 50-year-old history teacher and assistant football coach
at Brighton High in suburban Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   He said there were days when he dreamed of coaching at Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "As I grew older and the family commitments increased, I knew it
would never happen," Rockne said. "It would have made a great story
for me to coach at Notre Dame, but that was only a youthful fantasy."</TE>
<TE>   They're all wet: Dan Le Batard of the Miami Herald wasn't
impressed with the Dolphins' exhibition debut in a 24-7 loss last
week to New Orleans:</TE>
<TE>   "The Dolphins looked-- how can we say this gently?--like a team
that had never before seen a football, was completely unfamiliar with
the game's rules and had you longing for the grisly days when they
merely lost 62-7. And that's the good news."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Miguel Tejada of the Oakland Athletics with 393
through Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Detroit Tiger announcer Ernie Harwell, 84, who is
retiring after this season, used to wear berets to the ballpark, a
practice he took to after a trip to Spain. But he recently told the
Washington Post that he has given them up:</TE>
<TE>   "I've found that if you wear a beret, people think you're either a
cab driver or a producer of dirty movies."</TE>

<HD>Toney Earns Another Shot at a World Title</HD>
<DH>Boxing: Former champ stops Robinson in seventh, will fight
for cruiserweight crown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former two-time world champion James "Lights Out" Toney again
established darkness in his boxing career, scoring an impressive
seventh-round knockout of Jason Robinson in an International Boxing
Federation cruiserweight title-elimination bout on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Toney's victory at Pechanga Resort and Casino in Temecula sets up
a mandated IBF championship fight in November against champion
Vassily Jirov, and Toney looks as though he will have his full
arsenal.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm coming for you," Toney said from the ring of Jirov. "You're
nothing but a punk. You've been ducking me for two years. Now it's
time to put up or shut up."</LD>
<TE>   If Jirov was watching, he got a good look at Toney's monstrous
right hand, though it was Toney's left hook that ultimately turned
the lights out on Robinson in the scheduled 12-round bout.</TE>
<TE>   "He was strong, he was rangy, it took me a few rounds to figure
him out," Toney, ranked fourth by the IBF, said of Robinson, ranked
10th.</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing spectacular about the seventh round until the
last 40 seconds, when Robinson staggered Toney with a left. Toney
said that Robinson had pushed him, but, perhaps sensing the round
could be lost, Toney turned up the heat.</TE>
<TE>   He answered with a right hook that stopped Robinson, followed with
left and right hooks, missed with a right uppercut, then landed the
decisive left hook that put Robinson on his back.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson struggled to get up when referee Pat Russell's count
reached seven, but Russell threw his arms over Robinson to end it.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 11th consecutive victory, seven by knockout, for Toney,
33, of Los Angeles. He weighed 198 3/4 pounds and improved to 65-4-2
with 42 knockouts. Robinson, a former kickboxing champion from
Maywood, Ill., weighed 190 and dropped to 16-3.</TE>
<TE>   Toney used his right hand to also knock down Robinson at the end
of the fifth round, Robinson rising to his feet at the bell.</TE>
<TE>   "We put a lot of pressure on James' shoulders," said promoter Dan
Goossen. "It's the first time in 20 years I've promoted a fighter
when winning wasn't good enough. James had to come out here and do
what he did tonight, because we wanted to show in action rather than
words. James has proven he's willing to go to the gym, do everything
[trainer Freddie Roach] says, and come out here and beat the best in
the world."</TE>
<TE>   On the undercard, Steve Forbes of Las Vegas beat David Santos of
St. Petersburg, Fla., in a split decision that drew boos from the
crowd. Forbes won two cards by 117-111 and lost, 115-113, on the
other. Forbes (21-1) was stripped of the IBF lightweight title
Saturday after weighing in 2 3/4 pounds over the 130-pound limit. The
title remains vacant, though Santos (42-5) could have won it with a
victory.</TE>

<HD>Mallon Fights Off Winds to Take Canadian Open</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VAUDREUIL-DORION, Quebec</DL>
<LD>Meg Mallon took advantage of a gust of wind that cost Catriona
Matthew the lead on the back nine and won the Canadian Women's Open
on Sunday by three strokes despite a closing 73.</LD>
<LD>   It was the 10th come-from-behind victory for Mallon, who finished
at four-under 284 and took home the winner's share of $180,000.</LD>
<LD>   "When I woke up this morning, I saw the conditions, and I just
knew it was going to be a very difficult day," Mallon said after her
14th LPGA victory and first since she won the du Maurier Classic two
years ago. "I knew that nobody was going to come from behind and
shoot a low round to come back."</LD>
<TE>   As predicted, the winds returned, gusting at over 30 mph all day,
playing havoc with every shot, and making the greens oh-so-fast. The
top 10 players combined for 33 bogeys, four double bogeys and one
triple bogey, and only Canadian Lorie Kane broke par (71).</TE>
<TE>   Matthew, who began the day with a one-shot lead over Mallon, was
unable to recover from a disastrous triple bogey at the 12th hole,
even though Mallon gave her the opportunity with three bogeys on her
final seven holes.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew finished with a 79 and one-under 287, tying Michelle Ellis
and Michele Redman for second.</TE>
<TE>   The 344-yard, par-four 12th, with its hard-sloping green and
narrow fairway, was Matthew's undoing. After going one under at 12
through the first three rounds, she drove into the wind, and it swept
the ball out of sight.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just hitting a little four-wood that I didn't hit that bad,
got it turning left, and it went with the wind and ended up in the
bushes," said Matthew, forced to take a drop that cost her a penalty
stroke. "That really threw me, and the last few holes it was tough to
try and make birdies. You were really just trying to make pars."</TE>

<LD>Although it did not come easy, Disturbingthepeace remained the
hottest sprinter in the country Sunday at Del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   The California-bred gelding, who was purchased as part of a
package by owner David Milch more than a year ago, won for the sixth
time in a row, taking the $150,000 Pat O'Brien by a head over a
stubborn Hot Market.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Darrell Vienna and ridden by Victor Espinoza, who has
been the jockey in his three most recent victories, the 7-10 favorite
completed the seven furlongs in 1:21 4/5. The 4-year-old also became
the first horse since Bruho in 1991 to win the Bing Crosby and the
Pat O'Brien in the same year.</LD>
<TE>   While Hot Market set the pace, Disturbingthepeace, who has now won
four of five at seven furlongs, sat second, then appeared ready to
take charge into the lane, but the runner-up didn't quit. Love That
Silver rallied for third ahead of Blu Air Force and Mellow Fellow.
Komax was scratched earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   There is a distinct possibility the Grade II O'Brien was
Disturbingthepeace's last race until the Breeders' Cup Sprint on Oct.
26 at Arlington Park.</TE>

<TE>   Jockey Edgar Prado won four races at Saratoga to move into a tie
with Jerry Bailey atop the standings. One of his wins came on rising
star Wonder Again in the $150,000 Lake Placid Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   A 3-year-old Silver Hawk filly owned and bred by Joan Phillips and
her son, John, and trained by James Toner, Wonder Again cruised to a
2 1/4-length win over 120-pound highweight Riskaverse. In winning her
third in a row on the grass, Wonder Again, a 9-2 shot, ran the 1 1/8
miles over a yielding course in 1:49 1/5.</TE>
<TE>   Prado, who won with Piston in the first race, Patriotic Legend in
the second and Float And Sting in the fourth, has 32 victories at the
meet, which concludes on Sept. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this filly can be a Grade I winner," said Prado after
Wonder Again made a successful stakes debut in the Grade II. "She has
a lot of class and ability."</TE>
<TE>   Making her first start since finishing eighth in the inaugural
American Oaks at Hollywood Park last month, Riskaverse finished 2 1/2
lengths clear of 40-1 outsider Miss Marcia.</TE>
<TE>   Kirtle, the mild 3-1 favorite who had looked good beating a so-so
field at Del Mar on July 29, finished fourth. She was ridden by Mike
Smith, who had a lost weekend in upstate New York. Saturday, he was
unseated by Gander at the start of the $300,000 Saratoga Breeders'
Cup Handicap and was left without a mount in the $750,000 Alabama
when Bella Bellucci was scratched because of the track condition.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cat's At Home, a 10-1 shot, went wire-to-wire under jockey Jose
Velez Jr. to take the $350,000 Philip H. Iselin Handicap at Monmouth
Park.</TE>
<TE>   The Grade II was expected to be easy pickings for Include, but the
1-2 favorite never looked comfortable. At the wire, he and Bailey
were sixth in the field of seven, beaten by some 16 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   "No comment," Bailey said. "You can ask me any question you want
and I'll say no."</TE>
<TE>   A multiple-stakes winner owned by Robert Meyerhoff and trained by
Bud Delp, Include had won 10 of 18 entering the Iselin.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Mark Hennig for owner-breeder Edward Evans, Cat's At
Home ran the 1 1/8 miles in 1:49, beating second choice Bowman's Band
by three-quarters of a length. It was the ninth win in 26 starts for
Cat's At Home, but his first in a graded stakes since he took the
Excelsior at Aqueduct on April 28, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hall of Fame jockey Johnny Longden, who rode Count Fleet to the
Triple Crown in 1943, has suffered a stroke. Longden, 95, was resting
Sunday at his Banning home.</TE>
<TE>   "He's comfortable, he's not in pain, but he's weak and he sleeps a
lot," his wife, Cathy, said.</TE>

<LD>Two horses with reputations that exceed their accomplishments will be
in action as Del Mar concludes the fourth of its seven-week season.</LD>
<LD>   Easy Grades is the 6-5 favorite against four opponents in the
second, a $60,000 allowance at one mile on the main track, then five
races later, D'wildcat is the 7-5 choice in a field of five in a
$68,000 optional claimer at one mile on the turf.</LD>
<LD>   Best known for finishing second in the Santa Anita Derby--a weak
prep for the Kentucky Derby evidenced by the way the top three
finishers performed at Churchill Downs--Easy Grades is back on the
dirt trying for his second lifetime victory.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Desperado Stables and trained by Ted H. West, the
3-year-old Honor Grades gelding has been second on four occasions and
has been the beaten favorite three times.</TE>
<TE>   His most recent disappointment came when he was second, losing by
a head to Ridley on the Del Mar turf on July 26, at 3-10.</TE>
<TE>   A $600,000 purchase more than two years ago by Fog City Stable,
D'wildcat has won three times in 10 tries and has two stakes
victories, but he's never reached the heights some were predicting
for him last year.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, one of his stakes wins is extremely tainted. He was moved
up to first in the Churchill Downs Handicap on the Kentucky Derby
undercard on May 4 when Snow Ridge was disqualified because rider
Mike Smith allegedly struck D'wildcat on the nose with his whip just
before the wire. The widespread opinion was that no change should
have been made.</TE>
<TE>   Take that win away and the Forest Wildcat colt's lone stakes score
was Gulfstream Park's Swale, a Grade III, more than 17 months ago.
Trained by Bob Hess Jr., D'wildcat is the controlling speed in his
turf debut today against Golden General, Gallant, Sir Alfred and
recent winner Zanapour.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Fast-working firsters Lanzada's Sonata and Hula
Girl head a field of nine maiden fillies and mares racing 6 1/2
furlongs in today's sixth at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Rafael Becerra. The trainer was first or second with
half of his first 16 starters at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in today's eighth at Del Mar. The 10 fillies
and mares are a combined 0-for-61.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Breathless and It's Always
Busy in the third, singling Hot Topic in the fourth and using all in
the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/47. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $19.20/$287.80. Total money bet: $394.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Baseball labor talks are scheduled to resume today, restarting the
clock on negotiators trying to avert the sport's ninth work stoppage
in 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   Owners and the Major League Baseball Players Assn. return to the
table after brief discussions Saturday at the commissioner's office,
hoping to reestablish dialogue and complete an agreement before
players strike Aug. 30.</LD>
<LD>   Talks are stalled on two economic issues: increased revenue
sharing and the payroll tax owners deem essential to restrain player
salaries.</LD>
<TE>   The union has agreed to the concept of a tax, but has proposed a
much higher tax threshold and lower tax rate than owners will accept.
The union views a payroll tax and revenue sharing as a salary cap by
another name.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1994 strike, which lasted 232 days, owners and players
agreed to a luxury tax for the 1997, '98 and '99 seasons. But many
owners considered the previous tax formula ineffective.</TE>
<TE>   Management has proposed a tax of 37.5% to 50% on the portion of
payrolls above $102 million. The union has offered a 15% to 30% tax
to start on payrolls above $130 million, and has opposed a tax in the
final year of the proposal.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Zachary Osborne struck out 14--the last two with the bases loaded in
the sixth inning--as Louisville, Ky., beat Harlem, 2-0, on Sunday
night in pool play at the Little League World Series.</LD>
<LD>   Osborne struck out Fernando Frias and Spencer White to end the
game after the New York City team loaded the bases on hits by Javier
Lopez, Alibay Barkley and Jorge Lopez.</LD>
<LD>   "I was really nervous in the last inning," Osborne said. "Bases
loaded, two outs, with their No. 5 hitter. I just took a deep breath,
calmed down and struck the guy out."</LD>
<TE>   Jeremy Lopez struck out eight for Harlem (1-1).</TE>
<TE>   Harlem Manager Morris McWilliams described Kentucky as just an
"all right" team with a good pitcher on the mound, saying the game
turned on his team's errors.</TE>
<TE>   "We committed three errors, and that's how they scored,"
McWilliams said.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't score any earned runs."</TE>
<TE>   Osborne scored both runs for Louisville (2-0).</TE>
<TE>   He tripled down the right-field line in the third and scored on a
fielder's choice to give Louisville a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Louisville loaded the bases with one out, but Lopez struck out the
next two batters to end the threat.</TE>
<TE>   In other games, Aptos, Calif., beat Clemmons, N.C., 11-8; Fort
Worth routed Waipahu, Hawaii, 8-0; Agana, Guam, beat Dhahran, Saudi
Arabia, 9-6; and Monterrey, Mexico, rallied to beat Moscow, 4-3.</TE>

<LD>   Razov scored in the 32nd minute off a long pass from Hristo
Stoitchkov. The Fire (10-9-4) got their second goal in the 85th

<LD>   Columbus 4, Kansas City 0--Jeff Cunningham and Edson Buddle each

<LD>George Szabo and crew Austin Sperry solved the weather riddles of
Santa Monica Bay and made all the right moves to build an unbeatable
lead in the first race of the Nautica 2002 Star Class World
Championship Sunday, but their final opponent was time.</LD>
<LD>   With light, shifty winds forcing the fleet of more than 100 boats
to play beat the clock, the San Diego duo sailed across the finish
line 3 minutes 21 seconds ahead of the 3 1/2-hour deadline for the 10
1/2-mile race, while a bunch of big names were left behind.</LD>
<LD>   Szabo's finish made it an official race, leaving nine former world
champions with finishes of 22nd or worse. Runners-up Mark Mansfield
and crew Killean Collins of Ireland were 2 minutes 53 seconds behind,
followed by 1990 winner Torben Grael of Brazil. San Francisco's Paul
Cayard, the '88 champion, was delighted with seventh place.</LD>
<TE>   "This is my 11th Worlds," Szabo said. "The first one I was in at

<HD>Ronaldo Dispute Seems to Worsen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The weekend meeting between Florentino Perez, president of European
champion Real Madrid, and Massimo Moratti, president of Inter Milan,
failed to produce a solution to the Ronaldo dilemma.</LD>
<LD>   The Brazilian World Cup winner and two-time FIFA world player of
the year is unhappy with the Italian club and wants to return to
Spain, where he played for Barcelona before joining Inter Milan in
1997.</LD>
<LD>   But Ronaldo, 25, is under contract to Inter for the next four
years--at $6 million a year--and Real Madrid's offer of $48 million
plus a player or two has not been enough to tempt Inter into parting
with the striker.</LD>
<TE>   "Ronaldo is more than 80% certain to stay with Inter," Moratti
told the Italian news agency Ansa on Sunday. " In fact, I would say
100% certain."</TE>
<TE>   Moratti made it clear, however, that he is as dissatisfied with
Ronaldo as Ronaldo is dissatisfied with life in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "Ronaldo would do well to appreciate what he has going for him
here," said Moratti, who has put a $100-million price tag on the
Brazilian.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian trade deadline is not until Aug. 31, so Moratti simply
might be waiting for Real Madrid to improve its offer. His
unfavorable comparison between Ronaldo and Inter's other striker,
Christian Vieri, further underlines the deteriorating situation
between the Brazilian and the club.</TE>
<TE>   "I now appreciate Vieri, with whom I haven't always had a good
relationship, for his attachment to the club and the example that he
has shown to his colleagues," Moratti said.</TE>
<TE>   Italian TV Delay</TE>
<TE>   The start of the Italian season, scheduled for Aug. 31, might be
delayed because of a dispute over television rights, the Italian
Football League said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Almost half the Serie A clubs have been unable to reach agreement
with satellite television channels over the rights to live coverage
of their games. A league spokesman said a decision will be made
Tuesday whether to postpone the start of the season.</TE>
<TE>   French Offended</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United, needing defensive help after center back Wes
Brown broke his ankle in the team's 1-0 Champions League qualifying
loss to Zalaegerszeg of Hungary last week, has succeeded in insulting
the French team from which it is trying to acquire that help.</TE>
<TE>   The English club last month paid a world-record $47 million for
Rio Ferdinand, but has offered Stade Rennes only $3 million for
Julien Escude, the club's France under-21 national team defender.</TE>
<TE>   "The offer that Manchester United has made is almost offensive in
view of what they were capable of paying for Ferdinand," Emmanuel
Cueff, Stade Rennes' president, told L'Equipe Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Uruguayan Keeper</TE>
<TE>   Uruguay national team goalkeeper Fabian Carini has failed to agree
to a move from Juventus of Italy to defending English Premier League
champion Arsenal, and British newspapers speculated Sunday that
Carini might be heading to Manchester United instead.</TE>
<TE>   "The Carini deal is over," Arsenal Coach Arsene Wenger said. "He
has chosen another club. Maybe you will see him somewhere else in the
Premier League."</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal has been seeking a backup to England goalkeeper David
Seaman ever since Richard Wright, tired of being No. 2, left to join
Everton. Manchester United also needs an experienced backup to France
goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, who is injured.</TE>
<TE>   Hooligan President</TE>
<TE>   The strain of watching newly promoted Rilski Sportist Samokov lose
a home game in the Bulgarian first division proved too much for the
club's president, Yuri Galev, who was arrested for alleged
hooliganism.</TE>
<TE>   An interior ministry spokesman said Sunday that Galev had been
"detained for 24 hours as he has been accused of hooliganism" after
verbally threatening match officials.</TE>
<TE>   Deportivo Wins</TE>
<TE>   Goals by Juan Carlos Valeron, Victor and Nourredine Naybet, all in
the first 32 minutes, earned Spanish Cup winner Deportivo La Coruna a
3-0 home victory over Spanish league champion Valencia in the first
match of the two-game Spanish Super Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The second match is in Valencia next Sunday. The Super Cup is the
traditional curtain-raiser to the Spanish season, which begins Aug.
31.</TE>
<TE>   Swiss Fans Riot</TE>
<TE>   Police had to use tear gas and rubber bullets to restore order
after a clash broke out between the fans of rival Swiss teams Basel
and Lucerne.</TE>
<TE>   According to reports, 15 officers were injured in the violence,
which started when hometown Basel fans hurled stones at a bus
carrying Lucerne fans to a Saturday game. Shop windows and a tram
stop received "significant" damage and a kiosk was set ablaze before
order was restored.</TE>

<HD>Sunday Silence Succumbs</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: The 1989 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner
dies of a diseased leg.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Sunday Silence, winner of the first two legs of the 1989 Triple
Crown, died Monday in Japan of complications from a disease in his
left foreleg, his stable's spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   "For the last three days, his condition has been getting worse,
and we used a lot of strong medicines," said Eisuke Tokutake,
spokesman for the Shadai Stallion Station. "But today, he lay down
and couldn't get up."</LD>
<LD>   The 16-year-old horse died of heart failure around 11 a.m. local
time (6 p.m. PDT) on Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan.</LD>
<TE>   The stable said last week it was pondering whether to put the
horse down. Sunday Silence had developed laminitis--a debilitating
disease of the hoof--more than two weeks ago. The stallion's
condition gradually worsened.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Silence was the son of Halo, by Wishing Well. He was taken
to auction both as a yearling and as a 2-year-old, and both times he
was bought back by principal owner Arthur Hancock after bidders
didn't meet his minimum price.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Silence won nine races in 14 career starts, earning
$4,968,554. He was inducted into horse racing's Hall of Fame in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the perfect example of an ugly duckling that turns into a
swan with age," Hancock said. "Like the skinny teenager that develops
into a big strong athlete, some horses are just a little late in
maturing."</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Sunday Silence's battles with Easy Goer during his Triple
Crown chase stirred memories of Affirmed's duels with Alydar a decade
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Silence was chosen 3-year-old champion and horse of the
year in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1990, the horse was sold to Shadai Farm in Japan and was
the country's champion sire from 1994 to 2000. During that span, his
progeny produced 457 winners, 43 in stakes races.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>Some Differences Arise Over Camp</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although the logistics of moving training camp from Westwood to
Thousand Oaks were a challenge, training at Cal Lutheran did not add
significant costs for the Bruins.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA is paying Cal Lutheran about $60,000 for use of two practice
fields, dormitories and meals for eight days. The Bruin football
program has paid UCLA a similar sum in previous years for the same
services.</LD>
<LD>   "It's pretty much a wash," said Randy Taylor, director of football
operations.</LD>
<TE>   The windfall for Cal Lutheran, an NCAA Division III program, is
substantial, although Kingsmen football coaches were miffed at not
being informed by university officials about the arrangement with
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Lutheran begins training camp Sunday, one day after the Bruins
leave, and the coaches are concerned about the wear and tear on the
practice fields. Also, the cash paid by UCLA is not necessarily
earmarked for the Kingsmen football program.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA coaches and officials hope the differences are resolved. They
would like to return to Cal Lutheran for at least one more year
because renovations on the locker rooms and other facilities at the
Acosta Center are scheduled to take place next summer and fall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wait or weight, it all spelled frustration for Pat Norton the last
two years.</TE>
<TE>   The fullback from Newhall Hart High redshirted in 2000 and played
behind seniors Matt Stanley and Ed Ieremia-Stansbury last season,
making fewer carries (five) than mental mistakes (more than can be
counted on one hand).</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he plummeted from an ungainly 290 pounds to 230 while
redshirting, then inched back to 245 last season after feeling weak.</TE>
<TE>   Now he is up to 260 pounds, which feels just right. So does his
role, which is primarily to open holes for tailbacks Akil Harris and
Manuel White.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a great spring, I'm at my prime weight, I'm healthy and,
most of all, I'm learning the plays," Norton said.</TE>
<TE>   During his infrequent appearances last season, he was so intent on
making a strong impression that he would often ignore his assignment
and hit the first defender he saw.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd get excited, forget the play and just hit people," he said.
"Now I've calmed down."</TE>
<TE>   He also feels comfortable in the huddle because he has earned the
respect of quarterback Cory Paus and offensive coordinator Kelly
Skipper.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easier to talk to Coach Skipper because now I actually know
what I'm talking about with him," Norton said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Training at Cal Lutheran brings back childhood memories for
receiver Ryan Smith and tight end Mike Seidman. But they are memories
of the blacktop and hardwood, not the gridiron.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who grew up in Thousand Oaks before moving to Texas at 15,
and Seidman, who is from nearby Westlake Village, were teammates in
three-on-three basketball tournaments at Cal Lutheran as eighth
graders.</TE>
<TE>   The third member of their team, Kevin Howard, also blossomed in a
sport other than basketball, starring as a third baseman at Miami the
last three years before signing with the Cincinnati Reds this summer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ken Pritchett, a fifth-year senior from Crescenta Valley High, has
left the team. Pritchett had eight carries for 34 yards and had one
reception in his career.</TE>

<HD>Cassel Gets Some Good News</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC reserve quarterback Matt Cassel received positive news Sunday
when he learned immediate surgery would not be required for a knee
injury he suffered in a scrimmage the day before.</LD>
<LD>   Cassel, a redshirt sophomore battling redshirt freshman Matt
Leinart to become Carson Palmer's backup, chipped a bone under his
right kneecap when knocked to the ground while throwing a pass
Saturday. After reviewing results of an MRI exam with team physician
James Tibone Sunday, Cassel said he could return in a week if
swelling subsides.</LD>
<LD>   "They said I might have some pain here and there," Cassel said.
"If worse comes to worst, maybe surgery after the season."</LD>
<TE>   Cassel will wear a brace when he returns but he said that beats
surgery and missing four to six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big relief," he said. "I was expecting the worst and it
turned out better than I thought."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior Malaefou MacKenzie and freshman Hershel Dennis are the only
available tailbacks for today's scrimmage at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Seniors Justin Fargas and Sultan McCullough and sophomore Darryl
Poston are nursing hamstring injuries.</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie, plagued by injuries throughout his career, is thrilled
to be healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of ironic that everybody else is hurt and I'm one of
the only ones standing," MacKenzie said. "It feels weird."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Safety Troy Polamalu, who suffered a mild concussion Thursday,
participated in non-contact drills for the first time since the
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Pete Carroll said Polamalu would not participate in the
scrimmage. Neither will fullback Chad Pierson (hamstring), cornerback
Kevin Arbet (ankle), receiver D. Hale (ankle) or defensive lineman
Daniel Urquhart (neck), Carroll said. Receiver Kareem Kelly
(hamstring) also might sit out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior Nate Steinbacher, a reserve offensive lineman the last two
seasons, and freshman tight end Dominique Byrd were moved to the
defensive line to provide depth because of Urquhart's injury and
Bernard Riley's comeback from major knee surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbacher has not played defense since his junior season at
Anaheim Esperanza High, but he jumped at the opportunity to move
across the line and was embraced by his new group.</TE>
<TE>   "It was welcome to the dark side," he said. "I felt like Anakin
Skywalker, like I was becoming Darth Vader.... I think I'll enjoy
tackling people. Now I can hold all I want."</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, from Minneapolis, played middle linebacker and wide receiver
in high school. He dropped two passes in Saturday's scrimmage, but
Carroll said he could return to tight end in the future.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Short kickoffs plagued the Trojans last season and Ryan Killeen
was recruited from Mt. San Antonio College to correct the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Killeen got an opportunity to show his talent Sunday morning
during a light practice that featured special teams work.</TE>
<TE>   Killeen kicked several balls into end zone, but finished with one
that landed at the seven-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little shaky, trying too hard to do it for the coaches
instead of for myself and doing what I know I need to do," Killeen
said. "I just need to let it rip."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior guard Zach Wilson, recovering from a strained left foot,
said he will return to practice a week from today.... Junior
cornerback Marcell Allmond will remain hospitalized for a few more
days because of an infection.</TE>

<HD>Comets Need Two Overtimes to Prevail</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With her team one loss from WNBA playoff elimination, Sheryl Swoopes
said she never felt as if the Houston Comets were out of the game.</LD>
<LD>   It took two overtimes Sunday, but she made sure she was right,
recording 28 points and six steals in an 83-77 victory over the Utah
Starzz before 9,241 at Houston. It evened the Western Conference
best-of-three semifinal series at one game each.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been in this position before, and we know what it takes to
come back," said Swoopes, who received the
defensive-player-of-the-year award at the game.</LD>
<TE>   The teams were tied, 65-65, at the end of regulation play and,
73-73, at the end of the first overtime. In the second overtime,
Janeth Arcain, who had 17 points, got the opening tip and made an
18-foot shot that began a 9-0 run.</TE>
<TE>   Swoopes had cramps in her calves with 10:23 left in regulation.
She left the court but returned to push Houston into overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "I was lots concerned," Comet Coach Van Chancellor said. "I kept
walking to the end of the bench and I couldn't find her. But let's
give Utah credit. They put a giant in the middle, and she was
blocking shots."</TE>
<TE>   Margo Dydek, Utah's 7-foot-2 center, had 16 points and 12
rebounds. The Starzz had a 60-54 advantage with 4:30 to play and
retained the lead until Arcain's jump shot with 23 seconds left tied
it, 65-65. Utah played for the final shot of regulation, but Marie
Ferdinand, who had 22 points, was blocked near the basket. Houston
didn't get a shot in the closing seconds.</TE>
<TE>   New York 84, Indiana 65--Tamika Whitmore scored 24 points and the
Liberty made 59% of its shots, including five of 10 three-point
attempts, to even the Eastern Conference semifinal series at one game
apiece before 10,988 at Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Tamika Catchings led Indiana with 20 points but had only two field
goals after halftime.</TE>
