<HD>The Lost World</HD>
<DH>BILLANCOURT TALES , By Nina Berberova, Translated from the
Russian by Marian Schwartz, New Directions: 176 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FRANK</AU>
<BD>Michael Frank is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The story of Nina Berberova's career has all the earmarks of a
literary fable that might have been written by Henry James or her
compatriot Vladimir Nabokov or even by Berberova herself, although it
never was. Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, in 1901, Berberova spent
all of her writing life in exile, separated from her family, her
point of origin and her principal audience. She began to write
fiction in the early 1920s after she emigrated to Paris and gave up
writing it in the early 1950s, when she moved to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   In the course of her long life, she was impoverished, productive,
fleetingly popular among a certain limited readership, neglected,
forgotten and, before she died in 1993, rediscovered, first in Paris,
then (after glasnost) in Russia and finally--and still--in America.
The moral of the fable: Good writing should--will, when the stars are
in correct alignment--assume its rightful portion of inches on the
world's bookshelf even if it takes many decades to do so.</LD>
<TE>   In such novels and novellas as "The Ladies of St. Petersburg,"
"The Tattered Cloak" and "A Book of Happiness," the reader finds
Berberova's astute fictional eye turned on Russian men and women
whose lives are shaken up by the events of the revolution. Her
narratives tend to sweep widely across time and place. Her characters
experience themselves in a familiar Russo-literary tradition of
introspection and impassioned self-regard. They are often restless,
soulful, troubled and groping; they seek, but seldom find, happiness
or perfect love; they strive for but rarely achieve great
professional success. They are empathically drawn, incisively mulled
over and occasionally rather summarily cast into the hands of fate.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery at the heart of the Berberova fable is this: Why, when
she so clearly had a knack for stories, did she give up writing them
when she came to the United States in the early '50s?</TE>
<TE>   The answer may lie in the issue of displacement that Berberova
takes up so sympathetically in "Billancourt Tales," a collection of
13 stories that, by any logical chronology, should have been her
first book. These stories are a sampling of the dozens that Berberova
wrote between 1928 and 1940 for the Latest News, one of several
emigre newspapers that then appeared in France and served the
substantial population of exiled Russians.</TE>
<TE>   They are the rough equivalent, in Berberova's career, of Anton
Chekhov's early comedic newspaper sketches, but to identify them as
the work of apprenticeship is in no way to call them uninteresting.
In "Billancourt Tales" the reader watches as Berberova's fictional
intelligence begins to take shape and acquire color. She finds her
voice (in this case unified by the generally omniscient male narrator
Grisha), her subject matter (the working-class, largely male Russian
emigre community of Billancourt, whose central employer, the Renault
factory, hired them to replace the French workers destroyed by World
War I) and her themes, which perhaps inevitably center on the
tensions and longings of lives led in exile.</TE>
<TE>   In her autobiography Berberova described these Billancourt pieces
as a "lyrico-ironical series of stories about Billancourt-Russian
indigents, drunks, patresfamilias, Renault workers, courtyard
singers, [and] declasse eccentrics" and reported how, as they
appeared, shopkeepers would slip jars of preserves into her bag and
shoemakers would resole her shoes gratis and the local hairdresser
refused her tip, explaining, "We read your stories, we are very
grateful to you, you do not scorn our way of life."</TE>
<TE>   Gratitude for a lack of scorn: There is something very moving in
the phenomenon of a writer finding a community of displaced people,
drawing their portraits and giving them a voice--in effect ensuring
them a place in the most powerful container of memory there is, which
is to say, literature.</TE>
<TE>   And so here they are: men and women saddened--but, pointedly, not
possessed--by their lost Russia, scrambling to build new Russo-French
lives in French suburbia, questing for success, comfort, pleasure and
love, and naturally finding little of each. There is Ivan Ivanovich
Kondurin, a ballroom pianist in the time of the czar who (in "An
Incident With Music") gives up his work as a bookkeeper to play in a
silent movie theater but is suddenly jobless when the talkies come
along and he is "caught by history once again." There is Anastasia
Georgievna Seyantseva, a mysterious longtime habitue of Billancourt
who (in "The Little Stranger") receives an unexpected legacy: custody
of her niece. And there is Grisha's uncle, the loveless Ivan
Pavlovich, a Renault worker who (in "The Argentine") seeks company
for his "empty, orphaned" home and heart but takes too long to
overcome his aversion to his companion's disreputable past (she is
pregnant with another man's baby) and loses her forever.</TE>
<TE>   Loss is at the heart of Berberova's Billancourt world--loss of
homeland, history, love, hope--just as it seems to have been, at
times, in her own life, where a different kind of loss may help
explain why she stopped writing stories when she did. Berberova's
coherent community of exiles unraveled after World War II. Displaced
once again, and in more ways than one, Berberova lost her subject
matter, her regular form of publication and her readership.
Determined as ever, though, she moved on--to nonfiction, to teaching,
to her new American life. Sadly for her readers, Berberova's
story-making impulse stayed behind, in France, in her past. But we
are lucky too: We have these "new" stories, and for the lives they
commemorate and the particular time and place they so keenly
preserve, we cherish them.</TE>

<DH>FINGERSMITH, A Novel, By Sarah Waters, Riverhead Books: 516
pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIGITTE FRASE</AU>
<BD>Brigitte Frase is critic at large for Ruminator Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What a deliciously brazen stunt Sarah Waters pulls off in this
romantic thriller set in Victorian times. Quite a fingersmith herself
(that's a pickpocket), she steals with abandon from Dickens, plucks
cliches from every Gothic romance ever perpetrated in the early 19th
century, yet keeps us in thrall to her first-rate pastiche of
betrayed maidens and dastardly smiling villains.</LD>
<LD>   The first section of "Finger- smith" is narrated by 17-year-old
Sue, an orphan adopted into a den of thieves in a London ghetto. The
rest of the family is composed of Mr. Ibbs, Mrs. Sucksby, the
evil-tempered delinquent John Vroom and the sweet dimwitted young
woman Dainty. Sue and John are fingersmiths, Mr. Ibbs a fence and
Mrs. Sucksby, who would be comfortably and honorably at home in any
Dickens book, augments the household income by farming babies. There
are always half a dozen or so about, illegitimate or unwanted infants
she is paid to keep for a while. Only Sue, for mysterious reasons,
was never sold or given away, though she's been told her mother was
hanged as a thief.</LD>
<TE>   One blustery night, another member of the tribe appears, in high
melodramatic style, "dressed dark, wet through and dripping, and with
a leather bag at his feet. The dim light showed his pale cheeks, his
whiskers, but his eyes were quite in the shadow of his hat." This is
Richard Rivers, a suave confidence man whom the family calls
"Gentleman."</TE>
<TE>   Having nearly succeeded three times in marrying an heiress, he's
hatched a new campaign for which he needs Sue's help. He has been
hired by a reclusive scholar to help mount some illustrations for an
enormous dictionary he's compiling. Mr. Lilly's only companion is his
niece and secretary, Maud, who is in want of a maid. Maud will
inherit a fortune, but only if she marries, an unlikely prospect
given her enforced solitude.</TE>
<TE>   Gentleman, who is "handsome as a plum," has a foolproof plan to
carry away the girl and her money; Sue, as the new maid, is to help
him persuade Maud to elope with him. They will then have the
ingenuous bride committed to an asylum, where her own mother died,
and take all her inheritance.</TE>
<TE>   This is as much plot as I can divulge and, believe me, I've only
skimmed the surface. The novel is constructed with secret
compartments, Chinese box within Chinese box, each darker than the
one before. None of the characters is telling the truth, though only
one unwittingly leads us astray: "We were thinking of secrets. Real
secrets, and snide. Too many to count. When I try to sort out who
knew what and who knew nothing, who knew everything and who was a
fraud, I have to stop and give it up, it makes my head spin."</TE>
<TE>   Suffice it to say, Sue, Maud and Gentleman are soon embarked on
their courtship dance in a decaying mansion in a dreary, rain-soaked
landscape. Sue's narrative ends as Maud is escorted to the living
burial that Gentleman has plotted for her.</TE>
<TE>   The second part begins again with Sue's arrival at the Lilly
house, this time from Maud's point of view. It is a tour de force as
every incident Sue described takes on an entirely different and
uglier meaning.</TE>
<TE>   We learn more about Maud's work for her creepy and sadistic uncle
and about her relationship with Gentleman. Pay attention when Maud
tells Sue the dictionary has reached the letter F; it's a little joke
Waters plays on Sue and on the reader.</TE>
<TE>   When Sue takes up the narration again in the third part, the plots
and motives get murkier still, sadder too. The story careens into a
lurid climax, the only time the writer's control of her plot devices
slips and turns cartoon-like. But the novel is for the most part a
smart and seductive enchantment, in large measure because of the
female characters. The men are cardboard villains, but Mrs. Sucksby,
the housekeeper Mrs. Stiles and, of course, Sue and Maud are rich
creations.</TE>
<TE>   Waters' earlier novels, "Tipping the Velvet" and "Affinity," are
supple and psychologically nuanced lesbian romances. The erotic
charge between Maud and Sue and the psychological games they play
make "Fingersmith" a sophisticated treat, like fine bittersweet
chocolate.</TE>

<DH>THE JOHN FANTE READER, Edited by Stephen Cooper, William
Morrow: 336 pp., $25.95 MOOCH, By Dan Fante, Canongate Books: 240
pp., $13 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to Book Review,
is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at God: The
Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Fante is one of those tragic figures of arts and letters whose
best work was coldly and cruelly overlooked in his own lifetime, only
to be "discovered" and celebrated long after his death. When Fante
died at 74 in 1983, he had earned a bed in the Motion Picture and
Television Hospital in Woodland Hills by reason of his work as a
journeyman screenwriter in the old studio system--"the most
disgusting job in Christ's kingdom," he once called it. But he also
left behind a collection of novels and short stories so accomplished
and so stirring that he is now compared favorably with Henry Miller
and Ernest Hemingway.</LD>
<LD>   "John Fante could not have known that less than two decades later
he would be regarded as an important figure in 20th century
literature," writes Fante's biographer, Stephen Cooper, in his
preface to "The John Fante Reader," "nor that he would also be
recognized internationally for his influence on younger generations
of writers."</LD>
<TE>   Much of Fante's best-loved work is still in print, including such
early novels as "Wait Until Spring, Bandini" (first published in
1938) and "Ask the Dust" (1939) and later efforts like "The
Brotherhood of the Grape" (1977), published by Black Sparrow Press,
the house that first resurrected his writing in the 1980s. "The John
Fante Reader" features excerpts from many of Fante's most famous
books, but Cooper also includes fragments of less-celebrated stories
and unpublished letters, thus demonstrating to new readers exactly
why Fante has come to be so highly regarded.</TE>
<TE>   The magic begins with the very first selection in "The John Fante
Reader," "A Kidnaping in the Family," a short story from "The Wine of
Youth" (1983), in which the narrator describes how, as an adolescent,
he fell in love with a photograph of his mother that he found in a
locked trunk. He barely recognizes the beautiful young woman in the
snapshot as his aging and careworn mother, and he is lifted out of
the tawdriness of their real lives by the visions that the photograph
inspires.</TE>
<TE>   "I would stare at that strange picture, kissing it and crying over
it, happy because it had once been true," he writes. "And I remember
an afternoon when I took it down to the creek bank, set it upon a
stone and prayed to it."</TE>
<TE>   The most telling moment in the story comes when the young narrator
interrogates his mother on how she came to marry his father. She
gives him the hard facts of life and love in a poor Italian American
family at the turn of the last century, but he is sizzling with the
Oedipal urge--"I searched my catechism and prayer book for a law
which stated that mothers could not marry their sons"--and he
succeeds in enlisting his mother in conjuring up a rich and
provocative fantasy that would invalidate his father's claim on her
as her rightful husband:</TE>
<TE>   "'Didn't he do anything to you? Didn't he kidnap you, or
something?'</TE>
<TE>   "'I don't remember being kidnaped.'</TE>
<TE>   "'But you were kidnaped!'</TE>
<TE>   "'Yes!' she said. 'He did kidnap me! He came one night when I was
asleep and took me away.'</TE>
<TE>   "'Yes,' I said. 'Yes!'"</TE>
<TE>   The same clash of reality and fantasy, the same delicate interplay
between one's deepest longings and one's mundane circumstances, can
be traced throughout Fante's life and work as it is reflected in
Cooper's anthology. Set mostly in Southern California, and spanning a
period from the Depression to the early 1980s, the writing collected
in "The John Fante Reader" allows us to see the world through the
eyes of a man who was wholly free of sentiment and self-deception and
yet who was fascinated by his own origins and afire with his own
passions. "On Nietzsche's anniversary, which is my Christmas, I
always get stewed," he wrote to H.L. Mencken in 1932. "I would rather
write than anything else."</TE>
<TE>   A professor of English and film at Cal State Long Beach, Cooper
has already distinguished himself as Fante's anthologist ("The Big
Hunger: Stories 1932-1959" by John Fante) and biographer ("Full of
Life"). But, other than his artful selection of illuminating passages
from Fante's work, his own scholarship is mostly absent from "The
John Fante Reader," in which Cooper pays Fante the compliment of
letting him speak for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "You're nothing but a boy who's read too many books," says his
mother in an excerpt from "The Road to Los Angeles" (1985). But "The
John Fante Reader" allows us to see how the written word was, quite
literally, his own salvation: "When I was a boy I had prayed to St.
Teresa for a new fountain pen," Fante writes in "Ask the Dust." "My
prayer was answered."</TE>
<TE>   Every review of a book by Dan Fante seems to note that he is the
son of John Fante, and this one is no different. After all, Dan
Fante's first novel, "Chump Change," depicts a crisis in the life of
a man, dubbed Bruno Dante, whose father is a gifted but
long-neglected writer. And now Dan Fante brings Bruno back in
"Mooch," a novel in which the character's mid-life crisis deepens
into a sexual catastrophe that threatens to swallow him alive.</TE>
<TE>   "Jonathan Dante, my father, had been dead for eleven months,"
announces Bruno at the outset of the novel. "He died broke,
brokenhearted, collecting a stinking Writers Guild Pension and $762 a
month in Social Security. A forgotten screenwriter. I had returned to
L.A. from New York City to watch him die."</TE>
<TE>   Now Bruno is reduced to making a living by hawking computer
supplies over the phone in a telemarketing operation in which a
prospective customer is called a "mooch" and each paycheck depends on
how many cold calls result in sales. But his day job is only the
battleground from where he sallies forth to confront his real
demons--his struggle with alcoholism, his failed aspirations as a
writer and his tormenting love affair with a beguiling young woman
called Jimmi: "Half Mexican, half Iranian, twenty-six, beautiful and
street smart, from the Pacoima projects."</TE>
<TE>   "I knew why I loved this woman," Bruno declares. "She was like my
dead father, at war against her own life and time. Ten thousand
disappointments would kill her as they had killed him."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Fante allows us to glimpse a Southern California demimonde
that surely escaped his father's attention--the distinct and often
disturbing subcultures of the strip club, the porno video arcade, the
"sober-living" house where Bruno is stashed by his sponsor at
Alcoholics Anonymous and the cheap motel on Sepulveda Boulevard where
he holes up when he goes on a binge. "Mooch" is always intense and
harrowing, occasionally titillating and sometimes even funny, but
only rarely and grudgingly does Fante give us a moment of redemption.</TE>
<TE>   "My real difficulty--my problem--wasn't my depressions or my
drinking or my job failures or even the unarticulated fear that I was
[an] ... insane whack," confesses Bruno. "My problem was people. And
they were located everywhere."</TE>

<DH>MEDIA UNLIMITED: How the Torrent of Images and  Sounds
Overwhelms Our Lives, By Todd Gitlin, Metropolitan Books:  262 pp.,

<DL></DL>
<LD>Marshall McLuhan once said that whoever discovered water wasn't a
fish. It's hard to put the mass media in perspective; most of us,
most of the time, are fish in the media ocean. But it's not
impossible to be amphibious and see our information society as a
sometimes oppressive torrent of words and images, flowing through a
variety of media that entertain and inform us, while variously
distorting, compressing, magnifying, ignoring and counterfeiting
different aspects of social reality.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, this age of Really Big Media also happens to be one of
great media theory and criticism. If the eccentric McLuhan has faded
away, Todd Gitlin and several of his colleagues at New York
University decidedly have not.</LD>
<LD>   Gitlin's "Media Unlimited" isn't the first attempt to make overall
sense of what he calls the "media torrent": television, radio, film,
video, music, print media, the Internet--the whole shebang. Guy
Debord's "Society of the Spectacle" and David Shenk's "Data Smog" are
among its precursors. There are also faint echoes here of the
economist and social theorist Thorstein Veblen; and Gitlin resurrects
an early-20th century German thinker, Georg Simmel, in tracing the
"all-engulfing spectacle" to the 19th century. That history is a key
contribution of this book.</LD>
<TE>   Gitlin's goal is "to grasp the totality of the media," which might
imply common properties, underlying patterns, systemic relationships.
It originates in a web of supply and demand, involving modern
capitalism, available technology and human desires, especially the
modern desire for what Gitlin calls "disposable feelings," and the
quick and transient (and thus self-perpetuating) pleasures of drama,
emotion and connection.</TE>
<TE>   After exploring the sources of the media torrent, Gitlin
identifies various coping styles. The "fan" selectively
over-identifies with media icons; the "content critic," on the other
hand, "[b]eholding the media flux ... tries to keep a certain
distance from the foam to avoid a soaking" but assumes that "if the
content were only improved, so would the world be." Other responses
include the "paranoid," the "exhibitionist" (an eager participant),
the "ironist" (knowing but not overly subversive), the "jammer," the
"secessionist" and the "abolitionist." All are useful constructs;
there is a bit of most of them in most of us. The author is something
of an ironist.</TE>
<TE>   "Media Unlimited" doesn't arrive at any unified-field explanation
for the media torrent. Gitlin seems reluctant to follow the
traditional explanatory path of the left: to follow the money. Greed
may fuel the speed and plenitude of the media, but the torrent's
synergy, he suggests, transcends profit. Capitalism and modern
technology don't simply mold us, they confront and accommodate us.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone looking for a philosopher's stone of the media totality
will be disappointed here. But in the search for that totality,
Gitlin provides an excellent overview and many arresting insights and
sidelights. He notes, for example, that "best-seller sentences have
gotten briefer, simpler, and closer to screenplays." English, he
argues, is "the most torrential language." And among many
cross-references that link various media and genres, he observes that
"[t]he TV series 'Sixty Minutes' and its investigative offshoots are
the Westerns of journalism: every week, the good guy breezes into
town ... uncovers evil, and defends the community." Even the most
tawdry media frenzies, such as the ones involving O.J. Simpson,
Monica Lewinsky and Chandra Levy, have a redeeming edge, as ways in
which the country "confront[s] its major social and cultural
conflicts."</TE>
<TE>   Quibbles inevitably arise. Gitlin cites evidence that media
violence makes already aggressive young people more aggressive; but
elsewhere he minimizes the media's responsibility, saying we should
focus on guns instead. Could we not, by a similar logic, ignore guns
and focus on bullets? Powerful and pervasive as the media are, how
can they not affect gun use, gun control and criminal justice as a
whole?</TE>
<TE>   Gitlin seems averse to the notion of media effects on behavior and
even vacillates between a horror of the media torrent and a
contrarian embrace of it. Granted, research on media effects is
something of a quagmire, which has consumed careers and filled many
recondite learned journals with little, pardon the expression,
effect. Yet effects there must be. Larger questions remain. Are the
media essential to modern capitalism? How has the media's gigantic
yet shadowy footprint affected gender, faith, family, the arts? Is it
why, in Robert Putnam's phrase, we "bowl alone"? Is there a dark
corner of our society that television or the Internet has not somehow
influenced? And where is it all going?</TE>
<TE>   The media's virtual saturation of politics is a subject that has
spawned a light industry, including Gitlin's "The Whole World Is
Watching" about the left and the 1960s. Here, he observes some ways
in which media skew to the right but adds that "skew ... is the least
of the media's political impacts. The bigger story is demobilization.
The ceaseless quest for disposable feeling and pleasure hollows out
public life altogether."</TE>
<TE>   I found myself both marveling at, and partly concurring in,
Gitlin's sanguine assessment of the role of American popular culture
in the world at large. Images of mediocrity to some Americans are
images of subversion, energy, freedom and innocent pleasure
elsewhere. There is an innocuous quality in Hollywood's fixation with
pleasing and teasing, and so maximizing, its audiences: a devotion to
distraction, stimulation and "packaged innocence." Besides, people
like it; no one forces the Danes to watch "Dallas." But what of the
languages and cultures that are dying out? In embracing the media's
messy, torrential totality, Gitlin also embraces uncertainty and
complexity. If "Media Unlimited" doesn't entirely relocate that
unifying idea, it covers vast reaches of largely familiar terrain
with exceptional skill and daring. Such is the scope of the media in
modern life, that rather than grasp for simple answers, "Media
Unlimited" invites us to follow the poet Rilke's advice and "love the
questions."</TE>

<HD>Park Bond Measure Makes Sense for O.C.</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Yes on Proposition 40," Editorial, Feb. 20:</LD>
<LD>   The California Clean Water, Clean Air, Safe Neighborhood Parks,
and Coastal Protection Act on Tuesday's ballot provides a minimum of
$13.87 million for Orange County. Each city is guaranteed funding
based on needs and population. The bonds will provide funds for clean
water, clean air and the state parks and conservancies that we can
visit throughout the state.</LD>
<LD>   There is a long line of needed projects in many communities.
Californians have passed only one park bond act in the past 12 years,
while adding more than 5 million people since 1988. In the last park
bond act, Newport Bay received $12 million for an important project.
We must continue our investment in preserving and restoring our
natural and cultural heritage.</LD>
<TE>   Proposition 40 already has the endorsement of 12 cities in Orange
County, the Orange County Harbors Beaches and Parks Commission, and
many environmental, business, historical and veteran groups
(www.voteyeson40.org lists all current endorsements).</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 40 is fiscally sound. The level of the state's debt
payments is lower today than it was in the mid-1990s. The costs of
financing bonds are lower than at any other time in recent history.
According to the state treasurer's office, approval would finance
bonds over a long period, increase the debt ratio only slightly, and
is well within California's debt capacity.</TE>

<HD>Coad's Race May Shape El Toro--and More</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When voters go to the polls Tuesday, they'll be electing an Orange
County Board of Supervisors member who will have more on his or her
plate than decisions about the reuse of the vacated El Toro Marine
Corps Air Station. Our 4th District supervisor will have to work
effectively with four others on nitty-gritty, day-to-day county
business matters, as well as issues with long-term consequences.</LD>
<LD>   I may not agree with Cynthia P. Coad on every position she has
taken in her first four-year term on the board. But although we have
had opposite views on the airport issue, I have admired her
combination of business acumen and the way she has brought to bear on
county social issues the insights gained during her careers in
rehabilitation and education, her service as a college district
trustee and her work with numerous community groups.</LD>
<TE>   After years of observing local officials, I have concluded that no
matter how independent and how committed to principle an individual
seems, nothing much appears to happen unless he or she is skilled at
winning others to a viewpoint and in working out mutually acceptable
solutions. Several years ago, voters in the 2nd District resisted the
attempts of anti-airport activists to influence the election of a
supervisor through large infusions of campaign money. I hope 4th
District voters will keep their eyes on the bigger picture Tuesday
and not be blinded by out-of-town money or focused only on the single
issue of the proposed airport.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We need two more people like Chris Norby to replace the trio of
Chuck Smith, Jim Silva and Coad. Coad is up for reelection. After
eight years and $50 million poorer, we are finally getting to the
finish line at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   The irresponsibility of squandering so much money for their pet
project is unheard of. The memory of the Orange County bankruptcy is
still on our minds. The state-of-the-art airport, with the costly
security equipment, personnel, the necessity to widen the congested
freeways near El Toro, will make the price tag exorbitant.</TE>
<TE>   Then there will be many days when the airport must shut down
because of wind conditions. It all points to one question: Who needs
it? This expenditure may put all of us at financial risk. Airline
tickets and parking will be more expensive than at other established
airports. Will the public pay the difference?</TE>
<TE>   The toll roads are a good example of how people react. Behind
Measure W are responsible people. The pay-as-you-go (build) plan to
develop the park puts no one at financial risk.</TE>

<HD>Measure V: Local Control vs. Expediency</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Not So Fast on Measure V," Editorial, Feb. 24:</LD>
<LD>   Your analysis of Measure V was woefully shortsighted and
politically indefensible. You prefer to expound upon Treasurer-Tax
Collector John M.W. Moorlach's dismissive position that Measure V is
nothing more than an exercise in political expediency. For some
reason, you mention in only cursory fashion the reason it was
advanced by a majority of the Board of Supervisors. That is, people
in this county should not tolerate someone from Sacramento picking
their board member when such issues as an airport, roads and revenue
enhancements all involve heated debate. The only way to provide
citizens the right to vote is by changing the county to a charter
government.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, you think the solution to the problem should be dealt
with as part of a larger or thought-out charter initiative. You
ignore the fact that there were five public forums, and Supervisor
Todd Spitzer did what every elected official should do: provide
constituents a greater voice given that he may leave midterm. Did you
ever think that the only issue on the table is providing and
protecting for 3rd District residents the right to vote? You further
ignore the dismal performance of Measure T, which was the last
charter initiative you apparently want to resurrect. It was packaged
for the public with such a mixed bag of ideas that it was impossible
to please everyone. Instead, what is more politically feasible and
just plain prudent is building a charter county slowly.</TE>
<TE>   Vote "yes" on Measure V.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Mullen</TE>
<TE>   Citizens for Local Control</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Measure V allows the citizens of Orange County to vote to fill a
vacancy on the Board of Supervisors, nothing more and nothing less.
You complain that it does too much. It creates a charter county. You
also complain that it does too little. It does not include all the
provisions of a charter.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County had a comprehensive charter proposal that voters
rejected in 1996. The criticism was that it included too much.</TE>
<TE>   The critics say Measure V is too little, too much. I say Measure V
is just right. Let the voters decide.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Whipple</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is unfortunate that a good measure is being "spun" as
politically expedient. Measure V offers our community the right of a
special election when a vacancy occurs on the Board of Supervisors.
In order to do that, it is my understanding that the county must
change to a charter county. I am in full support of individual's
rights to vote to fill vacancies when they occur.</TE>
<TE>   It is our fundamental right as citizens to choose our own
representatives, and it is wholly inappropriate in a county this size
that political appointments be made in Sacramento. Let's stop
spinning the issue for once and let each community elect its own
representative. Vote "yes" on Measure V.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is in the best interest of the county that we maintain local
control, and Measure V begins the process with one critical issue,
the right of citizens to elect their supervisors. If there is a
vacancy, people can become voiceless if the governor drags his feet
in filling it. That is unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   The best path to a charter county is by a careful, step-by-step
process until all citizen, business and political groups come to a
consensus on policies or reforms. Let's retain self-determination for
Orange County, and Measure V begins the process.</TE>

Americans and Selected Nonfiction, Edited by Susan Shillinglaw and
Jackson J. Benson, Viking: 430 pp., $27.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAY PARINI</AU>
<BD>Jay Parini is the author of numerous books, including
"John Steinbeck: A Biography" and the forthcoming novel "The
Apprentice Lover." He teaches at Middlebury College in Middlebury,
Vt.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been a 100 years since John Steinbeck came into the world and
more than three decades since he died, but his presence on the
landscape of American literature has not dimmed. The reason for this,
of course, is that his books continue to draw readers: what Gore
Vidal called "voluntary readers" who come to the printed page for
sustenance of a particular kind. They migrate to Steinbeck because he
entertains, enthralls, challenges and inspires them.</LD>
<LD>   In his day, Steinbeck lined up well behind Faulkner and Hemingway,
the American masters of modernism. This was, in part, because he was
accessible in a way those writers never were, and this diminished him
in the eyes of some academic critics. For decades, he has been a
writer for junior high school, where "Of Mice and Men" remains a
staple. High school students have traditionally been assigned his
masterpiece, "The Grapes of Wrath," the epic story of the Joads as
the family makes its way from the Oklahoma Dustbowl to California's
imagined Eden. Few novels are more central to the construction of
American experience. Tom Joad, the novel's hero, is an idealized
version of the American man. His broad sympathies and
perseverance--he's a bundle of good, rugged values--appeal to a vast
audience. The novel continues to attract a readership around the
world, and it will always do so.</LD>
<TE>   Steinbeck may never sit easily on a college syllabus because he
does not present a kind of textual complexity that lends itself to
critical interpretation or exegesis, but his position in the American
pantheon seems firm--a testament to his readerly-friendliness and to
the quality of the work itself, which is better and more varied than
many academic critics want to acknowledge. This range is evident in
two recent publications timed to coincide with the centenary of his
birth. The Library of America has just issued its third volume of
Steinbeck fiction. It includes all of the major work of the decade
1942-1952, beginning with a slight wartime novella, "The Moon Is
Down," and working through "Cannery Row" (1945), one of his most
enduring novels; and "The Pearl" (1947), a somewhat cloying novella
that nevertheless appeals to eighth-graders in a big way; and
concludes with "East of Eden," another masterpiece, albeit a flawed
one.</TE>
<TE>   This volume alone explodes the commonly held notion that Steinbeck
never did anything of value after "The Grapes of Wrath," which was
published in 1939. In "Cannery Row," Steinbeck's wry genius is
apparent on every page, beginning with its famous opening paragraph,
in which all of Steinbeck's distinctive qualities as a writer are on
display: "Cannery Row in Monterey in California is a poem, a stink, a
grating noise, a quality of light, a tone, a habit, a nostalgia, a
dream. Cannery Row is the gathered and scattered, tin and iron and
rust and splintered wood, chipped pavement and weedy lots and junk
heaps, sardine canneries of corrugated iron, honky tonks, restaurants
and whore houses, and little crowded groceries, and laboratories and
flophouses." Readers in search of whimsical, poetic and deeply felt
evocations of the American West--its land and its people--will find
them abundantly in these pages.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more surprising is the new selection of Steinbeck
journalism--much of it long out of print--gathered for his centenary
by Susan Shillinglaw and Jackson J. Benson. "America and Americans
and Selected Nonfiction" presents a feast of good reading, and it
reminds us that once upon a time readers expected important writers
of fiction to be journalists as well. Steinbeck was, in fact, a born
reporter, and he brought the same quality of attention to language
that is characteristic of his fiction to casual pieces of reportage
for Collier's and Holiday and Newsday, a point this collection makes
obvious. Steinbeck wrote vividly about places he loved--Salinas, New
York City, Sag Harbor--and these evocations of place begin the book,
welcoming the reader to Steinbeck at his most fetching. In his more
important journalistic work, however, he engages with social issues,
such as the devastation wrought by agribusiness in California--the
subject of his novel "In Dubious Battle" (1935)--or the pitiful
condition of squatters in "The Harvest Gypsies," a series written for
the San Francisco News in 1936. His most incendiary piece is probably
"Starvation Under the Orange Trees," commissioned by Life but
rejected because of its overtly radical politics. It still crackles
on the page, fueled by indignation. That Americans should have found
themselves hungry and helplessly poor in the midst of plenty enraged
him.</TE>
<TE>   As Steinbeck says in "Writers Take Sides," a brief statement of
beliefs aimed at his opponents: "I am treasonable enough not to
believe in the liberty of a man or a group to exploit, torment, or
slaughter other men or groups. I believe in the despotism of human
life and happiness against the liberty of money and possessions."
Needless to say, this seems just as radical in post-Reagan America as
it did 60 years ago: perhaps even more so in a moment in our history
when irony--especially in politics--is painfully lacking.</TE>
<TE>   This volume also contains some of Steinbeck's reports from the
front during World War II. The writer dispatched 86 articles from
Europe during the war, publishing most of them in the New York Herald
Tribune. His assignment was to "see the war through the eyes of the
common man," as London's Daily Express suggested in an article that
mentioned Steinbeck's reporting. He did so with remarkable ease and
grace, taking us onto troop ships, into hospital wards and training
camps in North Africa. He plunged right into the caldron of war
itself in southern Italy, witnessing the invasion of Salerno. Some of
the best of these pieces are reprinted here.</TE>
<TE>   Unwell in his mid-60s, suffering from heart disease and a bad
back, Steinbeck nevertheless trooped off to Vietnam to visit his son,
a soldier, and to report for Newsday about the progress of that
particularly sour war. (He had been encouraged to do so by Lyndon
Johnson, whom he considered a friend.) The circumstances of that war,
so unpalatable and difficult to rationalize, defeated him as they
defeated this nation as a whole. Indeed, Steinbeck was driven to
distraction by the war, and he suffered a major relapse on his way
home from Southeast Asia. He died in 1968, disgruntled and confused
by a war that made no sense.</TE>
<TE>   This volume also contains the buoyant final essays that Steinbeck
published in "America and Americans" (1966). He had been asked to
contribute some text to a volume of photographs, but the project
expanded as he found himself writing more easily than he had in
years. This is, as he admitted in his preface, "a book of opinions,
unashamed and individual." He saw his country as "complicated,
paradoxical, bullheaded, shy, cruel, boisterous, unspeakably dear,
and very beautiful." It is difficult to resist such a portrait,
especially from an author willing to admit that there are "jagged
holes in our system."</TE>
<TE>   Radicals will, not unreasonably, argue that Steinbeck never went
far enough with his politics. Toward the end, he tended to side with
those in power and was less fiery than when young, less committed to
rooting out injustice. This is all true. Nevertheless, his view of
America and Americans, as presented in these brief, rather abstract
essays remains appealing: One just doesn't see this hint of guilty
optimism any more. Steinbeck saw that there were endless
possibilities for goodness in our national character and that if
these were not thwarted by greed and stupidity, Americans--a
patchwork entity created out "of work, of bloodshed, of loneliness
and fear"--might well do some good in the world.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Starvation Under the Orange Trees'</TE>
<TE>   The spring is rich and green in California this year. In the
fields the wild grass is ten inches high, and in the orchards and
vineyards the grass is deep and nearly ready to be plowed under to
enrich the soil. Already the flowers are starting to bloom. Very
shortly one of the oil companies will be broadcasting the locations
of the wild-flower masses. It is a beautiful spring.</TE>
<TE>   There has been no war in California, no plague, no bombing of open
towns and roads, no shelling of cities. It is a beautiful year. And
thousands of families are starving in California. In the county seats
the coroners are filling in "malnutrition" in the spaces left for
"causes of death." For some reason, a coroner shrinks from writing
"starvation" when a thin child is dead in a tent.</TE>
<TE>   For it's in the tents you see along the roads and in the shacks
built from dump heap material that the hunger is, and it isn't
malnutrition. It is starvation. Malnutrition means you go without
certain food essentials and take a long time to die, but starvation
means no food at all. The green grass spreads right into the tent
doorways and the orange trees are loaded. In the cotton fields, a few
wisps of the old crop cling to the black stems. But the people who
picked the cotton, and cut the peaches and apricots, who crawled all
day in the rows of lettuce and beans, are hungry. The men who
harvested the crops of California, the women and girls who stood all
day and half the night in the canneries, are starving.</TE>

<DH>THE SISTERS: The Saga of the Mitford Family, By Mary S.
Lovell, W.W. Norton: 612 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LUCRETIA STEWART</AU>
<BD>Lucretia Stewart is the author of the novel "Making
Love" and editor of "Erogenous Zones: An Anthology of Sex Abroad."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mitfords occupy a special place in British hearts and in British
folklore. They are national treasures, so their eccentricities, their
peccadilloes, their broken marriages, their unorthodox political
allegiances are all forgiven. They've become a sort of alternative
royal family, immortalized in Nancy Mitford's novels (notably "The
Pursuit of Love," "Love in a Cold Climate," "The Blessing" and "Don't
Tell Alfred"). And, more recently, their world was depicted in a
musical ("The Mitford Girls") and a highly successful television
adaptation--an amalgam--of the novels. Everybody knows them,
everybody loves them, everybody has a claim on them.</LD>
<TE>   The Mitford sisters--Nancy the novelist, Pamela the countrywoman
and "quiet" sister, Diana the fascist, Unity the fascist and
fanatical fan of Hitler, Jessica the communist and Deborah the
duchess--were the daughters of a minor British aristocrat, David
Mitford, who became the second Baron Redesdale. For a number of
reasons, some clear, some less so, the sisters became famous. Mary S.
Lovell claims in "The Sisters" that, were it not for Nancy's novels,
the family would never have become enshrined in the national
consciousness and, to a certain extent, that is true, but the
exploits of the Mitford girls were being reported in the press long
before Nancy published her first book. Their long-suffering mother is
supposed to have remarked, "Whenever I see a headline beginning with
'Peer's Daughter' I know one of you children has been in trouble."
(Her only son, Tom, gave considerably less trouble and died at 36
when he developed pneumonia after being wounded in Burma in 1945.)</TE>
<TE>   The sisters, four of whom were almost always known by their
nicknames--Pamela, "Woman" or "Woo"; Unity, "Bobo" or "Boud";
Jessica, "Decca"; and Deborah, "Debo"--lived largely (or at least
until they "came out" as debutantes and set off to find husbands) in
a world of their own or at any rate of their own making. They
invented a private language, Boudledidge, (which appears in Nancy's
novels as eggy-peggy); they had endless jokes, teases and games,
which were peculiar to them and must have appeared weird and baffling
to outsiders. That they were eccentric is beyond doubt, but somehow,
in their hands, that eccentricity became novel and exciting; it
became daring and groundbreakingly witty.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, Lovell does not share her subjects' light touch. In this
exhaustive (and exhausting) new biography, no stone has been left
unturned, no letter unread, no dance unattended, no outfit not
described, no joke not retold, no beloved pet (and there were dozens
of these) forgotten. The result reads like a collection of facts and
anecdotes hastily assembled, with little thought or analysis applied
to their presentation. Much of the material relies heavily on Jessica
Mitford's memoir, "Hons and Rebels."</TE>
<TE>   The country weekend, for example, at which Jessica met her cousin
Esmond Romilly, with whom she was soon to elope, is reported thus by
her: "Cousin Dorothy's house was deliciously comfortable and
pleasant. Unlike most English country houses, the rooms were always
glowingly warm. You got the feeling that the fires burned in the
fireplaces continuously all winter.... There were many old-fashioned
touches: oranges stuffed with cloves in the chests of drawers, early
morning tea in your bedroom...." Here is Lovell's version: "Renowned
for her hospitality 'Aunt' Dorothy was credited with being the
Edwardian instigator of weekend house-parties--'Do come Saturday to
Monday'--and her house was famous as a haven of comfort. Fires blazed
in all the rooms throughout the winter, and no expense or detail was
spared to make guests feel pampered." And so it goes on--for more
than 600 pages.</TE>
<TE>   Her tone, simultaneously gushing and banal, is more suitable to
Britain's Hello magazine than to a serious biography. (Witness her
initial description of Lord and Lady Redesdale: "They were honest,
well-meaning, salt-of-the-earth, admittedly slightly eccentric,
socially retiring minor aristocrats, thoroughly nice people who,
because of their extraordinary daughters, were propelled unwillingly,
blinking and unprepared, into an international spotlight.") She veers
between the arch, the naive ("It is tempting to wonder what might
have happened had Diana been able to arrange a meeting [between
Hitler and Churchill]. Might the war, which tore Europe apart, have
been prevented?") and the frankly incomprehensible (as when she
reports that Unity "gave alcoholic parties in her apartment for her
friends from 'the heim.'" Is an alcoholic party one attended by
alcoholic guests or one at which alcoholic drinks are served?).
Lovell, like many before her, has fallen hook, line and sinker for
the Mitfords, and it shows.</TE>
<TE>   But, worse than the cliches that pepper the text ("Aunt Dorothy
had a soft spot for her wayward young kinsman") or the breathless
admiration for all things Mitford, including Diana's espousal of the
Fascist cause and its dangerously charismatic leader in England,
Oswald Mosley (Lovell seems to believe that a love so great as theirs
was sacred and deserved the reverential, swoony treatment that
Abelard and Heloise would have considered themselves lucky to get),
is the complete lack of any distance or objectivity.</TE>
<TE>   The main problem with "The Sisters" is that Lovell appears
incapable of putting any of the information she has amassed in
context, so that Evelyn Waugh's first marriage to Evelyn Gardner
("The marriage could never have worked: Waugh had homosexual urges
and was not able to give She-Evelyn the emotional security she
needed; as a writer he needed quiet and isolation, while She-Evelyn
craved social life"), the Bright Young Things (which included "Lytton
Strachey and his lover Dora Carrington"--something of an
oversimplification of their actual relationship), the British Fascist
movement, Unity's crush on Hitler and the Spanish Civil War are all
splashed carelessly onto a vast, sprawling canvas of 1930s
upper-class British life. Everything, trivial or not, is given the
same breathy, excitable treatment in a sort of grotesque parody of
Mitford-speak (at one point, Lovell claims, "Decca was putrid with
jealousy" because Nancy had gone to Russia).</TE>
<TE>   This inability to understand the nuances of the British class
system, which is part of the larger problem, is perhaps
understandable--only the British upper classes and a few snobbish and
clever outsiders understand it--and therefore forgivable. What is
less forgivable is her absolute conviction that she does understand
it perfectly, that she is utterly at home in this strange alternative
universe created by the Mitfords and that she is our guide and
conduit to that universe. She just doesn't get it at all and the book
jars with every sentence as a result. British readers will understand
what's wrong; American readers may simply be uneasily conscious that
something is out of kilter.</TE>
<TE>   Another significant weakness of the book is Lovell's failure to
explore the relationship between the Mitfords--their lives and
times--and their portrayal in Nancy's novels. These novels are
intrinsically far more interesting than anything the Mitfords got up
to, but obviously not to Lovell (if the British weren't so busy
treating the Mitfords as national treasures, they would be
embarrassed by them; it could have gone either way). She dutifully
details the crossovers between Life and Art, but she never seems to
grasp how the one fed into the other, and her understanding of the
relationship between the two seems limited to such comments as "The
girls' parents Lord and Lady Redesdale ... are perhaps better known
to posterity as 'Farve and 'Muv.'" It is difficult to avoid believing
that she simply isn't familiar with the novels, if only because of
the endless missed opportunities to make interesting connections.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Lovell came to research the book, all but two of the
Mitford children were dead. "Two of the sisters are triumphantly
alive as I write this book. Diana, at ninety, still chic and
articulate: Debo, serene and utterly charming, celebrated her
eightieth birthday in March 2000...." As a result, the Mitford family
and their circle appear primarily as caricatures: chaotic children
jumping fences twice their height (all of them, however, rather more
elegant than those depicted by a cartoonist) on plump ponies;
red-faced men in pink (hunting) coats; effete but frightfully amusing
homosexuals, or men affecting to be homosexual ("filthy sewers"
castigated by Farve); beastly Fascists; languid beauties (Lovell
remains astonished and entranced throughout by the fact that Diana
was one of the great beauties of her generation and refers to it so
often that one becomes suspicious) and so on. They have all already
appeared--more elegantly, more endearingly, more enjoyably, more
memorably--in Nancy's novels, and that is where you should look if
you want to know about the Mitfords.</TE>

<HD>Art in a Proper Setting</HD>
<DH>The proposed redesign may do justice to LACMA's collection.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's a museum question for the art-interested. (Relax. It's a
no-brainer.) Which would you rather have: (a) a great art collection
housed in a lousy museum building, or (b) a lousy art collection
housed in a great museum building?</LD>
<LD>   If you answered (b), please call your travel agent and book a
flight to Bilbao, Spain, for a visit to its building-rich, art-poor
branch of the Guggenheim Museum. For art people, a great art
collection is the ideal--even if you need to climb to the bottom of a
dank and dingy well to see it.</LD>
<LD>   Now, here's a second question, which is more nuanced. Which would
you rather have: (a) a good art collection housed in a lousy museum
building, or (b) a good art collection housed in a great museum
building?</LD>
<TE>   Question No. 2 arises because it's the one to ask when assessing
December's stunning announcement that the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art will tear down most of its Wilshire Boulevard complex to build
an extraordinary new structure designed by celebrated Dutch architect
Rem Koolhaas. Why? Because LACMA's collection is neither great nor
lousy.</TE>
<TE>   In a society besotted with lists of "bests" and "worsts," A-list
celebrity or utter oblivion, it's easy to forget that most public
collections fall between those extremes. LACMA has a good collection
housed in a lousy museum building--actually, in several lousy museum
buildings--but if all goes as planned, it could have a good
collection in a great building.</TE>
<TE>   If you didn't know that LACMA has a good collection, maybe the
present dispiriting architectural mess is part of the reason. A great
building can show off a good collection to best advantage; a lousy
building can drain its vigor.</TE>
<TE>   Encyclopedic in scope, with holdings from most every time and
place in world history, the county museum's collections of American,
ancient, Islamic, European, Far Eastern, Indian, Southeast Asian and
Modern art have obvious gaps.</TE>
<TE>   They also boast numerous individual examples that are, quite
simply, as good as art gets, from Rembrandt's "The Raising of
Lazarus" (circa 1630), which puts the putrid smell of death in a
startled viewer's nostrils, and the archetypal word-image conundrum
of Surrealist painting, Rene Magritte's classic "The Treachery of
Images (This Is Not a Pipe)" (circa 1928-29) to 9th century BC
Assyrian reliefs from the palace of Ashurnasirpal II.</TE>
<TE>   Some concentrated categories, such as German Expressionist
painting, sculpture and especially graphics, claim astounding depth.
For historical breadth, the Shin'enkan collection of more than 300
prime Japanese scrolls and screen paintings from the Edo period
(1615-1868) is unsurpassed in the Western world. European Baroque
painting has steadily crept into prominence, while the collection of
18th century costumes and textiles can't be beat in any American
museum.</TE>
<TE>   And so on.</TE>
<TE>   No, LACMA does not rival New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.
But then, neither does any other encyclopedic American museum. (At
this late date in the history of art collecting, where supplies have
radically dwindled, none can.) Let's put it this way: LACMA is the
nation's most impressive encyclopedic art museum west of Chicago--and
you can toss in most of the South, to boot.</TE>
<TE>   That's no mean achievement, especially for a museum that's only
been at it in a serious way for about four decades. Koolhaas'
radically new building could make it clear.</TE>
<TE>   Although charged with proposing a new addition, plus a renovation
of the existing buildings, the architect chose instead to rethink the
entire physical campus. He took a risk in favor of architectural
coherence. The clarity of the sweeping result is powerful.</TE>
<TE>   More important, in the process of rethinking the physical plant,
Koolhaas also rethought the social dimension in which an encyclopedic
art museum in Los Angeles could function in the 21st century. This is
what elevates the design into the realm of potential greatness. His
building is a tour de force of conceptual verve, one that's hard to
imagine emerging in any other city in the world. That's why it should
be built.</TE>
<TE>   There are two parts to Koolhaas' revision. One concerns the public
image an encyclopedic art museum projects. The other--intimately
related--has to do with its organizational structure.</TE>
<TE>   The current LACMA is a palace in a park--a museum motif that's as
old in America as, well, the Metropolitan Museum in Manhattan's
Central Park, or the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston's Fenway (both
were founded in 1870). "A palace of art, truly, that sits there on
the edge of the Park," Henry James wrote following a visit to the Met
in 1907, and within three years Boston's museum had moved from its
original site at Copley Square to the Fenway. James' assessment could
have been repeated ad infinitum in subsequent decades. Detroit,
Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Toledo, Cleveland, San
Francisco, Washington--the motif characterized most American art
museum architecture in the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   Cracks in the palace-in-a-park motif began to be felt after World
War II, especially in new museums devoted mostly to Modern art and
contemporary culture. By the 1960s, those cracks had become deep
fissures. A tense era of social conflict did not look kindly on the
civic museum's established image.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to see why. A palace in a park represented the American
art museum's snobby ancestry in the aristocratic European country
house, stuffed to the rafters with cultural booty. These museums'
standard Beaux-Arts design, with its neoclassical, Greco-Roman
origins, gave the patrician source a democratic veneer. That image
was imperative. Born of 19th and early 20th century industrialization
and expansionism, and representing the Hellenic idea of being a haven
for all the arts, such museums functioned as civic symbols for the
ascendance of American democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the democratic facade of Beaux-Arts design could not
completely mask a stark reality. Big American art museums were also a
plaything for plutocrats, tempered by an aristocratic aura of
noblesse oblige, which compels those of high social rank to behave
nobly toward their lesser neighbors. Ditto LACMA, which opened in
Hancock Park in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly its William L. Pereira design differed from all its
encyclopedic predecessors. With the exception of LACMA, the nation's
important encyclopedic art museums are almost all found in the
Northeast and the upper Midwest. Befitting its unusual position,
LACMA was the first such American art museum built in a modern style.
At least, it seemed to be modern. Clad in marble chips, set atop a
podium and hovering above a pool, its original group of colonnaded
pavilions is actually Beaux-Arts Classicism with a Modern veneer.</TE>
<TE>   That tentative, superficial style matched the museum's provisional
aim. LACMA trustees trumpeted their determination to become the West
Coast Met. (L.A. had already snagged the Brooklyn Dodgers, and a
certain local newspaper had announced its goal was "to knock the New
York Times off its perch," so why not?) Pereira's work emulated
Lincoln Center in New York, which began opening in stages in 1962.
The fulsome ache to rival Manhattan, while casting futuristic L.A. in
its ill-fitting image, was palpable.</TE>
<TE>   It was also provincial, a backhanded declaration of deep cultural
insecurity. Like Gilded Age New Yorkers aping European aristocrats,
we couldn't just be ourselves and be good; we had to mimic the
reigning establishment to do it. Artists cringed all over town. Some
even made art of it.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Ruscha's incendiary Pop paintings are the supreme examples.
His images of Standard Oil gas stations and Norm's family restaurants
blazingly on fire pictured the avant-garde mandate to wreck
entrenched "standards and norms." Meanwhile, the paintings' formal
resemblance to commercial advertisements embodied that subversive aim
in aesthetic terms.</TE>
<TE>   So did his graphic mid-'60s painting "The L.A. County Museum of
Art on Fire." In the city of the perpetual future, the picture coyly
recalled the bombastic demand to "set fire to the library shelves ...
flood the museums" in Filippo Marinetti's famous 1912 Futurist
Manifesto. And nobody could miss the painting's comical one-liner,
which proposed a simple, combustible solution for LACMA's spanking
new yet widely reviled architectural design.</TE>
<TE>   Who could have imagined, before December 2001, that LACMA's
trustees would finally take Ruscha's advice--at least metaphorically?</TE>
<TE>   Koolhaas' design for the new LACMA is not final. But his
conceptual diagram--on view in the lobby of LACMA's Ahmanson
Building, with the four other architects' proposals--fulfills the
promise of the failed original: LACMA will be an encyclopedic art
museum with an authentically progressive building, not a timid,
pretentious pastiche. It reads as a radical reinvention of the old
motif of a palace in a park. Koolhaas' version is appropriate to a
technologically driven society and to the particular circumstances of
L.A. Best of all, it reflects democratic rather than aristocratic
culture.</TE>
<TE>   It starts with a bold stroke. The plan slices off Pereira's
buildings at the existing plaza level. Like a memory of what was, it
retains the working foundations of the original structures, where
staff offices, carpentry shops and other active work spaces are
housed. Change within continuity is incarnate.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that comes a new open-air plaza, an authentic civic
space that will be the site for cafes, shops, a reconfigured theater
and a large exhibition hall for temporary shows. The open,
transparent grid of the plaza's design is a sharp echo of Mies van
der Rohe, the great 20th century architect who was notoriously passed
over 40 years ago in favor of Pereira for the original LACMA
commission. (Koolhaas has dubbed the plaza the Miesian Court.) Mies
here returns to Wilshire Boulevard like a friendly ghost.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, raised high on concrete columns above the civic plaza are
the galleries for the museum's collections. Mostly without ceilings,
like the galleries at the Museum of Contemporary Art's congenial,
precedent-setting warehouse space in Little Tokyo, the collection
rooms are covered by a vaulting roof of translucent, air-filled
Mylar, stretched over steel arches.</TE>
<TE>   The image conveyed by this remarkable roof is two-fold. Partly
it's an airy, rolling landscape, which echoes the hills that surround
the L.A. Basin. Partly it's a light-filled, high-tech tent, suitable
to our nomadic age and its avid pursuit of cultural tourism.</TE>
<TE>   Koolhaas anchors his savvy, indoor-outdoor palace squarely in the
park--without eating up additional green space in park-poor L.A. The
current plan calls for wide staircases to ascend from the existing
park level to the new civic plaza, whose general transparency allows
one to look right through the space. The Hancock Park site,
surrounded by apartment buildings, office towers and stores, becomes
an instance of distinctive Angeleno urbanity.</TE>
<TE>   Four long, parallel, horizontal expanses lay out the art of Asia,
Europe, the Americas and the modern world, side-by-side. The plan
reflects LACMA's reorganization of its curatorial departments into
sections based on neutral continental geography, rather than on
shifting, Balkanized, socially volatile political units such as
pre-Columbian, American--meaning only the U.S.--or Far Eastern art,
which is standard practice for encyclopedic museums. The new format,
pioneered a decade ago by the Dallas Museum of Art, finds only its
second--and potentially more resonant--example at LACMA.</TE>
<TE>   Even when considered geographically, LACMA's collections retain
their strengths and weaknesses, of course, but this is the most
inspired, hopeful feature of the project. A new generation of the
same plutocrats that built the old LACMA--and every other
encyclopedic museum since the Met--will build the new one; but a
different political dimension marks the new design. Emphatically
horizontal, the entire scheme erases an image of vertical hierarchy
that undergirds an outmoded, paternalistic, European philosophy of
noblesse oblige. Instead, global cultures are cross-referenced.</TE>
<TE>   From the landscape form of the high-tech tent above to the
underground archaeology of the older buildings below, horizontal
layering here implies the packed strata of history, rebuking in built
form the pernicious myth that Los Angeles hasn't any. At the same
time, the art collection is held dramatically aloft, above the
mundane plane of daily experience.</TE>
<TE>   This is not an encyclopedic art museum tricked out with a moribund
building vocabulary of Doric columns and Greek pediments, Postmodern
or otherwise. Instead, it physically embodies the distinct condition
of art in a democratic society. Quality as an artistic pursuit
coincides with equality as a social aim. Think of the plan as a
democratic vista in concrete and Mylar--one that celebrates history
while working toward vivid social aims.</TE>
<TE>   The genius of Koolhaas' plan is that it manages to build on two
landmarks of museum architecture in an unprecedented way. A cadenced,
rectilinear building set atop a podium is itself a classical motif,
famously employed by architect and painter Karl Friedrich Schinkel in
the 1820s for his design of Berlin's Altes Museum. Schinkel's Greek
Revival style set the typological standard for America's encyclopedic
art museums.</TE>
<TE>   Schinkel was pointedly modernized by Mies in the 1960s for the
design of Berlin's New National Gallery--a sleek, Machine Age temple
of steel and glass. Although Mies' crystalline machine is an
architectural masterpiece, it's also a dreadful place to look at art.
The collections are hidden downstairs inside the podium. The
glass-walled gallery for temporary exhibitions above is one of those
flexible, all-purpose spaces that are so accommodating as to be
nearly useless.</TE>
<TE>   Koolhaas' 21st century design puts art back on the pedestal where
Schinkel and Mies had rightly exalted it. Yet it also manifests a
luminous democratic faith in social equality that eluded them.</TE>
<TE>   The creation of distinctive, cosmopolitan civic space is a worthy
goal for any public institution--not least a public institution
dedicated to art. But that's something that has repeatedly eluded
LACMA during 40 expensive years of building, renovation and
additions. Now, it seems to be within tantalizing reach.</TE>

<LD>Henry Spofford Jr. of the Philadelphia Spoffords will sing sweet
nothings into the ear of the brunet Dorothy Shaw on Tuesday, when the
curtain goes up on "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" at UCLA's Freud
Playhouse. But in real life, the gentleman who plays him, Broadway
leading man Hugh Panaro, really does prefer blonds--at least the
particular towhead who plays the gold-digging Lorelei Lee. After all,
Panaro and Alice Ripley have a love child together.</LD>
<LD>   They call him Zippy.</LD>
<LD>   At the moment, Zippy is crashing the Reprise! cast's first reading
of the Anita Loos work that made a star out of uber-blond Carol
Channing 50 years ago. Minutes before everyone gets down to business
at a rehearsal studio in Burbank, Panaro mashes Zippy into the soft
curve of Ripley's neck. Ripley grabs Zippy and presses his tender
mouth into Panaro's cheek. A fuzzier nuclear family would be hard to
find.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, Zippy has an advantage when it comes to fuzziness. He's
made of terrycloth. Over turkey and ostrich burgers at Burbank's
Coral Cafe the next day, Panaro and Ripley explain how Zippy the
stuffed zebra completed them as a happy theater family.</TE>
<TE>   Panaro says Zippy made his debut during the brief run of the
star-crossed musical "Side Show" on Broadway in 1996. For no
particular reason, Panaro, who played the lover of Ripley's character
in the musical about conjoined twins and Depression-era
vaudevillians, decided to decorate his dressing room in a jungle
motif. He covered the floor with a leopard-print rug. Bamboo and fake
vines climbed the walls and mirrors.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody got on the bandwagon," says Panaro, a former Broadway
Phantom who also starred in "Martin Guerre" at the Ahmanson Theatre
in 2000. "People were bringing me little jungle Beanie Babies. I had
leopards and tigers and giraffes. And then Zippy arrived. He had
spiky dark hair that Alice thought looked like my hair looked in
'Side Show.' And Zippy was the best because it came from Alice."</TE>
<TE>   Ripley, whose Broadway roles include Janet Weiss in "The Rocky
Horror Show" and Molly Ivors in the Tony Award-winning musical "James
Joyce's The Dead," trills back at him: "Is it just me? I think he's
beautiful. It's what's going on behind his eyes that just makes me
crazy."</TE>
<TE>   One more thing makes her happiness complete: "It's a good thing I
have a husband."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yes. By the way, the 38-year-old Ripley has been happily
married for six years to rock and jazz drummer Shannon Ford, who
performs with her onstage in her other life as a singer-songwriter.
And the divorced Panaro, also in his 30s, thinks Ford is a swell guy.
Because this isn't any ordinary love story. It's the story of a
promising friendship that intensified in the heat of a battle to keep
a show alive. And that battle is one that also concerns other lovers
of the American musical--the growing conflict between risk-taking and
commerce on Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   "Side Show" closed after 11 weeks despite glowing notices, not the
least of which came from the New York Times, which called Ripley's
performance "simply astonishing."  (The Southern California premiere
of Bill Russell and "Dreamgirls" composer Henry Krieger's musical is
playing at the Colony Theatre in Burbank through April 7.) After the
final curtain came down, Ripley and Emily Skinner, who played her
sister, were jointly nominated for a Tony Award. That validated the
cast's passion for the show, but it also underlined their loss.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know why a show closes," says "Blondes" director John
Bowab, a Broadway veteran who worked with Angela Lansbury in "Mame."
"In this case, it could be management. Sometimes lesser shows have
run because management knew how to keep them running. "Yet 'Side
Show' had a sort of mystique to it, and I think when you're involved
in a production like that, it's like joining hands and fighting off
the depression that can come with something one loses prematurely.
Some of my best friendships have been with people who've been
associated with me in things that didn't work. You join hands, and
it's us-against-them. And that becomes something maybe deeper."</TE>
<TE>   The pair's stage reunion was coincidental. Bowab first heard
Ripley and Panaro in "Side Show" and resolved to work with both of
them: He'd directed Ripley in a concert version of "Show Boat" at the
Hollywood Bowl last year, and he'd worked with Panaro in the 2000
Reprise! production of "Call Me Madam." Because of the spare two-week
rehearsal period for "Blondes," he was eager to cast familiar talents
and stage veterans. "It's comforting when you're under a tight
schedule to work with someone you know," Bowab says. "You don't want
them to have to prove themselves to you or you to them."</TE>
<TE>   Other stage stalwarts who round out the cast include Valarie
Pettiford, a Tony nominee for "Fosse" who plays Dorothy, and Ruth
Williamson, a Broadway veteran who appears as Lady Beekman. The plot
turns on Lorelei and Dorothy's search for happy marriages along
different paths--Lorelei for money and Dorothy for love--a buoyant
quest that takes them from a midnight sailing to the Moulin Rouge.
Because the stage version is rarely revived, audiences are more
likely to recognize hits from the Jule Styne-Leo Robin score:
"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" and "A Little Girl From Little
Rock."</TE>
<TE>   Bowab cast Panaro and Ripley in "Blondes" because he knew what
they were like backstage. Panaro played "a square" in "Call Me
Madam," Bowab says, but in real life he charmed cast and crew with
his "devilish" sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're casting what is basically a square role, you don't
want to hire a square actor," Bowab says. "You want somebody who will
bring something to the plate."</TE>
<TE>   Bowab found a similar quality in Ripley during their "Show Boat"
stint. "Alice is one of the great theater voices around today, and
during the rehearsal breaks at the Hollywood Bowl, sweltering under
100-degree heat, she was up and bright and devilish. I just fell in
love with that."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Bowab's task has been to direct a Lorelei that the
audience will love despite the character's grating image as a gold
digger. Channing, who owned the stage Lorelei, was able to play a
doll with dollar signs in her eyes to great comic effect when the
show opened in 1949. The character was softened for Marilyn Monroe
when she starred in the heavily adapted 1953 film version. Bowab
wanted Lorelei to seem fresh in 2002, even though the play is set in
cool-with-Coolidge 1924.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to evoke any of those memories," Bowab said. "I
didn't want to imitate Carol Channing. And in this century, I didn't
want the baby doll. I think it's been done to death. And Madonna
covered the Monroe version with her video. So I wanted somebody who
stood on her own and could bring me a unique quality."</TE>
<TE>   Even at the Coral Cafe, Monroe's ghost presides. Ripley notices a
sepia-tinged photograph of the blond icon hanging on the wall above
her booth, and she can't help sneaking glances at it.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at how beautiful she is," Ripley coos. "She's the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   "Look in the mirror," Panaro shoots back.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Ripley is a classic beauty, with flawless, high
cheekbones, eyes the color of blue marble and a distinctive style.</TE>
<TE>   Ripley says she's like her mom, a cross between Monroe and
Ann-Margret. Panaro says the Ann-Margret part wins hands down. "It's
an essence thing," he says. "It's rock 'n' roll, kitten with a whip.
Put a whip in Alice's hand and she looks right at home."</TE>
<TE>   Ripley's Lorelei will be as much a creature of the late 20th
century as it will of the actress. Ripley wants to put some
metaphorical meat on the character's bones. "It would be so easy to
play her as a gold digger," she says. "That's one facet of the
diamond that is Lorelei. Just one. Everybody is motivated by one
thing, and that is to find love, but with Lorelei it's skewed. I
think Lorelei equates money with love. That's what makes her say, if
I get a million dollars I'm a worthwhile person. I'm loved."</TE>
<TE>   "You might say this is really heavy for a musical. But I think
it's really important to look at Lorelei as a whole person. There are
things that are kinky, that literally have kinks. That might surprise
people."</TE>
<TE>   And getting the opportunity to surprise an audience is becoming
more and more of a luxury for musical theater performers, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "If she tried to do an imitation, that would be absurd," Panaro
says. "Alice is so many different things that she can bring to the
role. Why not take what Alice can do and put them in?"</TE>
<TE>   Freshening familiar characters is a typical approach taken by
smaller resident theaters that breathe new life into old musicals--a
major perk beyond the reach of performers who inherit roles in
bigger-budget Broadway productions, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "With a lot of corporate shows, it just comes down to running the
show like a finely oiled machine," Panaro says. "You don't want to
rock the boat, so if the guy that's doing it now takes two steps to
the right and you want to take three, sorry, you've got to take two."</TE>
<TE>   Ripley observes that the pressure on musical theater to conform
has been growing as productions become more and more expensive. "It's
ridiculous," she says. "The one downfall of commercial theater is
that it's commercial. It's all about who can bring in the most money
and the most people."</TE>
<TE>   Ripley found another way to bring in audiences. For two weeks
before "Side Show" closed, she collared them at the Broadway discount
ticket booth. For an hour before every performance, she and fellow
cast members tried to talk theatergoers into seeing the show.</TE>
<TE>   Panaro braved the Christmas cold with her. "I remember asking
somebody, 'What are you here to see?' 'Oh, I'm going to see "Cats."'
'Oh my God, you've never seen "Cats"?' 'Oh, no. We see it every
year.' 'Why don't you come and see something new? I'm in this show
called "Side Show." It's great.' 'No, no. We're here to see "Cats."'"</TE>
<TE>   Most people had never heard of "Side Show," Ripley says. "I'd say,
'Come back to my dressing room after the show because I want to see
how this show affected you.' And Emily who played my twin would go,
'What are you doing inviting these people you don't know to our
dressing room?' I was like a missionary."</TE>
<TE>   Ripley made curtain speeches, offering dinner to anyone who'd ante
up $1 million to keep the show going. The $1 million never
materialized, although a theater lover sent her a $2,000 check with a
note saying, "I know this isn't going to save the show, but at least
you can have a cast party on me." Ripley burst into tears when she
read it.</TE>
<TE>   Her eyes still moisten when she talks about "Side Show." "I have a
real murky and very dark sadness about it. I wouldn't be so bold as
to compare that show to an artist like Van Gogh, but you know how Van
Gogh became famous after his death? That's how I feel about it. 'Side
Show' is produced all the time all over the country in high schools
and regional theaters, but I'm talking about the original cast.
There's just a really big difference in being where the alchemy
begins. 'Side Show' closing was a really awful grieving process for
everybody--not just the actors, but the orchestra and the crew and
the ushers."</TE>
<TE>   Even though "Side Show" received good reviews, Ripley and Panaro
say, the show was drowned out by other productions with huge budgets
for promotion, such as Disney's "The Lion King" and "The Scarlet
Pimpernel," which inserted CD singles in subscribers' copies of the
New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   And some audiences were challenged by the show's grotesqueries,
unable to see past its freak-show setting to its universal truths,
such as the yearning for self-acceptance and unconditional love.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, that's the ultimate dream come true," Ripley says. "I'd
never seen a show like that, and it single-handedly restored my faith
in the possibility of musical theater being more than just a
diversion but of being something that's really healing."</TE>
<TE>   "Some people weren't deep enough to go there," Panaro says. "They
said, 'Oh, it's about a sideshow and bearded ladies.' They didn't
quite get it."</TE>
<TE>   But then steering clear of a cookie-cutter sensibility earned
Ripley and Panaro their "Side Show" roles in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Performers rarely get the chance to bare their soul on the
commercial stage, Ripley says. "For so long, that has not been
demanded of them. The director isn't going to make you do that and
the audience doesn't care. I'm not getting down on musical theater
because it's my life. But as long as certain standards are met, you
can get away with having a great voice and not really being that
great of an actress in musical theater."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that's why Panaro holds a special place in Ripley's heart.
Because in her eyes, he's all heart.</TE>
<TE>   "I always describe Hugh as a heart with legs," she says. "He's a
walking heart, like the giant heart costume I wore when I was a
singing telegram delivery person. My valentine outfit was this padded
pink heart with a place for my arms to come out, and that's exactly
how I see him. A big heart with legs."</TE>
<TE>   Panaro laughs. "Honey," he says, "the check's in the mail."</TE>

<LD>"Six months ago, I would never have dreamed this."</LD>
<LD>   Andrea L. Rich, leaning forward on a black leather chair in her
pristine office at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, wants to be
perfectly clear: The decision to rebuild the biggest encyclopedic art
museum west of the Mississippi from scratch was as much a surprise
for her as it was for the rest of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "It wasn't in the cards," says the museum's president and
director. "It wasn't in my cards."</LD>
<TE>   But on Dec. 5, LACMA unveiled a stunning plan: Instead of merely
remodeling its campus on Wilshire Boulevard, the museum would raze
four of its six buildings, replacing them with a vast, futuristic
structure designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas and topped by a
translucent, tent-like roof. Instead of compartmentalizing its
collection in separate buildings spread across the campus, it would
consolidate almost everything under that dramatic roof.</TE>
<TE>   In the days and weeks after the announcement, the museum's
trustees, staff, donors and advisors would echo Rich's assertion:
This brand new LACMA had never been in anyone's cards. The museum was
supposed to get a face-lift, not the wrecking ball.</TE>
<TE>   So how did a fixer-upper become a tear-down? Why did the museum
choose a design that its fans call a brilliant clarification of an
architectural muddle and its detractors consider merely a
$300-million roof?</TE>
<TE>   The first inkling of massive change came Nov. 10. Two days
earlier, an architectural competition that Rich and her advisors had
organized got underway in earnest. Five renowned firms were in Los
Angeles to pitch their ideas. The museum had given each four months
and $200,000 to develop a proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Working with a budget of about $200 million, architects were asked
to unify LACMA's six existing structures and to design a new building
for Modern and contemporary art. The only building earmarked for
possible demolition was the centrally placed Ahmanson, which might
stand in the way of a cohesive scheme.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, the architects came before a 10-trustee selection
committee, Rich's nine-member "cabinet" of staff advisors and three
outside consultants. Each contender had exactly two hours to make his
case and answer questions.</TE>
<TE>   The contest got rolling with Jean Nouvel of Paris at 6 p.m. on
Nov. 8. Thom Mayne of Morphosis in Santa Monica made his pitch the
next morning, followed by Daniel Libeskind of Berlin. On the final
day, Koolhaas appeared at 10 a.m., Steven Holl of New York at 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, they put on quite a show.</TE>
<TE>   "Jean Nouvel and his team were a little rumpled; they had that
very Parisian, world-weary quality," says Bruce Robertson, chief
curator of American art and an official note-taker for Rich's
cabinet. "Daniel Libeskind is short and lively and sort of sprightly.
Thom Mayne came across as a Los Angeles architect with a really
passionate, expressive language. Steven Holl and his associates were
all dressed in black and clearly from Manhattan; he was quiet and
very serious."</TE>
<TE>   Koolhaas, 57, winner of architecture's Nobel, the Pritzker Prize,
and as well known for his radical theories as for his actual
buildings, was casual--sans coat or tie. Robertson calls him
"reserved but almost aggressively incisive." Koolhaas put up a slide
summarizing what the museum had requested and, says Robertson, told
the assembly: "Look, anything that begins with the words 'link' or
'unite' is doomed to failure. You are not going to get anything good
if you take this approach, so I am throwing it out."</TE>
<TE>   His alternative was a clean slate: demolishing everything except
the museum's Japanese Pavilion and the old May Co. building now known
as LACMA West.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a gasp," says Keith Wilson, chief curator of Asian art.
Koolhaas said his team had tried to follow the museum's directions
but couldn't. LACMA's existing sprawl, he argued in a spiral-bound
presentation book, "inhibits the full unfolding of its potential" and
"the clarity of its collections." A consolidated museum would open up
more of the surrounding park and "create a sense of coherence and ...
presence that this museum has lacked for decades."</TE>
<TE>   The trustees expected to spend a lot of money on renovation,
including seismic upgrades, asbestos removal and the replacement of
mechanical systems. But Koolhaas questioned that approach: Why put
65% of the construction budget into renovation when his plan would
use 67% of the money for new construction?</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the art itself. Putting most of the collection
under one roof, on one floor, "in a way that is both architecturally
dramatic and educationally transparent," Koolhaas said, would create
new perspectives on related developments in different cultures.</TE>
<TE>   Focusing on the recent reorganization of LACMA's curatorial
departments into "centers" for American, Asian, European, Latin
American, and Modern and contemporary art, he showed how each
umbrella category could unfold independently while allowing visitors
to make connections on crisscrossing pathways.</TE>
<TE>   Koolhaas conceived of a layered structure, with an open-air plaza
sandwiched between subterranean offices and exhibition space
supported by slender columns. Compared with the multi-part creations
of his competitors, Koolhaas' simple rectangular model initially
"looked like nothing at all," Robertson says.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was the only one to be illuminated from within, and it
had a seductive glow. "I was unable to stay in my seat," Wilson
remembers. "A few of us got up and looked. We just had to see what he
was talking about."</TE>
<TE>   If the curators were a little awestruck, they were not alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I was stunned," says Walter L. Weisman, chairman of LACMA's board
of trustees and its architect selection committee. "It took some time
for the implications to sink in."</TE>
<TE>   "Four of the five architects followed the instructions," trustee
and donor Eli Broad says. "Then along comes Rem Koolhaas."</TE>
<TE>   Rich asked her cabinet to assess the proposals for the trustee
committee, without ranking the candidates. Retreating to LACMA West,
they compared the five models and reviewed Robertson's notes.</TE>
<TE>   It soon became clear that Koolhaas and Nouvel were at the head of
the pack. Both architects had given serious consideration to the art
collection. Additionally, they both left a lot of land to be
developed and didn't sink a big chunk of the budget into parking,
opting to leave the existing parking structure intact.</TE>
<TE>   Nouvel planned to install each of the centers in a separate
building. Modern and contemporary art would go into a new structure
that would link the main campus with LACMA West. But the most
distinctive feature of his scheme was to turn the roof into a deck
that would replace the existing plaza.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an interesting maneuver," Robertson says. "When you are
down on the ground, you never think of LACMA as being anywhere in
particular, but when you stand on the roof and look out, you suddenly
see it in a place that is both natural--against the Hollywood
Hills--but also man-made. You have the same sensation as you get
looking out from the Getty, but from within the city."</TE>
<TE>   As for Koolhaas, "there was a rapturous response to the concept of
presenting the collection with parity," Wilson says.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed us the way to do what we wanted to do," adds Stephanie
Barron, vice president for education and public programs and senior
curator of Modern and contemporary art, "and that it required, by the
way, a fresh playing field."</TE>
<TE>   But his proposal raised a lot of questions.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked so clever," says Nancy Thomas, deputy director of
curatorial affairs and head of the cabinet. "But we felt that it
should be examined in terms of practicality."</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, they realized his scheme was bound to be more
disruptive than the others, which would tackle one building at a
time. And what about that translucent roof? Could light really be
sufficiently controlled to prevent damage to the art?</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, we decided that the museum's leaders weren't in a
position to choose," Robertson says. "So we sent Nancy off to
urgently request that the process be slowed down a little."</TE>
<TE>   The next day, as Thomas made her case, Weisman and other trustees
began to smile and then chuckle. "It was a great moment; I could tell
that our concerns coincided with theirs," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Just before Thomas' presentation, the committee had had a session
with the independent consultants: Richard Koshalek, president of Art
Center College of Design; Neil M. Denari, then-president of the
Southern California Institute of Architecture; and Sylvia Lavin,
chairwoman of UCLA's department of architecture. "I asked them not to
rank the proposals, just like the cabinet--but they didn't obey me,"
Rich says. "I think they were surprised by their own unanimity. They
are not necessarily viewed as people who would normally be in the
same camp on anything, but they were all in favor of Koolhaas."</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 13--two days after the committee tallied the reactions and
two days before it was scheduled to recommend an architect to the
entire museum board--Weisman released a statement. The committee had
narrowed the field of contenders to two.</TE>
<TE>   "Nouvel and Koolhaas both addressed all the issues that we wanted
covered, but in completely different ways," Rich says. "We needed to
bring them back to get more information so that the committee could
make a fully conscious decision."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art opened in 1965, in a
three-building complex designed by Los Angeles architect William L.
Pereira. An addition to its Hammer and Ahmanson buildings was
completed in 1983, and the Anderson Building, designed by the New
York firm of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer, was added in 1986. Two years
later, the Japanese Pavilion, designed by architect Bruce Goff,
opened its doors. And in 1994, the museum's private support group
purchased the former May Co., a 1939-40 design by Albert C. Martin
and S.A. Marx.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an incremental kind of place," Los Angeles County
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky says. "You added a wing here. You
landscaped this asphalt over here. You didn't think about big, bold
sweeping initiatives that could change the course of the museum."</TE>
<TE>   Ask Yaroslavsky and anyone else close to the situation why the
change and they will give you a short answer: Andrea Rich.</TE>
<TE>   Rich came to the museum in 1995 after 34 years at UCLA, where she
worked her way up from student to executive vice chancellor. She was
a controversial choice for LACMA. The trustees had been unable to
find a director who was also an art specialist, so they split the top
job and hired her as president and CEO, with the understanding that
she would find someone to oversee the art programs.</TE>
<TE>   While the art world protested, Rich rolled up the sleeves of her
trademark black pantsuits and put her faith in that hallmark of
managers: study and planning.</TE>
<TE>   Since the day she arrived at LACMA, Rich resisted pressure to make
an immediate splash--raise a pile of money, remodel the jumble of
buildings, do something, anything big. First things first, she says.
"Once I got my footing, I decided there were five stages that we need
to go through."</TE>
<TE>   First she wanted to get to know the place and fix urgent problems
at the nuts and bolts level: updating phone systems, computers and
the like. Then came bringing in someone to oversee the art side. But
after a short go-round with an outside hire, she added director to
her title and promoted two LACMA curators to deputy-director
positions--Thomas, a specialist in ancient and Islamic art, and
Robert Sobieszek, curator of photography.</TE>
<TE>   Third was a strategic "framework," which defined the museum's
place in the community, reworked its mission--with education at the
core--and articulated a broad slate of goals. When it came to
collecting, conserving and interpreting artworks, for example, it set
out objectives such as "find the means to play in the international
arena" of acquisitions.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to these essentially internal activities, Steps 4 and
5 called for a revision of the museum's physical plant and a capital
campaign. But, in Rich's view, a lot of work had to be done before
either effort went public.</TE>
<TE>   That approach led to an intense analysis of the collections and
curatorial departments, which were variously organized according to
media, geography and history. European art curators oversee works
from a particular region and time span. Modern and contemporary art
curators have an international purview of a relatively short time
period. The prints and drawings department is defined by media, but
not place or time.</TE>
<TE>   The system led to gaps and overlaps in the collection, as well as
a lack of cohesion, Rich says. "We treated time-and-place departments
the same as media-based departments. When you do that, you don't tie
anything together."</TE>
<TE>   The solution was not to abolish the time-honored departments, but
to establish those five umbrella centers, which, says Thomas, "gives
a structure to natural alliances within our staff. It gives
[collaboration] a more official status."</TE>
<TE>   The next challenge was to figure out how to physically express the
new plan. That, in turn, led to a stack of documents loaded with
facts and figures that detail every square inch of the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Part one, the relatively slim "Vision Statement," published in
August 2000, set the basic goals of a new design: Unify the divided
campus, expand facilities and provide for the centers.</TE>
<TE>   "Facility and Needs Assessment," published in September 2000, is
"a phone book-size document," says Thomas, that lays out the present
space allocations for everything from loading docks to conservation
laboratories and projects needs for the next quarter century. It
estimates, for example, that LACMA's current 127,396-piece art
holding will increase to 276,917 by 2027.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, the full board of trustees gathered at a retreat
to consider the implications of all those pages of analysis. "We
looked at what would be needed physically to achieve what they had
outlined programmatically," Weisman says. "Translated into physical
terms, it indicated that significant changes needed to be made."</TE>
<TE>   With the board's blessing, Rich began planning an architectural
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "We compiled a very broad list of about 40 names to begin with,"
she says. That was soon pared down to about 20 firms. Each was
sounded out, and the number dropped further. Renzo Piano of Basel,
Switzerland, for example, and the Geneva-based team of Jacques Herzog
&amp; Pierre de Meuron said they couldn't take on another project in
LACMA's time frame. Meanwhile, Weisman enlisted trustees Broad,
Donald L. Bren, Robert A. Day, Robert Looker, Robert F. Maguire III,
William A. Mingst, Peter Norton, Lynda Resnick and Michael G. Smooke
to serve on the architect selection committee.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Broad helped organize a LACMA-sponsored tour of museums and
architects' studios. Weisman, Rich and museum Senior Vice President
Melody Kanschat accompanied Broad on what he jokes was "a forced
march" through London, Paris, Rotterdam, Basel, Berlin and New York.
Weisman recalls it as a whirlwind of airports and appointments that
had the participants grabbing cheeseburgers at McDonald's in Berlin
"because Eli wanted to see 42 museums between 2 and 4 in the
afternoon."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the contenders visited Los Angeles, consulted with Rich
about the museum's goals and checked out the site. The selection
committee announced its choice of competitors--Holl, Koolhaas,
Libeskind, Mayne and Nouvel--in early May.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of the announcement that Nouvel and Koolhaas were in a
runoff for the LACMA job, Rich and company were setting up
independent evaluations of both plans. The architects were asked to
return to the museum to defend their designs.</TE>
<TE>   "Koolhaas' plan was based on the premise that we could reuse the
plinth, the ground floor, so that we didn't have to pour money into
that," Rich says. "That needed a lot of explaining. So did the roof.
What was it made of? How did it work?"</TE>
<TE>   The system called for air-filled panels made of Mylar membrane.
"He brought some engineering consultants from London, along with
samples and pictures of places where similar roofs had been in place
for 20 or 30 years. We brought in local engineers, a construction
firm and cost estimators, and hammered out all the issues."</TE>
<TE>   A similar set of consultants convened to consider Nouvel's plan,
Rich says. In his case, committee members were concerned about
materials for the rooftop deck and how visitors would be protected
from rain and harsh sun. They also had questions about connections
and spaces between the buildings.</TE>
<TE>   It might appear that Nouvel was a fallback choice, in case
Koolhaas couldn't satisfy the committee. That was not the case, Rich
says. "The Nouvel scheme brought the program we planned to the
fullest fruition, within the time frame and budget that we could
manage. There was significant support from committee members who
thought it was a wonderful scheme and quite beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Putting it another way, Broad says, "Many of us said that our
heads were with Nouvel, but our hearts were with the Koolhaas
design." Once they did "due diligence," as he calls their inquiries
into costs and feasibility, they felt justified in following their
hearts.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost," says Weisman, "of trying to reshape the existing
structures and the unsatisfactory nature of the result was such that
it was not an option, no matter how brilliant the scheme. Our
alternatives were a clean slate, as presented by Rem, or nothing."</TE>
<TE>   "I think that there was a deep feeling in the selection committee
that this had the capacity for greatness," Rich says. "That just
caught them up, the capacity to have something unique in the world.
And why shouldn't Los Angeles have it?"</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 5, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the full LACMA
board of trustees, the 23 members in attendance voted unanimously to
build what Koolhaas had imagined.</TE>
<TE>   Considered in 2002 dollars, all six of LACMA's current buildings
cost about $160 million. Now the museum is faced with raising almost
double that figure in order to usher in a new era.</TE>
<TE>   The county, which provides about one-third of the museum's $40.5
million in annual operating costs, helped with a one-time $10-million
grant two years ago to pay for developing the expansion and
renovation plan (some of that money paid for the architect
competition). But all the funds for Koolhaas' scheme, and more, must
be raised from private sources.</TE>
<TE>   Rich hasn't announced a capital campaign, Step 5 in her long-range
plan. She hasn't even stated a fund-raising goal, although Weisman
says the sum will include $100 million for the endowment, which along
with the $200-million building budget brings the total to at least
$300 million.</TE>
<TE>   But the "quiet phase" typical of such efforts is surely underway.
Broad, for example, hasn't disclosed what his gift will be, except to
say that it will exceed his biggest donation to a building to date,
$23 million. As daunting as Step 5 is, it isn't Rich's only concern.
The design is just a draft; virtually every detail has to be refined
and may be changed. Meanwhile, the staff has yet to find an answer
for the problem of keeping the museum up and running during three to
five years of construction. And there are signs of opposition to
fund-raising for bricks and mortar rather than artworks or art
education. "The board went unanimously berserk ...," wrote one
naysayer in the Times. "At the risk of being blasphemous, maybe there
are better places to put one-third of a billion donated cultural
dollars."</TE>
<TE>   But the design also has fans beyond the museum boundaries. Ann
Gray, publisher of L.A. Architect magazine as well as an architect
and a self-described Nouvel fan, was one who had to be persuaded.
"How could they violate the rules of the competition?" she asks.
"[But] in seeing Rem's scheme, the architecture and the contents were
in such harmony--I was absolutely won over."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky, whose district encompasses the museum, has been
enthusiastic from the start. The design "is to the exhibition of art
what [Walt] Disney Concert Hall is to the performance of music," he
says. And Art Center's Koshalek only has applause for Rich and the
board: "They took a leap of faith."</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Rich is as philosophical about the critics as she is
about the kudos: No one went berserk; no one leaped.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't come here with some big vision," she says. "I've just
been bringing people along, trying to get them to think about the big
picture. If we hadn't done a really intensive reshaping of the
internal organization around our collections and the physical
planning around that," she says, "Koolhaas couldn't have come up with
that design." And LACMA wouldn't have agreed to it.</TE>
<TE>   For Rich, still leaning forward in her black leather chair, it's
just a matter of logic.</TE>
<TE>   "We allowed all of the ideas that were possible to brought to the
table," she says. "This was purely inductive."</TE>

<HD>How Not to Open a Hall</HD>
<DH>The Philadelphia Orchestra's generally panned unveiling of
Kimmel Center holds lessons the L.A. Phil would do well to heed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Open a new concert hall, and things will go wrong. We don't need
Peter or any other principle-producer to tell us that.</LD>
<LD>   A fiasco in Philadelphia last December was the latest example, and
not all of the problems associated with the opening of the Kimmel
Center for the Performing Arts could have been helped. Some of them
are simply the nature of the beast. But it needn't have been quite so
embarrassing.</LD>
<LD>   With the Walt Disney Concert Hall starting to show its shiny
exoskeleton--and with new concert halls sprouting in Costa Mesa,
Atlanta and Montreal--it is not too soon to begin the essential
planning to avoid Philadelphia's most egregious mistakes.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Philharmonic has just begun drumming up national
business for Disney. On Valentine's Day, it held a press conference
in New York with the hall's architect, Frank O. Gehry; its
acoustician, Yasuhisa Toyota; and the orchestra's music director,
Esa-Pekka Salonen. Next month, it will take that show on the road to
Europe and possibly Japan. Given the combination of Gehry's exalted
architecture, Toyota's radical surround-sound acoustical design and
Salonen's fresh musical thinking for the orchestra, Disney Hall is
expected to do wonders for L.A.'s cultural image.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Philadelphia, in New York's shadow, has an image
problem as well. And now, 21/2 months after opening its highly touted
Kimmel Center--the product of elegant architect Rafael Vinoly and
noted acoustician Russell Johnson--Philadelphia has a worse image
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Acoustics are always the main worry with any new hall. With so
many variables, no one really knows exactly how an orchestra will
sound until it sets foot inside and begins to play. The first
rehearsal provides raw information. A hall has different acoustical
characteristics when sound reflects off empty seats or is absorbed by
bodies filling them. Musicians need time and practice to learn how to
use a space. As materials settle and wood ages during the first
several months, the sonic character of a hall is likely to mellow,
but how or how much is unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   With a Russell Johnson hall, there are additional factors. The
acoustician favors electronically adjustable reflecting panels,
curtains and sound chambers that can make an orchestra's acoustical
learning curve that much steeper. Toyota's "vineyard" model (so
called because it creates terraces and pavilions of seats) doesn't
include those bells and whistles, but still there will be subtle
options for tuning the hall over time.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that opening nights never show off a hall's
full sonic potential. And this tends to be made worse by the fact
that concert halls are rarely completed on schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Hall, the orchestra's home in Kimmel Center, was so far
behind schedule that workers were at it around the clock, right up to
the day it opened. Even then, Johnson's acoustical machinery was not
yet operational. Not only did the orchestra have little time to
rehearse in the hall, but the building itself was far from ready for
public performances. And it will be some time before Johnson's
acoustical accoutrements are finished and the orchestra learns how
best to use them.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, concerts are being given. I hold out hope that Verizon
will turn out fine--I heard a glimmer of sonic sparkle amid the
opening-night blare, but most early reviews of Verizon were negative,
if guarded. Critics at the Philadelphia Inquirer have been reporting
that as work continues, the hall sounds different on every occasion
they visit it. London's Financial Times gave the Philadelphians a
two-month grace period before checking out the hall, and still found
an acoustic mess. Costa Mesa beware, because Johnson has the same
system in mind for the new addition to the Orange County Performing
Arts Center.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 1: Don't be impatient. It may be impossible to take up
residence in a fully seasoned hall, but Philadelphia would have done
itself a favor had it waited until the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, this is a lesson that our Philharmonic seems to have
learned. Disney was supposed to be ready next January, but the
orchestra decided to play it safe and open the hall at the beginning
of the 2003-4 season. Still, that's no guarantee of anything.
Construction on any hall is very intricate; the complexity of Disney
Hall seems almost nightmarishly so. Constant pressure needs to be
applied to make sure it is ready early enough so that the musicians
will have a reasonable amount of time to rehearse in it before they
let the rest of us in.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 2: Programming, programming, programming. It's the most
important component of a hall's opening, and it is entirely in the
orchestra's control. Yet it is the one that is most often botched.</TE>
<TE>   These are gala events. Ticket prices are high, the crowd
exclusive. Kimmel Center charged $5,000 a seat for its two-night
inauguration of Verizon Hall. But a gala mentality can be a recipe
for disaster.</TE>
<TE>   When a great orchestra is at its best, when it can bring to life
the music that means the most to it, it doesn't matter where it
plays. I love hearing the Berlin Philharmonic in its home, the
Philharmonie (the original vineyard-style auditorium), and I dislike
the colorless acoustics of Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County
center. But the Berliners' signature Beethoven sounded spectacular
when they visited there last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia made one wrong programming choice after another. On
Verizon's first night, Elton John ignored acoustics altogether with
blasting loudspeakers that drove symphony lovers (including the
architect and acoustician) out of the hall. The center's namesake
benefactor, Sidney Kimmel, who paid John's $2-million fee out of his
own pocket, told the press he feared that the Philadelphia Orchestra
wasn't quite festive enough for that occasion.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, he was right. The next evening, the orchestra gave an
uninspired concert. It commissioned a new piece from Aaron Kernis
simply because he is a native Philadelphian. But the orchestra has
had little experience with Kernis' music, and its Old World German
music director, Wolfgang Sawallisch, has little feeling for its
American idiom. It didn't go well.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrity-struck, management programmed that rare Beethoven dud,
the Triple Concerto, for no other reason than it wanted Itzhak
Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax on stage. Finally, the orchestral
glitter of the second suite from Ravel's "Daphnis and Chloe" was
meant to show off the lush "Philadelphia Sound." But Sawallisch is no
sensualist, offering a performance that was all luster and no lust.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 3: If a new work is commissioned (and the temptation is
irresistible), keep in mind that the performers are dealing with a
lot that is new, and new music will be a risky proposition unless the
conductor and the players have a relationship with the composer.
Although the Los Angeles Philharmonic refuses to confirm that it has
commissioned a work from John Adams, it is an open secret that has
been reported on Internet music sites. If so, that would make perfect
sense. Two years ago, Adams wrote his largest orchestra work, "Naive
and Sentimental Music," for the Philharmonic, and Salonen's
performance of it was a triumph. Next season, Adams will participate
in a special residency with the Philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the orchestra needs to demonstrate what makes it
thrilling. There is much that the Philharmonic can choose from. I
would put Stravinsky and Ligeti high on the list. Salonen's own "LA
Variations" is ideal; it is a brilliant showpiece written explicitly
for this band, and it perfectly represents what conductor and
orchestra stand for. Had Sawallisch stuck to his composers--Strauss,
Wagner, Brahms, Dvorak--it might have been easier to overlook
everything else that went wrong on the opening night.</TE>
<TE>   As for soloists, if absolutely necessary (and they aren't), they
must be chosen with great care. The Big Names are so often
encountered at galas that they can actually make a special occasion
seem ordinary.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 4: No speeches. The Philadelphia Orchestra introduced
its Verizon opener with a half-hour of provincial self-congratulation
from inarticulate arts managers and slick politicians. Kernis' piece
then played to an already antsy audience, its ears by then accustomed
to the amplified sound of loudspeakers and no longer quite as fresh
for live music. If at some point Salonen wants to say something to
the audience during the Disney opening, that's fine, as long as it is
him and him alone. He's good at it and has no tolerance for
stupidity. But first, let there be music.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a larger issue in this lesson, which is the role
psycho-acoustics play in any concert. In their gala mind-set, the
Philadelphians wanted to get the concert over with as quickly as
possible so they could hold a dinner and dance in the lobby
afterward. To do so, they played the program without intermission.
But as anyone who plans concerts should know, the second half of
concerts is almost always better than the first. After intermission,
the players tend to be less nervous and more comfortable with their
acoustical surroundings. The audience, as well, has become more
acclimated.</TE>
<TE>   An intermission also provides an opportunity to fix things. At
Verizon, the air conditioner was out of control, and it became so
cold that several women in the audience, wearing strapless gowns,
could bear it no longer and left early to huddle in the one women's
room where they could find heat. It is not hard to guess what they
are most likely to remember about the evening.</TE>
<TE>   A final lesson: Consider just how much a new concert hall can mean
to a city. In Australia, Sydney built an opera house and got a whole
new symbol for city and country. What does it say about Philadelphia
when during the dinner following the Philadelphia Orchestra's first
appearance in Verizon, the dance band immediately struck up "I Left
My Heart in San Francisco"?</TE>
<TE>   Disney Hall also needs to be especially careful about how it
presents itself--and Los Angeles--to the world. It isn't too late,
for example, to undo its decision to honor corporate sponsorship by
naming its auditorium after Ralphs/Food 4 Less Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   It may not be as bad as Philadelphia capitulating to a corporate
moniker, Verizon, for the orchestra's hall. Only Disney's main
auditorium will be saddled with the risible Ralphs designation, which
the Philharmonic's spokespeople say will be confined to a small,
tasteful plaque.</TE>
<TE>   Still, small details can loom large, especially when they have the
potential to wreak havoc on perceptions. Once Philly's air
conditioner had raised the wrong sort of opening-night goose bumps,
even an acoustical masterpiece might not have sounded warm.</TE>

<DH>Indie label Vagrant Records' specialty--tuneful 'emo'--is
resonating with fans seeking relief from teen pop and shock rock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The offices of Vagrant Records are what you might call Upscale
Warehouse. The converted paper manufacturing plant on a strip of
wholesale industrial businesses in Hollywood resembles those spartan
loft spaces that blossomed all over California during the dot-com
boom. Raw concrete floors coexist with Pottery Barn furniture,
oversized photographs of Vagrant's artists hang on the walls, and two
old-school video games idly hum in the back of the large main room.</LD>
<LD>   The vibe here is convivial but industrious. Label founder Rich
Egan's office door is always open, and he can usually be heard
bouncing tour revenue projections and idle chatter to director of
artist relations Tricia McNulty, who works in the adjacent office.</LD>
<LD>   Vagrant is so employee-friendly that it even has a modest
child-care room, with kiddie toys strewn on a Fisher-Price area rug.
"Rich actually uses that space for himself," says Vagrant co-owner
Jon Cohen, zipping by the space en route to Egan's office. "It's
kinda like Brian Wilson and his sandbox."</LD>
<TE>   From this cozy sanctum, Egan, Cohen and their 12 employees are
swimming against the music industry current. The independent rock
label, which celebrates its 10th anniversary this year, is one of the
past year's most surprising success stories, a company that Spin
magazine recently called "the Death Row of indie rock," a reference
to the landmark rap label.</TE>
<TE>   Proffering a tuneful, reflective brand of pop-punk that has been
labeled "emo"--short for emotion--Vagrant is selling a lot of records
to an audience that has welcomed a viable alternative to the
shock-rock tactics of nu-metal and the synthetic soul of teeny-bop
pop.</TE>
<TE>   Like L.A. indie labels that preceded it, Vagrant has become a
rallying point for a musical movement.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '80s, Greg Ginn's South Bay label SST became known as
a haven for hard-core pacesetters Black Flag as well as whip-smart
punk bands such as Husker Du and the Minutemen. Slash, which started
as a fanzine and eventually signed a distribution deal with Warner
Bros., covered L.A.'s punk (the band X) and roots-rock (Los Lobos,
the Blasters) flanks. In the '90s, Brett Gurewitz's Epitaph helped
launch the punk revival with the Offspring and Rancid.</TE>
<TE>   The emo trend is virtually synonymous with Vagrant, something that
pleases the label's founder to no end.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that people think of Vagrant that way is just amazing,"
says Egan, who as a kid would line up all of his SST records and
stare at the cover art for hours. "You knew when you were buying an
SST record that it was always gonna be good, and that's how I want
Vagrant to be. I want this label to be the Motown of punk."</TE>
<TE>   Among the artists on Vagrant's 17-band roster (see story, Page 79)
are New Jersey quartet Saves the Day, whose third album, "Stay What
You Are," is the label's best-seller at close to 200,000 copies, and
the Get Up Kids, a Lawrence, Kans., quintet whose second album,
"Something to Write Home About," has just passed the 150,000 mark.
Those are huge numbers in the indie-rock world, where only a handful
of artists ever break the six-figure sales barrier.</TE>
<TE>   Vagrant's most compelling artist is Dashboard Confessional, the
pseudonym for Florida-based singer-songwriter Chris Carrabba, a
26-year-old punk with a sensitive streak a mile long and a growing
cult of fans who hang on to every word of his sorrow-drenched
ruminations on relationships. Carrabba's Vagrant debut, "The Places
You Have Come to Fear the Most," is the label's fastest
seller--135,000 gone in less than a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that [Egan and Cohen] are incredibly passionate
about the music they put out, and how they get it across," says
Carrabba, who headlines the House of Blues in West Hollywood March
11-12. "They have carved a certain niche, but there's a wide spectrum
of music within that niche. And they're great to work with. It's been
an amazing time for me."</TE>
<TE>   Vagrant's success has come at a time when the music industry is
mired in a major slump. Record sales are down at the major labels.
Rosters have been slashed and costs have been cut. Label-sponsored
Internet download services such as Pressplay.com and MusicNet.com
have yet to catch on with consumers.</TE>
<TE>   It's not exactly a prime time for an indie label to make a major
play for market share, but that's just what Vagrant has done.</TE>
<TE>   "Vagrant is really smart in who they sign and then executing the
marketing plan," says Tom Calderone, senior vice president of music
and talent programming for the MTV networks. MTV2 frequently plays
videos by Vagrant acts such as Saves the Day, Dashboard and the Get
Up Kids. "They get the music out there in a grass-roots way. Nothing
is too hyped and nothing is force-fed, which means their artists will
have a longer shelf life down the road."</TE>
<TE>   On this busy Friday in the Vagrant offices, there have been a
number of encouraging developments on the Dashboard Confessional
front. "Late Night With Conan O'Brien" and Carson Daly's late-night
talk show have extended offers for Carrabba to perform. In addition,
MTV has called to inform Egan that the video for Carrabba's single
"Screaming Infidelities" will debut the following Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Egan is also keeping a close watch on Dashboard's radio play. "How
many spins are we getting in Seattle?" he asks Bill Carroll,
Vagrant's radio promotion man, who's on the receiving end of one in a
series of daily phone calls. "CIMX is adding Dashboard in Detroit?
That's great!"</TE>
<TE>   To watch the affable Egan work the phones is to observe a master
schmoozer. The Santa Monica native is the kind of record executive
artists dream of working with. A tireless cheerleader for his
bands--his management company Hard 8 handles Dashboard Confessional,
the Get Up Kids, Face to Face and Saves the Day--Egan keeps close
tabs on every facet of his acts' progress, from posters to in-store
appearances. This morning, he will have talked to radio programmers,
tour managers, retail rack-jobbers and a few of his
artists--prodding, praising, browbeating.</TE>
<TE>   "This label mirrors my taste in music," Egan says during a rare
lull . "I didn't know I was signing emo bands. The unifying thread
for me has been to sign artists who write serious songs. I was never
attracted to meathead punk."</TE>
<TE>   Rave reviews for Dashboard notwithstanding, Vagrant has made its
mark without the kind of critics' consensus that congealed around
earlier indie labels such as Matador and Sub Pop--not one Vagrant
record made the list this year in the Village Voice's annual critics'
poll. But there's no doubt that the label has resonated with
disaffected rock fans.</TE>
<TE>   Egan chalks it up to "kids just getting sick of bands getting
naked and smearing peanut butter on themselves. They're looking for
more depth in their bands."</TE>
<TE>   Egan and Cohen run Vagrant as fastidiously as any managers of a
thriving mid-level company. Their costs are close to the bone, but
they don't skimp on expenses where it counts most--recording their
bands' albums. Egan recruits A-list producers such as Rob Schnapf
(Beck, Foo Fighters, Moby, Elliott Smith) and Scott Litt (R.E.M., the
Replacements, Patti Smith) to work with his green bands, ensuring
that raw passion doesn't trump polish.</TE>
<TE>   Through 10 years of trial and error, the partners have developed
an artist-friendly business approach, in which phrases such as
"career development" and "tour support" aren't just bait tossed out
to lure bands to the label.</TE>
<TE>   Egan and Cohen involve their artists in every facet of the
decision-making process. Egan's first meeting of this day, with Face
to Face members Trever Keith and drummer Pete Parada, is a
date-by-date breakdown of the trio's upcoming spring tour.</TE>
<TE>   The itinerary is grueling--48 dates in 51 nights--but Keith wants
to see if the band can squeeze in even more shows. He consults a
giant map of the U.S. behind Egan's desk and traces a finger across
the Northeast. "Can we go from Jersey to Buffalo and still make it to
Cincinnati?" Keith asks Egan.</TE>
<TE>   The band will also need to rent a tour bus, hire a tour manager
and find someone to sell merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere is collegial but strictly business. "The key is to
keep the bands happy," says Cohen, a graduate of Palisades High
School and UC Davis who periodically pops into Egan's office to
confer. "Our whole motto is 'Put the bands first and everything else
will follow.' If we put our interests ahead of the bands', we're
gonna die."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Vagrant offers healthy royalty rates that in some
cases are higher than the industry average for emerging bands, as
well as decent advances so Vagrant's artists can live comfortably
while recording their albums. Adds Egan, "We don't hide the ball from
our artists."</TE>
<TE>   Vagrant is hardly an overnight success, which has been to the
label's advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Egan, who grew up in Santa Monica, attended Loyola High School
and, after a few "false starts," went to Loyola Marymount University.
Egan was a huge fan of punk. "I grew up on Southern California punk
rock," he says. "The Descendents, Social Distortion, Black Flag.
Luckily, I had two older sisters, and they prevented me from becoming
a total dork."</TE>
<TE>   Egan held a number of short-term jobs before starting Vagrant,
including a short stint in the mailroom at Creative Artists Agency,
until he was fired for "hitting the main guy's golf teacher in the
eye with a paperclip."</TE>
<TE>   Egan conceived the Vagrant label in 1992 and brought in his buddy
Cohen, who put up the initial seed money, in order to release a few
singles from a couple of obscure Boston bands. Egan then put together
a boxed set of singles called "West by North-South" in 1994 that
featured such bands as Face to Face, Down by Law and Samiam, and
marketed the compilation by placing small ads in a couple of
fanzines. He sold all 1,000 copies in three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Egan, whose late father, Richard Egan Sr., was a popular TV actor
in the '50s, continued to run Vagrant as a hobby while waiting tables
at night and conducting business from his Hollywood apartment. "I
didn't have a clue what I was doing," Egan says. "Jon [Cohen] and I
would drink good coffee and conduct imaginary magazine interviews
with each other."</TE>
<TE>   The label's breakthrough came in 1998 with a live album from Face
to Face that sold more than 80,000 copies. Vagrant's first studio
album, Boxer's "the Hurt Process," was also released that year. "We
didn't want to sign anyone until we were absolutely ready to do so,"
Egan says.</TE>
<TE>   Every Vagrant band has a tailor-made marketing plan. For emerging
acts such as Audio Learning Center and the Anniversary, the objective
is to build word of mouth, then tour relentlessly and create an
organic buzz.</TE>
<TE>   For established acts such as the Get Up Kids, whose new album will
be released in April, the label will opt for an aggressive approach
with a large shipment of CDs to such chain stores as Best Buy and
Target, and ads on Internet sites Punkband.com, Punknews.org and
Insound.com as well as the band's own Web site, www.thegetupkids.net.</TE>
<TE>   "Alkaline Trio had never sold more than 15,000 copies of their two
previous albums, but we knew they were primed to sell more," Egan
says of another Vagrant act. "We sold 40,000 of their Vagrant album
['From Here to Infirmary') the first week by getting their record
into the chains. It was just a simple supply and demand issue. They
were bigger than they even knew they were."</TE>
<TE>   Egan and Cohen have been careful to avoid the mistakes that have
taken down indie labels in the past. They have no use for hubris, and
the last thing they want to do is rest on their laurels. If the
records are good, everything else will follow.</TE>
<TE>   "People have this image of punk rock as holier-than-thou," says
Egan, now slumped on Cohen's couch at the end of a business day. "But
there are indies that are just as screwed up as majors because they
don't have the resources to take care of their bands, or they lock
them into long-term deals. But working with bands is like raising
children. You've got to nurture them and look after them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Key Vagrant Bands</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saves the Day</TE>
<TE>   Zippy pop-punk with pointed, lovesick lyrics and a lot of
endearing hooks. It's as if this New Jersey quartet learned its moves
from Jawbreaker and Green Day's "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life),"
and proceeded accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Get Up Kids</TE>
<TE>   The Lawrence, Kan., quintet delivers astringent pop with a
sardonic lyrical edge.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dashboard Confessional</TE>
<TE>   Acoustic reflections on bruised souls and troubled relationships
from a tattooed troubadour. Vagrant's in-house heartthrob is winning
over new fans by the week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Face to Face, Rocket From the Crypt</TE>
<TE>   Vagrant's Grand Old Men of Punk. Both Southern California bands
are major-label dissidents who have fervent followings and steady
record sales in the high five-figure range.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alkaline Trio</TE>
<TE>   Along with Face to Face and Rocket, one of Vagrant's
dyed-in-the-wool punk bands. No sunny tunes to be found here--just
lots of turbo-powered missives about betrayal and abandonment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New Amsterdams</TE>
<TE>   Smart love and mercy songs with a rootsy lilt from
singer-songwriter Matthew Pryor; records for the Get Up Kids' Vagrant
imprint, Heroes and Villains.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Anniversary</TE>
<TE>   Elaborately arranged baroque pop from Lawrence, Kan. This is the
most un-Vagrant-like band on the Vagrant label.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Audio Learning Center</TE>
<TE>   Fractured, self-referential indie rock that's a throwback to the
genre's salad days of the mid-'90s. The band most likely to win over
older Pavement fans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hot Rod Circuit</TE>
<TE>   Melodic punk that bounces off the walls like a tween on a sourball
sugar-rush.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hey Mercedes</TE>
<TE>   The Wisconsin quartet's wall-of-sound emo is firmly in the Saves
the Day/Get Up Kids camp, but its lyrics are a touch more elliptical
and abstruse.</TE>

<HD>Still on Her Terms</HD>
<DH>After dropping out of Hollywood in the '90s, Debra Winger
isn't so much returning as fading in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELE WILLENS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>She may be well versed in Tolstoy and James Agee these days, but
Debra Winger would still feel just fine taking a ride on that
mechanical bull. Debra Winger--remember her? If your memory span is
short or you're under say, 30, you have every right not to. She was
last on the screen in the very forgettable "Forget Paris" opposite
Billy Crystal. That was six years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "It's true you haven't seen me in a long time unless you go to the
legitimate theater in Boston or you've been a student at Harvard,"
says the actress, who has reemerged as producer and co-star of "Big
Bad Love," a small, offbeat film directed by, and starring, her
husband, Arliss Howard.</LD>
<LD>   It's based on the short stories of Mississippi writer Larry Brown,
and features Paul LeMat as Howard's war buddy, Rosanna Arquette as a
funeral home heiress and Angie Dickinson in what could only be
described as the Gena Rowlands role. But clearly it is Winger, still
charismatic after all these years, who has the best chance of
bringing anyone into the theater--if for no other reason than to see
what the heck has become of her.</LD>
<TE>   Well, rest easy. The navy-blue eyes are still as expressive as
ever. The velvet croak is intact. As is the voluptuous body that
memorably rode that bull in her 1980 movie breakthrough, "Urban
Cowboy." OK, she's looking close to her almost 47 years, but she
doesn't seem to mind. Nor does she look back at her quiet exit from
mainstream Hollywood for most of the '90s with anything resembling
regret. She just got fed up with the lack of interesting offers and
made other choices.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't like announce my retirement, but I didn't look back and
I was busy all the time," says the three-time Oscar nominee ("Terms
of Endearment," "An Officer and a Gentleman," "Shadowlands"), sitting
in the offices of IFC, which is distributing the film. She's dressed
in black slacks and sweater, her auburn hair brushed out. "Time
accelerates as you get older, and now when I hear it's been six
years, it doesn't feel like it. I mean, I had a baby, my mom passed,
I taught, I did two plays. I lived my life."</TE>
<TE>   Still, to those around her and the industry in general, it felt as
if she had said good riddance. "I realize that I'd created this
system of roadblocks around me, so that even if there was some good
material, it probably wouldn't have gotten to me," she concedes. "I
wasn't reading and I wasn't out there looking. My agent bugged me for
about a year, then he saw I was doing my thing and I was happy."</TE>
<TE>   That agent, Rick Nicita, says that after 20 years, he knows his
client well: "It's always been about the process more than the end
result with Debra, and I just wouldn't send her material that would
lead to an experience I knew she wouldn't enjoy. There has been an
assumption she didn't want to be in the business, and maybe having
her back on screen will correct that assumption."</TE>
<TE>   Nicita admits that "Debra doesn't always go down easily,"
referring to her sometimes tempestuous behavior. In fact, some might
have believed the wild-child leanings--difficult on the set and a
lover of some of the finer vices in life--ultimately led to her
disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely think I filled a slot," she says. "Nobody could do
everything they said I did or else I'd be dead. And there always
seems to be a slot for the Hollywood bad girl. As for being tough on
set, I spoke my mind and it wasn't gender correct. Those were the
days that when the male star went to his trailer, it was because he
must be getting into a really intense scene. If a girl went to her
trailer, she was having her period. I kind of knew it at the time and
didn't care, as long as I got to do what I wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the erratic behavior stemmed from a near-fatal accident
(she fell off the back of a truck) when she was 17. "Once you've come
up against death, you're part of a club," she says. "In my 20s, I
went into its negative side for a while where I felt immortal, that I
could do anything, live crazily. Then it started to resonate in a
good way."</TE>
<TE>   At that point, she says, she started to get more picky in her
choices, and during much of her 30s was seen (or not) in less
commercial fare, ("Betrayal," "Everybody Wins," "Sheltering Sky"),
working with foreign directors such as Costa-Gavras, Karl Reisz and
Bernardo Bertolucci. She was responding to an independent spirit
unhampered by the money side of the film business.</TE>
<TE>   Her growing disenchantment was confirmed during the unhappy
experience she and Robert Redford endured on "Legal Eagles." ("We
were like POWs together," she says, laughing.) The death knell was in
1995 when she, Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp were 21/2 weeks into
shooting a film called "The Divine Rapture" in a tiny town in Ireland
when the producers lost their financing, closed shop, and everyone
but Winger was gone within hours.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always said you can't put a film together--as I just did
with 'Big Bad Love'--until you've seen one fall apart, as I did in
Ireland," she says. "Everyone just left in the middle of the night
while I stayed until I saw that all these local people--like the
fisherman who'd given us his boat and hadn't been able to use it for
weeks--got paid. I didn't know about anyone else, but I wanted to be
able to come home and sleep at night."</TE>
<TE>   From then on, the focus changed. She and Howard--who have been
married 11 years--were living in New York, raising two sons, one his
by a previous marriage, one hers by first husband Timothy Hutton.
Both are now 14. She and Howard had a son four years ago and have
since moved about 20 minutes out of the city.</TE>
<TE>   There is a warm and effusive maturity about her now, and a
piercing and quick wit: "Her extraordinary ability for comedy has
never been tapped by Hollywood," claims Howard, who first met Winger
when they made "Wilder Napalm" (1993). "Debra started as a stand-up
and is naturally very funny."</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, she and Howard performed in "How I Learned to
Drive" and "Ivanov" at the American Repertory Theatre in Boston. The
timing was exquisite, as she'd simultaneously been invited by Harvard
University professor and child development expert Robert Coles to be
one of his teaching fellows for a class called "The Literature of
Social Reflection." She'd been introduced to Coles through her
onetime companion Bob Kerrey, the former Nebraska governor and
senator, and had met with Coles in connection with a documentary she
was researching on the spiritual life of children.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly she was cramming the classics for her work with 20
seniors whom she would lecture once a week about interpreting great
literary works through their life experiences. "Debra is an
intellectual, well-grounded in literature, and her contribution was
phenomenal," says Peter Emerson, a political  consultant who was also
a teaching fellow that semester. "Celebrity doesn't really have any
currency at Harvard, and for these students reflecting on their
lives, her great facility in storytelling was what mattered."</TE>
<TE>   "I'd had a terrible lower education so this was a thrilling
experience for me," Winger recalls. "That summer before the fall I
was set to teach, I never felt so alive. I'd never read in such a
vibrant way. I can't compare it to anything except when I hear the
film going through the camera. You have a level of [alertness] that
is like a drug." The reading seriously slowed the past two years
during which she and Howard took on "Big Bad Love."</TE>
<TE>   He and his brother James wrote the script, financing was found,
and cast and crew moved to Mississippi to shoot. A few weeks in, the
financing disappeared. Rather than let everyone go home while they
regrouped, Winger and Howard decided to produce the film themselves,
shoot and edit, and worry about distribution later.</TE>
<TE>   "Arliss and I took this long walk that ended in a Mississippi
graveyard at dawn and decided we'd do it ourselves," Winger says. "We
would make the film we wanted to make, not allow some Edward
Scissorhands at a studio to take it over at some point."</TE>
<TE>   They were impressed with IFC because its marketing staff had
experience opening small films slowly. "These are human beings who
have ideas about grass-roots campaigns," says Winger, who is involved
right down to the ads. "We're trying to pioneer having ads without
those freaking quotes on them. Like Joe Shmo saying, 'It will make
you laugh, it will make you cry.' I said just run it clean or I'll
get a quote from my gardener, because that's what it's come to."</TE>
<TE>   Although she doesn't have specific expectations for the
film--"Hope is a four-letter word; the movie will have its
life"--clearly there's more at stake now, evidenced by the fact that
she is doing the film festivals and interviews to promote it. Should
audiences find this little tale of a struggling writer and the family
he abandoned, they'll be rewarded by Winger's take on what could have
been a traditional role.</TE>
<TE>   "I was intrigued with the idea of the ex-wife, which is often such
a negative title," she says. "I wanted to play how hard it is to keep
the heart open when the well-worn groove is toward bitterness. Here
is a woman who has every right to be bitter--he's not helping with
the kids, she's holding down two shifts. I also didn't want to go too
far the other way, with just enough antidepressants to end up a
doormat. In this world of exes we've become, it's not all about
lawyers and alienation."</TE>
<TE>   The chemistry with Howard is palpable, a connection that was there
even before they met. Winger recalls sneaking into a multiplex and
standing to watch some of "Men Don't Leave," starring Jessica Lange
and Howard as the new man in her life. "After that movie, women
referred to his portrayal as the Best Boyfriend Award," Winger says,
laughing, "so I guess I could take that one step further."</TE>
<TE>   Truth is, she's one of those heat-generating actresses who has
mustered chemistry with many of Hollywood's leading men. Travolta
was, as she says, "at the acme of Travolta-dom" when she played his
young wife in "Urban Cowboy." Still the fireworks were there. "John
was and is sweet," she says. "I didn't say fun and I didn't say easy,
I said sweet."</TE>
<TE>   Although audiences loved her and Richard Gere in "An Officer and a
Gentleman" (1982), the experience was a nightmare for her. "There was
a mutual respect, but it's well-known we didn't connect," she says.
"I was dealt an unbelievable deal during that film and felt I needed
to be saved in real life, but I was only saved in the last scene of
the movie. Let's not forget I was being handed water-retention pills
after they saw dailies," she says of producers who feared she
appeared overweight on screen. "The whole experience was reckless and
the film was just about shelved. They had no idea what they had when
they threw it out there."</TE>
<TE>   She looks back much more fondly toward Redford--"How can you not
love a guy who hasn't had facial surgery?"--and Anthony Hopkins, her
co-star in "Shadowlands" (1993). "We still keep in touch. I only wish
he would work a little less. He's more complex than his roles allow
him to be." Her favorite was John Malkovich, with whom she starred in
"Sheltering Sky" (1990). "I just so admire the arc of his career and
he doesn't [care] in the right way."</TE>
<TE>   From the days of "Terms of Endearment" (1983), when she hung with
Jack Nicholson while locking horns with Shirley MacLaine, Winger
remains a guy's gal. "I do still have more male friends," she says,
"though it's not like I love the way a man's mind works. That's an
oxymoron! It's just a lot easier sometimes, there's not so much
twisting and turning. Even though there are a lot of female
executives at studios these days, for example, you need to check the
long fingernails for flesh." She's back and still speaking the mind
that is sharper than ever, and tempered only by age and experience
and a healthy perspective tailor-made for these post-Sept. 11 times.
"We have a really normal life--these days mostly it's about JV
basketball games," says Winger, who says living closer to the action
was really never for her. "Ever since I was a kid and lived in Los
Angeles, I was spooked by the [unchanging] weather. And there's just
a consciousness on the East Coast that I prefer."</TE>
<TE>   Taking a smaller but mature role in "Big Bad Love" is not, she
insists, any kind of message to Hollywood: "I don't really know who
those people are and I don't think they offered me many movies before
I disappeared, except when I was very young. For the first year and a
half or so, I questioned my decision of fading out, but then, I'm a
self-examiner by nature. But my mom, right before she died, reminded
me how fleeting life is, and I've been trying really hard to witness
the deal. It all goes so fast you might as well try to catch some of
it."</TE>
<TE>   When she looks back at the girl on the bull, she recognizes her:
"I'm basically the same, though hopefully I've grown at the way I
look at life. It's about how long you let yourself get away before
you start the road back. I'd never claim to be evolved, but I've
certainly re-volved several times."</TE>

<HD>Election Is an Important Test of Our Patriotism</HD>

<LD>Old Glory can fly above our cars, hang from our porches and adorn our
lapels. We can talk about the greatness of America. While we may
shake our fists at television images of Saddam, Osama and Milosevic,
it is in the quiet voting booth that the true fire of patriotism
burns. For Orange County residents, an important test of patriotism
will be measured when we have the first opportunity to vote since
Sept. 11. We should be more conscious than ever of this right as we
welcome home the heroic men and women who eliminated the repressive
Taliban regime.</LD>
<LD>   The health and well-being of our country is reaffirmed in a
polling place down the street from our homes, in a neighbor's garage
or at the local elementary school. It is the right to vote that
distinguishes the U.S. from repressive governments that destroy the
freedom of the individual.</LD>
<TE>   In the summer of 1787, the framers of the Constitution met in
Philadelphia to design a new, revolutionary form of government.
Rather than a powerful ruler granting privileges and rights to the
people, the people would grant power to a government. Americans have
courageously protected their right to determine how they should be
governed and who should govern them from Yorktown to Gettysburg.
America's greatness is intrinsically bound to a Constitution that
allows citizens to participate. Without that involvement, we cannot
survive as a representative democracy.</TE>
<TE>   We should all be concerned about the level of participation by
Orange County voters in previous elections. In a report from the
League of Women Voters, we are warned about voter apathy: "Citizens
are too often withdrawing from the political process....Voter
participation has hit the lowest level since 1924. Democracy is
weakened and government less accountable when people don't vote."</TE>
<TE>   We enjoy unmatched prosperity, opportunity and freedom because
historically Americans have taken civic responsibility to study the
issues, familiarize themselves with the candidates and make informed
choices. On election day we have the opportunity to preserve and
protect our sovereignty. This electoral process may be a heavy
responsibility, but the power, the very strength of our government is
derived from the men and women who take the time to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Our love of country should be matched by our love of the
democratic process that gives each citizen the precious right to
vote.</TE>

<HD>More Pleas to Support, Oust Tony Rackauckas</HD>

<LD>Re "Plea Bargains in O.C. Increase in Third-Strike Cases," Feb. 15:</LD>
<LD>   It's great to see that Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas is allowing his
deputies to dispense justice and not act as mere pawns in the
administration of justice. Unlike his predecessor, Mike Capizzi, who
forbade his deputies to plea-bargain third-strike cases, Rackauckas
allows his prosecutors, those most familiar with the cases, to
dispense justice by plea-bargaining those cases that do not warrant
the severe 25-years-to-life sentence. Rackauckas should be
congratulated and not criticized for his actions.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, we have Wally Wade, a career prosecutor of 21
years with the district attorney's office who is endorsed by his
peers in the Assn. of Orange County Deputy District Attorneys along
with practically every law enforcement organization in Orange County.
Those are the professionals closest to the issues, and they ought to
know. I'm pleased to see that The Times recently endorsed Wade. Wade
is squeaky-clean and an individual who combines conservative
sensibilities with progressive sensitivities.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand we have Tony Rackauckas, who is an embarrassment
to Orange County. After only three years in office he is already
under investigation by the Orange County Grand Jury.</TE>
<TE>   I wish there were a choice, but there isn't. Wade has the
integrity and proven qualifications to be district attorney.
Rackauckas doesn't, and he must go.</TE>

<HD>Not Rambo</HD>
<DH>SOLDIERS : Fighting Men's Lives, 1901-2001, By Philip
Ziegler, Alfred A. Knopf: 352 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH L. GALLOWAY</AU>
<BD>Joseph L. Galloway is the co-author of "We Were
Soldiers Once and Young" and "Triumph Without Victory: A History of
the Persian Gulf War."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are unexceptional men, these nine old soldiers Philip Ziegler
rounded up and interviewed at length at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, a
particularly English institution for men of their sort. Through their
eyes and their stories, the reader gets a different look at the 20th
century, the English, their families and their army. Though they
represent a dying empire, they are, in essence, Everyman or at least
every soldier who ever wore a uniform in any country.</LD>
<LD>   In "Soldiers: Fighting Men's Lives, 1901-2001," the storytelling
is understated and matter-of-fact. Not a Rambo in this lot of what
the British call "other ranks," or enlisted men, though there are men
here, including Albert Alexandre, who saw action in the trenches at
Ypres and Passchendaele in World War I at the tender age of 16; and
Thomas Parnell, who rode on the last British Army horse patrol into
the Khyber Pass in August 1939; and Douglas Wright, who escaped
Dunkirk to become a commando who raided behind enemy lines.</LD>
<TE>   All nine of Ziegler's soldiers had, in their twilight years,
entered the old soldiers' home. There they live a monastic life where
their basic needs are basically met: A room so tiny it is called a
berth, 5 feet by 9 feet. Three square meals a day. The comfort of
military rules and military neighbors. They are trotted out once or
twice a year on parade in their distinctive scarlet coats and
tricorner hats, symbols of a lost empire.</TE>
<TE>   How they ended up taking the king's shilling is a story in itself.
Most signed up to escape homes with too many children and not enough
food, in neighborhoods where there was no other way to escape a brief
brutal life in the coal mine. Poverty was the norm. They left as soon
as they could, some signing up as "boy soldiers," or apprentice
soldiers, at 14 or 15, trading a life at home often so harsh that it
made barracks life and the tender mercies of a tough sergeant major
look good by comparison.</TE>
<TE>   The women in their lives, be they mothers or wives, have
nonspeaking, nonvoting parts in these life dramas, worn down or worn
out by too many children and too much work and too little support and
husbands who drink up what little money they earns. The wives put up
with frequent moves, living with parents when no army quarters are
available, and long separations. Small wonder the men of these
stories are widowers or divorced.</TE>
<TE>   The men do as the army tells them, even when it makes no sense.
They are "rushed" out East to India or Burma at a time when that
journey takes several weeks--only then to be "rushed" back to
England. They are on occasion lost in transit, in a way that only
armies can contrive, left dangling for weeks or months in some
holding camp where they were never intended to have landed.
Promotions are won and lost. Good guys can finish last.</TE>
<TE>   The nine in this book serve in peacetime in India, Ceylon, Malaya,
Hong Kong, Malta, Cyprus, Palestine, Syria, Iraq, Aden, the Persian
Gulf states, Libya, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and the
Cameroons. They are the last guards of a fading empire. They are
largely ignorant and contemptuous of the locals.</TE>
<TE>   One is struck by how little the army, its officers or its NCOs
tell them of just what is going on in the world, in the war, in the
army or outside the gate of their posts. They soldier on, blindly
obedient and proud of it. One is temporarily posted to a U.S. Army
unit, where he is made terribly uneasy by the easy familiarity
between officers and enlisted ranks.</TE>
<TE>   They are uncomplaining souls, even when the army they love dumps
them unprepared back into civilian life with a hearty handshake, a
few quid and the thanks of a grateful nation.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, faced with loneliness and failing health on the
outside or signing up for a cell as a Chelsea pensioner, each votes
for the familiar and comforting. Alwyn Holmes' wife, Jean, once asked
him what he would do if she died first and he became a lonely old
man. "I won't be a lonely old man," he replied. "I'll go back where I
belong, to the army." At the Royal Hospital Chelsea, they have
reenlisted. They are with their own sort once more and, to a man, say
they don't mind spending the end of their lives with the same
institution they began with.</TE>

<HD>Ghost Story</HD>
<DH>THE GOLEMS OF GOTHAM, A Novel, By Thane Rosenbaum,
HarperCollins: 370 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KLINGHOFFER</AU>
<BD>David Klinghoffer is the author of a spiritual memoir,
"The Lord Will Gather Me In," and a forthcoming biography of the
patriarch Abraham.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the Bible's telling, Adam was the first creature into which God
breathed a soul. Before that, the Talmud notes, he was a "golem"--an
animated mass without the divine gift of a human spirit. Later,
Jewish tradition suggests, certain spiritual data were passed from
Adam to the patriarch Abraham and down to the ancient and medieval
Jewish sages explaining how to give life (but not a soul) to
inanimate matter.</LD>
<LD>   Thane Rosenbaum in "The Golems of Gotham," takes liberty with this
traditional definition of a golem. His characters are more like
ghosts, disembodied spirits, in this simple, comical but not funny
story padded with pretentious meditations on the nature of art.
Rosenbaum's protagonist is 14-year-old Ariel Levin of Manhattan's
Upper West Side. Her father is novelist Oliver Levin, whose wife left
them when Ariel was a toddler. Oliver is haunted by the double
suicide of his father and mother, Rose and Lothar, both Holocaust
survivors. Hoping to save her father from repressed grief, Ariel
employs cabalistic spells to raise the ghosts of her father's mom and
dad. How exactly she got hold of these spells goes unspecified.</LD>
<TE>   Without meaning to do so, Ariel also unsettles the spirits of six
writers who, in historical fact, survived the Holocaust only to take
their own lives. These six ghosts, Primo Levi and Paul Celan among
them, join Rose and Lothar as a posse of "golems" to liberate Oliver
from his case of grief-induced writer's block.</TE>
<TE>   As plot developments arise, Rosenbaum often doesn't bother to link
cause with effect. At some point, the golems turn from saving Oliver
to improving New York City, deciding to eliminate any features of
urban life that remind them of the death camps, even doing away with
smoking and tattoos, which call to mind the crematoria and the
numbers the Nazis tattooed into their victims' arms.</TE>
<TE>   But Rosenbaum never tells us how they do this. It just happens.
Sometimes these spirits are incorporeal, other times they exert
physical force. Rosenbaum doesn't feel obliged to be consistent. As
he asserts in one of his ruminations on art, "a real artist doesn't
care about facts, details, adventure, or even plot--just truth."</TE>
<TE>   But the book would have benefited from more attention to such
matters. It is full of repetitive or extraneous passages, like the
cliched phrases Rosenbaum loves to play with. Then there are his
frequent recaps of what's already happened, as if the novel had been
serialized. So Rosenbaum gives us reminders of Ariel's prowess in
mysticism, as if from chapter to chapter we might have forgotten
about the powers of this "heroic pied-piper cabalist of the Upper
West Side."</TE>
<TE>   The most convincing parts of the book have nothing to do with the
Holocaust or with cabala. Rosenbaum may actually have had it in him
to write an affecting story simply about a man whose wife abandons
him and their young daughter. This is his third fictional work on the
theme of the Holocaust and its grievous effects on the children of
those who lived through it. Alas, another legacy of Nazi genocide is
its lasting influence on a segment of American Jewish culture that
seeks to paint Judaism solely in terms of the Holocaust and the
Eastern European shtetl culture it erased. For example, in "The
Golems of Gotham," Rosenbaum is big on having characters run out to
buy yahrzeit memorial candles or talk about the kaddish, a prayer
associated with mourning.</TE>
<TE>   This not only makes for overwrought fiction, this book and many
others like it have taken Jewish literature in a new and unfortunate
direction. The classic texts of Judaism, from the Talmud to
Maimonides to modern philosophical reflections like those of Rabbi
Joseph B. Soloveitchik, are luminously spare and emotionally reserved
despite suffering that long predated the Holocaust. This ancient
literary tradition has no place for schmaltz--that wonderful Yiddish
term for melted chicken fat, in other words, sentimentality without
bounds. As a cultural artifact, Rosenbaum's "The Golems of Gotham" is
of interest only because it illustrates that sentimentality so well.</TE>

<HD>All That Is Solid Melts Into Air</HD>
<DH>DOT.CON: The Greatest Story Ever Sold, By John Cassidy,
HarperCollins: 372 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX RAKSIN</AU>
<BD>Alex Raksin is an editorial writer for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conventional wisdom holds that the Internet bubble popped on Friday,
April 14, 2000, 88 years to the day after the Titanic disaster and
when a decline in technology stocks drove the Dow Jones industrial
average down 617.78 points, its most precipitous plunge ever. It can
be argued, however, that the Internet bubble wafted on at least a
year longer in the shape of a company called Enron. Enron may not
have a dot after its name, but it was the embodiment of the "new
economy" company that dot-coms aspired to be in the '90s.</LD>
<TE>   Enron was able to flourish only because dot-com companies in the
'90s brought a peculiar set of notions to the American mainstream:
that Wall Street analysts could objectively evaluate companies they
had stakes in; that people would embrace new technologies simply
because they were cool; and that "nontraditional metrics," which
evaluated companies based on fuzzy new measures like buzz, brand and
"mind share," was more revealing than old-fashioned measures like
assets, dividends and growth rates. The mystery of Enron--how it
could have come to be valued at more than $60 billion despite its
paucity of assets and good ideas--becomes less perplexing when you
read this tale of companies that came before it like Price- line.Com,
which was valued at $10 billion, more than United Airlines,
Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines combined, even though it
had no valuable terminals, no landing slots and no brand names, not
to mention no airplanes. Lucid and informed, "Dot.Con" is New Yorker
writer John Cassidy's attempt to explain why so much hard capital
evaporated into hot air.</TE>
<TE>   Many authors are now flaunting their razor-sharp hindsight about
'90s profligacy, but Cassidy manages to find at least a few eternal
verities behind the great financial folly. The central problem,
Cassidy writes, was that investors failed to realize that the
Internet's patchwork of cables, computers and promises was not a
"revolutionary new business model" but merely "a tool that companies
can use to build their business if they can combine it with
distinctive products."</TE>
<TE>   One charm of the book is that, its title notwithstanding, Cassidy
doesn't buy into banal stereotypes of Machiavellian bigwigs preying
upon innocent Americans. He skewers not only the media and Wall
Street analysts for promoting dot-coms much as TV networks pitch epic
miniseries, but also armchair investors for having the hubris to
think they could be players in the drama. Cassidy holds three groups
particularly accountable:</TE>
<TE>   * Journalists and Wall Street analysts, who failed to ask basic
questions that would have helped investors distinguish between
brilliant discoveries (such as Mosaic, the Web browser that turned a
green-and-black computer messaging system into a colorful, human
tapestry) and fantastically stupid schemes (such as Jim Clark's
Healtheon, the company that was valued at more than $2 billion on its
first day of trading even though it had no clue of how to accomplish
its goal of "fixing the U.S. health care system.") Healtheon's only
business plan was a "magic diamond" that showed computers somehow
connecting payers and doctors to providers and consumers.</TE>
<TE>   * Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who initially hyped the
bubble by glibly concluding that "the computer, satellites and the
joining of laser and fiber-optic technologies" had "fostered an
enormous new capacity to capture, analyze and disseminate
information." Though Greenspan came to believe that most Internet
companies were absurdly overvalued, Cassidy writes, he failed to
exercise his "legal, moral and intellectual authority to prick the
bubble ... until too late."</TE>
<TE>   * The American people, whose "greed and gullibility" puffed the
most hot air of all into the Internet bubble.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Cassidy's editor David Hirshey boasted that "Dot.Con"
would "demystify [the] extraordinary social and cultural phenomenon"
of the Internet with all the anthropological depth of "The Great
Crash," John Kenneth Galbraith's 1955 analysis of how rituals and
assumptions that America up for the 1929 stock market crash. Even
editors, it seems, are susceptible to the temptations of hot air, for
Cassidy, despite his pretension of rising above journalism into
history, does not achieve the sharp critical distance that Galbraith
showed.</TE>
<TE>   Through much of the book, Cassidy, an Oxford-trained former
business editor of the Sunday Times of London, comes across as an
elitist, broadly dismissing Americans by analogizing them to H.L.
Mencken's "sordid, money-grubbing people" or to the "young Rattles
and unthinking Fools," whom 18th century poet Edward Ward sneered
upon for failing to "follow Reason's Rules."</TE>
<TE>   Galbraith was an elitist too, sympathizing with the sentiment of
his contemporary, economist John Maynard Keynes, who once wrote that
"the social object of skilled investment should be to defeat the dark
forces of time and ignorance, which envelope our future." But
Galbraith at least acknowledged that his meritocratic ideas would be
a hard sell in populist America.</TE>
<TE>   Cassidy, by contrast, asserts imperiously that "it is up to
journalists and government officials to try to maintain sanity" but
does not acknowledge the cultural impediments blocking anyone who
tries to uphold that ideal. Many journalists in the '90s, for
instance, believed it was their job to reflect popular enthusiasms,
not shoot them down.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Cassidy fails to wrestle with the difficulty of
Greenspan's dilemma. He was, and still is, a disciple of Ayn Rand: a
fervent believer that capitalism works best when capitalists are free
to reinvent themselves. It's too glib to blame a libertarian like
Greenspan for failing to impose his own classical yardstick for
valuing a company--does it manufacture a needed good more cheaply
than its competitor?--on a country that has decided to pick up new
yardsticks.</TE>
<TE>   Both conservative thinkers like Greenspan and liberal ones like
George Soros agree that it's no mean feat to distinguish the "real
economy" from the perceived one. Value is as much a social construct
as it is a financial one. As Keynes put it, investment is like a game
of musical chairs: What matters is not the inherent value of your
stock but whether you are left standing when the music stops.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of grappling with the hard question of how America's
meritocrats should have gone about exposing and correcting popular
misconceptions, Cassidy simply asserts, in rather abrupt and sudden
passages that introduce and conclude the book, that the whole dot-com
bubble had been merely a "historic aberration": a bout of
"technological utopianism" that ended when Americans became sober and
sane after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "After several years indulging itself in fanciful thoughts about
the future," Cassidy concludes, "America had gotten serious, leaving
behind the trivial pursuits of a speculative bubble."</TE>
<TE>   My guess is that Cassidy really doesn't believe that Sept. 11
changed America so fundamentally but that he is putting his Oxbridge
elitism aside so he can carry out his Fleet Street newspaperman's
obligation to find a news peg that makes his subject more topical.
Like Greenspan, or the business journalists of the '90s, it seems,
Cassidy at some level knows that his job is to listen carefully and
not take a seat until the music stops.</TE>

<DH>A SMALL TREATISE ON THE GREAT VIRTUES: The Uses of
Philosophy in Everyday Life, By Andre Comte-Sponville, Translated
from the French by Catherine Temerson, Metropolitan Books:  352 pp.,
$27.50</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FREDERIC RAPHAEL</AU>
<BD>Frederic Raphael has written widely on philosophy. His
most recent book is "Personal Terms," edited notebooks, 1950-69.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philosophy, like wine, does not always travel well. If Hegel, for
instance, is hard to swallow in German, he is totally indigestible in
English (why else would some academics still swear that his wisdom is
so delicious?). French philosophy, until very recently, was greatly
influenced by Hegel and by that other master of higher windbaggery,
Martin Heidegger; as a result, Sartre and his admirers wrote a great
deal of verbosely grandiose nonsense, in which a mysterious entity
called Being had, almost literally, a life of its own.</LD>
<LD>   In Sartre's world, since man was deemed always to be in a state of
"becoming," no suit of moral principles fitted him for long. To
accept an established code of "virtue" was a symptom of
"inauthenticity," if not of being a salaud, or swine. It was, of
course, an immense comfort for the rebellious postwar young to be
told that behaving well, in the bourgeois sense, was really a way of
behaving badly and that "good faith" consisted in breaking with
antique forms of decency, honor and truth. As a result of revering
the Dialectic, those who saw no merit in Western democracy found
their ideal in Communism; despising the false freedom of liberal
societies, progressive theory discerned true freedom in slavery.
Who's surprised that someone once said that it was hard to decide
which had done more harm to the French character, the German army or
German philosophy?</LD>
<TE>   Andre Comte-Sponville is one of the younger generation of French
academic philosophers (those who are not academic are journalistic
self-promoters likeBernard-Henri Levy). His innovative style is
declared by nicely phrased respect for what Shelley once called
"antique courtesies." The least of those, which Comte-Sponville
includes in his tally, is Politeness. What Sartre despised, he
praises: love--rather than revolutionary violence--is the culminating
virtue without which the others lose their savor.</TE>
<TE>   If Comte-Sponville is forthright in his declaration of the virtue
of virtues, he is French enough to be wary of being unadornedly
virtuous: not wanting to be taken for a coeur simple too naive for
smart company, he likes to find a paradox among his truisms and to
fashion a catchy phrase where the chance arises. However, you will
find little mention of the paramount moral need to overthrow
capitalism or of the Universal Rights of Man, which bears the
label--among the French at least--"Made in France." As for the
Christian virtues, Fidelity (up to a point), Prudence and Purity are
among those he endorses, but Christianity itself, like God, is taken
to be a model, but never a revealed Truth. The morality of "as if"
asks us to behave well for man's sake, rather than for God's.
Tolerance trumps dogma, and I'm glad, but is it ever going to
persuade us to behave well? The 21st century, if it lasts its full
term, will tell.</TE>
<TE>   The subtitle--"The Uses of Philosophy in Everyday Life"--honors
its claim. At the same time, many well-chosen scholarly references
(printed at the back of the book in English, but more usefully, I
think, at the foot of the page in the French edition) testify to the
author's wide learning and incite further reading, especially when it
comes to the moralizing philosophes--Rousseau to La Rochefoucauld,
Descartes and Alain to, of course, Sartre--of his native land. French
philosophy, like French cooking, admits only certain ingredients to
be worthy of its mental kitchens. Plato, Spinoza and Aristotle, yes;
a little chopped Vladimir Jankelevitch; et voila! Bertrand Russell,
G.E. Moore, Karl Popper? Connais pas!</TE>
<TE>   If I am only somewhat very enthusiastic about this collection of
homilies, it is fair to say that what I liked, I liked very much
indeed and would recommend wholeheartedly. The virtue of Gratitude is
not only praised but--as Byron once insisted--praised well. In a time
of painful bereavement, I derived great comfort from the following:
"Gratitude ... is this joy of memory, this love of the past--it
neither suffers over what no longer is nor regrets what has been but
joyfully recalls what was. It is time regained ... 'the grateful
recollection of what has been,' says Epicurus--by which we understand
that the idea of death is made immaterial, as Proust says, for even
death, take us though it will, cannot take from us what we have
lived.... Death deprives us only of the future, which does not exist.
Gratitude frees us from death, through the joyous knowledge of what
was. Gratitude is acknowledgment, which is to say, knowledge (whereas
hope is merely imagination); this is why gratitude touches on the
truth, which is eternal, and inhabits it. Gratitude is the enjoyment
of eternity." Crap, or wisdom? It depends now recent your pain is.</TE>
<TE>   The main trouble with this book is that it is like eternity in
Woody Allen's dictum, which as Comte-Sponville cites with enthusiasm,
"is a long time, particularly toward the end." Nor are all of the
essays of the same quality. When the best are so good, how could they
be? Comte-Sponville's skillful translator, Catherine Temerson, nearly
always does a difficult job very well, but is she right, very early
on, to translate mechancete as "meanness" and to say that it is
"arguably the only true vice"? This is arguably--a worthless term
which finds no source in the original French--a very silly statement.
Mechancete would surely be better rendered as "malice" or "evil
intentions." "Arguably" simply concedes that the translator knows she
is, as Plato seldom put it, spit-balling.</TE>
<TE>   There is in Comte-Sponville an ill-controlled tendency (who will
control the tenured, after all, especially if they are about to be
translated into 19 languages?) to gild every lily and fashion
cracker-mottos from ill-considered paradoxes which retain a certain
tincture of soixante-huitisme--the intellectual recklessness of May
1968, when the French students, the author proudly among them, sought
to overthrow the existing moral and social order. For instance:</TE>
<TE>   "[T]he law protects private property, in modern democracies no
differently than in Pascal's day, and when it does so it guarantees
inequality in wealth. Where equality and legality are at odds, where
is justice?"</TE>
<TE>   As the English used to say, "Pull the other one, it's got bells on
it." Though we may deplore the rampant plutocracy that gives
excessive, often corrupt, power to Big Bucks, the quoted paragraph is
so full of fallacies as to be hardly more than a string-bag of
absurdity. To assert with a straight face that the law of 17th
century France, an absolute monarchy, is identical with that of
today's democracies is to bend the knee to the Sartrean radicalism
which no longer dares to speak its full name. If, per impossible,
there were no inequalities in wealth, the world would become
economically static and soon poorer. Nothing that anyone owned would
be worth anything, since its sales or use would make someone,
somehow, more equal than someone else. Friedrich Hayek had taken care
of this subject, I thought, for once and for everyone except
Comte-Sponville: All leveling levels down; Justice is not, and cannot
be, a function of financial equality, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the fun of reading these mainly bite-sized essays is that
some are a lot easier to swallow than others. When an author incites
you to send back some of his dishes while admitting that others are
entirely to your taste, the chances are that his menu is varied,
spicy and has something for everyone. I could, however, do without
the protracted attention given to Simone Weil, whose theocentric
masochism is not my bag. I also regret that, in the overlong
concluding eulogy of Love in all its forms, no reference is made to
Wittgenstein's interesting remark that there is a lot more decision
in loving than most people realize.</TE>
<TE>   Comte-Sponville's deification of Desire is Gallic cant; if, as he
says, "[t]here is no virtue that does not partake of desire," then we
can, as Wittgenstein put it (in another context), "divide through" by
desire and proceed to make useful, unconflating distinctions about
each individual virtue. And, just for the record, Spinoza used no
such Latin adverb as humanite, because the word doesn't exist: it's
either humane or humaniter. Who cares? Well, it's still a petty
virtue in professors (and publishers) either to get such things right
or to keep off the classy quotes altogether. N'est-ce pas?</TE>

<LD>THE BOMBAST TRANSCRIPTS</LD>
<LD>   Rants and Screeds of Rageboy</LD>
<LD>   By Christopher Locke</LD>
<TE>   Perseus Publishing: 288 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   "The inspiration of all true art is a blank screen and a bad
attitude." There's a lot of attitude going around these days but not
enough to change anything. Still, this fast-talking, rule-breaking,
opinionated and irreverent writing has the whir and hum of the '60s.
How did Christopher Locke achieve the exalted position from which he
mercilessly dumps on his readers (fondly called the "Reader Abuse
Programme")? "My resume looks like the routing manifest for some
displaced person after WWII. I am merely a high-tech migrant worker,"
specializing in artificial intelligence. Which is not what he was
doing at IBM, we later learn. He was, to his great embarrassment,
writing P.R.: "I don't mind telling you about the acid, the drinking,
the women.... But to admit that I was once in Public Relations ...
well, try to imagine how painful this is for me." This is a
collection of columns that ran in Locke's very own Web zine, now 6
years old, called Entropy Gradient Reversals, a title that had
occurred to him 30 years ago while "deeply immersed in the study of
psychotropic particle physics." The best are pure rant: against
corporate America, against fascism, against stupidity. Since the
present is so rotten, so corrupted, many of the essays are memories
of grand old trips on Sandoz pharmaceuticals, pure lysergic acid
diethylamide-25. "I woke up angry," Rageboy writes. "I'm tired of
being angry. I'm tired of being scared. It makes me angry."</TE>

<TE>   BLUES FOR CANNIBALS</TE>
<TE>   The Notes From Underground</TE>
<TE>   By Charles Bowden</TE>
<TE>   North Point Press: 293 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Charles Bowden is so low it makes me want to nurse him back to
health, a neat trick for a writer to pull on a reader. Bowden gets
lost. I've admired this before, particularly in the text he wrote to
accompany a photo book on the Sonoran Desert, which he knows and
loves. Its great pleasure was learning the language the Sonoran
Desert might speak. As a journalist, covering unions and sex crimes
and bad business, he still gets lost, which newspaper editors might
not like, but book readers will. When Bowden writes, for example as
he does in this collection, about what it was like to write about sex
crimes, he weaves his own sex life into the telling, as if to find
the part of himself that would understand this part of human nature.
Just when he starts to fall into blackness in front of us, his
readers, he goes back to rough bark and rain and mud and even blood;
to nature and to the image of the manzanita tree that grows around
his home. Stab, hack, cut through. As a writer seeking justice in his
words, he is like a man clearing the brush, trying to break through,
to get enough light and oxygen to see his trees and sky again before
he goes back under. In "Blues for Cannibals," Bowden weaves the story
of the deaths of four friends close to him, by drink or suicide or
both. He tries to get to the source of the sickness, of the sadness
that triumphed over them. "We are cannibals now," he writes of the
human condition. "We can devour and take but cannot give." Such
despair in the American nightmare. Bowden is invited to watch the
killing by lethal injection of a prisoner on death row: "I watched
and feel dirty for the watching." Of course he would. He is never
comfortable just watching. For a big bad Western desert anarchist,
Bowden absorbs pain like a sensitive New Age guy. It just crawls into
his roots and makes these leaves. The bark is rough. The wood burns
hot.</TE>

<TE>   SENTIMENTAL, HEARTBROKEN REDNECKS</TE>
<TE>   Stories</TE>
<TE>   By Greg Bottoms</TE>
<TE>   Context Books: 216 pp., $21.95</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be that sad happy tragicomic narrator bleeding that
jazzy blues-filled bebop prose, a dirty reefer-stoked martyr for the
lost ... and the never-quite made-its." This is Greg Bottoms'
ambition as a writer, a self-image with a history, a contrariness and
the desire to describe undescribed lives. The time Bottoms gets sick
after tripping along nicely on LSD for several days is when he
finally goes to the bathroom and realizes that some little old lady
doing her custodial job is going to have to clean up after him and
all the other partying thugs. Bottoms plays with the idea of being a
Southern writer in these stories, for which he uses the definition of
Southern writing given by critic Lewis Simpson: "Southern fiction
derives from visions in which faith in the [writer's] ability to make
his own world has had an entangled confrontation with an experience
of memory and history that tells him he cannot do it." Bottoms
subscribes to this. To dodge this fate, he "becomes a character in
someone's story." There are dead dogs and remorseful addicts and bad
fathers and dead mothers. Bottoms, like Bowden and Locke, doesn't
just go out on his limb. He damn well tries to break it.</TE>

<HD>When Dance Becomes Stance</HD>
<DH>Le Tigre puts an electronica soundtrack to its feminist
beliefs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a genre that values experimentation over technical mastery and
centers on gender equality issues. A style that fuses cut-and-paste
sound collages with rock and rap. They call it punk feminist
electronica--they being Le Tigre, a New York City trio headed by
Kathleen Hanna.</LD>
<LD>   Leave it to Hanna--once one of the most outspoken members of the
early-'90s Riot Grrrl movement--to pioneer a new genre of music.</LD>
<LD>   Hanna, 32, is best known as the singer for Bikini Kill, the '90s
punk band that gave voice to women's oppression and anger. Not one to
be pigeonholed or to do what is expected of her, she is also an
artist, organizer and political activist who for the better part of a
decade has been the mouthpiece and role model for the Sassy
magazine-schooled feminists who called themselves Riot Grrrls.</LD>
<TE>   A grass-roots musical and social movement that began in the early
'90s in Olympia, Wash., and Washington, D.C., Riot Grrrl encouraged
women to reject traditional notions of femininity. Pro-woman and
anti-corporate, its message was do-it-yourself, instructing young
women to combat the rampant sexism they heard on the radio by making
their own music, and to disregard magazines that told them how to
look, act and think by making 'zines of their own. Although the
movement had no founder per se, Hanna was widely perceived as its
leader.</TE>
<TE>   Punk feminist electronica picks up where this girl-positive,
guitars-in-arms movement left off, though it has a slightly different
agenda. Where Bikini Kill challenged women to speak their minds, Le
Tigre--which plays L.A.'s El Rey Theatre on Friday--urges them to
connect with their bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to encourage women to take up space publicly and to dance
together and to be present in their bodies when they're dancing,"
Hanna says.</TE>
<TE>   "To be able to be physically joyous in public is, unfortunately, a
radical act."</TE>
<TE>   According to Hanna, women, fearing rape or physical assault, often
protect themselves by retreating from their bodies and into their
minds. In the face of this "gender persecution," as Hanna calls it,
to dance is to make a political statement.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an act of empowerment to publicly take up space and to
dance," she says. "Of course, we want to make the soundtrack for
that, so ... it's got to have a good beat."</TE>
<TE>   Like Bikini Kill, which wrapped compelling, guitar-driven melodies
around its "Revolution grrrl style now" message, Le Tigre, whose
latest album, "Feminist Sweepstakes," came out last October, cuts and
pastes samples from lesbian protest demonstrations, comedy routines
and other seemingly undanceable sources into tracks bound together
with body-moving, drum-machine beats.</TE>
<TE>   Le Tigre is actually Hanna's second venture into punk feminist
electronica.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, after Bikini Kill called it quits, she morphed into Julie
Ruin--an alter ego she adopted for a solo project she recorded in a
closet with a hand-me-down sampler. Her move to canned rhythms and
samples was a radical departure from the raw hysterics of Bikini
Kill, and the album "Julie Ruin" (on Kill Rock Stars) drew mixed
reviews from critics.</TE>
<TE>   She formed Le Tigre in 1999, teaming with Johanna Fateman, creator
of a now-defunct magazine called Snarl, and Sadie Bening, a filmmaker
best known for her work with a children's Pixelvision camera.</TE>
<TE>   Their blend of '60s girl-group sensibility with synth rock was
much fuller and more confident, catchy and playful than Julie Ruin's
music.</TE>
<TE>   But the original lineup made only one record together, the
self-titled "Le Tigre," released in late 1999. Unable to devote
enough time to the band, Bening left in 2000 and was replaced by her
friend J.D. Samson, who runs a group to promote dancing in lesbian
bars called Dykes Can Dance.</TE>
<TE>   Le Tigre's subsequent work seems more overtly political--something
especially apparent on "From the Desk of Mr. Lady," the 2001 album on
which Samson debuts. "Bang Bang" uses samples of women's screams and
machine gunfire, while "They Want Us to Make a Symphony out of the
Sound of Women Swallowing Their Own Tongues" features a male
interviewer who doesn't let his female subject get a word in
edgewise.</TE>
<TE>   It's heavy and provocative subject matter, yet the group balks at
being called a political band.</TE>
<TE>   "What does that mean?" Hanna asks. "That we're radical-left
feminists or materialist feminists or Marxist feminists or what?
There are so many bands out there that are right-wing or subtly
espousing those politics by singing covertly sexist lyrics or
covertly homophobic lyrics. Why are they never asked about being
political?"</TE>
<TE>   "Feminist Sweepstakes" is the group's most overt call for women to
put on their dancing shoes.</TE>
<TE>   On its opening track, it declares it is "the band with the
rollerskate jams." In that mission, Le Tigre does not disappoint--on
record or live.</TE>
<TE>   During performances, the group takes full advantage of the fact
that almost all its music is recorded, so it is not too loaded down
with instruments to do a dance routine, choreographed by Samson.</TE>
<TE>   Le Tigre's "karaoke-hybrid performance," as Fateman calls it, is
also fleshed out with videos contributed by established female video
artists, including Tammy Rae Carland, who also owns the Mr. Lady
record label that has released Le Tigre's three records.</TE>
<TE>   Collaboration with female artists from a variety of disciplines is
key to Le Tigre's brand of feminism.</TE>
<TE>   "If we only connect with other indie rock artists, it really is
narrowing the scope of what we can achieve," Fateman says. "We really
want to build bridges and see what else is out there and see what we
can offer people and what they can teach us."</TE>
<TE>   Le Tigre is as much a work in progress as it is a band, according
to Hanna.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still in the developmental stage. I feel it could turn into
a performance art troupe or a detective agency at any moment, but
it's not a totally defined thing like how a band is. It's a process."</TE>

<HD>She Didn't Quite Leap Into Acting</HD>
<DH>Leslie Caron recalls the days when she was brought to
Hollywood and ballet, not films, meant everything to her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leslie Caron admits she was a bit of a snob when she came from Paris
to Hollywood more than 50 years ago to star with Gene Kelly in the
1951 MGM musical "An American in Paris." For one thing, the teenage
ballet dancer wasn't impressed with Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought compared to Paris it was very unsophisticated," she
recalls. "There were no theaters. Everybody was asleep by 9 p.m.
There was no night life. There is so much going on in Paris every
night."</LD>
<LD>   Despite her initial misgivings, "An American in Paris" made Caron
an overnight sensation. With her ballet training, she brought an
elegance and grace to the more jazz-oriented dance numbers in the
film. She had a wonderfully fresh, innocent screen persona and even
managed to soften Kelly's brashness.</LD>
<TE>   Rick Jewell, associate dean of the USC School of
Cinema-Television, says that Caron was able to match Kelly step by
step. "To me, she and Cyd Charisse were the two dancers who could
match up with him best. I always felt she just complemented him."</TE>
<TE>   She went on to star in such classics as "Daddy Long Legs" (1955),
"Gigi" (1958), and "Fanny" (1961) and received best actress Oscar
nominations for "Lili" (1953) and "The L-Shaped Room" (1963). Along
the way there were several marriages--including one to British
director Peter Hall--and a well-publicized affair with Warren Beatty,
with whom she appeared in 1965's forgettable "Promise Her Anything."</TE>
<TE>   Petite and sporting a pixieish short haircut, the still-gamin
70-year-old Caron was in town recently to discuss her participation
in the "American Masters" documentary "Gene Kelly: Anatomy of a
Dancer," airing Tuesday on KCET.</TE>
<TE>   By now, Caron is very much a seasoned Hollywood pro. She knows how
to conduct herself in interviews. She helps the photographer achieve
the right lighting for her portrait. She's charming and remarkably
candid.</TE>
<TE>   This late afternoon, Caron is holding court in a vintage suite at
the Regent Beverly Wilshire, her favorite haunt in Los Angeles. "This
is where I first descended, that is why I love it so much," she says,
smiling. "MGM put me here."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in the "intellectual part of Paris" near the Sorbonne,
Caron began taking ballet lessons at age 9. Seven years later, she
was a member of the Ballets des Champs-Elysees. "It was the most
avant-garde and sophisticated company [in Paris]," she says. "It was
the modern ballet company in all of Europe."</TE>
<TE>   She had been with the company for a year when Kelly caught her
performing the role of the Sphinx in "Oedipus and the Sphinx." "I
understand he came backstage but I had gone home to bed," Caron says,
laughing. "I didn't know about this ritual of waiting in your
dressing room for people to come and shake your hands and say,
'Marvelous, darling.'"</TE>
<TE>   Besides, she says, she didn't have a clue who Kelly was. A year
passed before she met the musical comedy star. "I met him at the
Hotel George V," she says. "He made me read a little bit and said,
'Tomorrow let's make a test.' So I did it and then forgot all about
it. I can't say I was dying to become a movie star. It wasn't in my
plans. Then one day there was a phone call."</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, she found herself a Parisian in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sad to leave my friends at the ballet," Caron says.
"Hollywood didn't mean anything to me. I was strictly a ballet dancer
and I had so much to learn. I must say [films] became exciting, but
not on the first film.</TE>
<TE>   "The first film ['American in Paris'] was hard work. I don't want
to say it was hostile, but unfriendly because I wasn't used to
working in front of the camera and on cement floors.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't used to express myself with talking and acting," she
continued. "It had to be learned and it was all hard."</TE>
<TE>   Caron was so shy she did all of her scenes with her back turned to
the lens. Finally, Kelly gave her some advice. "Honey, if you want
your mother to see you in this film, turn your face to the camera."</TE>
<TE>   During the production, she lived behind the electrical works at
the studios, "in the section where the workmen lived because I was
really paid very little."</TE>
<TE>   She also was suffering from mononucleosis during the filming. "I
was very young, and it was very hard work and enormous
responsibility," Caron says. "I wasn't really taken care of. At that
age, you don't have the self-assurance to say, 'Listen guys. that's
it for day.'"</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Vincente Minnelli and featuring the standards of
George and Ira Gershwin, "An American in Paris" finds Kelly playing a
struggling painter in the City of Light who falls in love with a
young shop clerk (Caron). The Technicolor production, which won the
best film Oscar, is best known for its climactic "American in Paris"
ballet sequence that is still one of the most sumptuous numbers ever
presented on screen.</TE>
<TE>   The "American in Paris" ballet alone took six weeks to rehearse.
"We had a whole ballet company put together," she says. "We had a
ballet master who would come in the morning and do the class. The
whole film took about eight months to film."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly was a "great, great partner," Caron says, but as a
choreographer, he was pragmatic. "There was no time to teach me," she
says. "With his assistant, Carol Haney, he asked me to show him
everything I could do well, all my advantages. I was very good at
extension. He would use all the things that I could do well."</TE>
<TE>   While making "An American in Paris," Caron fell in love with
acting and asked the studio about doing straight acting parts. "I
immediately started taking lessons," she says. Before "An American in
Paris" was released, the studio put her in a drama, "The Man With a
Cloak," opposite Joseph Cotten, and a drama with jazz music, "Glory
Alley."</TE>
<TE>   She admits that she tried to break her contract with MGM. "I
wanted more freedom," she explains. "I would have liked to continue
on the stage and couldn't. That was painful, but on the other hand, I
started taking acting lessons."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until she did "Lili" in 1953 that she felt comfortable
in front of the camera. In the charming drama with music, she plays a
French waif who ends up working at a puppet show in a traveling
carnival. "I enjoyed playing that character and I didn't pay much
attention to what people were thinking. I was happy."</TE>
<TE>   But the MGM brass wasn't. "I found out at the end of the film the
whole studio thought, 'My god, poor Leslie. What happened to her?'
Talk about pitiful-looking. No glamour."</TE>
<TE>   Even "American in Paris" producer Arthur Freed visited her on the
set one day to offer his regrets. "He said, 'Leslie what have they
done to you? I brought you to Hollywood and made you glamorous and
look what they are doing to you. I have got to save your career. Is
there another film you would like to do?'"</TE>
<TE>   Caron mentioned a few projects; Freed, though, wasn't interested
in any until she brought up Collette's story of "Gigi."</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Oh I'll get back to you on that.' That is what
triggered 'Gigi'--he felt sorry for me."</TE>
<TE>   During production of "Lili," Caron was ordered to forgo the
plain-Jane appearance. "I was told, 'You have to have makeup and
curly hair and high heels,'" she recalls. "I was beside myself with
despair."</TE>
<TE>   So she left the set and went to see MGM studio head Dory Schary to
lodge a complaint. "I was half crying," she says. "I said if I play
her with curls and makeup, it's not going to be the same character
and the story is going to be lost. He said, 'What film are you
doing?'"</TE>
<TE>   Caron informed him that it was "Lili."</TE>
<TE>   "He told me: 'Do whatever your little heart wants.' So I went to
back to the set and told the producer he said I could do it the way I
wanted. Everybody was angry with me because I had stopped the
production and got my way."</TE>
<TE>   Since she was under contract, Caron generally had little say in
her projects. "The studio was like a big factory," she says. "You
learned [about your roles] in the trades." That's how she learned MGM
was loaning her to 20th Century Fox in 1955 to star opposite Fred
Astaire in "Daddy Long Legs."</TE>
<TE>   "I really loved dancing with Fred," Caron says. "He was in
fabulous shape before, during and after a film. Gene wasn't in shape
between films. Gene would let himself go, so it was a hard effort for
him to [get back into shape]. Fred was always in good shape. He was a
natural dancer. He had muscles like a rabbit. He never got out of
breath. He would do a whole number like 'Slewfoot' and I would be
[panting] and he was [fine]."</TE>
<TE>   Caron, who lives in Paris, has continued to act. Although the
parts haven't been as meaty as during her 20s and 30s, she appeared
in such miniseries as "QBVII," "Master of the Game" and "The Man Who
Lived at the Ritz" in the 1970s and '80s. She had a small part in
Francois Truffaut's "The Man Who Loved Women" (1977). She has also
starred on the European stage and headlined the national tour of the
revival of "On Your Toes" in 1984.,</TE>
<TE>   More recently, she appeared as the widow Madame Audel in
"Chocolat" (2000) and in the 2001 TV remake of "Murder on the Orient
Express." She also has a country inn at Auberge, La Lucarne aux
Chouettes, that consists of four restored boathouses built centuries
ago on the river Yonne.</TE>
<TE>   She doesn't dance anymore but keeps fit walking her young Jack
Russell terrier, Toto. "He's a little devil," Caron says, laughing.
"Very often I have to run after him."</TE>
<TE>   Although her career has lasted for half a century, Jewell always
felt a bit sad that Caron came to Hollywood toward the conclusion of
the Hollywood studio system. "She got to the party awfully late," he
says. "Musicals were in decline. I guess another way of looking at it
is the old 'glass full/glass empty' idea. At least she made it before
it was all over, and certainly she is an important part of the end of
the great era of American musicals."</TE>

<DH>Taking a Disney cruise with fans, can critics Ebert and
Roeper steer clear of conflict-of-interest issues?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Depending on which direction their thumbs go, Roger Ebert and Richard
Roeper can inspire or discourage people from shelling out $8 for a
movie. Those thumbs, when pointing up, are worth millions to the
studios. Ebert and Roeper are so popular that fans ask them for
autographs. So perhaps it's no surprise that the studio that owns
"Ebert &amp; Roeper and the Movies," Disney's Buena Vista Television, is
taking its franchise on vacation--sort of.</LD>
<LD>   Inaugurated last year, the Film Festival at Sea aboard the Disney
Wonder is a chance for movie aficionados to pay $524 to $1,014 for a
three-night cruise, which left for the Bahamas on Thursday and
returns to Cape Canaveral, Fla., today. Film buffs get to meet Ebert
and Roeper, and get a sneak peek at some of this year's coming
releases. The cruise is advertised online with a composite photo of
Ebert and Roeper smiling with the Disney mouse ears behind them on
the ship's funnel.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, vacationers watched Disney-owned Miramax's "In the
Bedroom," Warner Bros.' "The Dish," MGM's "The Claim" and Disney's
1988 animated "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." This year, they will see
Disney's "Monsters, Inc.," Miramax's "Stolen Summer," HBO's "Real
Women Have Curves" and Fox Searchlight's "One Hour Photo."</LD>
<TE>   But the cruise raises some questions about whether journalists and
critics can navigate the tricky waters of cross-promotion and still
avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. "Ebert &amp; Roeper" is
perhaps the highest-profile television show featuring print
journalists and one of the few entertainment-related shows that still
includes movie criticism. Some say Disney's aggressive
cross-promotional activity as well as the decision to hire Roeper, a
reporter who had no background in film criticism, has dealt a blow to
the show's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "They already have a problem in that they work for a company that
owns the movies they are talking about," said Michael Josephson,
president and founder of the Josephson Institute of Ethics in Santa
Monica. "The more they are willing to associate themselves with
Disney, the less credibility they have in criticizing movies for
Disney. When somebody plays the role of critic, it is really
important that we believe it is their most honest and objective
professional opinion. We invest something in the credibility of that
person."</TE>
<TE>   Ebert agrees that media conglomeration has made everything more
complicated.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in an age of cross-ownership. Where could we go where we
wouldn't have a conflict?" he said in an interview before he
underwent surgery last month to remove a malignant tumor of the
thyroid. Ebert is expected to make a full recovery, according to his
publicist. He strenuously denies that the cruise gives even the
appearance of a conflict of interest.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been a movie critic since 1967, and my record stands for
itself," he said, adding that his reviews of Disney's summer
blockbuster "Pearl Harbor" and teen hit "The Princess Diaries" were
scathing.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, no one is accusing Ebert or Roeper of altering their
reviews because of the show's studio sponsorship. Rather, the
questions raised are more about the appearance of fairness in
reviews--and the larger topic of critic credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly the topic of credibility among critics has become an
issue of late. Last summer, Sony was caught using a fictitious
critic, named Dave Manning, to hype its movies. The incident also
raised questions about the use of little-known or disreputable
critics--known in the industry as "quote whores"-- in blurbs for
movie advertisements. In addition to the critic scandal, Sony
admitted having hired two employees as "fake fans" for a television
spot promoting "The Patriot." Other studios soon admitted using
actors in these "testimonial" TV spots.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's cutthroat competitive environment has led studios
to take these desperate measures in their marketing and publicity
campaigns. And as Ebert pointed out, another layer of complexity is
added when massive media conglomerates gobble up studios and
entertainment publications.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which owns 20th Century
Fox, owns part of TV Guide. Entertainment Weekly and Time are owned
by AOL Time Warner, which owns Warner Bros. "Entertainment Tonight"
is owned by Paramount, while Access Hollywood is owned by NBC; Disney
owns ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Even news reporters have become involved in cross-promotional
activity. ABC news anchor Charles Gibson can be seen in Disney's
upcoming film "The Rookie" introducing a fictitious story, with the
ABC News backdrop, about the movie's main character, played by Dennis
Quaid.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the continuing nightmare of synergy in the media
business," said Charles Fleming, author and professor of
entertainment reporting at USC's Annenberg Center for Communication.</TE>
<TE>   "With so many media/information and entertainment companies
merging, it's almost impossible for any journalist to be sure that
the parent company of the parent company won't create possible
ethical conflicts," he continues. "But the conflict is avoided as
long as the person does his job. Going on a cruise might not be
strictly part of the job."</TE>
<TE>   However, Roeper said the cruise is an important part of promoting
the show, which is part of their jobs. "We are not putting on Mouse
ears or participating in launch parties," said Roeper, who replaced
the late Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel in 1999. "[The cruise]
does not appear to me to be a conflict."</TE>
<TE>   "I have much more to lose than Disney has to gain," added Ebert.
"If anybody perceives that I'm not telling the truth as I see it, I'm
out of business."</TE>
<TE>   The show began as a public television series before it went into
syndication in 1981 as "At the Movies." It now carries a lot of
weight in the movie industry. "They have one of the most well-known
names with the broadest audiences of moviegoers," said Jeffrey
Godsick, executive vice president of Fox publicity and promotion.</TE>
<TE>   The television show was purchased from Tribune Co. (which owns the
Los Angeles Times) by Buena Vista in 1986 and renamed "Siskel &amp; Ebert
&amp; the Movies." When Siskel and Ebert accepted Buena Vista's deal over
Tribune, it caused some controversy at the Chicago Tribune, according
to Siskel's colleagues at the time and Larry Diekhaus, producer of
the show from 1987 to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Siskel left the paper. He returned soon after but
wrote a weekly column on film and was no longer the paper's main film
critic.</TE>
<TE>   By 1990, Siskel and Ebert were doing more than just a weekly show
at a local Chicago station. They were hosts of specials with live
studio audiences from Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. Audience
members were given free passes to Disney World after the show,
according to Mary Kellogg, senior vice president of current
programming for Buena Vista Television. But by 1996, Kellogg said,
they stopped doing live shows because it became too complicated to
find air time.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at synergy as a positive, not a negative," she said. "I
have all these wonderful assets within the company, and it's my job
to figure out how to make it work for my shows without making it
overworked. It has to feel organic."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the cruise and live shows at Disney World, Buena
Vista has found a way to tap into the show's popularity to get
attention for other Disney-related products. The show continues to
air on some Disney-owned ABC affiliates around the country, including
KABC-TV in Los Angeles, where it has been airing early Sunday
evenings for many years. The Ebert &amp; Roeper Web site,
www.ebert-roeper-movies.com, has direct links to partners such as
Disney.com, Disneystore.com, ABCFamily.com and Buena Vista
Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Kellogg acknowledges there is a danger of "over-hyping" the show,
but that she is protective of Ebert and Roeper. "They have a
reputation, and I would never jeopardize that reputation," she said.
"Those thumbs are worth a lot of money. [Ebert] has been offered
millions of dollars for those thumbs to be used to endorse products,
and he has only used them for movies."</TE>
<TE>   The show's ratings have decreased slightly since Siskel's death,
going from an average of 2.6 million weekly viewers in 1997-98 to 2.2
million in 2000-01, according to Nielsen Media Research. Known not
only for their pithy, intelligent remarks about film, Siskel and
Ebert were also watched for their fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   When Siskel died in 1999 of complications from earlier brain
surgery, dozens of candidates tried out for the show. Eventually
Buena Vista executives and Ebert decided on Roeper, who was a
general-interest columnist for the Sun-Times. The decision garnered
some heat because of Roeper's lack of film criticism experience. Some
say he was selected for his good looks and youth.</TE>
<TE>   "Television criticism is all but gone; it's all been replaced by
entertainment gurus," said David Poland, an Internet entertainment
industry analyst who tried out for the show. "The decision to hire
someone who is not a film critic is a shame. It is the second most
powerful position in the country--in terms of criticism--and he is
not a critic."</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Cruise Lines was billing the event as an opportunity
to "screen films with two of the most respected movie critics in the
business." Ebert, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1975 for film
criticism, defends the decision to hire Roeper, saying that Roeper is
a true movie lover who has written several columns about film.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like being a CPA or a dentist where you have to have the
right shingle on the wall," said Ebert, who added that he had no
experience in film criticism when he started as a critic at the
Sun-Times in 1967. "How do you become a critic? You appoint yourself.
You start calling yourself a film critic. You start writing reviews.
You network and try to get a job."</TE>
<TE>   Roeper, who was featured in People magazine's 50 Most Eligible
Bachelors issue last year, still hesitates to call himself a critic.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not have applied for the job [of critic] at the New York
Times," Roeper said by telephone. "My concern is doing the best
possible show with Roger and whether it connects with the audience. I
consider myself the co-host of a show that critiques movies."</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, the definition of a real critic has always been
murky, according to cultural historian and author Neal Gabler. In
addition, the relationship between entertainment columnists/critics
and the studios has always been incestuous, he added. For example,
Clark Gable built a bathroom for gossip columnist Louella Parsons,
and producer Darryl F. Zanuck gave columnist Walter Winchell an
office on the Fox lot. Even today, some entertainment reporters are
flown out by the studios to promotional movie junkets. Movie critics
who work in a popular medium like television cannot be seen as overly
analytical or critical because they will lose their following, Gabler
added.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand the relationship between the audience and
the critic," he said. "Critics will give a favorable review of a film
that they think is going to be popular because they don't want to
alienate their audience."</TE>
<TE>   Not having the right credentials and using cross-promotional
activity too aggressively could backfire, said Keith Woods, director
of the Poynter Institute, a media watchdog group based in Florida.
Already, the public is skeptical about the media's objectivity.
According to a 1998 national journalism ethics surveys completed by
the Radio Television News Director Foundation, 8 out of 10 viewers
believe advertisers have undue influence over news content.</TE>
<TE>   "The public doesn't always make the connections [of ownership],"
Woods said. "All it takes really is for one thing to happen on [Ebert
and Roeper's] watch for the public to take that next step and say
'Aha!'"</TE>

<DH>The eccentric and the conventional coexist in Eric Owen
Moss' progressive design of his Stealth office block.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Few Los Angeles architects have risen faster and fallen harder than
Eric Owen Moss. During the 1980s, architects such as Thom Mayne,
Michael Rotondi, Franklin Israel and Moss were touted as the future
of the profession. Their work--dynamic, jagged designs that sometimes
seemed close to breaking apart at the seams--were viewed as apt
metaphors for the disintegration of American society. And Moss, the
most cerebral of the group, was their intellectual leader.</LD>
<LD>   But by the mid-1990s that promise had all but fizzled. Israel, one
of the most talented of the group, died from complications of AIDS in
1996. Rotondi, a founder of the architectural firm Morphosis,
appeared to be headed toward professional obscurity and has yet to
land a major commission. Even Mayne, now an established star,
struggled with his career until he resurfaced two years ago with the
opening of the celebrated Diamond Ranch High School in Pomona.</LD>
<LD>   Moss, meanwhile, was drifting into an increasingly hermetic
universe, completing a series of idiosyncratic projects in an
isolated, former manufacturing district in Culver City owned by
developers Frederick and Laurie Smith. These works, mostly small
additions that cling to existing structures like parasitic organisms,
marked Moss as an eccentric outsider, one who seemed destined to end
up as an obscure, somewhat bizarre footnote to L.A.'s rich
architectural history.</LD>
<TE>   Now Moss' star is on the rise again. In December, the 58-year-old
architect won an international competition to design a renovation and
expansion for the Queens Museum of Art in New York, his first major
commission outside Los Angeles. In January, he was named director of
the Southern California Institute for Architecture, one of the
region's most progressive design schools.</TE>
<TE>   And with the completion in December of his latest work, the
Stealth Building, Moss seems to be resurfacing as an architect
concerned with the world outside his head. Located at 3528 Hayden
Ave. in Culver City, the project is a provocative reworking of the
conventional suburban office block. Its sleek, chiseled forms are
pulled and twisted, recalling a rational world deformed by
unconscious urges. Perhaps more important, the project's relationship
with the surrounding buildings suggests a new urban model, an
alternative to the quaint reproductions of small-town America that
now dominate the profession.</TE>
<TE>   The project is the latest addition to an existing Moss-designed
office park, set around a landscaped parking lot. Along one side, two
existing warehouses have been transformed into advertising offices,
their facades partially sliced away and reclad in enormous sheets of
glass. Opposite, a small performance space is embedded in the facade
of another warehouse building. The performance space's steps,
protected under sheets of undulating glass, cascade down from the
building's corner like a gigantic, airborne jellyfish.</TE>
<TE>   The new building, which forms the entry to this complex, is
actually two interlocking structures, one old, the other new. An
existing, one-story factory shed extends along the street at ground
level, its interior transformed into a series of loft-like offices.
The new two-story structure rests atop this space, propped up on a
series of slender I-beam columns. At one end, its hulking form spans
a narrow driveway, creating a portal to parking in back.</TE>
<TE>   Seen from the street, the Stealth is a tough building to love. A
bland parking lot, interspersed with smaller patches of lawn, faces
the street. The building's dark, faceted facade looms above, looking
like the bomber it was named after. Two large cylinders, painted a
crude silver, carve up through the core of the building, anchoring it
to the site.</TE>
<TE>   But the design's impact stems from its ability to conjure up old
suburban myths, both soothing and disturbing. The patches of lawn are
a play on notions of suburban tranquillity. The building's facade,
which transforms from a conventional office block at one end to a
menacing, wing-like form at the other, embodies the tension between
America's economic confidence and the military industrial complex
that remains such an important part of it.</TE>
<TE>   Those tensions are reflected in the building's interiors as well,
which are conceived as a series of distinct zones. The building's
south wing, for example, is surprisingly subdued. Rows of glass boxes
line the back wall, with simple square windows overlooking the office
park in back. On the lower floor, the long strip window narrows to a
point at one end, the only hint of the building's dynamic exterior.</TE>
<TE>   At its other end, however, the offices begin to break apart. The
building's front wall protrudes out toward the street, tearing free
of the floor slab. The third floor becomes a mezzanine, with views
down through a long, canted strip window to the street below. Above,
a second strip of windows allows light to spill down onto both
floors. The entire wall is braced by a series of canted steel
columns, heightening the sense of vertigo.</TE>
<TE>   These two wings are joined via a central lobby terrace, which is
partially open to the outdoors. The lobby is framed by the canted
facade, which is braced by more steel columns. Above, a fragment of a
ribbon window reappears, forming a glass canopy over the
double-height space. A heavy, internal bridge passes overhead,
linking the two third-floor office wings. The idea is to create a
compact "social condenser," where office workers can loiter, mingle
and escape the suffocating ennui of their daily lives.</TE>
<TE>   Such spaces recall the work of the late New York artist Gordon
Matta Clarke, who carved apart abandoned townhouses with a chain saw,
an act that served as a powerful metaphor for the social upheavals
and generational conflicts of the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Moss' work is not as graceful as Matta Clark's. Nor is it as
compelling a work of social commentary. But its underlying themes are
similar: the release of repressed, unconscious forces; the struggle
for individual expression and social instability.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, the quality of Moss' individual designs may be
less important than the originality of his urban vision.</TE>
<TE>   During the past decade, architects have felt increasingly free to
create buildings that are radical expressions of the contemporary
condition. Urban planners, meanwhile, have retreated into a
neo-traditional vision of the city: pedestrian enclaves that ooze
with the nostalgia of a Norman Rockwell painting.</TE>
<TE>   Moss' loosely knit collection of architectural baubles offers a
less facile alternative. Seen from the terraces of the Stealth
building, the relationship between Moss' strange additions and the
existing landscape has a surprising harmony. With each new addition,
that sense of balance only promises to get stronger.</TE>
<TE>   As such, the development represents an urban ideal that is less
homogenous and more tolerant than the norm. It is a world where the
outcast, the oddball and the eccentric coexist with the rational, the
mainstream and the conventional.</TE>
<TE>   Years from now, that idea may well turn out to be Moss' most
lasting contribution to architecture.</TE>

<LD>Talk to rock talent scouts these days and three names seem to be the
primary reference points for hot new acts: Dave Matthews, At the
Drive-In and the Strokes.</LD>
<LD>   Of the three, only Matthews has been a superstar with super record
sales to his name. Drive-In was perhaps on its way when it broke up
last year, and the Strokes' debut album, "Is This It?," is off to a
promising start. But neither band's territory--aggressive and earnest
for ATDI, neo-garage punk-pop for the Strokes--is exactly a proven
gold mine.</LD>
<LD>   Yet label executives around the business are looking for the
"next" of each act as much as the next Matthews.</LD>
<TE>   So if you want to play along at home, keep these three names in
mind: Howie Day, Thursday and the Hives.</TE>
<TE>   Boston-based Day is the hottest name among several buzz acts seen
as tapping into the same audience appeal as Matthews. A
singer-songwriter who performs solo with an acoustic guitar and a
boom box playing rhythm tracks, Day has been courted heavily by major
labels of late. A recent L.A. show was jammed with record company
executives, and Day is said to be close to choosing from several
substantial contract offers.</TE>
<TE>   He's not alone in the field. With such acts as John Mayer and Jack
Johnson proving that the collegiate and young-adult following
associated with Matthews has interest in new acts, there's label heat
around the reggae-tinged band O.A.R. and Massachusetts trio Dispatch.</TE>
<TE>   "Both Dispatch and O.A.R. are getting airplay in Chicago on a
modern rock radio station," says DreamWorks Records A&amp;R executive
Luke Wood, whose signings have included punk band A.F.I. and rock act
Jimmy Eat World. "Both come from the frat-house jam-band world."</TE>
<TE>   On the At the Drive-In side of things, Mars Volta--featuring
ADTI's singer and guitarist--still has not made a deal. But the
latest name drawing a lot of attention is Thursday, a group from
Chicago associated with the oh-so-sincere "emo" movement. Its "Full
Collapse" album, released last year on the independent Victory
Records label, has been getting video airplay on MTV2 and has been
selling about 3,000 copies a week.</TE>
<TE>   "The singer sounds like Morrissey meets [the Cure's] Robert Smith,
and the production elements are an indie-punk version of that," says
MCA Vice President of A&amp;R Tom Sarig.</TE>
<TE>   The Hives may well be--no pun intended--the most buzzed-about band
in the realm of the Strokes and the White Stripes, following those
two as the latest rock sensation in the English music press. The
Swedish band makes urgent, noisy, intelligently sarcastic rock
influenced equally by '60s garage-rock and '80s punk. Via the indie
label Burning Heart, the band's second album, "Vini Vidi Vicious,"
was released by L.A.'s Epitaph Records in late 2000. Epitaph has the
rights to the band's next release, but major-label interest has grown
intense in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   "They could be the Strokes meet Green Day," Sarig says. "The songs
are really cool and exciting, but also commercial."</TE>
<TE>   All these bands have established themselves with indie releases
and steady touring, which is both a blessing and a curse when it
comes to jumping to the majors.</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking No. 1 for music that's authentic and connects
with people," Wood says. "That bodes well. But the trick is to see
how as a business you can work with these people and help them grow.
And as you start inviting much more grass-roots artists and fan bases
into the mainstream, you've got to stick with them, and that's
historically something we haven't seen. I'm so afraid that in three
years 500 emo-core bands signed by majors will get dropped."</TE>
<TE>   NOT PRODIGIOUS: It's been nearly five years since the Prodigy's
high-profile signing with Maverick Records and its hit album "The Fat
of the Land" brought all that "electronica's the next big thing" talk
to a head. The album hit No. 1 in the U.S. and sold about 2.5 million
copies, with the hit single "Firestarter" and the controversial
"Smack My Bitch Up" leading the way. A lot has happened in pop music
since then--but not another Prodigy album.</TE>
<TE>   There's one on the way, though. The group is working on an album,
tentatively titled "Always Out Numbered Never Out Gunned," and has
returned to live action as well, with plans for its first U.S.
concerts since 1998. The shows will be April 27 at the Las Vegas
House of Blues and April 28 at the Coachella Music and Arts Festival
in Indio.</TE>
<TE>   To hear Prodigy leader Liam Howlett talk, the group stayed away
too long.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking forward to being back in America to do these shows
and play a few new tracks from the forthcoming album," he says,
"'cause you must be bored with that nu metal nonsense by now."</TE>
<TE>   FROM CONTROVERSY TO TRIBUTE: The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
brought extra attention for an indie Athens, Ga., electro-pop duo
using the name I Am the World Trade Center--and much of it wasn't
good. Deluged with e-mail and media commentary, Dan Gellar and Amy
Hairston announced they would change their performing name.</TE>
<TE>   "People were writing from all over the world, some really rude and
alarming and even threatening," Gellar says. "The way people were
reacting, we thought there was no way we could keep the name."</TE>
<TE>   Now, though, Gellar and Hairston have changed their minds, and a
new album, "The Tight Connection," due in July from Gellar's own
Kindercore Records label, will carry the original name.</TE>
<TE>   "After a few months, it was like a switch flipped," Gellar says.
"Someone had said that after three months people won't feel the same
way, and it was like magic. After three months, people said to us,
'You can't change the name!' People were so behind America that
changing the name would have been an insult."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: It was Aaron Lewis' appearance on the "Family Values
Tour 1999" album that launched him and his band, Staind, to the top
of the rock world. So it's no shock that Lewis is the star of "Family
Values Tour 2001," an album recorded on last year's edition of the
hard-rock trek.</TE>
<TE>   Not only are there two Staind tracks and one by Lewis solo, but
the somber singer also guests on Stone Temple Pilots' "Creep" and
Linkin Park's "One Step Closer." The album, due May 7 from Elektra
Records, also features performances by Static-X and Deadsy....</TE>
<TE>   Don Henley and Train are set to headline Tiger Woods' fifth annual
Tiger Jam concert, April 20 at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las
Vegas. Tickets go on sale next Sunday for the event, which raises
money for VH1 Save the Music, the Grammy in the Schools program, and
various youth-oriented charities in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.... The
Delta Heavy 2002 tour being organized by Sasha and Digweed is shaping
into a battle of the DJs, at least on some dates. The Chemical
Brothers have signed on for April 20 in Chicago, April 24 in Phoenix
and April 26 in San Francisco, with Paul Oakenfold joining in Chicago
and San Francisco. The tour intersects with the Coachella festival on
April 27 and 28, with those and other DJ acts involved....</TE>
<TE>   Warren Zevon's next album, "My Ride's Here," sees the
singer-songwriter teamed with four literary lyricists. American
writers Hunter S. Thompson, Mitch Albom and Carl Hiaasen, and Irish
poet Paul Muldoon all contribute words to Zevon's music.</TE>

<LD>   VARIOUS ARTISTS</LD>
<LD>   "Evangeline Made: A Tribute to Cajun Music"</LD>
<TE>   Vanguard</TE>
<TE>   In the stress and complexity of modern life, there's always room
for music that feels cleansing and unspoiled, which is most certainly
why many of the pop fans who loved the Buena Vista Social Club album
also found much to enjoy in "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" The music
may have been from Cuba and Nashville, respectively, but there's a
common sense of emotional purity in the two collections.</TE>
<TE>   The motherland in the case of "Evangeline Made" (due in stores
Tuesday) is southwest Louisiana, where Cajun music has asserted its
liberating zest for more than two centuries, thanks to its
distinctive mix of lively, accordion-and-fiddle instrumental
seasoning and spirited, French-language vocals</TE>
<TE>   Rather than produce an album of her fellow Cajun artists, musician
and musicologist Ann Savoy wanted to demonstrate the affection of
pop-rock figures for Cajun music. Her all-star cast ranges from rock
'n' roll master John Fogerty and former Lone Justice cowgirl Maria
McKee to Richard Thompson, Linda Thompson and Nick Lowe. Savoy teams
with Linda Ronstadt on a couple of numbers, and the pairing is as
fluid and engaging as Ronstadt's country-pop duets with Emmylou
Harris.</TE>
<TE>   --Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   QUETZAL</TE>
<TE>   "Sing the Real"</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   SLOWRIDER</TE>
<TE>   "Nacimiento"</TE>
<TE>   !de volada!</TE>
<TE>   The release of new albums by these two Los Angeles bands
highlights the musical melting-pot percolating in the local Latin
alternative scene. Quetzal offers an ambitious set of politically
tinged musings couched in a silky blend of jazzy Afro-folklorico.
Slowrider, the newer group, serves up more of a party mix of Latin
jazz, funk and hip-hop in which lyrics make way for several
instrumentals.</TE>
<TE>   Quetzal is by far the more mature and accomplished outfit. This is
the second album by the multiethnic East L.A. band, which was founded
in 1993 by guitarist and composer Quetzal Flores. My, how they've
grown in just the past two years.</TE>
<TE>   This must be the most highly educated Chicano band in history,
with some of its nine members holding degrees in ethnomusicology,
fine arts, classical music and jazz. Their training shines through on
this intricately textured work (in stores Tuesday), which weaves
sweet vocals and bewitching violins on a gently flowing stream of
rhythms, from cumbia to son.</TE>
<TE>   Although several members are credited as songwriters, the band's
central vision of "organizing through art" belongs to Flores. His
commitment to the cause, inspired by Mexico's Zapatista movement,
occasionally gets heavy-handed, as when he rhymes "community" and
"ideology" in the album's opening musical manifesto, "The Social
Relevance of Public Art." Yet even that difficult tune grows on you,
thanks to the pure and alluring vocals of Martha Gonzalez (who is a
guest on one Slowrider track).</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Slowrider's work (also out Tuesday) often seems
derivative and half-baked. Although the hip-hop vocals grab
attention, the instrumental title cut, which means "birth," sounds
oddly lifeless. Still, Slowrider has promise if it follows Quetzal's
example: Stay the course and keep working at it.</TE>
<TE>   --Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Eleni Mandell, "Snakebite," Space Baby. Less is more, they
say, and this L.A. singer-songwriter does a lot with less on her
third collection (in stores Tuesday). More introverted than 2000's
"Thrill," this album may be less obvious about its pleasures, but the
quiet, slightly noir-country touches resonate well amid her wry,
moody blends of folk, jazz, blues and cabaret. Against stark acoustic
backdrops that accentuate the raw emotion, her voice transforms from
raspy-sweet to sexually hysterical to fervidly scornful, painting
rare portraits of mysterious and desperate lives.</TE>
<TE>   --Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   *** Playgroup, "Playgroup," Astralwerks. After two decades of
production and remix work, Playgroup mastermind Trevor Jackson
clearly knows his way around a beat. On his debut as Playgroup (due
Tuesday), which features a slew of eclectic guest stars, including
Bikini Kill and Le Tigre's Kathleen Hanna and dancehall artist
Shinehead, Jackson turns his experience into a stylish paean to
dance-pop beats of all genres and eras. Like early B-52's, Playgroup
knows that cool and fun aren't mutually exclusive.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Rinocerose, "Music Kills Me," V2. Listeners who like a
little rock with their house music, or vice versa, will enjoy this
French collective. Upbeat in rhythm but gothic in sensibility, with
nods to the Cure, Brian Jones and Jimi Hendrix, "Music Kills Me" (in
stores Tuesday) flows easily from boogie-down dance tracks to
living-room funk light. But it's hit-or-miss when vocals are added to
the mix.</TE>
<TE>   --Susan Carpenter</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 RockFour, "Another Beginning," Rainbow Quartz. Those who
witnessed this Israeli foursome's Midnight Oily club gigs last summer
in L.A. might be surprised to find them marching alongside Sgt.
Pepper into a Byrdsian haze. Well, the lava lamps are aglow in Tel
Aviv, illuminating RockFour's political and personal themes.
Shaven-headed frontman Eli Lulai teeters on imitation in places but
finds his emotional pitch on "President of Me," a ballad that recalls
the work of Neil Finn.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Where do the good songs go?</LD>
<LD>   In 1917, lyricist P.G. Wodehouse outlined the journey taken by old
songs after "they had their day and then we threw them away." The
heavenly ditties flew to a land "on the other side of the moon,"
where "they're always loved and they're always new," wrote Wodehouse.
These lines were part of "The Land Where the Good Songs Go," a number
from the musical "Miss 1917," for which Jerome Kern wrote the music.</LD>
<LD>   Nowadays, of course, songs don't have to leave the planet to
remain alive. Even a typical preteen has a fairly sizable collection
of favorites on CD. With advances in cyberspace, obtaining and making
recordings becomes easier all the time, and the fracturing of the
music market has led to the proliferation of boutique labels--in
theater music as well as in other genres.</LD>
<TE>   Witness "The Land Where the Good Songs Go" itself. It's now
available on a new double CD, "Jerome Kern: Life Upon the Wicked
Stage," from LML Music. Sung by Pamela Myers in the piercing style of
a Broadway diva and arranged by Ron Abel so that the song picks up a
catchy beat and swells into a grand finale, the once-demure little
tune has become a glamour queen, worthy of closing a first act in
some multimillion-dollar musical.</TE>
<TE>   The Kern set is one of five collections of old theater
songs--three of them double CDs--recently released. If only Wodehouse
could hear them now ....</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   JEROME KERN: LIFE UPON</TE>
<TE>   THE WICKED STAGE</TE>
<TE>   Various artists</TE>
<TE>   LML Music</TE>
<TE>   This double CD is a live concert recording, a memento of the most
recent S.T.A.G.E. benefit for people living with HIV or AIDS,
recorded at Cal State L.A.'s Luckman Theater a year ago. But unlike
some recordings of theater music benefits, this one (available online
Friday and in stores May 7) seldom conveys the impression that you're
missing out by merely listening, as opposed to being there in the
theater.</TE>
<TE>   OK, maybe you had to be there to fully appreciate Roger Rees and
Jane Carr singing "A Fine Romance." Judging from their comments,
apparently they were dressed as a cat and a canary. One also wonders
if Lea Thompson really shimmied during her take on "Shimmy With Me,"
and what Bonnie Franklin and Reece Holland did during "I Won't
Dance."</TE>
<TE>   But most of the other 29 numbers sound complete with just the
soundtrack. They cover a vast swath of Kern's oeuvre, from a Jane
Lanier rendition of "How'd You Like to Spoon With Me?" (from "The
Earl and the Girl" in 1905) to the magnificent "In Love in Vain"
(from the movie "Centennial Summer," released in 1946, after Kern's
death in 1945) sung by Melissa Errico. Ron Rifkin is in fine voice
for "Remind Me," from a 1940 film.</TE>
<TE>   Fans of "Show Boat," Kern's most famous and monumental work, get a
respectable selection, sung by Brock Peters, Valarie Pettiford, Linda
Michele (an especially lush Abel arrangement of "Make Believe"), and
Dale Kristien and Hugh Panaro in a duet.</TE>
<TE>   Far less predictable is some of the novelty casting. Comedy writer
Bruce Vilanch recites (as opposed to sings) "They All Look Alike"
from 1917's "Have a Heart"--the title refers to the male gender.
Playwright Charles Busch introduces "The Last Time I Saw Paris" as "a
haunting, meditative reflection" and then interprets it in a brassy,
flamboyant fashion that belies his adjectives. The only such casting
that falls flat is Rod McKuen's faltering "Look for the Silver
Lining."</TE>
<TE>   The recording ends with a description of Kern's final hours,
spoken by Carole Cook, that leads gently into "Till the Clouds Roll
By."</TE>
<TE>   This year's S.T.A.G.E. benefit, a tribute to Johnny Mercer, will
take place at the Luckman on Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and next
Sunday at 3 p.m. Information: (323) 656-9069.</TE>

<TE>   DREAMGIRLS IN CONCERT</TE>
<TE>   Lillias White, Audra McDonald, Heather Headley and other artists</TE>
<TE>   Nonesuch</TE>
<TE>   Another recording from a live benefit concert, this one brought
together three of Broadway's reigning divas to play the original
Dreams in a revival of the ferocious Henry Krieger/Tom Eyen musical
"Dreamgirls," about a Supremes-like group's turbulent rise to the top
of the charts.</TE>
<TE>   The concert was a New York benefit for the Actors' Fund, held 13
days after the terrorist attacks plunged New York into a nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   Lillias White, a Tony Award winner for "The Life," tackled Effie,
as she had done previously on tour and on Broadway. Audra McDonald, a
three-time Tony winner, played Deena Jones, the Diana Ross-like
character, while Heather Headley of "Aida" fame played Lorrell
Robinson, the least prominent of the three Dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Listening to the show without benefit of the dynamic staging that
usually accompanies it demonstrates how important that staging is.
The music itself, while ideal for the context, doesn't have many
discrete, detachable selections; large chunks of this recording
consist of dialogue or half-sung talk with a musical background.
However, the big numbers here are very big, especially the thunderous
first-act finale, "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going."</TE>
<TE>   This format also points out that the first part of the show
belongs to the men as much as the women, especially to Billy Porter's
soul star James Thunder Early. In 2000, Porter won an Ovation Award
for playing the same role at Civic Light Opera of South Bay Cities,
and he's terrific.</TE>
<TE>   Once the women take over, it's fun to listen to McDonald, known
for her high-class choices of material, playing a character who
becomes more crass as the show goes on, and playing her very well.
But the emotional heart of the show is still White's Effie.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the character's sometimes exasperating personality,
White's voice alone is enough to break hearts.</TE>
<TE>   ***1/2</TE>
<TE>   KURT WEILL: THE CENTENNIAL</TE>
<TE>   Various artists</TE>
<TE>   LML Music</TE>
<TE>   Actors' Fund benefits are also held in Los Angeles, including this
tribute concert in late 2000, a century after Weill's birth. The
producers were the same S.T.A.G.E. crew who produced the Kern album,
and some of the talent overlaps between albums.</TE>
<TE>   The astringent sounds of Weill's signature work in Germany were a
far cry from the usual Kern melodies. But once Weill came to America,
his work began to resemble more closely the songs of the Broadway
giants, including Kern. With 22 numbers, this recording offers a
sampler from both eras. And the overall consistency is a little
higher than that of the Kern collection.</TE>
<TE>   The album opens with Charlotte Rae singing "Pirate Jenny." Those
who know of Rae only from the sitcom "The Facts of Life" may groan.
But in fact Rae was in the famous 1954 production of Weill's "The
Threepenny Opera" off-Broadway. And her Pirate Jenny sounds
remarkably, effectively raw.</TE>
<TE>   Other highlights from Weill's German work include Linda Purl's
"Barbara Song," Tim Curry's "Surabaya Johnny" (sung in German even
though the liner credits refer to "translation by Michael Feingold")
and Loretta Devine forced to sing too high in "Mack the Knife."</TE>
<TE>   The lesser-known American works feature lyrics by such diverse
collaborators as Ogden Nash, Langston Hughes, Maxwell Anderson and
Ira Gershwin.</TE>
<TE>   The singers include Pam Dawber, Nancy Dussault, Sharon Lawrence,
Sally Kellerman (whose husky timbre is ideal for "Speak Low"),
Shirley Jones, Brock Peters, Hugh Panaro and--redeeming himself from
his performance on the Kern collection--Rod McKuen, whose ragged
voice is better suited for the autumnal lyrics of "September Song."</TE>

<TE>   1998 Royal National Theatre</TE>
<TE>   production cast album</TE>
<TE>   First Night Records</TE>
<TE>   Recorded in London in 1998, this CD will probably capitalize on
the March 21 opening of the Broadway version of the same production
of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein classic.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the casting has changed for the American rendition.
Curly, who was played by the now-famous Hugh Jackman in London and on
this recording, will be played by Patrick Wilson of "Full Monty" fame
on Broadway. However, this CD's Laurey, Josefina Gabrielle, will be
on Broadway, as will its Jud, Shuler Hensley.</TE>
<TE>   Jackman brings a light, open sound to Curly's songs, in stark
contrast to the deeper, smoother, more urbane sound of the original
Broadway production's Alfred Drake.</TE>
<TE>   Gabrielle, by contrast, sounds less airy and a little more mezzo
than the most prominent previously recorded Laureys. Vicki Simon's
Ado Annie is notably less deadpan and more full-throated than most of
her predecessors.</TE>
<TE>   At more than 73 minutes, this recording offers a lot more
music--and more dialogue--than the original Broadway record's 50
minutes, and almost as much music as the film's soundtrack, which was
released on CD at more than 76 minutes. This CD includes the lush
ballet music that ends the first act and was dropped from the
original stage recording. And we get the men's chorus "It's a
Scandal! It's an Outrage!" and the solo "Lonely Room," both of which
were omitted from the movie soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   Orchestral bird calls open Jackman's rendition of "Oh, What a
Beautiful Mornin'," and we hear Curly and Laurey commenting on each
other's admonitions during "People Will Say We're in Love." These
aren't big changes, but they do evince a willingness to rethink
little nuances. Let's hope that the New York version measures up.</TE>

<TE>   BERNADETTE PETERS LOVES</TE>
<TE>   RODGERS &amp; HAMMERSTEIN</TE>
<TE>   Bernadette Peters</TE>
<TE>   Angel</TE>
<TE>   The actress and singer who's most often associated with the work
of Stephen Sondheim dips into the preceding generation of musical
composers with mixed results.</TE>
<TE>   In her new CD, due in stores March 12, Peters sounds more at home
with such raucous comic items as "The Gentleman Is a Dope" than with
the high-flying ode "If I Loved You" or the anthem "You'll Never Walk
Alone."</TE>
<TE>   Sondheim collaborator Jonathan Tunick did the arrangements and
co-produced the album. His most unusual handiwork is in "There Is
Nothin' Like a Dame," which normally isn't associated with the likes
of Peters--or indeed, with anyone of the dame persuasion. Here it
becomes a big-mama blast, almost an arrangement that you could strip
to.</TE>
<TE>   Listen too to such relative rarities as "So Far," "I Haven't Got a
Worry in the World" and "Something Good." And listen to the little
catch in Peters' voice at the tail end of "Something
Wonderful"--that's the kind of grace note that gives her sound its
personality and, yes, wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). They are already
released unless otherwise noted.</TE>

<DH>Cellist Felix Fan created the San Diego festival Muzik3 to
play and hear unorthodox pieces.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL USLAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Passive audience members can't exist at the Muzik3 festival in San
Diego. How could they? Seated within a circle of six percussionists
hitting metal pipes, planks and foil, the audience is all but forced
to participate.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not something you're thinking about; it's something you're
vibrating to," explains Steven Schick of the program he and his
percussion sextet Red Fish Blue Fish will perform at the fifth annual
Muzik3 festival opening Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "It's homemade surround sound," says Morris Palter, another member
of the group.</LD>
<TE>   An evening of bone-rattling rhythm is one of the seven unorthodox
aural experiences that will make up this year's Muzik3, which unfolds
during the next three weekends in San Diego. From percussion pieces
played on junkyard metal (and composed by Iannis Xenakis) to a cello
instructed to sing to itself (in David Lang's "Little Eye"), each
concert will feature the kind of music that draws the adventurous.</TE>
<TE>   It was five years ago when cellist Felix Fan was struck with the
motivation to create such a draw. Fan, 27, who grew up in San Diego
and now lives in New York and Paris, was presented with a grant from
corporate and private donors that he could spend however he pleased.
He chose to create a festival, calling it Muzik3 for the types of
music--contemporary, pre-contemporary and improvised, in his
words--he planned to present.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, it was just an excuse to invite my friends to come to
California, hang out and play some music," Fan says. "It was also a
way for me to be able to play the pieces I wanted to play and hear
the pieces I wanted to hear."</TE>
<TE>   For the festival's site, Fan chose his parents' living room--no
ordinary space. "They have this big room where we can seat maybe 300
people," Fan says. As supporters of the San Diego music community,
Chris and Sue Fan (he's a biochemist; she's a piano instructor), were
used to opening up their home to players. Every year, when the La
Jolla Chamber Music Society holds its SummerFest, the Fan house
becomes its rehearsal space and even a musicians' hotel.</TE>
<TE>   But after two years in the living room and one at the San Diego
Art Institute, Muzik3 moved to its current home, Sushi, a former
Carnation milk factory turned avant-garde performance space in
downtown San Diego. Although Sushi also fits about 300 people--Fan
doesn't want the audience size to get larger--the number of concerts
in Muzik3 has increased, at the rate of about one a year, he says.</TE>
<TE>   As Muzik3's artistic director, Fan chooses who and to a large
degree what will be on the program. As might be expected from a
performer who plays with chamber groups and sometimes a ska band, his
choices come from all over the spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   During the first weekend, Raw Fish, a string quartet made up of
Fan, violinists Jennifer Frautschi and Nurit Pacht and violist Peter
Bucknell will pair two Dmitri Shostakovich quartets, No. 8 and No. 4,
with "Different Trains," written by Steve Reich in 1988, and "Black
Angels," written by George Crumb in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   The earlier Shostakovich work was written in 1949 but not
performed until after Stalin's death in 1953. Quartet No. 8, his most
famous, is dedicated to the memory of victims of fascism and war.
Crumb's piece is an antiwar reaction to Vietnam, and "Different
Trains," inspired by Reich's railway journeys as a child, features a
tape of sampled voices whose looped phrases hint at a larger picture;
some of them come from interviews with Holocaust survivors recalling
a train ride to a concentration camp.</TE>
<TE>   Fan says the programs' ties to issues of war and peace are "purely
coincidental." He put the pieces together because that just made
sense to him.</TE>
<TE>   What also makes sense to him, this year at least, is to add an
element to the Reich piece, a screen dropped in front of the quartet
showing video images of trains. The tape, which he made, will create
what he hopes will be a silent-film effect.</TE>
<TE>   That's the kind of programming that has enticed Frautschi, a
Southern Californian whose career as a soloist and an ensemble player
is taking her all over the world, to become a repeat Muzik3
performer.</TE>
<TE>   "Muzik3 is really a great chance to play music that's not at other
mainstream festivals," says Frautschi, who at last year's festival
performed a Crumb piece on electric violin. "It's exciting and a real
challenge to play with things which alter the medium and throw in a
variable."</TE>
<TE>   Another repeat Muzik3 performer, Palter of Red Fish Blue Fish,
also relishes the festival's spirit of artistic freedom. For his
solo, in a program dedicated to the Greek composer Xenakis, Palter
has invited a dancer to perform a visual interpretation alongside him
while he plays "Psappha," a work that calls for the player to choose
his or her "instruments" from an assortment of objects, saw blades
and the like--"whatever's inspiring me at the moment," Palter says.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's ever been done before, to have someone dance
to the Xenakis. But I think the music makes you want to move. And
Felix trusts my judgment," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Palter is one of the five graduate students at UC San Diego who
make up Red Fish Blue Fish along with their professor, Steven Schick.
Their performance, the group's first in Muzik3, solidifies an
inevitable tie between the festival and the new music specialists at
UCSD's music department.</TE>
<TE>   Palter says the ensemble, which just completed a recording of
Xenakis, is eager to bring an entire concert of his music to a larger
audience. "It's very rhythmical and very athletic, and it's easy to
project that rhythm onto people who may not 'understand' contemporary
music," he says, crediting Fan for bringing crowds to new music.</TE>
<TE>   "Felix keeps up a relationship with the San Diego community. I
don't know how he does it, but it's always full every night," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Neale Perl, executive director of the La Jolla Chamber Music
Society, which is co-presenting Muzik3's final concert, agrees the
young cellist has a "big fan club in San Diego."</TE>
<TE>   "As a professional cellist myself, I've been following Felix's
progress since he was a little boy," says Perl, who remembers when
Fan was more interested in surfing than in practicing.</TE>
<TE>   Fan began with private lessons in San Diego, and then at age 11
drove to USC every weekend to study with cellist-professor Eleonore
Schoenfeld. During high school, he flew to Indiana University every
few months to learn from Janos Starker, whom Fan calls his "cellist
hero." After high school, he moved to Germany to attend the
Hochschule fur Musik Koln.</TE>
<TE>   As a soloist or a chamber musician, Fan has appeared with the
Orquesta Radio Television Espanola, in Spain, with the BargeMusic
chamber series in New York City, and with the San Diego Symphony. The
ska band, Common Sense,  based in Southern California, is an ongoing
hobby for him; he last played with it in late February at the House
of Blues in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Perl also calls him a "rising star of SummerFest," where he has
played in various ensembles since 1992. Recently, Perl invited him to
take part in the society's Discovery Series, which highlights
performers on the way up.</TE>
<TE>   "Not that he needed to be discovered, but the kind of music he was
performing did," Perl says.</TE>
<TE>   Because Fan's Discovery Series concert will coincide with Muzik3,
Perl and Fan decided to present one performance, the festival's
finale, under both banners. The collaboration will put Muzik3 into
its largest venue yet, Sherwood Auditorium at the San Diego Museum of
Contemporary Art, and it will give the society a chance to present
composers it has never presented before.</TE>
<TE>   Fan, along with the New York City-based Talujon Percussion
Quartet, will play the Lang piece (Lang is co-founder of the music
festival and ensemble Bang on a Can). They will also perform works by
Tan Dun, the Oscar-winning composer for "Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon"; and the enduringly controversial John Cage.</TE>
<TE>   It's just the kind of mix Fan thrives on, and any pressure to make
Muzik3 more conventional, and perhaps more popular, does not exist in
his mind. "We don't really have any fear of what we put on stage. We
will throw in somebody like Sam Rivers [who plays mostly
improvisational jazz and will perform twice in this year's festival]
on the same program with a Beethoven quartet. And with your typical
Beethoven crowd, it's hit or miss whether they're going to like Sam
Rivers or not, and vice versa. You don't really know what's going to
happen, and I actually find that kind of exciting," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Perl says he's impressed with how Fan has created more opportunity
for himself and his colleagues with Muzik3. "Young musicians really
need to make their own opportunities and take their careers into
their own hands. He's made a special niche" with Muzik3, he says.</TE>
<TE>   And one that can inspire some exciting performances, Perl
believes. "Younger musicians are committed to this repertoire.
They're giving it to you fresh. You don't know what to expect, and
then you're just bowled over, because these are the artists of the
future."</TE>
<TE>   Fan knows not everyone thrives on unpredictability. But he
believes there are rewards to be found among the saw blades, the
video installations and the cello instructed to sing to itself. "For
somebody who has never been to a contemporary music concert before,
it's a great leap of faith. It takes a certain amount of openness to
even get yourself there. But come with an open mind. One out of 10
concerts you go to, there is something you will hear that will really
catch your ear. And for those times, it's really worth going."</TE>
<TE>   "He's being very modest," Perl responds. "The ratio will be much
higher than that."</TE>

<HD>Exercising Their Options to Disagree on El Toro</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Times' editorial, "Retain the El Toro Option," Feb. 16, opined
that Measure W needs to be rejected, coupled with the expectation
that the county then provide for better leadership in dealing with
the El Toro issue.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, the editorial also stated that "regional
decisions were traditionally dictated mostly by a moneyed elite with
ready access to compliant county supervisors." The sad fact is that
this time-honored tradition is not going to change as demonstrated by
the actions of the pro-airport majority and acknowledged in your
editorial, which said the county, through ineptitude and arrogance,
bungled the El Toro planning process.</LD>
<LD>   The fact of the matter is the county has lost its credibility. The
decision to determine their own destiny is now in the hands of the
people of Orange County. The county must accept that decision by
implementing its provisions.</LD>
<TE>   Vote yes on Measure W!</TE>
<TE>   Paul Willems</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I agree with The Times' decision to oppose Measure W and thus
retain the El Toro option for an airport, but I believe an
explanation is needed for why the county's leadership has been at
fault in the planning process.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the three supervisors made it clear from the beginning that
they opposed any airport at the El Toro site and were determined to
stop the process. That declaration of war created a horrible
atmosphere of secrecy, distrust and ultimate disaster.</TE>
<TE>   If all five had worked together on the project, they might have
reached reasonable compromises, and those responsible for the
planning could have been more forthright in sharing their work,
without fear of giving information to those who were searching for
ways to sabotage their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The Times is right. If Measure W is defeated, a more reasonable,
less ambitious airport solution must be reached by all parties for
the sake of this county's future. But if that is to happen, each of
the supervisors must first be willing to go to the table with the
goal of helping and not hindering the process, with an attitude of
compromise and not contempt.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Olson</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Measure W doesn't give Orange County a free park. All it does is
rezone the land and eliminate El Toro as an airport option. This will
guarantee a massive expansion of John Wayne (up to three times its
current size and capacity), which will heavily affect many North
County cities, including Costa Mesa, Newport Beach, Tustin, Orange,
Santa Ana and Anaheim. Airplanes will be forced to fly over
neighborhoods that previously have escaped most of the effect of John
Wayne Airport's proximity to them. All Orange County cities (and the
city of Irvine itself, ironically) will feel the effect as well, as
Measure W opens the door to massive future development of the El Toro
site and land around it.</TE>
<TE>   A Feb. 11 Times article noted that two developments the Irvine Co.
wants to build on vacant land next to El Toro would generate 358,000
daily car trips versus a maximum of 176,000 daily trips for the
airport. If Measure W passes and the El Toro area is rezoned, these
future residents, and more, will drive the freeways to John Wayne
Airport and to LAX, increasing the risk of auto accidents
significantly as they compete with the diesel tankers trucking fuel
to John Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   Residential and business communities will be demolished and
multiyear construction projects commenced to make room for the
expansion of John Wayne, creating even greater traffic jams. Take a
look at the environmental impact report found in your local library
if you're doubtful of these facts (alternatives F and G).</TE>
<TE>   Orange County residents need to know they are not voting for a
park if they vote yes on W. They are voting to expand John Wayne,
develop the El Toro site and vacant land surrounding it, and in the
process dramatically increase air pollution, traffic, risk of air and
road accidents, and decrease the quality of life for all Orange
County residents. Vote no on W.</TE>
<TE>   Cecilia Flanagan</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The source of Orange County's present and future economic
prosperity has been, and will be, the quality of life and not the
presence of an airport. The principal contributor to the increase in
the value of our homes, one of our most significant investments, has
been the quality of life and not the presence of a major
transportation hub.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Dr. Gerhard "Rusty" Rostvold, a leading California
economist, completed a study of the economic damages versus the
economic benefits of an airport at the former El Toro Marine base.
His conclusion is simple: The economic damages--measured in terms of
the loss in the value of our homes, the loss of jobs, and the
inability to provide additional housing so badly needed in this
county, and other important indicators--total approximately $20
billion. This amount is more than two times the economic benefits of
the area.</TE>
<TE>   This does not measure the environmental damages such as noise, air
pollution and traffic congestion. These damages would be even greater
and would "destroy the quality of life currently enjoyed by more than
240,000 people living within the primary landing and takeoff pattern
of the proposed El Toro airport," Rostvold said.</TE>
<TE>   In the next 20 years, the largest population growth in the
five-county Los Angeles region will occur in Riverside and San
Bernardino counties. There are four existing airports in these two
counties with enough capacity to serve the growth in air passenger
demand for the next half century. Let's opt for a park and economic
prosperity in Orange County.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Most Voters Oppose El Toro Airport but Divide Over Park," Feb.
24: In a desperate attempt to counter overwhelming public support for
Measure W, pro-airport forces have falsely claimed the initiative
will significantly raise taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing could be further from the truth. Proposition 13 requires
taxes raised by local governments be approved by two-thirds of
voters. That is the law. The taxes threatened by park opponents are
just another dishonest pro-airport scare tactic.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro has nothing to do with satisfying regional demand, cargo,
creating jobs or taxes. What El Toro represents is a
"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" for Newport Beach to finally be rid
of John Wayne Airport, and nothing more.</TE>
<TE>   The citizens of Orange County deserve a better plan than an
airport for El Toro. Measure W is about the future, about hope, about
our quality of life and about the legacy we will leave to our
children.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Central Park and Nature Preserve Initiative
provides a monumental opportunity to create a dynamic public place
for education, recreation and cultural life. It is an expression of
the values we cherish and our capacity to transform a major public
asset into a special place where nature, ideas and the human spirit
flourish. On Tuesday, vote yes on Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Prince</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm concerned that many people in Orange County do not realize
that the former El Toro base is the size of a city. It is absolutely
huge. For that reason, great thought must go into the reuse of that
land.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W will rezone the property from airport use to that of a
huge park, businesses and homes. That concerns me because the last
thing this county needs is a major influx of new families to
contribute to our already crowded freeways, schools, malls, etc. What
we don't know is the toll all of those new homes and businesses will
take.</TE>
<TE>   I'm voting no on Measure W to keep the county's preferred plan in
place. A moderate-size airport, golf courses, parks and open land is
a far more reasonable and responsible solution for our future.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Goodin</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Isn't it ironic that in El Toro--the Bull--the people of Orange
County are caught on the horns of a dilemma: We hate airports, their
noise and pollution, yet we use airports and need them for business
and personal travel. At the root of the seesaw battle over base reuse
is our failure to address this as the conundrum it is.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years you have printed countless letters from readers who
decry the evils of an airport at El Toro while apparently finding no
fault with an airport a few miles down the road at John Wayne, and
who presumably would find it even less noxious were we to convert the
Los Alamitos reserve center to a commercial airport. Conversely, many
environmentally aware and concerned citizens who hate pollution and
who fight for a clean environment believe that the need for an
airport overrides issues of quality of life, and are willing to
support it despite known damage to the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Leadership has not been lacking. It has been nonexistent. While
debate raged, discussion and consensus-building did not. Pre-emptive
votes, manipulation and subterfuge have marked the entire process.
Virtually no attention has been paid to slowing growth, even though
the surge in development has added greatly to the number of potential
users of an airport.</TE>
<TE>   We have not looked at what the county needs and how El Toro can
fit into a plan to improve life for all of us, not just those with
the most power or money. We have not approached El Toro as a
community-wide opportunity or problem to which our problem-solving
skills could be applied.</TE>
<TE>   I agree with The Times' editorial. Even at this late date, we
should pause, think and agree to keep options open. The good people
of Orange County can surely do better than to let themselves be gored
by the horns of El Toro.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Measure W Responses Could Cover a Runway," (letters) Feb. 24:
I agree strongly with Dan Summerl from Laguna Beach when he says
there are several facts that people choose to ignore when the option
of an El Toro airport comes into play. One is that John Wayne Airport
operates at only half the capacity that it was built for. Knowing
this, why should we build a airport when we don't even use the one we
have? Also, airports are a horrible thing when it comes to living
peaceful lives. Would you want to live the remainder of your life
with extremely loud noises every 15 minutes? I don't think you would.
By building this airport, the community is basically saying that we
don't care about the comfort or happiness of our people. That is just
plain rude.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, I think that there is no point whatsoever that we build
this useless airport. It will cause only more controversy and
turmoil, and we definitely don't need that right now. Building the
airport is certainly a waste of time, effort and money.</TE>
<TE>   I hope everyone sees that this airport will lead to nothing but
disaster, so vote yes on Measure W.</TE>

<HD>What Threatens Our Youth Most?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNY BIOCHE</AU>
<BD>Jenny Bioche of Newport Beach is a former radio talk
show host. She can be reached via e-mail: chatwithjenny@hotmail.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have a confession to make. I watch a lot of TV. Enter my home on
any given weeknight, and you'll find me on the couch with a blanket,
a remote and something to eat. Don't get me wrong. It's not that I
don't have a love for the written word. Being a writer affords me the
passion, if not the necessity, to pick up the paper, a book or a
magazine and read to my heart's content. But after the kids are in
bed and the kitchen's cleaned, I indulge in TV talk shows and
prime-time dramas to escape my mother-of-three, cul-de-sac existence.</LD>
<LD>   And, granted, we have more channels, and hence much more junk. But
in the aftermath of Sept. 11, it ain't all bad, folks. Celebrity
interviews discuss movie projects that, once halted after the
tragedy, are now moving forward with a renewed sense of duty,
patriotism and a need to contribute in a meaningful way. Prime-time
storylines weave messages of tolerance and respect for Muslims in
ways that are more relevant to viewers than in previous times. At the
end of the hour, I am often reminded of the preciousness of life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</LD>
<LD>   The underlying theme in these new media messages is that basically
everyone wants a safe, good life for themselves and their children.
We want reassurance that our children will be free from terrorist
oppression. But I'm not so sure that's the enemy that is the most
threatening to our youth.</LD>
<TE>   In February, 15-year-old Charles Bishop flew a plane into a Tampa
skyscraper and killed himself. Immediately the reaction was "It's
part of Bin Laden's network," and the chase was on to hunt down the
fallen youth's alliances. Later it was learned that he acted alone.
Acquaintances described Charles as reserved with signs of depression.
Conversely, his mother described him as happy and well-adjusted.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's John Walker Lindh, from my hometown of San Anselmo,
in Marin County, being held for ties with Al Qaeda terrorists.
Scratch the surface of a well-to-do family living in a privileged
area and you find a young man with a few demons in the closet.</TE>
<TE>   It seems to me that no matter how hard we try to batten down the
hatches at airports and continue our state of heightened alert, the
real danger to our youth is the lack of emotional intimacy from their
parents. Granted, the troubles of Bishop and Lindh are probably
deeply rooted, but as I parent, I know how much my emotional
connection to my own children affects their well-being.</TE>
<TE>   And I suspect that while Bishop and Lindh are extreme examples of
young people in distress, my instincts tell me that if they had been
well-grounded by a consistent, nurturing group of loved ones, these
tragedies could have been prevented. But it seems to me we're putting
more of an emphasis on "staying safe"--that is, physical
security--and overlooking the importance of securing our children's
mental well-being, by connecting with them on their level.</TE>
<TE>   A classic example is how we begin in the early parenting years.
Every time I'm at the playground, I see a parent reprimanding a child
for being emotional. "Don't cry," the mother scolds her toddler,
upset over a sand toy dispute. "You keep it up and you're in
time-out!"</TE>
<TE>   Instead of acknowledging what the child is feeling, this reprimand
teaches the child that unchecked emotions are unacceptable to the
parent. Fast-forward to the teen years, and no wonder our kids
withdraw and seek unhealthy outlets for their feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly in Orange County, I notice parents determined to
"give their children every advantage," in the form of a jampacked
schedule that leaves little down time to just be with the child. How
are we truly going to be in touch with our children when we're so
preoccupied with getting them to practice on time and getting first
place in the science fair?</TE>
<TE>   We have become so focused on what our children do that we are
losing touch with who they are. That's not to say helping our
children achieve goals isn't good. But substituting perfect
attendance at soccer practice with real emotional intimacy can be
disastrous for the child's well-being.</TE>
<TE>   We need to embrace our children's emotions, honor them and help
them cope. "I'm sorry you're upset right now, and I know this is
difficult for you" sure goes further than "Stop crying, we're late
for karate." When we do this, we truly support our children, which is
what unconditional love is all about.</TE>
<TE>   The CBS drama "CSI" portrayed an airplane passenger whose unruly
behavior leads passengers to think he is a terrorist. People descend
on him and kill him. It's later revealed that he was suffering from
encephalitis and unable to communicate his physical distress.</TE>
<TE>   I think in some ways we do the same thing with our children.
Rather than taking five minutes to ask, "Are you OK?," we bulldoze
feelings because they interfere with the schedule or make us
uncomfortable. I wonder what five minutes of compassion would have
done for John Walker Lindh or Charles Bishop. The main character on
"CSI" summed it up perfectly: "It took five men to kill this man.
Maybe it would have taken just one to save him."</TE>

<HD>Social Security Is Still Secure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CONNIE HADDAD</AU>
<BD>Connie Haddad is a former president of the League of
Women Voters in Orange County. She writes from Yorba Linda.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Various myths died Sept. 11. Among them was the myth of a "lockbox"
in which the Social Security surplus (the trust fund) would be
"saved."</LD>
<LD>   Of course there never was such a thing. But it sounded good.
Politicians could pose as defenders of Social Security. They would
lock up ("save") the surplus by using it to pay down debt.</LD>
<LD>   No one is talking lockbox now. This does not mean that the trust
fund is being squandered. The Social Security surplus must, by law,
be loaned to the government, through the purchase of U.S. Treasury
bonds. Whether it is used to pay down debt or pay for a war, every
penny is paid back with interest, earning billions of dollars for the
trust fund.</LD>
<TE>   Until 1983 there was no huge surplus. Social Security was a
pay-as-you-go system with modest reserves. Then, in 1983, Social
Security appeared to be facing insolvency within 18 months. The
primary cause was the unexpected and dramatic increase in the number
of people taking early retirement when it became possible to retire
with reduced benefits at age 62.</TE>
<TE>   The Greenspan Commission was convened to deal with the impending
crisis. That was the beginning of the ever-expanding surplus. The
payroll tax was raised 42%; the age for full retirement benefits was
changed to gradually increase from age 65 to age 67; and benefits
began to be taxed for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   For almost 50 years before 1983, even as the ratio of workers to
retirees dropped dramatically, benefits were expanded nine times to
extend coverage to previously excluded workers. Disability insurance
was added and an annual cost-of-living adjustment was legislated.</TE>
<TE>   The payroll tax increases in 1983, coupled with benefit
reductions, were so extensive that Social Security benefits will be
funded, without any changes, for the longest period in its history.</TE>
<TE>   Yet think tanks and policymakers have created widespread concern
that Social Security is going broke. The reality is an actuarial
calculation of a possible 25% shortfall over three decades away.</TE>
<TE>   The very conservative actuarial assumptions used to predict
economic growth, birth rates, immigration, wages and unemployment
cause each new year's prediction to move the date for possible
insolvency farther into the future--the latest date being 2038--yet
there is much talk about the need to "save" Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   Partial privatization has been the most heavily promoted proposal.
This calls for reducing benefits and making every worker an investor
in the stock market. But the Enron debacle coupled with the declines
in the stock market have temporarily quieted the most vocal advocates
of this approach.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, the bipartisan committee appointed by President Bush
failed to come up with a viable plan for privatization. Covering the
loss of payroll taxes during the decades-long transition period
proved to be an insurmountable obstacle.</TE>
<TE>   They also failed to address who would bear the risk for people
facing poverty, even destitution, as a result of bad investment
decisions, bad luck or Enron-style chicanery.</TE>
<TE>   Disability and Survivors Insurance have also been conspicuously
absent from any discussion of privatization. About one in three
Social Security beneficiaries is not a retiree. Of the more than
262,000 Social Security beneficiaries in Orange County, about 85,000,
many of them children, are receiving Disability or Survivors
Insurance. More than $266 million in Social Security benefits are
paid to Orange County residents every month. About $1 in $5 goes to a
nonretiree.</TE>
<TE>   Most other proposals for changing Social Security, such as
changing the Consumer Price Index or increasing the number of years
used to calculate benefits, either directly or indirectly reduce
benefits. And in spite of the fact that about 80% of workers retire
before age 65 (most at age 62), policymakers continue to favor
raising the retirement age even further--to age 70.</TE>
<TE>   There are, however, several proposals for eliminating possible
shortfalls that do not involve a reduction in benefits.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, no payroll tax is taken from wages above $84,900,
yet workers too poor to pay income taxes are taxed on every cent they
earn. Essentially, the payroll tax is a flat tax with an exemption
for the wealthy. Raising the cap on this tax could eliminate as much
as 90% of a projected shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Before rushing to make any changes in a successful and enormously
popular government-run program, we should keep in mind that
economists can't even predict deficits and surpluses several years in
advance without making embarrassing errors. Look backward 36 years.
Was anyone in 1966 accurately predicting economic conditions for the
year 2002?</TE>
<TE>   We should also consider what happened to California when
influential lobbyists convinced the entire California Legislature
that electricity needed deregulating.</TE>
<TE>   Is there any evidence that elected officials in Washington are any
freer of lobbying influences or more knowledgeable about a complex
issue than California legislators were when they plunged us into the
electricity crisis?</TE>

<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>"You know that old trees just grow stronger. And old rivers just grow
wilder every day. Old people just grow lonesome waiting for someone
to say, hello in there. Hello."</LD>
<LD>   --John Prine</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   PORTLAND, Ore.--It's a familiar scene, but this time you won't
hear me scoffing. I'm looking into the recreation room at a busy
high-rise. We have here a bank of glowing computers, the click-clack
of keyboards, the synthetic sound effects and the hypnotized faces of
people lost to the world around them.</TE>
<TE>   A commonplace sight at offices, homes and Internet arcades. Except
here, the tapping of keyboards occurs to the wound-down beat of an
old clock. You've heard of dragging the mouse, and it really does
drag in this case. The average age of these techno-heads I'm watching
is 84.</TE>
<TE>   One woman finishes her session and swivels slowly in her chair.
She pauses for that necessary interval on the return trip from
cyberspace. Bent over, she grasps for her walker, stuffs her morning
printouts into an apron and shuffles off. Someone whispers that she
is 101, one of the oldest graduates of one of the newest ideas in
geriatrics: wiring up our parents, grandparents and
great-grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   What is viewed as a threat to our youth is proving to be a gift to
our elderly, stimulating their minds, restoring their self-esteem,
keeping them in The Now with friends and family.</TE>
<TE>   I have pondered the "gray gap" before. The subject brought me
here. But until I looked closely, I had not truly understood the
dispiriting impact of the technology revolution on those left behind.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest transformation of this era is occurring all around
millions of older Americans, and they're not part of it. Many blame
themselves. Few of us have thought to help. Or if we tried, say, to
get our parents connected, we often failed.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a big jolt to our entire culture. And there's a
whole generation of us who missed out.... It's something when
everyone else knows," Josephine McWhirter tells me. She is 79, a star
pupil of Spry Learning.</TE>
<TE>   The Portland-based company teaches seniors, one step at a time,
that computers aren't so scary, so fragile or so incomprehensible.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a revelation. It's changed my whole life," she beams.</TE>
<TE>   You don't hear that very often. At least from people who mean it.
I'm happy to get it firsthand. Modern life has meant the isolation of
our elderly, and now modern life has a way to help.</TE>
<TE>   The Pew Internet and American Life Project has determined that
only 15% of those over age 65 have used the Internet. Of those people
who resolve never to go online, 81% are over age 50.</TE>
<TE>   For Devin Williams, 30, a Harvard MBA and budding entrepreneur,
this proved the opportunity for "social enterprise." A onetime
investment banker, she joined with a college friend two years ago to
found Spry, www.Spry learning.com, to produce a computer literacy
curriculum now used at retirement and assisted-living facilities in
four states.</TE>
<TE>   I met Williams at a dinner party a while back and casually
mentioned that I'd given up on the idea that my retired parents would
ever embrace technology.</TE>
<TE>   The excuses that the elderly offer--and Williams has heard them
all--are self-deprecating. I'm too old. I'm too stupid. I'm no good
with gadgets. I'll break the machine. Mostly, it's fear and shame.
And, often, a stubborn reluctance to learn from their children.</TE>
<TE>   Williams invited me to come see what happens when can-do
instructors slow down and begin with the basics. Such as, don't worry
if you press down on the keyboard too long and get a whole string of
letters. See, you can delete them. Or, no, the spell-checker is not
an actual person spying on you. In eight weekly classes, the elderly
are taken from typing to e-mail. So far, Spry has devised 44 advanced
classes on everything from games to managing stock portfolios, with
more in the works.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a godsend," says Norman Barrow, 78, who now keeps in
touch with family and friends via three different e-mail address
books.</TE>
<TE>   Because residents are enthusiastic, retirement homes like
Portland's Calaroga Terrace are now pitching the idea that "you're
never too old to surf."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of never, I never thought I would say it: Sometimes
there's a friend in this ugly, one-eyed box on the table. If you're
over 75, send me an e-mail to john.balzar @latimes.com, and I'll say,
hello out there. Hello.</TE>

<HD>Soccer Is Kicking Into L.A.'s Future</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is an associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Good things doubtless will come to Los Angeles now that construction
is underway on a big soccer complex in Carson. But some bad could
also come of it--like a powerful monopoly controlling how much
international soccer local fans can see, or, God forbid, even the
return of the National Football League.</LD>
<LD>   Ground was broken last week on a $120-million sports facility on
the campus of Cal State Dominguez Hills, to be built by Anschutz
Entertainment Group, which also owns Staples Center, the successful
downtown L.A. arena. Billionaire Philip Anschutz, who controls the
company, has other holdings that include a hockey team that plays at
Staples Center and five Major League Soccer teams, including the Los
Angeles Galaxy.</LD>
<LD>   The Galaxy is the centerpiece of Anschutz's plans for his new
soccer facility. The team will move from the Rose Bowl to a
27,000-seat stadium in Carson to be built by 2003. The Galaxy's new
home is modeled on soccer stadiums in Europe; AEG bills it as the
first "world-class" soccer stadium in the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   Hyperbole aside, there is no denying the benefits of AEG's new
complex. It will be a training site for both the men's and women's
U.S. national soccer teams and will house a tennis stadium and a
Olympic velodrome for cycling. All in all, an ideal project for
Southern California, where year-round good weather makes the sports
that people play as popular as the sports that people sit and watch.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings me to the NFL. Local folks just shrugged when our two
former NFL teams left town in 1995. There has never been a hue and
cry to bring the NFL back. The NFL needs L.A. more than we need the
NFL, and everybody knows it. So pro football has been reduced to
trying to sneak in our backdoor. Or, more precisely, into using AEG's
new soccer facility to reestablish a beachhead in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   AEG spokesmen say that "a few" NFL teams have expressed an
interest in using the Carson site as a summer training camp. The most
likely candidate is the San Diego Chargers, whose owners will use the
implied threat of moving back to L.A. as leverage to prod San Diego
to build the team a new stadium at public expense. We Angelenos must
urge our good neighbors to the south to have none of this cynical
game.</TE>
<TE>   But it will be difficult to keep the Chargers away. Like any
landlord, Anschutz can rent to whatever tenant he wants. He is also
rumored to be interested in buying a minority interest in an NFL
franchise, moving it to L.A. and building it a football stadium near
Staples Center--at his own expense.</TE>
<TE>   If Anschutz can pull off that trifecta, more power to him. But
let's make sure he does it on his dime and not ours--just as city
officials did (under pressure from local taxpayers) when Anschutz
built Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   There is leverage that L.A. officials can use to keep Anschutz's
latest megaproject from having negative side effects. It takes a form
the NFL still must ruefully recall--a lawsuit by the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Last November, the commission filed a federal lawsuit in Los
Angeles accusing Major League Soccer and the U.S. Soccer Federation,
which oversees soccer in this country, of restraint of trade. The
commission alleges that the two U.S. soccer organizations have
interfered with its efforts to stage soccer matches in the Coliseum
featuring international teams.</TE>
<TE>   Under international soccer protocol--and it is just protocol, not
law--the U.S. Soccer Federation can veto the appearance of foreign
teams on U.S. soil. For the Coliseum Commission, the last straw came
when it was forced to cancel a match between Mexico's national team
and a Spanish team because U.S. Soccer exercised its veto power,
claiming the international match might keep soccer fans from
attending a Galaxy game a few days later.</TE>
<TE>   What a lame excuse. And don't be surprised if a federal jury
reaches the same conclusion when the lawsuit comes to trial. Don't
forget that the Coliseum Commission won a big antitrust suit against
the NFL on similar grounds in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   But the NFL is history. The Coliseum's future is soccer. Not the
so-so brand of soccer Anschutz is selling through Major League
Soccer. But international matches like the one held at the Coliseum
two years ago between Mexico and Argentina, which drew 90,000 fans.
Or maybe even putting a Mexican League soccer team in the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Before that can happen, the Coliseum Commission must see its
latest lawsuit through to the bitter end. Anschutz and the powers
that be in U.S. soccer may not like having their cozy empire
challenged. But what makes the free enterprise system work is
competition--both on and off the field.</TE>

<HD>Wednesday's Question: 'What Do We Do Now?'</HD>
<DH>The GOP gubernatorial candidate can't dillydally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL WHALEN</AU>
<BD>Bill Whalen, a research fellow at Stanford's Hoover
Institution, worked on Richard Riordan's gubernatorial exploratory
committee in 2001.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Redford's name isn't on the ballot, but he looms over
Tuesday's vote. For the winner of the GOP gubernatorial primary will
greet Wednesday's dawn asking the same question that was Redford's
final line in his film, "The Candidate": "What do we do now?"</LD>
<LD>   That is, what does he do besides speed-dialing potential donors.
With 32 weeks to Election Day, the GOP nominee will need to raise a
cool million bucks a week to be competitive with Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   And, whomever the nominee is, he will be the Republicans' odd man
in, having won a a hard three-way primary without broad-based party
support. The first order of business will be reaching out to
disaffected fellow Republicans to solidify the GOP base.</LD>
<TE>   Let's say Bill Simon prevails. Common sense dictates that he make
a beeline for those establishment/big-donor Republicans who sided
with Richard Riordan. Simon will have to convince them that he's not
Dan Lungren in designer glasses--another conservative gubernatorial
candidate who can't attract the support of women and minorities.
Simon would do well to jettison his primary campaign mantra that he
is the "conservative Republican" candidate.</TE>
<TE>   But what if Riordan defies Simon's late-campaign momentum to claim
victory? After a primary in which Riordan's record was spun enough
times to earn a Grammy , the former L.A. mayor would need to
re-educate conservatives to his life story. It's not an impossible
sell: He balanced budgets, cut taxes, fought for Rose Bird's ouster.
Not bad for a Republican, conservative or otherwise. The bigger
challenge will come from within--he'll have to stifle the kind of
gaffes he made during the primary, i.e. no more remarks about fellow
Republicans like former Gov. George Deukmejian.</TE>
<TE>   Watching all of this with more than passing interest is the Bush
White House. For as Republicans in California fare, so too will
President Bush's ability to make inroads into "blue state"
America--those states whose support of the president, popular though
he currently is, runs only anti-terrorism deep.</TE>
<TE>   It was the White House that set this state's GOP primary dynamics
in motion by encouraging Riordan to throw his hat in the ring--and
now finds itself awkwardly building a last-minute bridge to a Simon
campaign that it didn't take seriously until the poll numbers
changed. The White House saw Riordan as an extension of its plans for
California, appealing to women and minority voters. If Simon wins the
primary, Bush has to decide if he can execute the same play with a
different GOP quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday morning, California Republicans will gather in L.A.
for a traditional unity breakfast. The featured speaker will be
either a "moderate" trying to make peace with angry conservatives or
a "conservative" hoping to enthuse disappointed moderates. Either
way, it'll be good theater.</TE>

<HD>L.A.'s a Sleeping Giant for New Yorker</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Normally, publicist Josh Norek has to do a lot of explaining about
the bands he represents from the world of rock en espanol. In New
York, where he's lived and worked all his life, most people have
never heard of Mexico's Jaguares or Argentina's Santos Inocentes. His
clients never get airplay on Spanish radio in the Big Apple, where
salsa is king. And the average Latino on the street? Forget about it.
New Yorkers wouldn't know Jaguares' idolized lead singer, Saul
Hernandez, from Pepe LePew.</LD>
<LD>   Norek finally got fed up with the frigid climate and moved his
one-man operation to Los Angeles last month, settling into a
two-bedroom apartment in an Art Deco building in the Wilshire
District, near the Conga Room. You can imagine his excitement to
discover that the leasing agent in his new building is a big Jaguares
fan. In fact, she had tickets to see the band that very weekend.</LD>
<LD>   "Wow, I love Los Angeles!" thought Norek, who offered to pay his
rent in CDs.</LD>
<TE>   Norek's move to Eley, as roqueros spell L.A., is not big news in
the entertainment world. Still, it's one more indication that, here
in the USA, the City of Angels is truly the heart of rock en espanol.</TE>
<TE>   I visited Norek in his new digs last week. A toasty afternoon sun
bathed his fourth-floor flat, neatly organized and decorated with the
enigmatic image of Mexican singer Julieta Venegas and other stars of
this still-struggling scene. Other posters serve as souvenirs of the
Latin Alternative Music Conference, an event Norek has coordinated
for the past two years in New York. One bedroom serves as his office,
furnished in Ikea light. The tools of his trade: a computer, a phone
and a fax.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, the former law student could do his job from
Anywhere, USA. But being here gives him access to key players in the
field who are also increasingly calling L.A. home. Norek works
closely with two of the major managers in the Latin alternative
business: Marusa Reyes, who represents Jaguares, and Tomas Cookman,
who represents Fabulosos Cadillacs and is Norek's co-organizer in the
annual New York conference.</TE>
<TE>   Now they're all neighbors in Eley. They meet face to face, which
brightens the brainstorming.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, roqueros are bound to become a critical mass in the
Southland.</TE>
<TE>   While Norek was settling in, Colombia's alternative music
superstar Juanes was in town recording his second solo album with
Gustavo Santaolalla, the pioneering rock producer from Argentina who
has also set up shop here, with a studio in Echo Park. Heading east
toward West Covina, the staff of La Banda Elastica, a leading
magazine of the alternative music scene, is celebrating its 10th
anniversary of consistent publication here.</TE>
<TE>   There are so many rock en espanol fans in the region that the
Ritmo Latino music retail chain has four stores specializing in the
genre. Called Ritmo Rock, they're located in Van Nuys, Wilmington,
Santa Ana and Huntington Park.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. offers Norek another personal advantage--he can walk to the
Conga Room, which he did after my visit. He went there not as a
publicist this time, but as just another struggling musician. Norek
belongs to a quirky multiethnic group called Hip Hop Hoodios, a play
on "hood" and the Spanish word for Jews, judios. The band, a
Jewish-Latino melange with songs such as "Havana Nagila," is
scheduled to perform at the club March 31.</TE>
<TE>   Norek expresses discomfort about his dual roles, worried about a
potential conflict of interest, which he can't quite define. He seems
overly fastidious about keeping the publicist and the performer
separate. When it comes to his own band, he even prefers to go by his
Latino alter-ego, Josue Noriega.</TE>
<TE>   Relax already. It's all about music.</TE>
<TE>   How this Jewish kid from Albany, N.Y., got swept up in Latin music
is a story in itself. He got his first taste of it during a stay in
South America seven years ago. "It just blew me away, it was just so
much more innovative than anything I was hearing in the States," says
Norek.</TE>
<TE>   He had dropped out in his sophomore year and headed to Buenos
Aires in 1995, drawn by his love of Latin America. The 19-year-old
got a job there with Warner Music, "marketing Alanis Morissette and
Hootie &amp; the Blowfish to poor unsuspecting Argentines."</TE>
<TE>   Once he discovered the vibrant Spanish rock scene in Argentina, he
was hooked. He came home with a missionary zeal to convert the
uninitiated.</TE>
<TE>   "All my friends at Cornell were like, 'What happened to you?'"</TE>
<TE>   Norek, who graduated in 1997 with a degree in communications,
couldn't listen to music in English anymore. And he couldn't
understand why others didn't share his enthusiasm for this innovative
Latin genre.</TE>
<TE>   "It got me passionate about my goals," he says. "I was determined
to help people overcome their stereotypes about what Latin music is,
to get them to realize that there's much more to this music than
banda or salsa or Ricky Martin."</TE>
<TE>   His love for Latin rock is matched only by his revulsion for Latin
pop. He considers Enrique Iglesias the antichrist. He calls Spanish
radio a travesty.</TE>
<TE>   "Hearing Latin pop radio is what motivates me every day," he says
of his zeal to push alternative Latin music. "Because like, this
radio stinks."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it stinks less to him in L.A. At least here you can catch
the occasional cut by Jaguares or Mana on the air.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd never in a million years hear Jaguares on the radio in New
York," Norek laments.</TE>
<TE>   So what are young Latino rock fans in L.A. tuning to?</TE>
<TE>   KROQ, Norek says. The rock station's audience is more than
one-third Latino, according to audience survey data. "Get them to
start spinning a track by a Molotov or a Puya, and a lot could
happen," he says. "L.A. is a sleeping giant."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Norek's move was a matter of demographics. Mexicans,
the majority of Latinos in L.A., have always been big rock fans,
going back to the '50s when Spanish versions of rock hits were the
craze south of the border.</TE>
<TE>   "When Mexicans immigrate here, they bring their rock traditions
with them to this country," says Norek, one of our most recent
immigrants. "I really feel like I'm home."</TE>

<LD>I am a lover of music from the era of Little Milton, Jackie Wilson,
Millie Jackson, Little Willie John, Bobby Bland, Motown, Stax, Chess
and all the other magnificent music makers and artists, soul and
jazz, that Alicia Keys and India.Arie, these absolutely beautiful
young sistas, so well represent ("Sisters Who Know a Woman's Worth,"
by Isaac Guzman, Feb. 24). Those of us who are their parents and
grandparents, we salute them and are so very proud of them. They
represent the best not just in black, but all young people.</LD>
<LD>   Of particular note, they are refusing to buy into the
self-debasement by use of the "self-hating" N-word. It is the most
venal and violent word in any language, and thank you Ms. Keys and
Ms. Arie, for making an old black brotha happy and proud.</LD>

<LD>I really appreciated Don Heckman's "Versatile Vocalists Shouldn't Be
Overlooked" (Jazz Spotlight, Feb. 24). There are many talented female
vocalists playing small clubs and getting virtually no radio play.</LD>
<LD>   The British chanteuse-songwriter Julia Fordham, with her
four-octave range, played at the Coach House, UCLA and the Soho club
in Santa Barbara two weeks ago promoting an upcoming album. I caught
the Santa Barbara show, and was amazed that Fordham has the same
vocal range and strength in person as she does on her inventive
recordings.</LD>

<LD>Older rock musicians shouldn't have to "Hang Up Their Rock 'n' Roll
Shoes," to quote a song by Chuck Willis ("Hope I Play as I Get Old,"
by Geoff Boucher, Feb. 24). But Boucher failed to mention many of
rock's first generation never made it to old age.</LD>
<LD>   Artists such as Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran and Ritchie Valens died
tragically at young ages. Holly was 22, Cochran 21, and Valens was 17
and only eight months and four singles into his career. Jerry Lee
Lewis' rock career was damaged by scandal, so much so he changed
genres. Gene Vincent was badly injured in the car accident that
killed Cochran. By the time Vincent recovered, the industry had
forgotten him.</LD>
<LD>   Carl Perkins also had a similar fate and had to switch to country
music. Elvis Presley sold out to Hollywood, and would never again
record music as good as the stuff he recorded between 1954 and 1957.
Bill Haley was 29 when he had his first chart hit. Haley's early
music was great, Louis Jordan-inspired jump blues (jump blues was the
prototype for rock 'n' roll), but when he hit it big, his label, pop
and jazz giant Decca (which was also Jordan's label), had him record
material that was more like "mock 'n' roll."</LD>
<TE>   Boucher also forgot about rock's first generation of performers
who happen to be black. Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Bo
Diddley, Ray Charles and Johnny Otis (he's not black, but, as he
says, he "might as well be") are still alive. We now call these
legends rhythm &amp; blues artists, but in the 1950s they were considered
rock 'n' rollers.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher also says, "In the 1950s, most of the top rock stars tried
to recycle and repackage their hits, and restricted their subject
matter to the most inane themes."</TE>
<TE>   I can't name one rock 'n' roll artist who did that during that
period. He must be referring to Paul Anka, Bobby Vee, Bobby Vinton,
Neil Sedaka, etc. While all these artists were/are great singers,
they are not rock 'n' roll artists. That's like calling 'N Sync rock
'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the rock artists (i.e., Fats Domino, Chuck Berry, Bo
Diddley, Little Richard and Ray Charles to name a few) of the '50s
went on to long, productive careers, and did not record "inane
themes." They may not have hit the charts a lot (with the exception
of Charles), but they still recorded good music.</TE>
<TE>   MIKE SANDERS</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What's more fitting than aging rockers protesting the traditions
of being 50 or 60? After all, the hearts of these authentic types
have always pumped with rebellion. Bob Dylan, Paul Simon and Paul
McCartney are just a few who have always said no, and through their
music, they redefine social freedom. Now instead of confronting the
prejudices of World War II parents, we reject the ageism of 21st
century whippersnappers and corporate moguls.</TE>
<TE>   That experienced rockers continue to resist a prescribed
traditional life limited to slow golf games and boring cruises is not
surprising. What else could we do?</TE>
<TE>   Recent tragedies have shown this imperfect world still needs help,
and '60s artists have always been catalysts for busting up lies--of
racism, imperialism and sexism.</TE>
<TE>   Ageism is next. Should we not confront it because of our own
growth? No matter how old the artist, each new CD stands in a rack
like a proud soldier in the human evolution of love, war, and
experience. Something is "still happening here" and never mind
definitions that "try to put us down."</TE>
<TE>   I, for one, hope to get an invite to Mick's 70th birthday gig.
Really. I love that guy.</TE>

Boehm, Feb. 24) would be more accurate if it said "They're Believers
Who'll Never Truly Be Artists."</LD>
<LD>   True artists, in the theater or elsewhere, aren't interested in
including or excluding other artists based on their religious
beliefs. While spirituality may well help to form an artist's gifts
and color his or her artistic output, the spirituality of other
artists is irrelevant. It's nice to point out they brought in a Jew
to direct one of their productions, but if we're to believe your
headline, only committed Christians can join Actors Co-Op, and
clearly this group has other than artistic agendas.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that you're willing to give this group any credibility,
particularly in a nation that upholds a goal of freedom by
prohibiting discrimination because of religion, can only be evidence
of either a slow news week or why theater in Los Angeles remains
second-rate.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was refreshing to see Mike Boehm took the time to find out what
the theater company was about and did not write it off as a
right-wing Christian fanatic group that happens to be performing
theater.</TE>
<TE>   As an actor, I found my weekly interactions with office staff and
company members were delightful. They cared for me as a professional
actor, but it went further--conversations did not stop on what shows
have you done lately and who is your agent. We talked about
everything from my spiritual walk to my daily life.</TE>
<TE>   This commitment to the individual is evident in their work. I have
many colleagues and friends in the company and have seen many shows
there. Their shows might not be considered risky, but what the actors
give to the audience on stage every night is very much so. The actors
are able to take risks because of the emotional and spiritual support
company members give each other.</TE>
<TE>   I think they produce some of the best theater I have seen in the
Los Angeles area. I end with a quote from Peter Brook's book "The
Empty Space": "The theater is holy because its purpose is holy ... it
has a clearly defined place in the community and it responds to a
need."</TE>
<TE>   I would argue the Actor's Co-Op is a "holy theater."</TE>

<LD>   BOBBY SHORT</LD>
<LD>   "Piano"</LD>
<TE>   Surrounded By</TE>
<TE>   Listeners tend to think of Short as the ultimate cabaret singer,
but his jazz piano chops are top-notch, as he reaffirms on every
track of this beguiling, small-group recording. As if to emphasize
the point, Short doesn't sing a note on the first two cuts of
"Piano," instead relying on his characteristically poetic keyboard
touch and an ability to reshape a melody in more ways than one might
imagine. The sense of rapture he conveys on an extraordinarily
introspective version of "Memories of You," the exotic harmonic
terrain he explores on "'Round Midnight" and the gentle dance tempo
with which he rewrites "Isfahan" only could have been conceived by
such an original sensibility. Of course, once Short begins to sing,
there's no resisting the ardor of his delivery or the distinctly
smoky quality of his voice. But, ultimately, "Piano" stands as a
testament to Short's achievements on his instrument of choice.</TE>

<TE>   CHICAGO UNDERGROUND DUO</TE>
<TE>   "Axis and Alignment"</TE>
<TE>   Thrill Jockey</TE>
<TE>   Granted, the brilliant Chicago Underground Duo would not exist
without ideas and innovations laid down by the Assn. for the
Advancement of Creative Musicians, or AACM, a groundbreaking musical
collective that has been flourishing in Chicago and beyond since the
mid-1960s. But to their great credit, multi-instrumentalists Chad
Taylor and Rob Mazurek have built distinctive music of their own on a
foundation created by the bands of the AACM. You can hear it in the
free-form, abstract tone poems that define this recording, and on the
key riffs and ostinatos that often hold together seemingly anarchic
improvisations. Although Taylor plays mostly percussion and vibes, he
also picks up the guitar, while Mazurek, a cornetist, dabbles in
piano and electronics. Together, they create a startling range of
sounds, textures and colors, some original to this disc. Although
this recording will not appeal to the most conservative tastes,
listeners with open ears will revel in the freedom, energy and utter
unpredictability of the Chicago Underground Duo's music. Even at
their most hard-driving, Mazurek and Taylor take pains to keep the
music unpretentious, translucent and thoroughly inviting.</TE>

<TE>   DIANE DELIN</TE>
<TE>   "Talking Stick"</TE>
<TE>   Blujazz</TE>
<TE>   The violin has a long and distinguished history in jazz, with
players such as Stephane Grappelli and Eddie South conceiving deeply
personal approaches to the instrument. Yet few young musicians turn
to the jazz fiddle these days. That makes Delin's recording
particularly welcome, for in this disc she announces herself as one
of the more promising young violinists to swing into view in years. A
melodist to the core, Delin is not afraid to linger over a phrase on
American pop standards such as "Beautiful Love" or "If I Should Lose
You," nor does she refrain from producing an ineffably sweet and
buttery tone. Yet for all its lyric poetry, this recording never
becomes maudlin or sentimental. Whether leading her jazz quartet or
luxuriating in orchestral accompaniments, Delin produces
improvisations of considerable style and unmistakable integrity. If
Delin still has a way to go to match the virtuosity of a young jazz
fiddler such as Regina Carter, this recording nevertheless proves
that she's swinging in the right direction.</TE>

<TE>   CHICAGO BLUES</TE>
<TE>   PIANO MASTERS</TE>
<TE>   "8 Hands on 88 Keys"</TE>
<TE>   The Sirens</TE>
<TE>   It isn't often that four Chicago piano virtuosos convene for a
marathon recording session, but this one must have been a riot,
judging by the sheer fervor of the performances. Each artist sounds
unlike the rest, with Barrelhouse Chuck laying down relentless boogie
rhythms, Detroit Junior accompanying his fat piano chords with lusty
moans and cries, Pinetop Perkins luxuriating in unbelievably slow and
sultry tempos, and Erwin Helfer ripping through blues, boogie and
jazz numbers at a breakneck pace. The music-making becomes
practically symphonic when two artists share a track, as in the
explosive "Pinetop's Blues," with Helfer slamming two-fisted chords
while Barrelhouse Chuck sings, shouts and thunders for all he's
worth.</TE>

<LD>The Times endorses selectively, on a case-by-case basis. Here are
recommendations in state and local races in Tuesday's elections.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   STATE</LD>
<TE>   Proposition 40. YES. The state has gained ground toward preserving
its natural treasures, thanks to previous bond issues. This
$2.6-billion bond measure would continue the improvement, dedicating
funds for urban parks and other purposes. The state would remain
within its informal limits on bond debt.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 41. YES. This $200-million bond issue would help
counties buy new voting machines and retire Florida-style punch-card
models before the state has a Florida-style voting mishap.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 42. NO. This would designate state gasoline sales tax
money for transportation projects, permanently. This is poor policy
and lazy lawmaking, shoving a decision unnecessarily onto voters. The
Legislature can renew the current earmarking law, which expires in
2008, if economic conditions dictate.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 43. YES. Writes into the state Constitution a
guarantee that a vote cast is a vote counted. The high-toned rhetoric
would underpin laws extending recount periods.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 44. NO. Since 1922, voters have had to approve changes
in state oversight of the chiropractic profession. Enough. Instead of
passing this measure, whatever its modest merits, voters should
demand that the Legislature craft another proposition removing this
from voters' responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 45. YES. The current strict term limits in the
Legislature shuttle members in and out, treating political deadbeats
and the best and brightest alike. Leadership has suffered badly. This
measure would allow legislators to run again by collecting signatures
equal to 20% of votes cast in the last election. It could help
restore stability and a little expertise to lawmaking in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   State Superintendent of Public Instruction. State Sen. Jack
O'Connell. A former high school teacher who has specialized in
education during nearly two decades as an assemblyman and senator,
O'Connell has the right portfolio and accomplishments for the job.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LOS ANGELES CITY</TE>
<TE>   Proposition Q. YES. This $600-million bond measure would finance
two new police stations, repair existing police and fire stations and
build facilities for better support of 911 emergency calls. The
city's history on similar projects is not great. But new oversight
mechanisms bring accountability to this measure.</TE>
<TE>   Charter Amendment R. YES. Changes the dates of odd-year city
elections to avoid holidays and put more time between the primaries
and general elections, and between general elections and the taking
of office July 1. The extra time after general elections would allow
for more thorough recounts, if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   City Council District 2. Wendy Greuel. She has good local
political experience working for former Mayor Tom Bradley and
expertise on civic issues. Her opponent, state Assemblyman Tony
Cardenas, is damaged by his deep involvement with some of the
nastiest attack ads of the last mayoral race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LOS ANGELES COUNTY</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff. Lee Baca. Incumbent Baca has made steady progress in
addressing the department's problems, including its handling of
mentally ill inmates, and has taken a tough line on officer
misconduct while also tackling crime hot spots. He has weak areas,
particularly in handling his budget, but has earned reelection.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SUPERVISORS AND ASSESSOR</TE>
<TE>   District 1. Gloria Molina. Incumbent Molina isn't much of a
compromiser, but she is a solid and imaginative community-builder.</TE>
<TE>   District 3. Zev Yaroslavsky. Running unopposed for his third term,
Yaroslavsky is a budget expert and an adept pragmatist.</TE>
<TE>   Assessor. Rick Auerbach. Elected in 2000 to fill an unfinished
term, he has modernized his office and made it friendlier to
constituents.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BALLOT MEASURES</TE>
<TE>   Charter Amendment A. NO. This measure, limiting county officials
to 12 years in office, is more generous than the damaging state
limits, but officials would still be lame ducks after eight years,
and limits remove voter choice.</TE>
<TE>   Charter Amendment B. NO. Similar to Amendment A, except that it
would apply term limits only to the five county supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Charter Amendment C. YES. This charter amendment would help the
sheriff strengthen the management structure of the department.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 2. Hank Goldberg. A 15-year deputy district attorney
who has handled a wide range of prosecutions, he has experience
training new prosecutors and has written and lectured extensively.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 39. Richard Naranjo. A political newcomer, Naranjo is a
deputy district attorney with business experience, the best choice in
a fairly weak field.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 40. Superior Court Judge Floyd Baxter. He deserves
reelection, especially against an opponent rated "not qualified" by
the County Bar Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 53. Lauren Weis. A 23-year prosecutor, she has improved
the way local law enforcement handles sexual assault cases.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 67. Paul Bacigalupo. The supervising judge for the
state bar, he has a strong background in civil law and a
"well-qualified" rating from the bar.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 90. Superior Court Judge Robert Simpson. The bar
association rated Simpson highly, and his previous years in civil
practice are valuable. He deserves reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Office No. 100. Richard Walmark. A deputy district attorney for 16
years, he has earned the bar's "well-qualified" rating, unlike his
challengers for this open seat.</TE>

<HD>A Thesaurist Leaves, Exits</HD>
<DH>Robert L. Chapman has left language lovers a rich legacy
through his delightful editing of Roget's.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regrettably, unfortunately, lamentably and mournfully, Robert L.
Chapman is deceased, demised, departed and dead at 81. The son, boy
and male offspring of a West Virginia typewriter mechanic, Chapman
once drove trucks, then studied poetry and medieval literature before
editing the timeworn, antiquated, irreplaceable Roget's International
Thesaurus.</LD>
<LD>   He transformed, altered and caused the transmutation of the
stuffy, dull, ill-ventilated compendium of synonyms and antonyms into
a hip, cool, with-it collection of words and associations, not only
piquing the intellects of language lovers but saving the behinds,
fannys and GPAs of countless late-night collegiate essay writers (see
also Indolent, Slothful, Procrastinating). With their new shoes,
underwear and a Webster's, college-bound juveniles have long packed a
Roget's, hoping to sound more educated while getting there.</LD>
<LD>   Before (Slang) cashing in his chips and giving up the ghost,
Chapman quietly shaped the way we speak and think of words and idioms
as tools to effectively communicate to each other the multi-toned
richness of the human experience (see Feeling, Knowledge). You know
how people in 19th century photographs posed as if nailed to boards
and never smiled? Today's photographers encourage relaxed and open.
Same difference for thesaurus editors.</LD>
<TE>   A doctor and Londoner despite his French name, Peter M. Roget
produced in 1852 more than a mere alphabetical listing of similar and
dissimilar words. He also created categories such as Kindness,
Benevolence to suggest enlightening linguistic links likely to be
missed by word seekers. The goateed Chapman was engagingly subversive
in his academically rooted but pragmatic, populist approach to
chronicling and improving how English speakers speak and write. His
computers also tracked word usage to update and expand categories and
words for new times, inserting AIDS, Scud, hacker, fax, ecosystem,
even new dog breeds and slang and modern phobias (i.e. Fear of
Flying, not prominent in 1850). Roget's perusers find themselves
wandering the distinctive wordways of Chapman's lexicon, encountering
new meanings, associations and phrasings through serendipity, an
increasingly rare modern commodity and a delicious entry that needs
no synonym. As things eventuated, credit goes to Robert Chapman, who
has no synonym.</TE>

<HD>The Ultimate Gamble</HD>
<DH>With a radical redesign, BMW is tinkering with the
mechanics of success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>At first glance, things have never looked better for BMW.</LD>
<LD>   Bayerische Motoren Werke has quadrupled its U.S. sales in the last
10 years, zooming from the No. 5 luxury nameplate in 1995 to No. 2
last year.</LD>
<LD>   The company is preparing some bold moves, including the planning
of a small BMW 1-series; reintroduction of the sporty two-door
6-series and the storied Mini brand; and production of a luxury
limousine for Rolls Royce, the marque it takes over Jan. 1.</LD>
<TE>   BMW also is very profitable, earning $1.4 billion in the first
half of 2001, about as much as General Motors Corp. and Volkswagen,
the powerhouse auto makers of the U.S. and Europe, put together. And
nobody's talking about BMW being acquired or forced to partner up in
a strategic alliance that has enveloped the other major auto makers
except Honda Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   But BMW also is taking its biggest risk ever with a radical
redesign, inside and out, of its flagship 7-series.</TE>
<TE>   The new 7, with prices starting at about $63,000, has an
exaggerated lip that curves around the top of the trunk, which many
automotive critics find unharmonious at best.</TE>
<TE>   And the jury is still out on iDrive, the revolutionary--but
maddening to some--system that lets drivers select and set all
controls from climate to audio to navigation with a single,
mouse-like knob on the center console.</TE>
<TE>   BMW needs to score well with the 7-series in the U.S., where more
7s are sold than in any other market, even Germany. California is
particularly crucial to BMW's success as it snaps up 22% of BMW sales
in the U.S., and nearly one of four 7-series cars is sold in the
state--70% of them in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "BMW tends to go for MAYA--most advanced, yet acceptable--and the
new 7-series pushes the limit of acceptability," said Rudi Volti, a
sociology professor at Pitzer College in Claremont who teaches a
"Cars and Culture" course. "The lip gives extra trunk space, but not
a lot of 7 owners are in the light-hauling industry."</TE>
<TE>   The flagship of the BMW line, the 7-series always has highlighted
the newest technology such as anti-lock brakes in the 1970s, and
traction and stability control. As the top-of-the-line BMW, it bumps
heads with the Mercedes S-class and Audi A8 and S8.</TE>
<TE>   BMW has demographics, customer loyalty and a brand aura that any
car maker would "sandpaper their eyeballs for," said Detroit-based
auto analyst Jim Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "In our brand consideration study, BMW is just walking on water,"
said Hall's boss, George Peterson, president of AutoPacific
consulting firm in Tustin. "It's a highly aspirational brand for
young people. Twenty years ago the 3-series was the ultimate vehicle.
The 1-series could be the same for the twentysomethings today."</TE>
<TE>   With the 1-series, BMW says, it's going smaller but not downscale,
an obvious reference to Mercedes-Benz and its $25,000 C230 hatchback,
which some critics say lacks the appointments and feel worthy of a
Mercedes.</TE>
<TE>   There also will be a reborn 6-series coupe, originally sold in
this country from 1977 to 1989. A two-door that seats four adults,
the resurrected 6-series will return to the market in 2004, the same
year the 1-series is to arrive.</TE>
<TE>   What BMW calls the "X-family" of SUVs also is expanding with the
entry-level, smaller Austrian-built X3, to come on the market next
year. The Mini goes on sale in the U.S. this month.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980 only four BMW models were on sale in the U.S.: the 320i,
the 528i, the 633Csi and the 733i. (Today about 30 models are in the
lineup.) For buyers back then who were aware of BMW--and plenty
weren't--it was seen as a rival to Mercedes: a high-end German luxury
brand with solid engineering and reliable quality.</TE>
<TE>   In AutoPacific's recent brand consideration studies, BMW has
outpaced Mercedes among car buyers shopping in that range. BMW's
image has grown so strong that it took a page from Lexus' handbook
and last month launched an aggressive ad campaign for certified
pre-owned BMWs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Takeover Rumors</TE>
<TE>   BMW's strong financials also have enabled the company to fend off
potential takeovers, friendly or hostile.</TE>
<TE>   There have been persistent rumors of offers by virtually every
large auto maker to purchase, or buy into, BMW. The more credible
scenarios have GM or Ford Motor Co. buying a percentage of the
company, but that would require winning over the secretive Quandt
family that controls about 48% of BMW stock.</TE>
<TE>   Ford would be able to add BMW to the stable of luxury brands in
its Premier Automotive Group--Lincoln, Jaguar, Volvo, Land Rover and
Aston Martin.</TE>
<TE>   GM would have even more to gain: a globally credible premium brand
with a strong international image, something that neither of GM's
premium brands, Cadillac and Saab, can claim.</TE>
<TE>   But the Quandts and BMW executives brush aside such heretical
suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   "BMW is big enough, and BMW is strong enough. Why should we
merge?" asked Chief Executive Joachim Milberg in an interview with
The Times in January at the North American International Auto Show in
Detroit. "For market reasons, for technology reasons, for product
reasons? No. We have our technology, we are in a good position
worldwide and we have a great product portfolio, so there is no
reason for BMW for a merger."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the company's health, there are complaints about BMWs. For
years it was known as a company of "Eine Wurst, drei Groesse" (one
sausage, three sizes) for the unimaginative similarity of the 3-, 5-
and 7-series.</TE>
<TE>   But now the very design of BMW's flagship has become a hotly
debated issue, with the new 7's look roasted in the enthusiast press
and driving reviews. The expert consensus is that it's an acquired
taste.</TE>
<TE>   "The styling's risky, but I think over time people will accept
it," Peterson said. "When I first saw it, it was like, ugggh. But I'm
starting to warm up to it."</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Lindland, senior auto analyst with forecasting group
DRI-WEFA, is charitable as well. "I like it. It's definitely
different, and not always completely appealing to the eye," she said.
"But it's unmistakable from the back and the side--it's clearly the
new 7-series."</TE>
<TE>   BMW is quick to defend the styling and says it allows the car to
be slightly higher without making it longer. Besides, BMW executives
say, it was a necessary "revolutionary" step after the "evolutionary"
last design change for the 7-series in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   With the all-new 1-series and 6-series coming, and the extension
of the X-family of SUVs, "the product portfolio will be much broader
in the future, so we needed, let's say, a new 'shape language' for
our cars," Milberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The skewering the 7-series is receiving in the media is getting
old to Chris Bangle, the American who is BMW's chief designer at its
Munich, Germany, headquarters. He dismisses the potshots at his
design as fashionable pooh-poohing of the car before pundits had a
chance to drive it</TE>
<TE>   "Significance requires controversy, otherwise we're not moving
forward," the Wisconsin native said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do things that people easily accept, then the only part of
the mystique lies in the unavailability of it. If we're doing a car
we want to make available, like the 7-series, that can't be our only
card to play. We have to make something which makes a car fascinating
and interesting for the longer term," Bangle said. "We have to grow
with the car; otherwise you get bored with it."</TE>
<TE>   For probably the first time, however, it's more than a BMW's looks
or handling that will polarize potential customers. The technology
itself is so daunting that it could turn people away.</TE>
<TE>   Some BMW owners and aspirants, among the most aggressive
early-adapters in the industry, will eat it up. "I think that people
who drive the 7-series want to be on the edge," DRI-WEFA's Lindland
said. "They want the early-edge technology, and that's what BMW has
given them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Youthful Appeal</TE>
<TE>   The risk is that the vaunted technology could overshadow the 7's
driving performance. To start the car, for instance, drivers first
must insert an optical key, press the brake, then push a button on
the dashboard that engages the motor--a process that will have to be
explained countless times to parking valets.</TE>
<TE>   Most owners probably will learn the dozen iDrive functions they
need to know to adjust the air conditioning, set the clock and change
the radio stations--leaving the remaining 690 operations unexplored.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't spoken to anyone who doesn't work for BMW who can use
iDrive," AutoPacific's Peterson said. "The jury's out, and iDrive
could really hurt them."</TE>
<TE>   Using the flagship 7-series as a test for such a technological
leap is a genuine risk, because the reception of the 7 reflects how
BMW is perceived overall.</TE>
<TE>   Though the car has been on the market only since January, some
analysts in Detroit already are talking about "Death by iDrive."</TE>
<TE>   "The iDrive might appeal to younger-generation drivers who enjoy
joysticks and other gadgets, but the owner profile of the 7-series is
more pre-electronic," said Volti, the Pitzer professor.</TE>
<TE>   The gadgety 7-series actually might turn off buyers and chase them
to another brand in the constantly shifting American market.</TE>
<TE>   "Cars have gotten pretty good, and the difference between a
$25,000 and a $70,000 car is not that great," Volti said.</TE>

<HD>BMW Stepping on the Gas After a Bumpy Ride</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MUNICH, Germany</DL>
<LD>It was only three years ago that those steering the elite and
notoriously independent Bayerische Motoren Werke were thrown out of
the driver's seat for having taken a disastrous wrong turn in
acquiring Britain's troubled Rover.</LD>
<LD>   For decades synonymous with speed, greed and gusto, BMW saw its
luster dulled by association with the down-market commodity cars
rolling off the assembly lines at Rover.</LD>
<LD>   Sales and profits tumbled, heads rolled and the road ahead looked
bumpy when mild-mannered engineering professor Joachim Milberg became
chief executive in 1999 with a mandate to contain the damage.</LD>
<TE>   The company's recovery under Milberg has turned more heads than
has its latest luxury model, and the 58-year-old leader attributes
the turnaround to swift recognition of the Rover mistake and even
swifter swallowing of company pride in correcting that error.</TE>
<TE>   When months of haggling failed to produce a serious buyer, Milberg
dumped the losing enterprise in March 2000 for a symbolic 10
pounds--about $15--to a group of British investors.</TE>
<TE>   "BMW Group is now the only car manufacturer with different brands
but all focused on premium segments," Milberg said in an interview at
company headquarters here. "Our experience from the Rover time is
that premium brands and value-oriented products don't fit well under
one roof."</TE>
<TE>   He describes the quick turnaround as the result of "courageous
decisions," acknowledging the public uproar after the divestiture.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of British auto workers lost jobs and their German union
counterparts howled at a move that couldn't have been executed under
this country's strict labor laws.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Auto Maker Not Hit Hard by Recession</TE>
<TE>   Even after absorbing the Rover losses, BMW posted record sales and
output last year, delivering 905,657 cars to customers and
forecasting a rise in sales of more than 7% when final 2001 results
are reported this month. And despite the gloomy outlook for economic
growth in Germany, its No. 1 market, and uncertain prospects for
solid recovery across the Atlantic, company executives expect another
banner year in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   BMW shares, traded on the Frankfurt exchange, have risen steadily
to about 42 euros from the mid-20s at the start of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Premium sectors are more independent from economic cycles than
are mass-market products," said Milberg, explaining BMW's purring
performance last year, when recession hit bigger rivals hard in their
bottom lines.</TE>
<TE>   Although BMW's management was able to boast in a letter to
shareholders last month that "2001 was by far the most successful
year in the history of the BMW Group," Milberg diplomatically
declined to discuss the pitfalls of their volume-oriented
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   U.S.-German auto giant DaimlerChrysler, for instance, was battered
with $1.9 billion in losses last year, when recession and worries
about terrorism after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks prompted many
consumers to put off buying cars.</TE>
<TE>   Mercedes, the flagship Daimler product, fared far better than the
higher-volume U.S. brands, posting a 3% boost in profit from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. market remains second to Germany for BMW, but it is the
most important export venue and fastest-growing segment, especially
for the higher-powered cars, corporate affairs director Peik von
Bestenbostel said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that gasoline prices in the U.S. are only a third of
those in Europe, explaining the enduring appeal of the big Beamers in
America while many Germans have opted for more modest models.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Mini Expected  to Generate Buzz</TE>
<TE>   One part of Rover retained by BMW was its Mini, the boxy little
compact that came to fame in the 1960s, when British pop icons such
as the Beatles and "Pink Panther" star Peter Sellers got behind the
wheel in movies.</TE>
<TE>   The Mini, expected in the U.S. market this spring, made a splashy
comeback in Europe last summer, still bearing its signature squat
outline but now outfitted with top-line BMW technology and interior
comforts.</TE>
<TE>   The Oxford, England, plant is working hard to keep up with demand
and plans to produce 100,000 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Financial Officer Helmut Panke, who will replace Milberg in
May when the chief executive takes early retirement, cautions against
seeing the Mini as a departure from the newly embraced mantra of
premium only.</TE>
<TE>   "Premium doesn't mean only a certain price level. It means having
an elite player in each category, whether a unique car like the Mini
or a physically big car like the 7-series," said Panke, 55, who
earlier headed U.S. operations and has brought back a relaxed
American demeanor.</TE>
<TE>   Panke smiles when reminded of his jackets-off, first-name-basis
approach with colleagues and visitors, a striking contrast to the
formality of most German corporations.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that you can say I have a more American style of
management, although I have certainly been affected by my U.S.
experience. But I've been a member of the board since 1996 and we
have brought about this reorientation as a team," Panke said.</TE>
<TE>   "The current management style will continue, even if my
personality means I speak louder and faster."</TE>

<HD>Fund Managers Weigh Activist Role</HD>
<DH>Reforms: Investors debate their involvement in shaping
corporate behavior in the post-Enron era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like millions of Americans, the typical stock mutual fund manager may
be outraged by the corporate scandals that have rocked financial
markets in recent months.</LD>
<LD>   But should those managers be compelled to take a stand--with their
shareholders' money--against company executives who don't appear to
have investors' best interests at heart?</LD>
<LD>   The question is one the fund management business has faced
periodically for decades. Now, in light of Enron Corp. and other
corporate debacles, the issue is boiling up again.</LD>
<TE>   Vanguard Group founder John Bogle is urging mutual fund companies
to form a "Federation of Long-Term Investors" to push for change on
corporate governance issues such as auditor independence; the
dilutive effect of stock option grants on earnings; and aggressive
accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Bogle, in a recent speech, said the 75 largest mutual fund
companies control 44% of the voting power at U.S. companies,
including pension and institutional accounts. Combined, this
"constitutes the 800-pound gorilla who can sit wherever he wants to
sit at the board table" to demand corporate accountability or change
the way firms conduct themselves, he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, many mutual fund managers say the idea that they should
get involved in pressuring companies is unrealistic. There isn't
enough time to do that while managing a portfolio, and to take the
time to do it risks generating higher costs--and lower returns--for
fund investors, some say.</TE>
<TE>   "As a minority shareholder it's awfully tough to get management to
change," said Bill Nygren, manager of the Oakmark and Oakmark Select
stock funds in Chicago. "Most of the time the smart thing to do is
sell the stock and move on to something else."</TE>
<TE>   Nygren likened investing to watching prime-time TV: "If you don't
like what you see, you can pick a fight with the networks or you can
switch the channel. Most of the time we opt to switch the channel."</TE>
<TE>   Historically, corporate governance has been an important issue
among socially directed funds and major public pension funds.</TE>
<TE>   But the concept of institutional investors playing an activist
role on key issues of corporate governance now may be resonating with
more mutual fund managers.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent letter to shareholders, Legg Mason Inc.'s star fund
manager, William Miller, called on corporate executives to
concentrate on their core businesses and stop focusing on earnings
"gamesmanship." He said company management spends "far too much time
trying to massage analysts' [profit] expectations in order not to
disappoint 'the Street.'"</TE>
<TE>   Miller reportedly has assembled a group of fund managers who are
considering placing ads in major financial publications listing their
ideas of governance "best practices." For example, the group might
challenge stock option proposals it deems overly generous to
employees at the expense of shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Miller at Baltimore-based Legg Mason declined to
comment on the report, which appeared in the Financial Times.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 20 years, a few mutual fund managers at times have
taken an activist approach with companies, either opposing management
on certain issues or rallying other shareholders to press for change.</TE>
<TE>   But those names--notably value-oriented managers such as Windsor
Fund's John Neff and Mutual Shares' Michael Price--now are mostly
retired.</TE>
<TE>   Some industry experts say the time is ripe for more stock fund
managers to make their voices heard, given the stunning losses many
funds suffered in the collapses of Enron, Global Crossing Ltd. and
other scandal-wracked companies.</TE>
<TE>   B. Kenneth West, senior consultant to TIAA-CREF--the
$271-billion-asset teachers' retirement fund--and chairman of the
National Assn. of Corporate Directors in Washington, said that in the
long run, the nation's continuing shift from traditional pension
plans to defined contribution retirement savings plans such as
401(k)s, will spur mutual funds to become more active in addressing
governance issues, especially if prodded by plan participants.</TE>
<TE>   West said traditional mutual funds could be particularly effective
in pressing for corporate governance reform. "They hold so much of
the equity market and they don't have an ax to grind," he said. "You
could argue that unions and pension funds have a political agenda,
but mutual funds can be objective. For them it's simple: Good
governance leads to better investment returns."</TE>
<TE>   Yet whether there is in fact a meaningful investment payoff from
governance activism remains a matter of great debate.</TE>
<TE>   Bogle believes there is a link between good corporate governance
and higher stock returns, as do many public pension funds and the
socially directed investing industry, which screens companies based
on issues such as the environment and workplace diversity.</TE>
<TE>   TIAA-CREF, which spends slightly more than $1 million a year on
corporate governance issues, believes it generates far more than that
in added shareholder value.</TE>
<TE>   According to New York-based Domini Social Investments, its Domini
Social 400 index of large stocks screened for social and
environmental criteria has beaten the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index over the last decade. The Domini index returned an annualized
13.8% in the 10 years ended Jan. 31, versus 13% for the unscreened
S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   But those long-term numbers have little relevance for many fund
managers, especially momentum-oriented managers who routinely turn
over their entire portfolios more than once in a calendar year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bogle argues that funds that take a buy-and-hold approach
to investing have a responsibility to become more involved in shaping
corporate behavior.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested that his Federation of Long-Term Investors start with
six big index mutual fund managers that control an estimated $1.4
trillion, or 10%, of U.S. stocks: Barclays Global Investors, State
Street Global Advisers, Vanguard, Mellon Financial Corp., Deutsche
Asset Management and TIAA-CREF.</TE>
<TE>   As passive investors who simply buy and hold stocks in indexes
such as the S&amp;P 500, these investors in theory have a vested stake in
promoting forthright corporate management to minimize the risk of
more Enrons occurring.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way an index fund manager can really influence
shareholder value is through governance," said Mercer Bullard, CEO of
Fund Democracy, a Chevy Chase, Md., company that lobbies regulators
on behalf of mutual fund shareholders. "These funds can't vote with
their feet [by selling their stake in a company], so they should be
more involved" in monitoring their companies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics Say Some Reforms Not Practical</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based mutual fund giant Capital Group, famous for its
long-term investing approach, also might be a charter member of the
group he envisions, Bogle suggested. The firm will consider the plan
when it receives something in writing, spokesman Chuck Freadhoff
said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the index-oriented fund companies also say they would
consider Bogle's idea. TIAA-CREF, which is the world's biggest
pension fund manager along with offering indexed and actively managed
mutual funds, said it would like to meet with Bogle on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some index fund managers, such as Vanguard's Gus Sauter, say
that while Bogle's proposal is well-intentioned, it's hard to picture
in practice.</TE>
<TE>   "If you put us and all of our competitors in a room together we
might end up debating Robert's Rules of Order more frequently than
anything else," he said, referring half-jokingly to a popular manual
on parliamentary procedure.</TE>
<TE>   Sauter, who steers the Vanguard Index 500 fund and 24 other index
funds, said Vanguard "has always been aggressive on governance
issues," and said he works to improve corporate practices as a member
of various boards at the major stock exchanges and the Investment
Company Institute, the fund industry's main trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Sauter said he likes to be involved in corporate governance--to a
point.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not unusual for us to vote against a compensation package
that seems excessive, or to meet with management to exercise our
influence on a merger proposal," he said. "What we won't do is try to
tell General Motors how to set up its marketing strategy."</TE>
<TE>   At a recent news conference, Investment Company Institute
President Matthew Fink said he was "puzzled" by Bogle's idea. Fink
said fund companies already address governance issues individually,
and he questioned whether the plan might face antitrust obstacles if,
for example, managers end up voting shares as a bloc.</TE>
<TE>   Bogle said critics may be reading too much into his plan. "This
wouldn't be like some sort of European Union, where you're locked in
and you have to follow strict rules," he said. "All I want to see is
an enlightened discussion of the issues."</TE>
<TE>   Some shareholder activists say that although their proxy proposals
at corporate annual meetings still face an uphill battle when
management opposes them, there are signs that such proposals are
getting more careful consideration by other big investors.</TE>
<TE>   At Walt Disney Co.'s recent annual meeting, a shareholder
resolution calling for the company to stop awarding consulting work
to the accounting firm that audits its books failed to pass, but it
garnered 42% of the vote--sending a loud message even in defeat,
according to activists.</TE>
<TE>   Though Disney had opposed the resolution in proxy materials sent
to shareholders, the firm did an about-face and supported the idea,
making the final vote moot. Activists were heartened by the company's
shift as well as by the number of votes in favor of the proposal;
they noted that most shareholder-sponsored proxy ideas historically
have gotten few votes.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, some fund managers say widespread activism will never
be practical for one basic reason: Most individual investors, they
believe, would prefer to see their managers use their time to pick
winning stocks and avoid dogs, rather than to badger companies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fund Managers Learn  to Pick Their Battles</TE>
<TE>   With the majority of troubled companies, such as now-bankrupt
retailer Kmart Corp., "There isn't anything you could have done
anyway," Nygren said. "It was just a bad business plan."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, if "the people running a company are really
dishonest," he said, "the damage they can do while you're fighting a
battle is huge." In two months last fall, Enron's stock shriveled
from around $30 to less than $1 when the company skidded toward
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Nygren said he has picked just one fight in his 20-year career,
pressuring Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. to spin off Moody's Corp. in 1998,
and although he said he has no regrets (he still holds both stocks),
the battle took much of his time over several months.</TE>
<TE>   "These things can be all-consuming," Nygren said. "With 60
holdings between the two funds, there's no way we could get actively
involved in all of them."</TE>
<TE>   However, he said, it's overstating the case to say that fund
managers generally don't take corporate governance issues seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Nygren said he votes on all proxy resolutions, for example,
opposing excessive stock option plans as well as anti-takeover
provisions that seem to serve management rather than shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "The general idea that institutional investors are shirking their
responsibilities is misplaced," Nygren said. "As I see it, my duty is
to grow shareholder capital with after-tax returns that are as high
as possible. Very rarely that means diverting my time to try to
change the way one specific company is run."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Veaco, part of the management team running the Clipper and
PBHG Clipper Focus funds, takes a similar stance. "We will vote
against management when warranted, but if we're doing that
consistently, what kind of a long-term partnership do we have with
the company?" Veaco said.</TE>
<TE>   He said corporate governance issues are part of the research
process at Beverly Hills-based Pacific Financial Research, advisor to
the Clipper mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   Veaco said he looks for related-party transactions in a company's
financial statements, which could flag a conflict of interest;
examines the makeup of a company's board; and frowns upon firms that
re-price worthless stock options for executives, which "defeats the
purpose of using options to align management and shareholder
interests."</TE>
<TE>   Veaco said the Clipper funds will vote against excessive
compensation packages, such as the stock option plan awarded to
Mattel Inc. executives in May 1998. That management proposal passed
with slightly more than 60% of the shareholder vote, and Clipper,
which lost confidence in the leadership of then-CEO Jill Barad, later
sold its shares.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shock and Anger  but No Uproar Yet</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Veaco said, "the best form of corporate governance is
to identify and invest in companies with outstanding long-term track
records managed by executives who have demonstrated a consistent
commitment to building shareholder value."</TE>
<TE>   Shelly J. Meyers, Beverly Hills-based manager of the socially
directed Citizens Value fund, said fellow fund managers she has
talked to are angry about Enron and other unfolding corporate
scandals, but still "in a state of shock."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of bitter sarcasm about all the executives at these
sinking ships who made out like bandits and couldn't care less about
their employees and shareholders," she said. "But it's almost too
soon for the uproar. Portfolio managers are doing a lot of knee-jerk
selling and waiting to see what shoe drops next."</TE>

<HD>Calls for Faster, Fuller Disclosure by Insiders</HD>
<DH>Regulations: Reformers say official reports of stock sales
by Enron's Lay came too late to do investors any good.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Under current financial disclosure rules, not even the most diligent
shareholder could have figured out whether former Enron Corp.
Chairman Kenneth L. Lay was bullish or bearish on his company's stock
in the critical few months before Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   It wasn't until mid-February that Lay was required to fill in a
key piece of the puzzle: The revelation that he sold $70.1 million
worth of stock back to the company last year, including $26.1 million
worth after Vice President Sherron S. Watkins sent him her now-famous
Aug. 15 memo warning that Enron could "implode in a wave of
accounting scandals."</LD>
<LD>   Lay's defenders say he was bullish on the stock to the end, and
that the sales were forced upon him by margin calls, or demands from
lenders that he pony up cash collateral to make up for the declining
value of holdings in his personal brokerage accounts.</LD>
<TE>   Whatever Lay's true opinion of Enron's prospects, critics say, the
salient fact is that he wasn't legally required to make public the
bulk of his 2001 sales of company stock until it was far too late for
the information to do investors any good.</TE>
<TE>   Outrage over the Enron scandal has prompted Congress and the
Securities and Exchange Commission to try to plug loopholes in the
laws and regulations governing disclosure of such insider stock
trades.</TE>
<TE>   Because executives and other corporate insiders often have huge
sums at risk in company stock, their actions with those shares are of
great interest to other investors.</TE>
<TE>   Reformers want to speed up disclosure deadlines for insider
transactions, make terminology in transaction reports more
understandable to investors and require that the filings be done
electronically so they are instantly available.</TE>
<TE>   Although technology for electronic filing has been in place for
years, 95% of all insider-transaction disclosure still is filed in
paper form, the SEC says.</TE>
<TE>   The main goal of disclosure is to monitor company
insiders--defined as executives, directors and holders of 10% or more
of a firm's shares--so they don't violate federal laws against
trading in their own stock while in possession of "material nonpublic
information."</TE>
<TE>   An executive who knows his company is about to announce
surprisingly strong earnings, for example, could make easy money by
buying shares and waiting for the good news to drive up the stock
price. That also would be illegal.</TE>
<TE>   A second reason for disclosure is to enlighten investors. Some
experts say the trading activities of insiders are a good signal of
where a firm's stock is headed. A cottage industry has sprung up of
research firms that issue buy or sell recommendations based on what
insiders are doing with their own shares.</TE>
<TE>   But current federal rules on the timing of disclosures can make
such monitoring difficult, said Lon Gerber, research chief at Thomson
Financial in Scottsdale, Ariz., which tracks insider trading.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, insider purchases or sales made in public stock markets
must be disclosed within 10 days after the end of the month in which
they occur. So if a sale takes place Feb. 1, it does not have to be
reported to the SEC until March 10.</TE>
<TE>   "My clients would shoot me for saying this, but 10 days after the
end of the month is a long time to wait," said Alan L. Dye, a former
SEC lawyer who now is a securities law partner in Washington law firm
Hogan &amp; Hartson.</TE>
<TE>   The monthly filing rule also covers the exercise of options, a
popular way to compensate executives.</TE>
<TE>   However, the rules for reporting so-called dispositions, or sales
of stock back to the company, are more lenient. Disposition
transactions aren't required to be reported to the SEC until 45 days
after the close of a firm's fiscal year. In Enron's case, Feb. 14 was
the 45th day after its fiscal year ended. Lay filed his disclosure on
that day.</TE>
<TE>   Such transactions, which require advance authorization by either
company directors or stockholders, typically have been elements of
long-term compensation plans, experts said. For example, executives
may be awarded stock that vests, or becomes their property, at
periodic intervals. Each time a block of stock vests, it's a taxable
event. For the convenience of the executives, some firms will allow
them to sell back a portion of the stock to cover the taxes owed.</TE>
<TE>   Dispositions aren't rare, and normally they aren't controversial.</TE>
<TE>   "In retrospect, sales back [to a company] should be reported more
timely," Dye said. "But in the past, [investors] never made much of
those types of transactions."</TE>
<TE>   Lay's was a spectacular exception because his $70.1 million in
sales back to Enron in 2001 dwarfed the $15.9 million in net public
market sales that he had previously reported in monthly SEC filings.
Moreover, Lay's public market sales, which had been occurring like
clockwork at the rate of 3,000 to 4,000 shares a day virtually every
trading day, halted abruptly July 31.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lay Controlled Timing Of Stock Sell-Backs</TE>
<TE>   So the investing public had no way of knowing until mid-February
that Lay kept right on selling--but to the company, not in the
market--through August, September and October as damaging revelations
about Enron's finances were pounding its stock lower.</TE>
<TE>   A big difference between Lay's dispositions and others that are
done on a regular basis to cover taxable stock-vesting events is that
Lay controlled the timing of his sell-backs, so they appear much more
like voluntary investment decisions, Dye said.</TE>
<TE>   Lay's fellow Enron officers, including former Chief Executive
Jeffrey K. Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S.
Fastow, also have been accused of profiting at other investors'
expense, but all of their 2001 stock transactions apparently were
reported in regular monthly filings.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling sold 240,000 shares for $15.5 million last year, with
none of the sales coming later than June 13, according to SEC
filings. Fastow did not sell any company stock in 2001, the filings
show.</TE>
<TE>   Lay's $26.1 million in sales after his Aug. 15 warning from
Watkins also came while he was reassuring employees in
teleconferences and e-mail messages that Enron was solid and the
stock was a good buy.</TE>
<TE>   "Such a dramatic insider sell-off would have been a big warning
sign to investors, but this information was not readily accessible to
them," Sen. Jean Carnahan (D-Mo.), a member of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee investigating Enron, said in a
statement accompanying reform legislation that she proposed recently.</TE>
<TE>   Carnahan's bill would require company insiders to electronically
report transactions both to the SEC and on the company's Web site by
the end of the day they occur. Similar legislation by Rep. George
Miller (D-Calif.) would require such notification to the company's
employee pension plan within 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Some House Republicans, led by Ohio Rep. Michael G. Oxley,
chairman of the Financial Services Committee, also favor a one-day
disclosure deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson's Gerber said daily filing might be "overkill," but weekly
filing would bring U.S. markets into line with a number of foreign
markets, including Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Beller, chief of the SEC's corporate finance division, said
recently that the agency is considering stepping up the filing
deadlines to within two days of a transaction. The SEC also is
considering placing the filing requirement on companies rather than
on the individuals, where the burden now lies.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Kimberly, a spokeswoman for Lay and his family, said Lay
halted his long-standing program of regular, public market stock
sales July 31 because "he thought the shares were undervalued."</TE>
<TE>   The sole reason for his huge sales of stock back to the
company--carried out in 20 transactions from Feb. 1 through Oct.
26--was that Lay was being squeezed by margin calls, Kimberly said.
He had pledged his Enron shares as collateral in his brokerage margin
accounts and was using loans secured by the stock to buy other kinds
of securities so he could diversify his holdings, she said.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of 2001, she said, Lay's outstanding margin loans
totaled $80 million. At the same time, Lay's Enron stock was 80% of
his net worth, she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Enron CEO Has Sold Off Other Assets</TE>
<TE>   Enron's most recent proxy statement said that as of the end of
2000, he personally owned 5.4 million shares. At the price then of
$83.13 a share, his stake would have been worth nearly $450 million.
If that was 80% of his net worth, his non-Enron assets would have
come to an additional $110 million. Kimberly said these estimates are
too high but she declined to provide details.</TE>
<TE>   As Enron's stock and the value of Lay's other securities declined,
his broker-lenders kept demanding more cash collateral, Kimberly
said. Lay had to keep relinquishing more Enron stock to the company
in $4-million blocks, she said.</TE>
<TE>   If Lay was so certain that Enron shares were a good buy, why
didn't he sell off all of his other assets before selling more
company stock?</TE>
<TE>   Kimberly said Lay has sold many of his other assets, noting that
in February he sold his stake in the Texans, Houston's new National
Football League team.</TE>
<TE>   As to why Lay didn't report his stock transactions on a more
timely basis, Kimberly said, "Enron made all the disclosures that
were required by the SEC."</TE>

<HD>Steel Industry Needs Tariffs and Much More</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Steel industry problems are front and center once again in Washington
and this time they involve not only foreign steel imports but also
retiree health costs for the unionized portion of the American steel
industry.</LD>
<LD>   The import situation has become critical. Recessions and slow
growth in economies around the world in recent years have led to
record low prices for steel worldwide and a surge of steel shipments
to the U.S. market.</LD>
<LD>   The profitability of the American steel industry has been damaged;
prominent firms, including Bethlehem Steel Corp., have entered
bankruptcy. The shrunken steel business, now smaller than the
plastics industry, needs help against the onslaught of cheap imports.</LD>
<TE>   To be sure, problems are not the only story in steel today. The
industry's innovative record and potentially strong companies are
less well known to investors but could come to the fore amid the
international furor about to erupt if the United States raises
tariffs.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush must decide by Wednesday whether to impose tariffs
on some steel products and also whether the government should pick up
the estimated $12-billion cost of supplemental health benefits for
retired steelworkers, which the companies have failed to fund and now
want to drop.</TE>
<TE>   Experts predict the White House will approve some tariff
protection for the domestic industry but not grant immediate help
with health benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Raising tariffs on steel imports will bring international
protests.</TE>
<TE>   But look for the Bush administration to respond by launching a new
effort to deal with the chronic global ills of steel: international
overcapacity of production and closed foreign markets.</TE>
<TE>   Europe, Japan and other steel producers will join the effort, but
solutions predictably will be slow in coming.</TE>
<TE>   The world's steel mills are capable of producing roughly</TE>
<TE>   865 million tons a year--106 million in the United States. In
other times, the U.S. market took in less than 20 million tons a year
in imports.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last decade, as economies hit severe downturns in Asia,
Russia and Latin America, their exports to the U.S. increased to 30
million to 40 million tons a year.</TE>
<TE>   The flood of imports and declining prices hurt the U.S. industry
even though American steelmakers have improved efficiency
enormously--with productivity equal to that of Japan and Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. steel industry has cut back its capacity by 30 million
tons in the last decade. Big Steel's work force has declined from
548,000 at its peak in 1965 to roughly 160,000 today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No Help for Legacy Costs</TE>
<TE>   Technological competition also has affected steel. Engineered
plastics increasingly are used in automobile bodies and appliances,
displacing steel. The plastics industry now employs four times as
many workers as steel.</TE>
<TE>   Steel industry cutbacks have brought economic devastation to
communities in northern Indiana and nearby Chicago, and to the
Minnesota iron range where ore boats lie idle in Duluth.</TE>
<TE>   It is the political clout of these steel regions, and others in
Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, that will win White House
tariff relief for the industry.</TE>
<TE>   But Washington experts such as Philip Potter, president of Federal
Strategies Group, a lobbying firm, say the industry won't get the 40%
tariffs it is asking for and won't get help on billions of dollars of
unfunded retiree health benefits, which the industry calls "legacy
costs."</TE>
<TE>   Legacy costs are supplemental medical benefits, beyond Medicare,
that steel management granted to the United Steelworkers Union when
the industry was richer and the union larger.</TE>
<TE>   But as companies incurred losses and the industry shrank, these
benefit promises were not funded and now present a burden. The
companies and union are asking the federal government to pick up the
tab.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely, though, the government will let companies and unions
work out their own problems, which are partly self-inflicted. Unions
never renegotiated benefit demands that had become unrealistic, and
companies, even as they neglected employee health programs, never
ceased to pay millions of dollars in salaries and bonuses to their
top executives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Global Expansion</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, with some temporary tariff relief and a concerted
White House effort to open foreign markets, conditions could turn up
for the American steel industry. A look at three different companies
offers a good perspective on this traditional yet changing industry.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Steel Corp. is responding to the global challenge by trying
to grow and compete on the world stage. U.S. Steel is seeking to
merge with Bethlehem Steel if the latter firm's legacy costs can be
taken care of. It also is in the process of acquiring National Steel
from NKK Corp. of Japan, which bought the U.S. firm in the 1980s. And
U.S. Steel bought the Kosice mill in Slovakia two years ago and would
be in the market for other overseas ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel sees foreign steel companies, such as
France's Usinor, merging with others to become international giants,
and thinks that's a good strategy. To succeed, it will need
concessions on work rules from the United Steelworkers and a better
climate in the world economy, says analyst Christopher Olin of
Midwest Research, a Cleveland-based investment firm. But there's no
reason it cannot compete globally.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most efficient steel companies in the world, after
all, are in the United States. Nucor Corp., based in Charlotte, N.C.,
is one of them. Nucor is a "minimill," a firm that produces new steel
from scrap using an electric arc furnace instead of the traditional
blast furnace. Its steel generally is used in construction rather
than in the production of cars and appliances, which demand smoother
sheet steel.</TE>
<TE>   Nucor is nonunion and has invested in new equipment and
innovations through the years. But that did not prevent the company
from being hurt by the industry's downturn and the flood of imports.
With tariff relief and an upturn in world business, Nucor could get
back to the 20% profit on investment of the mid-1990s, rather than
the 4.5% returns it recorded in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   And in a global market, it should not be overlooked that some of
the most efficient U.S. steel producers are owned by overseas firms.
California Steel Industries Inc., in Fontana, is owned by Brazil's
Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and Japan's Kawasaki Steel. It produces
rolled sheets of steel, for appliance panels and construction forms,
from semi-finished slabs imported from Brazil, Mexico and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Return to Production</TE>
<TE>   California Steel's president, Lourenco Goncalves, doesn't fear the
White House imposing a tariff on slabs he must bring in from Brazil
because, as a U.S. producer, he'll "be protected from the Japanese,
Korean and Chinese steel imports that really dominate this market,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   That's a reminder that California is a steel-importing region, and
its businesses will pay whatever tariff Washington imposes to protect
the American steel industry.</TE>
<TE>   The real point of this crisis in the world steel industry is that
everybody would be better off if the global economy could get back to
hitting on all cylinders rather than relying on the United States as
the top buyer of steel and other products.</TE>

<HD>Key Governance Issues for Some Activists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's a look at some of the corporate governance practices that
activist investors, including John Bogle of Vanguard Group and
William Miller of Legg Mason Inc., believe should be major issues for
institutional money managers:</LD>
<LD>   * Earnings "management" and the use of pro forma results. Bogle,
in a recent speech, denounced the "byzantine accounting legerdemain"
used by many companies to avoid disappointing investors and brokerage
analysts from quarter to quarter, potentially at the expense of a
long-term focus.</LD>
<LD>   He urged companies to stop giving analysts self-serving "guidance"
that sets the bar low each quarter so reported results inevitably
beat estimates.</LD>
<TE>   Bogle also said money managers should pressure companies to stop
using so-called pro forma earnings to spruce up their results. He
noted that in 2001 about 1,500 companies reported pro forma
earnings--as he put it, "what their earnings would have been if bad
things hadn't happened."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, a well-known value-oriented investor who manages the Legg
Mason Value Trust fund, sounded a similar theme in a recent letter to
his shareholders. Miller mocked one brokerage analyst who recently
said a company "exceeded expectations, as expected."</TE>
<TE>   Miller also said "the problem with pro forma results is that they
are too often 'pro-motional,' eliminating the negative and
emphasizing the positive. When did you ever see pro forma results
that indicated the business was doing worse than was reported under
GAAP [generally accepted accounting principles]?"</TE>
<TE>   * Overstated pension plan assumptions. Bogle said some companies
are using rosy projected returns for their employee pension plans to
buff their financial statements. Many firms still assume 9% to 10%
annual returns on their pension plans in coming years, when 5% would
be more realistic, Bogle said, considering that the plans usually
hold bonds and other assets that have generated lower long-term
returns than stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The higher the assumed long-term returns, the lower the annual
pension plan contributions a company is required to make in the near
term. Instead, money that would have been earmarked for a pension
plan accrues to the company's bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, for example, IBM was able to boost its earnings by $200
million because it raised its return assumption on its pension plan
to 10% from 9.5%. Enron Corp. was more aggressive: It assumed 10.5%
annual pension returns.</TE>
<TE>   Bogle said the issue should be on the agendas of the board of
directors' finance committees of every public firm.</TE>
<TE>   * Underreporting of executive compensation. Most major companies
don't treat the costs of employee stock options as an official
expense on income statements. That has contributed to an
overstatement of earnings in recent years, Bogle said.</TE>
<TE>   When options involve no charge to earnings, they are considered a
"cheap" form of compensation--when in fact they represent a cost to
shareholders, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   A bill in the U.S. Senate would force companies to charge options
costs against earnings. But the bill's prospects are uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Though executives should have a chance to be handsomely rewarded,
Bogle said, he and others believe option grants are excessive in many
cases, bringing even mediocre CEOs tens of millions of dollars a
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Executive pay is out of control because [board] compensation
committees aren't doing their job," he said.</TE>
<TE>   * Auditor independence. Bogle said outside accounting firms may
have had little incentive to question the books of companies such as
Enron because of an inherent conflict of interest that has developed
over the years: A major chunk of the revenue generated by Big Five
accounting firms now comes from non-auditing work such as consulting,
often performed for the same clients whose books the firms are
auditing.</TE>
<TE>   "To some extent this issue is resolving itself a bit," Bogle said,
noting that the major accounting firms are taking steps to separate
their auditing and consulting operations.</TE>

<HD>Writing 'Paid in Full' on Check Doesn't Erase Debt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I read your comments regarding the effects of filing
bankruptcy, and it inspired me to write you regarding a situation I
find troubling. A friend of a friend has racked up credit card debt
and student loans totaling $100,000. Not securely employed, she has
been planning on declaring bankruptcy while continuing her dinners
out, lavish shopping trips, a car purchase and vacations, figuring it
all will get wiped out soon enough.</LD>
<LD>   She says she is working with a lawyer who advised her to write $10
checks to all her creditors, with a note saying "paid in full" on the
check. She was told that by the time they realize it is not payment
in full, this lawyer--who is charging $7,000--will step in and
dispute the charges.</LD>
<LD>   He says the credit card companies won't have enough time to
research the charges and probably will just drop them. I think she is
being scammed herself while she is trying to scam the creditors. She
is desperate and doesn't care, but it makes me angry that people are
doing this. Have you heard of this scam?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: This "paid-in-full" nonsense has achieved the status of
urban legend, says J. Scott Bovitz, a Los Angeles bankruptcy lawyer.
A creditor sometimes will reduce a claim for a disputed payment, but
this kind of settlement usually won't happen if the debtor acts in
bad faith, Bovitz says. The act of writing "paid in full" on a $10
check pretty much defines the term "bad faith."</TE>
<TE>   Your friend also is deluded if she thinks her education
debt somehow will get erased. Student loans are among the debts that
usually can't be wiped out in Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   She may get stuck with the bills for her spending spree, as well.
Bankruptcy judges tend to frown on folks who rack up big bills on
luxuries and other nonessential purchases right before they file. In
fact, judges think so little of this practice that she might be
prevented from going through with the bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Your friend isn't really desperate. She's unethical. She
understands that she's involved in something shady and yet she's
participating anyway. She'll probably get her comeuppance when she's
saddled with all the debts she thought she could avoid.</TE>
<TE>   If you have any concern that Bankruptcy Court might not catch her
shenanigans, you can tip them off after she files by calling the U.S.
Trustee's Office in your area, listed in the blue pages of your local
phone book.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's a Mistake to Rush Into Bankruptcy</TE>
<TE>   Q: You recently answered a question from a woman who had filed for
bankruptcy and was wondering if she would pay more for a mortgage
because of it. Your answer--that she ultimately would pay more
because she bailed on her debts--was technically correct but kind of
harsh. After all, she could have filed for bankruptcy for reasons
beyond her control.</TE>
<TE>   A: There are lots of reasons to file for bankruptcy, including job
loss, divorce and overwhelming medical bills, among others. There's
not much excuse, however, for filing before you understand the
consequences, as this woman apparently did. Anyone considering
bankruptcy should know the costs and research the alternatives before
turning to the courts. One good source of information is "Money
Troubles: Legal Strategies to Cope With Your Debts," by Robin Leonard
and Deanne Loonin (Nolo Press, 2001).</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, some consumers rush into bankruptcy without
understanding that the filing will affect their credit record for 10
years. People who file for bankruptcy will have more trouble getting
loans, and pay more for them, than if they hadn't filed.</TE>
<TE>   The woman who wrote might be able to get a mortgage shortly after
her bankruptcy was finished, but she would pay high fees and an
interest rate three to five percentage points higher than someone
with good credit.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy penalty diminishes over time, especially if she
cleans up her act and pays her bills promptly. If she maintains good
credit, she may be able to qualify for an Federal Housing
Administration loan a few years after her bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   FHA loans currently average 6.76%, compared with about 6.3% for
standard 30-year loans, according to Bankrate.com, which tracks
interest rates.</TE>
<TE>   FHA borrowers also must pay mortgage insurance, which boosts their
monthly payments. This insurance, referred to as mutual mortgage
insurance, or MMI, costs 0.5% of the loan amount a year, or $500 a
year on a $100,000 loan.</TE>
<TE>   These extra costs reflect the additional risk lenders take when
they make loans to people who already have bailed on their
obligations.</TE>

<HD>Pension Funds Seek Disclosure of Votes on Governance Issues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Large pension funds say they plan to keep pressing for corporate
governance reform regardless of whether mutual funds and other
institutional investors join the fight.</LD>
<LD>   Some pension officials also want to turn up the heat on private
institutional investors by forcing them to disclose how they vote on
governance issues that are placed on annual company proxy statements.</LD>
<LD>   Major public pension funds, including the $150-billion-asset
CalPERS, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, long
have used their financial clout to pressure individual companies that
the funds believe are failing to boost shareholder value.</LD>
<TE>   Now, CalPERS is calling for an overhaul of company auditing
procedures to prevent future Enron-style implosions.</TE>
<TE>   The fund plans to submit proposals for accounting reform to
Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial
Accounting Standards Board.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS also has proposed a commission of legislators, regulators
and investors to consider ways to expose conflicts of interest among
Wall Street brokerages, corporate auditors and others.</TE>
<TE>   "For more than 10 years CalPERS has made constructive attempts to
improve corporate governance in the U.S. and abroad," said William D.
Crist, president of the fund's board of administration. "Enron
teaches us that in spite of these efforts, shareholder value can be
destroyed by faulty corporate governance. It clearly is time for us
to tighten the screws."</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS, like many of the biggest pension funds, is primarily an
"index" investor, meaning it aims to hold on to stocks for years or
even decades. That gives the fund greater incentive to monitor
corporate performance.</TE>
<TE>   Some managers of pension plans and socially directed funds say
they are encouraged by the new interest other fund managers are
showing in corporate governance. But they say dramatic changes in the
level of investor involvement will take time.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some discussions with [mutual fund] money managers who
were badly burned by Enron, [focusing] on issues such as auditor
independence," said Damon Silvers, the AFL-CIO's associate general
counsel, who often represents the labor union on pension fund issues.
"I wish we could say we have firm commitments that they will become
more involved."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, "Over the last decade a number of money managers
have revised their proxy-voting guidelines to be more responsive to
shareholder resolutions."</TE>
<TE>   Many fund firms, such as Vanguard Group, publicize their
proxy-voting policies on their Web sites--but not necessarily their
company-specific votes.</TE>
<TE>   The shareholder advocacy firm Fund Democracy has joined with
pension funds and socially directed fund companies such as Domini
Social Investments and Calvert Asset Management to ask the SEC to
require fund managers to disclose not only their proxy-voting
policies but also their votes, so investors can see where their funds
stand on governance issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Proxy voting is the most direct means by which individual
investors--either directly or through financial intermediaries like
mutual funds--can influence corporate behavior," Domini founder Amy
Domini wrote in a letter to the SEC.</TE>

<LD>Greenspan Sees Signs of Slow, Sure Recovery</LD>
<LD>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that he sees
increasing signs the U.S. economy soon will emerge from recession,
but warned that the recovery could proceed at a sluggish pace.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, the economy grew at a 1.4% rate during the fourth quarter,
and manufacturing in February grew for the first time in 19 months.</LD>
<TE>   The longest-serving Fed chief, presenting the central bank's
semiannual assessment of the nation's economic health, said the
nation has largely recuperated from the financial shock of Sept. 11,
and there is little evidence that the collapse of Enron Corp. and
other recent economic setbacks will cause the recovery to stall.</TE>

<TE>   Former Global Crossing Employee Files Lawsuit</TE>
<TE>   A former Global Crossing Ltd. employee who questioned the
propriety of the company's accounting methods filed a
much-anticipated lawsuit against company founder Gary Winnick and
three other executives.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, by former Vice President of Finance Roy L. Olofson,
offered new details about the alleged accounting tactics that helped
the troubled telecommunications firm mask its deteriorating financial
health, which culminated in its Jan. 28 bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Olofson said the company improperly used long-term contracts for
network capacity to boost revenue, even though many of the deals did
not bring in cash. His allegations are being investigated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the FBI. A spokesman for
Winnick said the lawsuit "has no merit."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Labor Department began questioning former Global
Crossing workers about the company's 401(k) retirement plan,
apparently to determine whether any pension laws were broken.
Employees lost about $250 million between 1999 and 2001, when the
value of the company stock in their 401(k) accounts tumbled from a
peak of $64 to 30 cents. A Global Crossing spokeswoman said the
company was cooperating with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the company disclosed that it expects a "significant net
loss" for its fiscal fourth quarter and for all of 2001. Its official
earnings statement has been delayed while its outside auditor,
Andersen, continues to review the books.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Execs Square Off in Enron Testimony</TE>
<TE>   In a confrontation between accuser and accused, Enron Corp. Vice
President Sherron S. Watkins told Congress that former Chief
Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling must have known about the company's
financial troubles, while Skilling maintained that he was unaware of
accounting improprieties.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, former Enron Treasurer Ben F. Glisan--who reportedly
pocketed $1 million by investing $5,800 in the company's
off-the-books partnerships--has begun cooperating with the Justice
Department, according to a source familiar with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling, whose earlier testimony before a House panel was greeted
with skepticism from lawmakers, denied lying to Congress during 5 1/2
hours of grilling before the Senate Commerce Committee. In a classic
he-said-she-said duel, Skilling and Watkins--seated at the same table
and separated by only Skilling's attorney--disputed each other's
account of what led to the largest bankruptcy in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   State Lawmakers Seek to Bar Gene-Altered Fish</TE>
<TE>   California lawmakers, environmentalists and fishermen are joining
to stop the spread of genetically engineered fish into the state.</TE>
<TE>   Two bills and a joint resolution recently introduced in the
Legislature would bar live gene-altered fish from entering the state
and require special labeling when sold in California stores.</TE>
<TE>   California would be the second state to take action. A less
stringent Maryland law adopted last year bans the fish from the
state's network of waterways but allows them in separated ponds and
lakes.</TE>
<TE>   Several firms are trying to develop stocks of transgenic salmon
and catfish to be sold to fish farmers. These fish, spliced with
genes from faster-growing species, would let farmers get bigger fish
to market for less money.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HP Chief Pushes Merger on Wall Street</TE>
<TE>   With a shareholder vote looming, Hewlett-Packard Co. Chief
Executive Carly Fiorina made a direct appeal to Wall Street on the
proposed $21.7-billion purchase of Compaq Computer Corp., saying it
is vital for the company, and asked them to ignore the daily attacks
from dissident director Walter Hewlett.</TE>
<TE>   With several major investors on record as being against the deal,
and with the shareholder vote scheduled for March 19, Fiorina held a
daylong meeting with analysts in New York.</TE>
<TE>   She explained why she thinks Compaq would let HP offer more
end-to-end packages to corporate customers, and she detailed the
projected financial merits of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Investors Pump Cash Into Stock Funds</TE>
<TE>   Despite getting smacked by two straight down years for stocks,
investors plowed a net $19.6 billion of new money into equity mutual
funds in January.</TE>
<TE>   The cash inflow, reported by the Investment Company Institute, was
the highest monthly total in a year and the fifth-highest January
inflow.</TE>
<TE>   The tally surprised some analysts, who expected investors to be
less willing to buy stock funds after suffering heavy losses in 2001
and as the market weakened again in January.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Union Decries Chicken Plant Conditions</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to call attention to an "epidemic" of repetitive-stress
injuries among blue-collar workers, the United Food and Commercial
Workers union filed a federal complaint alleging hazardous working
conditions at a Pilgrim's Pride Corp. chicken plant in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said it is only the first salvo in a campaign to

<TE>   Tobacco Firms Involved in Smuggling, EU Says</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco companies have violated a U.S. trade embargo for more than
a decade by illegally sending billions of cigarettes into Iraq, the
European Union has charged.</TE>
<TE>   The allegation is detailed in documents recently filed in federal
court in Brooklyn, N.Y., where the EU has accused tobacco firms of
evading hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes by taking part in a
vast cigarette smuggling scheme.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraq allegation focuses on two companies, R.J. Reynolds and
Japan Tobacco Inc., which acquired Reynolds' international cigarette
business in 1999. But an affidavit filed in court claims that in
December a witness saw Philip Morris brands being trucked from Turkey
into Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   It could not immediately be determined whether U.S. authorities
are looking into the EU's claims.</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco company officials denied the claims.</TE>

<TE>   Agents, SAG Reach Tentative Agreement</TE>
<TE>   The Screen Actors Guild reached a tentative three-year agreement
with the Assn. of Talent Agents that would allow agencies to make and
receive investments from companies involved in production.</TE>
<TE>   Underscoring the high stakes of the deal, SAG said it hired two
Clinton administration strategists--Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new proposal--which must be approved by SAG's governing
board and membership--independent production companies and large
advertisers would be allowed to invest as much as 20% in a talent
agency.</TE>

<LD>Re "Divisions Multiply Over Bush Energy Plan," Feb. 26: President
Bush, in the driveway of the White House, proudly said, "Today we had
a chance to see some of the best car technologies being developed by
American ingenuity." He showed the GMC pickup, Ford SUV and Chrysler
Minivan as American hybrid-fuel car models. These American models
will not be available until 2004, whereas Japan has been producing
and selling hybrid vehicles for about a year in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer touted the "American"
vehicles' capabilities, but Daimler-Chrysler is not an American
company, just as Honda and Toyota are not American companies. If a
German car company is to be included in this list of American
ingenuity, I feel that Japanese cars should also be included. The
president should naturally take pride in American products, but I
sincerely hope that this is not a manifestation of racial/ethnic
prejudice, subconsciously or otherwise.</LD>

<TE>   The propaganda put out by the car industry ("The government wants
to take away my SUV," the fictional Sally says to her husband, Joe,
in one of the ads) has reached, in terms of pure utopian
disinformation, the level of myth. The U.S. has about 3% of the
world's proven oil reserves and consumes more than 25% of the
planet's energy, yet somehow Big Auto and Big Oil would have us
believe that energy independence is to be found on the supply side of
the equation. Americans collectively choose to ignore the evidence
before their very eyes, preferring to be seduced by corporate
America's fantasy world of unlimited energy and infinite growth. When
will America wake up?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It is my impression that now is the time to start thinking of
converting the Social Security system to a real federal pension
system to which everyone in the country who works, from the president
and legislators on down, would be required to contribute. Income from
the program would be placed in the general fund, and payment of
pensions would have first call on government revenue. If there wasn't
enough current income to meet pension obligations, all pensioners
would suffer equally in proportion to the amount they would otherwise
be entitled to.</LD>
<LD>   My objection to present schemes, such as the 401(k) plans, that
invest pension funds in the stock market is that there are too few
"widows and orphans stocks," where money invested is safe. I know of
a number of elderly widows living on invested money who had very
handsome incomes up until the return on treasury bills dropped below
2%, and even large pension funds such as Florida's have lost a lot in
falling stock prices recently.</LD>

<LD>Re "Enron's Watkins Falls Far Short of Being a Hero," Commentary,
Feb. 27: It's about time someone called politicians and journalists
to account for their profligate use of words like "whistle-blower,"
"hero" and "courage." Americans have long had a facile notion of
courage and heroism, applying it to athletes who compete while
suffering from stress fractures. But to see the term "whistle-blower"
join the company of such overused words is particularly distressing.
To be a true whistle-blower is to go public with an ethical conflict,
with the public good in mind.</LD>
<LD>   Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, bless her heart, seems to
have been whistling largely for the benefit of herself and her
bosses, not the thousands of Enron employees who lost their life
savings or the other outsiders whose investments tanked. She's no
Daniel Ellsberg.</LD>

<HD>Public Safety: Prop. Q Bond Includes Oversight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Voters will have an important opportunity on March 5 to strengthen
public safety throughout Los Angeles when they vote yes on
Proposition Q, the 911-emergency response measure.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition Q will provide funds to repair, renovate or replace
police stations and fire stations throughout the city. Many of our
police stations are so overcrowded, police detectives are forced to
work from cramped trailers, in converted broom closets or at off-site
locations. Important police records are stored in makeshift stacks in
the halls. And many of our fire stations lack the proper equipment to
protect the firefighters who are stationed there from diesel
emissions. Other older stations are so small, the ambulance must be
parked outside.</LD>
<LD>   A yes vote on Proposition Q will mandate that the city move ahead
with specific projects that have been carefully selected and
evaluated. They include a new, earthquake-proof emergency operations
and 911 dispatch center; four replacement police stations (West
Valley, Hollenbeck, Rampart, Harbor); two new police stations
(Mid-City and San Fernando Valley); and two new bomb squad
facilities, one in the Metro area and one in the Valley. Q also
provides funds for vitally needed repairs and renovations of fire and
police stations.</LD>
<TE>   This proposition includes special provisions for independent
financial audits and a citizens oversight committee to ensure that
the projects are completed on time and within budget, a committee
that I will join City Council President Alex Padilla in appointing. I
urge voters to join me in a yes vote on Proposition Q.</TE>

<TE>   Would someone please enlighten Mayor Hahn? How long will it be
before he seeks an opinion from the city attorney's office to take
legal action against the people responsible for wasting the hundreds
of thousands if not millions of dollars of our bond money?</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry about the dollars wasted by city bond issues, Mr.
Mayor. You can just go back to the taxpayers and have them write you
another check. Not! We have been waiting 13 years for a new police
station in the Valley alone. Where's the money? More officers, more
accountability--not buildings, not taxes. Oh, pardon me, we call them
bonds. No on Q. Period.</TE>

<LD>Republican pollster and lay Mormon Bishop Gary Lawrence says that
Republican candidate for governor Richard Riordan should learn from
the Mormons (Commentary, Feb. 27). Bad-mouthing other churches, he
says that the Mormons have discovered that you gain adherents by
standing firm for something, not by watering down your beliefs.</LD>
<LD>   Lawrence apparently has forgotten that only a few years ago the
Mormons changed their beliefs to allow blacks into their priesthood,
and long ago they changed their beliefs and outlawed plural marriage.
Those were rather distinctive beliefs that the Mormons changed in
order to get with the times.</LD>

<LD>Gordon Walker claims in his Feb. 27 letter that changing the name of
vouchers will make a difference, but it's the intent of the vouchers
that should be questioned. If the intent is to improve education for
children, no one has explained how vouchers will accomplish that in
the real world of Los Angeles. What schools in L.A. will the kids
take their vouchers to? Can anyone tell me where there are any
openings in quality private schools, public magnet schools or the top
public schools?</LD>
<LD>   The students are the real difference between private and public
schools. Private schools can choose their students and don't have to
accommodate those who aren't fluent in English, don't behave or who
are disabled. My guess is if the LAUSD had the same latitude, the
public schools could match the private schools in success rates.
Blaming the teachers and administrators is disingenuous. It's not the
teachers and administrators who don't learn, don't behave, don't
prepare the kids for school or who vandalize schools. This is above
and beyond the intrinsic problems of moving tax dollars into
religious schools, even if done through the backdoor of parental
choice.</LD>
<LD>   Zelda McKay</LD>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is true that the GI Bill of Rights allowed vets to attend
schools of their choice--private, religious or trade. However, Walker
ignores the fact that these choices were made by adults--veterans
who, for the most part, had had combat experience. School vouchers
would be given to the parents and not to the children themselves, as
he states. The choice of schools would be made by parents, not the
children.</TE>
<TE>   As to the teachers of public schools fighting the voucher program,
I would suggest that under a voucher program there would probably be
an increase in the number of religious and private schools. Wouldn't
it seem logical that these teachers from public schools would be
hired to teach in these new schools? After a crash course in
religion, that is.</TE>

<HD>Only Term Limits Can Remove Stale Politicians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several writers have recently opposed term limits on the basis that
elected officials not doing their jobs could be voted out of office.
That sounds inviting but doesn't work in practice.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the case of Willie Brown, the poster boy for term limits.
In addition to serving his constituents in a small Assembly district
in the Bay Area, he had a stranglehold on state politics for many
years as speaker of the Assembly. As speaker he had far more effect
on me and my family than my own assemblyman. Yet I could not vote him
out of office. And there was no chance that he would be defeated by
the small number of citizens who elected him in his district. Now we
have state Sen. John Burton (D-San Francisco), president pro tem of
the Senate, and others trying to stay in office.</LD>
<LD>   For better or worse they have had their turn at the helm. Now it
is time for fresh people with fresh ideas. Yes, there are some
problems with term limits, but they pale in comparison to the
suffocating grip some politicians have imposed on this state.</LD>

<LD>Re "A Plan That Could Help Unclog the Freeways," Feb. 25:</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 42 misses the boat. Spending $36 billion of gasoline
sales tax to build roads won't solve congestion. There are too many
cars.</LD>
<LD>   The only thing that will work is to pay people not to drive. That
is, direct the gasoline tax directly back to each of the 34 million
people in California via an income tax rebate. Increase the rebate
and the tax, dollar-for-dollar, until the roads decongest. Reduce
congestion, clean the air, reduce car crashes. Everybody gets real
money back. Everybody wins except for a few oil-well-owning Texans. I
only know one, and he will do OK.</LD>

is how I see the Olympics: a colossal waste of time, energy and money
that has everything to do with political posturing, medal counts,
flag-waving and profit and almost nothing to do with the spirit of
amateur athletic competition. I wonder how many amateur hockey

<HD>Spiritual Rainbow Coalition Ministers to Patients' Needs</HD>
<DH>UCLA student chaplains reflect the city's religious
diversity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How does a Hindu talk to a Buddhist about life after death? How can a
Christian pray with a Muslim? Such questions define the lives of
students in UCLA Medical Center's Spiritual Care Unit. Pills and
diagnoses seem like cheery conversation starters compared with the
topics they handle.</LD>
<LD>   Father Abraham Jacob, a Catholic priest in his early 50s, was
raised Hindu. He is one of 14 students in the hospital's chaplaincy
training program. On a recent day, his first visit was with a
13-year-old girl who was asleep when he entered her room. Her
grandmother and aunt sat quietly beside her.</LD>
<LD>   The instant intimacy of hospital conversations was evident as the
aunt explained that the girl cannot digest food and needs surgery.
"She has always been sickly," the aunt said.</LD>
<TE>   "Are you Persian?" Jacob asked. He has Persian relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Any religion?" He mentioned that he is a Catholic priest.</TE>
<TE>   "We are born Muslim, but we're not practicing," the aunt said.
"It's more a personal relationship with God."</TE>
<TE>   Jacob offered to send a Muslim chaplain, but they did not commit.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you like to pray?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Go ahead," the aunt said. "It's all the same."</TE>
<TE>   It was a brief prayer. "God bless you for taking care of God's
child," Jacob began. "God has given you a special child."</TE>
<TE>   In the hallway afterward Jacob said he never knows what to expect
when he enters a patient's room. One Catholic woman told him to go
away. "She had some problems with the church," he recalled. "No hard
feelings. I sent her another chaplain."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes he only stops in to tell a patient that chaplains from
every major faith are available if they want to see one. The
full-time staff includes a priest, a minister and a rabbi, with
Muslims and Buddhists on call. Fifteen years ago, when the program
was new, the full-time staff consisted of one Baptist minister.</TE>
<TE>   These days, religious diversity is redefining hospital chaplaincy
work. While the patient directory at UCLA is usually about 65%
Christian, the number of Jews, Muslims, Buddhists and members of
other religions continues to increase. Training programs like UCLA's,
which is officially called the Clinical Pastoral Education Program,
have been in place since the '50s. Many of them were designed to
prepare seminary students to become part of a patient's treatment.</TE>
<TE>   A Baptist minister named Janice Humphreys launched UCLA's program
in 1989. The first students were Christian seminarians, but this year
the group represents an array of the world's religions, including
Hinduism, Buddhism, Shintoism and Islam as well as Judaism and
Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   A similar broadening has occurred in chaplaincy programs around
the country, but UCLA, as a reflection of its patients, is ahead of
most others.</TE>
<TE>   Sandee Yarlott has been the program's director for about a year.
"Ten years ago there was a realization that the chaplaincy program
needed to diversify religiously, or at least culturally," said
Yarlott, 52, who came to UCLA after developing chaplaincy programs in
Northern California. She recently recruited a Muslim woman to the
program after meeting her among the hospital volunteers, and she is
currently arranging to make presentations to Buddhists and Muslims
around the city. Jewish students also have gone through the program.</TE>
<TE>   More than 6,000 students are in chaplaincy training programs
around the country, according to the Assn. for Clinical Pastoral
Education in Decatur, Ga., the largest accrediting institution in the
country. No one goes into the field for the money. Most graduates
find jobs as full-time chaplains, earning around $40,000 per year;
Californians face a particular challenge since most available jobs
are in faraway places such as North Dakota or Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 hospitals and related centers are certified to teach
chaplaincy by the association, the vast majority of them nonreligious
hospitals. Locally, UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles Childrens
Hospital and the Methodist Hospital of Southern California in Arcadia
offer programs. So does the Crystal Cathedral, a Christian church in
Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   About half of the students in UCLA's training program are
seminarians or clergy, and despite the financial and geographic
limits of the profession, competition for enrollment in the UCLA
program is stiff. There were 14 applicants for the residency program
last fall; only four were accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Good intentions won't get you very far in this field.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it all right to read the five precepts of the religion to a
dying Buddhist?" one Catholic student asked Rev. Kusala, a Buddhist
monk who met with the group as part of a lecture series on the
world's major religions.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Kusala said. "That would be like a Buddhist leading a
Christian who wanted to pray the Our Father." Buddhists don't believe
in God the Father.</TE>
<TE>   "How should we pray with a Buddhist?" asked a Japanese Methodist
student who was raised in the Shinto religion, where she learned that
death leads to 33 hells, if not 33 heavens. "You don't pray with a
Buddhist," Kusala answered. "Buddhists don't worship any god. There
isn't anyone to petition. We try to help the dying to remember all
the good they have done in this life."</TE>
<TE>   These somewhat abrupt awakenings have a ripple effect. "I don't
mention Jesus when I pray, unless I know the patient is Christian,"
said Jacob. (Patients are not required to list their religion on
hospital forms.) If he does pray with a patient, it is only about
specific things the patient has talked about.</TE>
<TE>   "The real work we do as chaplains is to listen," Yarlott said.
"For that, we have to watch how our own assumptions and values impact
situations." Religious sensitivities are only part of what a chaplain
has to be aware of. "A patient might say they are going home soon,"
Yarlott explained. "We might answer, 'Good.' Maybe, but for an abused
woman, maybe not. By assuming things, we might shut down entire
conversations."</TE>
<TE>   Sedigheh Kunkel, a retired nurse in her 50s, entered the training
program in January. She speaks Persian and Arabic and enters a
hospital room saying "Salaam aleikum" if a patient's chart shows that
he or she is Muslim. "Peace be upon you," the Arabic greeting, is
Kunkel's way of saying that she is Muslim too.</TE>
<TE>   An older woman with an inflamed knee saw Kunkel at the door of her
hospital room and smiled. Surrounded by valentine cards and
heart-shaped balloons, with her husband sitting in a chair beside her
bed, the patient seemed to want something more.</TE>
<TE>   "You saw me yesterday. I had a broken heart," she reminded Kunkel.
Their conversation, a mix of Persian and English, ended when the
patient said, "I want you to pray for me." Kunkel suggested they pray
together in Persian.</TE>
<TE>   A former nurse, Kunkel came to the chaplaincy program while
working as a volunteer translator helping Persian-speaking patients.
She found herself going beyond her immediate tasks and listening to
patients' stories.</TE>
<TE>   "I was crying so often when I'd meet people who were dying," she
said. "It's different in nursing. You are action oriented; you don't
think so much about how people feel." Kunkel went to Yarlott for
guidance. "I wondered if there was anything I could do to stop crying
and be more helpful," she recalled. "Sandee suggested I apply for the
chaplaincy program."</TE>
<TE>   For his second visit with a frail 43-year-old man who had been in
isolation since December, Jacob put on the required mask and gloves.
The first time they met, the patient, a lapsed Catholic, was cool
toward Jacob. This time, through the oxygen tube in his esophagus, he
managed to say that his sister would visit him the next day and that
he was not as upset as he had been. Jacob asked if he would like to
pray, and the patient nodded in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "What shall we pray?" Jacob asked.</TE>
<TE>   "That I can go home," the man answered.</TE>

<HD>Driven by the Fear Factor</HD>
<DH>Gavin de Becker is Hollywood's go-to man on security
matters. But some of his methods have set his critics on edge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIMI AVINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone wants to be a star, until they discover it can be scary at
the top. Gavin de Becker, a charismatic, controversial
private-security specialist, wanted success and recognition as much
as any American dreamer. But he quickly learned about the dark side
of public life--the constant scrutiny, the dangers posed by wacko
fans. Now 48, he has been a celebrity assistant, presidential
advisor, expert witness, author, entrepreneur and script consultant.
He's worked for and been befriended by some of the most celebrated
people in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Like George Harrison. The former Beatle came to Los Angeles to die
late last year. De Becker wanted his friend to have privacy and
safety, and if shielding Harrison would upset some people, De
Becker's attitude was, so be it. He'd made enemies before. After
Harrison died, De Becker's strategy backfired, and he found himself
embroiled in a big public mess.</LD>
<LD>   Harrison's death capped a busy season for the consultant. He never
sought to profit from the tragedy of Sept. 11. Yet understanding fear
is his metier and, suddenly, the whole country was jittery. So in the
weeks following the terrorist attacks, he constantly answered his
phone, even at 3 a.m., whenever a celebrity or a corporate client
felt the need to talk about biological or chemical warfare.</LD>
<TE>   "I frequently get calls from people who are afraid or concerned
about something," he says. "But after Sept. 11, I spoke to more
people who were afraid than in any other time in my life. They were
asking me questions that God could answer much better than I could.
'What city do you think will be hit next?' 'If we do travel, where is
it safe to stay?' I came to the conclusion that the only place not to
be was in the imagination, because that's where all the really
dangerous stuff was going on."</TE>
<TE>   De Becker's response to the public's panic was to write a book,
"Fear Less: Real Truth About Risk, Safety and Security in a Time of
Terrorism" (Little, Brown, $19.95). His first book, "The Gift of
Fear," (Little, Brown, 1997) had reached No. 4 on the New York Times'
bestseller list, revealing the depth of public interest in
demystifying and predicting violence. His follow-up, "Protecting the
Gift," (Dial Press, 1999) was a guide to keeping children and
teenagers safe. The latest work explains that terrorism isn't
something completely new in America and that this country would be
better off if its citizens soberly examined potential threats, rather
than automatically buying into the kind of speculation and mass
hysteria fomented by De Becker's nemesis, television news. The
author's share of profits from "Fear Less" will go to Victory over
Violence, a Pacific Palisades-based charity that provides support to
families affected by violence.</TE>
<TE>   Fear, to De Becker, is more than a catchy word to put in a book
title. It is the foundation of the Los Angeles-based business he has
built over the last 25 years. A pioneer in the still-developing field
of threat assessment, he analyzes fear, categorizes it, heeds or
discounts it.</TE>
<TE>   "Fear Less" is a balm for psyches frazzled by current events. He
debunks a number of worst-case scenarios terrorism has inspired, from
mass death from anthrax to nuclear attack. ("A nuclear device used by
terrorists would be low-yield; it would not, contrary to our worst
imaginings, level whole cities.") He believes that when the unknown
is studied, it can be better understood and controlled. Information
is power. He who has it has the ability to instill fear, or minimize
risk.</TE>
<TE>   What would be considered a routine risk minimization procedure in
De Becker's world led to a brouhaha after Harrison's death. The
singer, who was not a client, didn't own a home in Los Angeles. He
knew his condition was terminal and needed a place where his friends
could come to say goodbye. De Becker rented a house in Coldwater
Canyon for the Harrisons to use. Everyone who visited was given a
nonexistent address on Coldwater, where they were met and escorted to
the house.</TE>
<TE>   When Harrison died, the funeral home was given the same
non-address for picking up the body and listed it on the death
certificate. When it was revealed that the death certificate included
a fictitious address, a chorus of questions and accusations arose.
Was someone deliberately trying to falsify information on a legal
document? Why did Harrison die at a house rented to De Becker? Gloria
Allred filed a complaint about the discrepancy. Conspiracy theories
fed the gossip machine. The investigation that followed was, De
Becker says, "a silly waste of taxpayer money."</TE>
<TE>   He believes the public doesn't have the right to know everything
about celebrities. "Most people have no idea the kinds of challenges
high-profile people face," De Becker says. "They have the same
hierarchy of risk as anyone when it comes to home accidents, disease,
car crashes. What most of us don't have that they do is constant
pursuit by alarming strangers. Famous people experience stalking,
fear, threat, intimidation, unwanted pursuit with extraordinary
frequency, and most of the public doesn't have a remote connection to
what living with that is like."</TE>
<TE>   It makes sense that De Becker would apply some of his expertise to
protecting his own privacy. In order to visit his office, a reporter
and photographer are driven in a customized black Suburban with
windows so thick they look like they could stop a bullet. The driver
wears a suit right out of "Men in Black." The office address is kept
secret for the clients' sake, he says, so confidential files at the
headquarters of Gavin de Becker and Associates won't be vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Inside a nondescript warehouse in the San Fernando Valley, De
Becker strides in wearing a midnight-blue pinstriped Armani suit. His
voice is resonant, his manner upbeat. He's just returned from doing
some television interviews about "Fear Less" and hasn't had time to
wash off his TV makeup. He excuses himself to take an urgent call in
his inner office, encouraging his visitors to help themselves to soft
drinks and snacks. The walls are covered with photographs of the
security expert with former presidents and movie stars and
certificates of commendation from law-enforcement groups. His
hospitality is unusually gracious. Perhaps his mother was a wonderful
hostess, one might think.</TE>
<TE>   Hardly. She was a heroin addict who lived on welfare in Los
Angeles, who shot (but didn't kill) her third husband in front of her
three children. At 39, she committed suicide. De Becker was 16.
Self-educated and self-made, he credits his painful childhood with
forcing him to summon survival skills beyond the ken of most
teenagers. As a boy, he had only sporadic contact with his father, a
gymnast and dancer who traveled a great deal, and he was beaten by
his mother, he recalls, "with everything in the house" as a weapon.
He believes his history made his career possible.  "When I was just
starting out, a lot of my clients were women in peril," he says. "I
lose my mother at 16, and then I find myself dealing with madness and
craziness. Dealing with pain. Surprise, surprise. All my career,
people told me I really have compassion. I had more than that. I had
empathy because I knew the experience of victimization and fear. I
understood it."</TE>
<TE>   When De Becker was still in school, his grandfather rented an
apartment in Beverly Hills to give the family an address in that
city's school district. At Beverly Hills High, De Becker was one of
the poor kids. He was friendly with the children of Rosemary Clooney
and Jose Ferrer and was a constant presence at their house. After De
Becker's mother died, Clooney invited him to move in.</TE>
<TE>   Shaun Cassidy, a friend for 30 years, says, "Gavin was basically
running Rosemary Clooney's house." He made himself useful. Just old
enough to get a driver's license, he became Clooney's de facto road
manager when she went on tour.</TE>
<TE>   His next job was as a personal assistant to Jeanne Martin, Dean
Martin's ex-wife. That led to a position with Elizabeth Taylor. Just
into his 20s, De Becker traveled with Taylor and Richard Burton
during their tumultuous second marriage. He helped them elude the
paparazzi and paid attention to mail they received from weird fans.
He saw why people with public lives need someone to handle logistics
and the press--to create a zone of privacy and safety. While De
Becker was envisioning a consulting company that would provide
services for public figures, his job suited the emotional needs of
the abused child who was different from most of his classmates.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a kid, I looked at families on television and thought
that was real life, and my life wasn't real. I thought everyone on TV
looked happy, and I wanted to be in their lives. That life was
cleaner. I thought wealth was cleaner. I became, in effect, the guard
at the door," he says. "You couldn't exclude me. I was the guy who
was excluding people."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor and Burton were show-biz royalty in their prime and were
received like heads of state throughout the world. "What I could do
was fake it," he says. "My whole approach was to never act surprised.
The first time I was on a private jet, I acted as if I'd been on one
just two weeks before. I had moxie."</TE>
<TE>   He also had an easy charm and a sense of humor. Today, he says,
most of his close friends are comedians and comic writers, wits like
Carrie Fisher, Bruce Wagner and Ed Begley Jr. They're his audience as
often as he is theirs. "He's the funniest civilian I know," says
Harry Shearer. "He's very bright and disciplined, and he'd probably
be good at whatever he wanted to do. But if you do what he does for a
living, having a light side would be a necessity."</TE>
<TE>   After Taylor and Burton's marriage ended, De Becker came back to
L.A. and began getting referrals. When De Becker was 23, he handled
security for Cassidy, who had become a teen idol. "Back then, the
usual security you could hire were just bouncers," Cassidy says.
"Gavin turned that whole business around and invented it, really. He
ran a protective detail the way the Secret Service would operate."</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, he was meeting with the Secret Service, sharing
information about stalkers who targeted entertainment, corporate and
political leaders. In 1980, De Becker, a Democrat, was made director
of a special services group responsible for the safety of public
figures who attended Ronald Reagan's inaugural. President Reagan then
appointed him to a 21-member presidential advisory board of the
Department of Justice, and he contributed to a federal research
project on mentally ill people who stalk public figures.</TE>
<TE>   Gavin de Becker and Associates, founded in 1978, employs 77 people
and offers protective security, threat assessment and management, as
well as training and educational materials. The majority of his
clients are corporations, government agencies and schools. He won't
name clients, but his work for Theresa Saldana, Madonna, Cher,
Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael J. Fox, Barbra Streisand and John Travolta
has been reported, particularly when stalking cases have been
prosecuted. Faye Wattleton, the head of Planned Parenthood and target
of violent anti-abortionists, turned to him. After Camille and Bill
Cosby's son was murdered in 1997, they hired him to assess threats
they received. Some of the firm's less grisly tasks involve helping
celebrities plan weddings and other family occasions so that they
won't be disturbed by uninvited fans or the press.</TE>
<TE>   The company has assembled an archive of more than 400,000 letters
sent by disturbed, angry and possibly dangerous people to his
clients. In addition to threat letters that can run 100 pages long
when a star becomes the object of a fan's obsession, everything from
body parts to dead animals, hair, skin, fake bombs, razor blades,
caustic chemicals, syringes full of blood or semen and engagement
rings can become bids for attention.</TE>
<TE>   The most controversial element of De Becker's work has been his
development of computer-assisted threat-assessment tools sold to law
enforcement, state and federal agencies, schools and corporations.
Academics and law enforcement professionals have questioned the data
used in the programs and complain that De Becker won't reveal it.</TE>
<TE>   Law-enforcement officers and private security often have differing
opinions about the best way to handle stalkers. The police believe in
the effectiveness of restraining orders and confrontation. De Becker
emphasizes the safety of the client over police intervention. "His
reputation in the law-enforcement community is mixed," says a deputy
district attorney who spoke on condition of anonymity. "In my
opinion, sometimes he doesn't get law enforcement involved in a case
quickly enough."</TE>
<TE>   But even his detractors admit that professional jealousy motivates
many who knock De Becker. He has homes in the San Fernando Valley,
Lake Arrowhead and a retreat on a private island in Fiji. Never
married, he's popular with a loyal group of famous friends and goes
out with glamorous women. Geena Davis is a former girlfriend and
although he was a consultant on "The Bodyguard," the Kevin
Costner-Whitney Houston film that romanticized love in the
private-security business, he says he never has, nor would, date a
client.</TE>
<TE>   He requires employees to sign nondisclosure agreements that
protect the privacy of his clients and prevent his staff from talking
about him, even after they're no longer working for his company. A
former employee who still works in the same field says, "He's a
love-him-or-hate-him guy, and I left after being with him a long time
because I wasn't in love. But I will give him this. Gavin made
targeted violence and domestic violence media issues. If he hadn't
helped bring that to the public's attention, we'd be years behind
where we are now. The Department of Justice is giving research grants
and we're making progress because he helped educate people about it
and he's a terrific marketer."</TE>
<TE>   One of the ideas De Becker would most like to spread is that a
troubled past isn't a predictor of one's future. He is close to many
of the children who live in the Fijian villages near his home and has
mentored others in L.A., through the UCLA School of Public Policy and
Research's mentoring program. "I love telling kids that you are not
the architect of your childhood experience, and that you build your
own life," he says. "I wouldn't want other people to have learned the
way I have, but my experiences have affected everything, in good ways
and bad."</TE>

<LD>You just can't play Red Rover on asphalt.</LD>
<LD>   So when Beckford Elementary principal Isabelle Wiefel was given
the chance to replace four kickball fields on her asphalt playground
with a giant patch of grass, she grabbed it.</LD>
<LD>   "I remember growing up back East, we always had grass," Wiefel
recalled. "We could play games like Red Rover, where someone was
always falling down. And on nice days the teacher would put a blanket
out and we'd have our lessons outside, sitting on the grass,
listening to the birds in the trees. Those are some of my best
memories."</LD>
<TE>   Now her Northridge campus has become one of hundreds of Los
Angeles Unified schools getting playground face lifts that will make
grass and trees part of their students' school memories.</TE>
<TE>   It's a turnabout for the nation's second-largest school district,
known for its cookie-cutter campuses: a sprawling classroom complex,
with a tiny patch of grass out front and a giant blacktop playground,
ringed by a chain-link fence.</TE>
<TE>   And though it's happening quietly, under the radar for most of us,
architects and environmentalists describe it as the most dramatic
public landscaping project the city of Los Angeles has ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   I don't have any proof that grass on a campus helps children
learn. I don't know if test scores will go up at schools that add
grass, flowers and trees. But I remember my first visit to Beckford
10 years ago, and the one question asked by my 5-year-old, who was
about to start kindergarten there.</TE>
<TE>   We had met the teacher, toured the classroom, surveyed the
playground and its equipment. My daughter wasn't impressed by the
picnic tables, jungle gym, sandbox piled high with climbing tires.
Instead, she asked, "Mommy, where's the grass?"</TE>
<TE>   She had come from a preschool that had not only swings and slides,
but acres of grass and trees. She hated to give that up, and so, I
realized, did I. But every suggestion parents made to add campus
greenery was turned away by a district preoccupied with such basics
as keeping classrooms clean and toilets functioning.</TE>
<TE>   So we could hardly believe our eyes last month when my daughters
and I drove by and saw giant green carpets of grass being unfurled on
the schoolyard, and kids lined up to watch, wide-eyed.</TE>
<TE>   Beckford's new field is part of a package of improvements funded
by Proposition BB, the 1997 bond issue that provided $1.2 billion to
upgrade L.A. Unified's aging campuses. Most of the money is going to
improve plumbing, install air-conditioning, paint classrooms and
repair broken fixtures. But each campus also got to choose from a
list of landscape and playground options, and grass was high on most
every list.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Los Angeles district officials have been resistant to
the idea of grass on playgrounds. "Too expensive to maintain,"
principal Gary Domnitz was told when he first inquired about adding a
grassy field to the yard at Loyola Village Elementary in southwest
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason they had blacktop was that it doesn't require mowing,"
Domnitz said. He was told that if the district planted grass, the
campus would have to provide the money or hire gardeners to maintain
it.</TE>
<TE>   But three things happened over the past few years to make the
"greening" of Los Angeles schools a reality: Research now shows that
the addition of grass and trees to a campus can produce energy
benefits that will save the district money. The pot of money to pay
for such additions has grown tremendously, thanks to corporate
efforts and private foundations and the pool of money from
Proposition BB. And there is a growing awareness that the aesthetics
of a school contribute to its efficiency and its value to the
community.</TE>
<TE>   "We're emphasizing the landscape today because we realize that
landscaping is very important," said Bob Timme, professor and dean of
the architecture program at USC. "With the proper landscaping, grass
instead of asphalt, trees shading the south sides of buildings, we
can reduce the long-term costs to run a school. We discovered that
the energy costs of a campus actually are higher than the cost of its
construction, over the life of a school."</TE>
<TE>   Timme heads Los Angeles Unified's Design Advisory Council, which
is helping to oversee an ambitious campaign to construct 85 schools
and expand 75 others over the next five years to accommodate the
district's growing student body. Landscape designs were on the agenda
Friday at a symposium for school architects at the Getty Center.</TE>
<TE>   Landscape concerns are more than a matter of dollars or
environmental issues, Timme said. "The idea of running on asphalt is
so bad for kids' developing bodies. Yes, there's more maintenance
involved with grass. You have to water it, fertilize it, replace it.
But it really adds to the quality of the total school experience."</TE>
<TE>   And Timme said he wouldn't be surprised to learn that greening a
campus does improve its students' achievement. "These things are not
often a straight line," he says. But there is research that shows
that environment affects performance. "The idea that we're going to
stick a tree outside a window and test scores are going to go up ...
well, that might not be that far off."</TE>
<TE>   Domnitz, the principal at Loyola Village, has already seen the
impact his school's green fields have had on attitudes. "People have
told me they enjoy coming to work, the environment is so refreshing.
And the kids are just so excited. They can play soccer now; they
never could before."</TE>
<TE>   The school made $100,000 in landscaping improvements, funded by
the Anne and Kirk Douglas Foundation, which gives grants to schools
for playground improvements; Proposition BB funds; and more than
$25,000 raised by parents and the booster club. There is new
playground equipment, a grass field, flower gardens and trees, and
two 50-foot circles of grass--outdoor classrooms, they call
them--surrounded by curving concrete benches so that children can
meet with their teachers outside, in the shade of trees.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola's students may not realize that their school is saving
energy, helping promote an architectural renaissance and protecting
ecology. They just know they can play soccer at recess, turn
cartwheels after lunch, take their shoes off while their teacher
reads and feel grass beneath their feet. And learn to play a running
game like Red Rover without anybody worrying about skinned knees.</TE>

<LD>I am driving, this day, a 1994 Pontiac Grand Am with a distinctive
pink ball on the rear antenna upon which glitters the word
"Princess." This is not my car. If this were my car, I suspect I
would be writing about an entirely different set of problems this
morning.</LD>
<LD>   No, I am driving this car, my teenage daughter's car, because her
mother's car is in the garage. If her mother's car were not in the
garage, then I would be driving it, because my car is also in the
garage.</LD>
<LD>   We are, as you may suspect, currently trapped in one of those
everything-goes-at-once warps. Some people dismiss these kinds of
streaks as little more than coincidence. Personally, I think such
sustained runs of bad luck are the work of an extraterrestrial dork,
who amuses himself this way.</LD>
<TE>   Granted, this sounds like I'm a roll of aluminum foil away from a
homemade suit that wards off death rays, but is there a more logical
explanation? Consider the evidence. Besides the two cars, here is
what else happened in the span of six days:</TE>
<TE>   The first whiff of trouble was, literally, a whiff. Something
wasn't right with the septic system. In most cases, when something
isn't functioning properly, I try to fix it myself before calling for
help. There are two exceptions to this approach: One is electricity,
because I have come close on more than one occasion to walking "The
Green Mile." The other is the septic system.</TE>
<TE>   Here is what I know about the septic system: The word
"putrefaction" is included in the definition of the word septic. This
is all I want to know.</TE>
<TE>   In the interest of breakfast, let me just say that when the septic
guy looked down into my tank, he whistled. A whistle is never the
reaction you are looking for from any repair guy.</TE>
<TE>   Next up was the computer, which had been sending increasingly
hysterical messages. To be honest, I haven't been comfortable
interacting with computers since seeing "2001: A Space Odyssey."
Eventually the computer refused to do anything but click, which, you
know, was better than its cutting off our air supply or something.</TE>
<TE>   It cost twice as much money to fix the computer as it did to fix
the septic system. You'd think it would be just the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, after one septic, one hard drive and two cars, what else
could possibly go wrong? I probably shouldn't have said that.</TE>

<LD>   The legal watchdogs at the Center for Law in the Public Interest
don't get around to patting themselves on the back too often, but the
roster of causes they've championed could fill a California history
book.</LD>
<LD>   The center celebrated its 30th anniversary Monday night at the
Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel with a tribute to attorney-developer
Nelson Rising, who was instrumental in rounding up the $25,000 seed
money for a quartet of determined young lawyers who wanted to
establish the legal center in 1971. Rising is only the third person
to be honored by the center--the others were producer David E. Kelley
(1997) and late attorney Frank Wheat (1987).</LD>
<TE>   Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher, another of the
center's earliest supporters, introduced Rising. "As a business
leader, Nelson has been a friend of conservation, recognizing the
importance of balancing growth with preservation," said Christopher,
who presented Rising with two paintings--a watercolor depicting
wildlife of the Ballona Wetlands and an oil of a Mojave Desert
scene--that evoke his environmental work.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys Carlyle W. Hall Jr., John Phillips, Brent Rushforth and
the late Ric Sutherland founded the center, which is credited with
creating the idea of "environmental justice." Its first case was
representing the Sierra Club and the NAACP to stop construction of
the Century Freeway through South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   That case was followed by others that laid the groundwork for
California's environmental land-use law. Subsequent targets included
job discrimination, identity theft, preservation of the historic
Watts Towers and, in collaboration with Rising, preservation of the
Ballona Wetlands. More recently, the center helped in the effort to
preserve the Chinatown Cornfield, which will become an urban public
park.</TE>
<TE>   "We've come a long way from that basement office at Wilshire and
Crenshaw," said Hall, in lauding Rising. "And we couldn't have done
it without him."</TE>
<TE>   Warren Olney emceed the event, which raised more than $350,000.
California State Librarian Kevin Starr was the featured speaker. "The
roll call of the CLIPI cases fits into a legacy that represents a
better idea by California of itself," said Starr. "They're the
significant building blocks of a better California."</TE>
<TE>   Guests included John Tunney, Robert Garcia, Lydia Camarillo, Judge
Matt Byrne, Gerald Chaleff, Ruth and Lew Hollman, Mickey Kantor and
Heidi Schulman, Connie Rice, Ron Olson, Max Palevsky, Victor
Palmieri, Nikolas Patsaouras, Ira Reiner, Alan Sieroty, Nancy Wheat,
Andrea Ordin, Jack Weiss, Mel Levine, Mary Nichols and John Daum.</TE>

<TE>   L.A. Phil Overseers</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes they must amaze even themselves. John Williams and Yo-Yo
Ma, together last weekend for a whirlwind celebration to mark
Williams' 70th birthday, started their Saturday with a full rehearsal
at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for Sunday's sold-out celebratory
concert with the L.A. Philharmonic. Then, in the afternoon, they
headed out to a Costco in Culver City where more than a thousand fans
were waiting.</TE>
<TE>   It was close to sundown before the duo was rolling again--this
time for a segue to black tie and a swank soiree at the Beverly Hills
Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   There, Curt Tamkin, chairman of the newly formed L.A. Philharmonic
Board of Overseers, and his wife, Priscilla, and John Hotchkis, L.A.
Philharmonic board president, and his wife, Joan, were waiting to
greet guests at the inaugural event for the Overseers. The pre-dinner
program included a chat session with Williams and Ma conducted by
L.A. Phil's executive director, Deborah Borda, and a mini-concert by
Ma of Williams' "Pickin'" and a gigue by Bach.</TE>
<TE>   "What's amazing about John," said Ma, "is that his work is
appreciated by the masses, yet he can transport us to another world.
When Americans think of their country and the emotional experiences
they've had, so often it's connected to the music John has written."</TE>
<TE>   Following the program, Tamkin led the way to dinner, where
members, who must commit $10,000 annually to join this cadre, dined
on designer greens, rack of lamb, Chilean sea bass and a chocolate
pyramid for dessert, and then two-stepped the night away to Fred
Starr's Louisiana Repertory Jazz Ensemble. Spotted in the crowd:
Ernest Fleischmann, Pat Mitchell, Laurel and Eric Bernt, Felice and
Richard Cutler, Laura and Bill Siart, Alyce and Spud Williamson,
Margie and David Barry and Ceci and Dudley Rauch.</TE>
<TE>   Tamkin reports that $600,000 has been raised since the group's
inception in January.</TE>

<TE>   Horse Play</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating the Year of the Horse and a decade of showcasing the
talent of young musicians, members of the Chinese-American League of
the Pacific Symphony gathered for a benefit gala last weekend. About
250 guests enjoyed a dinner of filet mignon and tiger shrimp at the
Westin South Coast Plaza Hotel in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment was provided by violinist Melody Chang, cellist Fang
Fang Xu and pianist Ethan Yi Dong, past winners of Showcase for Young
Musicians, an annual musical competition sponsored by the league at
the Irvine Barclay Theatre. Winners receive honorariums and are
invited to perform with the Pacific Symphony under the baton of music
director Carl St. Clair.</TE>
<TE>   Orchestra president John Forsyte praised league members and their
guests for supporting aspiring musicians.</TE>
<TE>   "You are great patrons who champion the careers of young people,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the league was founded in 1992, more than 500 musicians have
competed in the showcase. "The competitions bring attention to the
talent of these students, and the winners are grateful for the chance
to perform with an orchestra," said arts benefactor Arlene Cheng of
Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The Feb. 23 gala raised $20,000. Guests included co-chairwomen
Betty Tu and Elena Ross, Assemblywoman Judy Chu, Michael Eng, Ruby
Au, Verna Chow, Ellen Ong, Charles Wu and Caleb Zia.</TE>

at the Captain's Ball celebrating the 60th anniversary of the United
Services Organization. The event raised about $90,000 for South
County Senior Services in Laguna Woods.</TE>
<TE>   More than 400 guests--including noncommissioned military personnel
in full uniform--attended the gala at the Laguna Cliffs Marriott in
Dana Point. Decorations included a large American flag and a 20-foot
replica of the Statue of Liberty. Recognized at the Feb. 16 event for
their support of programs for seniors were Clarice and Richard Lehn,
Mike and Kitty Kourie, Robert Feldman, Jack Sylvester and Mary Van
Ness. Jacque DuPont and Linda Lewin were co-chairwomen.</TE>

<LD>In the winter of 1925, many people in the town of Nome, Alaska,
became sick with a terrible disease called diphtheria. The medicine
needed to save them was hundreds of miles away in Anchorage. The time
of year made it too risky to send medicine to Nome by plane, so dogs
were hooked up to sleds and sent racing across the frozen wilderness
in a 674-mile relay. The teams of dogs and the sled drivers delivered
the medicine in six days. The dogs were heroes, and the people of
Nome were saved. Many years later a race was organized to honor the
brave dogs.</LD>
<LD>   The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race follows an old supply route
through Alaska for 1,150 miles. The race is so difficult that it is a
great accomplishment just to finish it. Each team is made up of one
person who drives the sled, called a musher, and 12 to 16 dogs,
usually huskies. The dogs are conditioned, trained and well cared
for. Special booties are made for their paws to protect them from the
ice and cold during the race. They are sometimes given special meals
of seal blubber. They often sleep in scattered hay that has been
placed for them in the snow.</LD>
<TE>   A musher drives each team from a standing position on the sled and
yells directions to one or two lead dogs at the head of the pack.
Mushers have rules to follow during the race. They must stop at
checkpoints to rest and feed their dogs. They must carry a sleeping
bag and safety gear with them. Mushers always look out for each
other. Blizzards, strong winds, icy trails and melting ice present
dangers. But one of the biggest dangers comes from moose. A hungry or
tired moose might attack a dog sled team. Mushers will do anything to
stay out of their way.</TE>
<TE>   There are 64 teams competing in the Iditarod this year. It takes
about 10 to 20 days for the mushers and their dogs to cross the
finish line. It is an exciting time for the people who live in
Alaska. Many of them volunteer to help with what is known as "The
Last Great Race."</TE>
<TE>   Author's note: The Iditarod was scheduled to start last week. To
follow the progress of the mushers and for more information, visit

<HD>Marathon Creates a Garment District</HD>
<DH>The opportunistic often gather runners' roadside castoffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking for a smelly sweatshirt? How about a wet hat or dirty gloves?
There will be plenty of castaway clothes to choose from during
today's L.A. Marathon, the city's best-kept secret for free
secondhand running gear.</LD>
<LD>   T-shirts, sweatpants, windbreakers--you name it. If a runner wears
it, you can probably find it somewhere in the wake of the marathon's
23,000 participants. While some racers arrange for friends or family
to find what they've tossed aside, others sense the futility of such
an endeavor, and that leaves the rest up for grabs.</LD>
<LD>   "After the pack of runners leaves, the street is just one solid
mass of clothing, plastic bags, shoes, sweaters, socks, hats.
Anything you can imagine is apt to be found there," said Brenda
Ramsey, the marathon's start line coordinator for the past 12 years.
She estimates that each runner leaves at least one article of
clothing at the starting line downtown.</LD>
<TE>   The L.A. Marathon has cleanup trucks and sweepers to whisk away
whatever detritus is left over from its runners, but it does not have
a formal program for donating the clothing to charity, which some
other cities do. After the Boston Marathon, which has about 15,000
participants, volunteers pick up and donate about three tons of
clothing. The New York City Marathon collects more than double that
amount.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the [starter] gun will go off and you'll see clothes
flying up into the air," said Hal Higdon, a senior writer for
Runner's World magazine and host of a marathon training Web site.
Higdon, who lives in Indiana, ran seven marathons in seven months
last year to celebrate his 70th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Like most marathon trainers, he advises dressing in layers and
wearing something on the outside that you don't care to ever see
again. "Everybody's got an ugly sweatshirt," he said, "something you
might give to a relative who was chilly at the beach but never bother
to get back."</TE>
<TE>   Ed Cogert, 69, has one and is prepared to let it fly, along with a
pair of gloves, when he runs his ninth marathon today. "I've had it
for years," he said. "You get kind of tired of it, you know? I'll
just use it till I don't need it anymore.... Hopefully it will get to
somebody that needs it."</TE>
<TE>   Layers are necessary because temperatures can vary up to 20
degrees from the time runners bound across the starting line in the
morning until they take their last exhausted step over the finish
line in the afternoon. Today's weather forecast calls for a low of 50
and a high of 71. The starting temperature for last year's L.A.
Marathon was 54 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Inexperienced marathoners have a tendency to dress for the
starting temperature, accounting for neither the changes in their
body temperature nor the weather.</TE>
<TE>   "That can get them into trouble," said Pat Connelly, coach of the
L.A. Roadrunners, the L.A. Marathon's official training group. "When
the sun gets brighter and hotter, they find themselves with too
much."</TE>
<TE>   That makes for a strange striptease, one that usually takes place
during the first three miles as the runners warm up and strip down,
throwing unwanted layers "to the curb or up in the trees or in the
bushes," said L.A. Marathon president Bill Burke.</TE>
<TE>   Burke has been aware of the throwaway clothes phenomenon for about
15 years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know for a fact that there are those who know when the event
is, know the route of the event and garner wardrobe from both the
start line and along the first couple miles."</TE>
<TE>   Who are these scavengers, these people watching the runners not
for the race but to pick up what they leave behind? The homeless,
mostly, or those working on their behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "There's really some nice clothing. You'd be surprised," said
Connelly, who suggests a more financially viable, if less
ecologically sound, alternative as a warmup garment: a garbage bag.
That was the clothing choice of many runners during the 2000 L.A.
Marathon, which took place in a torrential downpour, but it is also
good for the cold.</TE>
<TE>   "It keeps your body warmth inside, and it's something you can toss
away," Connelly said.</TE>
<TE>   And it solves another problem--of people casting aside their tops
with their race numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how many times I've stood on the finish line
[asking] my runners, 'Where is your number?' [and heard] 'I think
it's back on King Boulevard or Vermont.'"</TE>

<AU>M. DELAL BAER</AU>
<BD>M. Delal Baer, chairman of the Mexico Project at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, participated in the
"Partnership for Prosperity" meetings as a member of the agricultural
policy working group.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Last week, a brain trust drawn from the public and private sectors
sat down to address poverty in Mexico and its inevitable
consequence--immigration. The effort, launched by President Bush and
Mexican President Vicente Fox on Sept. 6, 2001, was dubbed the
"Partnership for Prosperity," and its mandate is to make
recommendations on what can be done to accelerate the flow of private
investment to Mexico's poorest regions. Although the project hasn't
received nearly as much attention as the continuing bilateral
negotiations on immigration, it is every bit as important and is
likely to be the center of attention when Bush visits Mexico later
this month.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans in the United States and free-market politicians
throughout Latin America often have been defensive about social
policy, relying on the worn but true notion that responsible economic
management, investment- friendly policies and growth create a rising
tide that lifts all boats. But with populist passions on the rise
throughout Latin America, and with the market reforms of the 1990s
under attack there, more is needed in the way of social policy. The
U.S.-Mexico "Partnership for Prosperity" could satisfy that need.</LD>
<TE>   Rather than focusing exclusively on government spending to
alleviate inequality, the partnership builds on the market-based
economic reforms that Mexico has implemented, on the NAFTA paradigm
and on the commitment of both countries to free-enterprise solutions.
Rarely have two governments tried to formulate social policy on the
basis of the recommendations of a private-public partnership, and
never has there been so explicit an attempt to harness the engine of
private capital to explicit social goals.</TE>
<TE>   Putting some of his eggs in the partnership basket is a wise move
by Fox and his economic advisor and coordinator of the economic
Cabinet, Eduardo Sojo. The United States, with its deep philosophical
roots in private initiative and small government, is unlikely ever to
go down the European Union's path of large, government development
funds. Support for large foreign-aid programs in the U.S. Congress
dried up long ago, but there is no better way to appeal to U.S.
cultural proclivities than to appeal to American entrepreneurial
spirit. By this logic, socially conscious business and trade
promotion should be the centerpiece of U.S.-Mexico relations.</TE>
<TE>   The partnership also is the logical counterpart to any impending
liberalization of immigration policy. It will be hard enough for a
well-meaning Bush to generate congressional consensus on a limited
liberalization of immigration policy in advance of the midterm
elections. Trying to do so without putting in place an assertive
economic-development strategy in Mexico would put the cart before the
horse, opening the U.S. to the prospect of indefinitely absorbing
Mexico's surplus labor at a time when jobs are being lost in the U.S.
economy. Whether or not one supports the large-scale regularization
of immigrants in the U.S., ultimately it is a palliative, not a
curative approach. The only real answer to migration is one that
provides economic opportunities for Mexicans in Mexico. Americans are
much more likely to find their comfort zone with a liberalized
migration policy if they know that Washington and Mexico City are
doing all they can to target the migrant-sending regions of Mexico
with private capital.</TE>
<TE>   The businessmen, scholars and government officials of the
partnership have been working on the financing of housing,
telecommunications, remittances, infrastructure and agriculture.
Linking social development to cyber market integration,
people-to-people initiatives, integrated financial instruments and
mortgage programs is under consideration. Moreover, the partnership
is likely to hold its own feet to the fire by building into the
effort some means of measuring its success or failure in meeting
defined goals. There is a degree of results-oriented practicality and
accountability in the initiative that is rarely a trait of government
policies, but that is perfectly suited to two presidents with a
background in business.</TE>
<TE>   Rural development is one area where the private-sector motif of
the "Partnership for Prosperity" is especially compelling.
Agriculture receives less than 1% of the total direct foreign
investment in Mexico. Yet, 25 million Mexicans, or about 25% of the
population, live off the land, and they constitute around two-thirds
of the very poor. Increasing foreign direct investment in Mexican
agriculture by only 2% or 3% would make a big difference in
productivity, incomes and employment.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has ever seen the scraggly corn patches and
frighteningly lean campesinos of the parched mountains in the state
of Guerrero knows that it makes sense to introduce radical measures
to stimulate investment. Why not simply declare Mexico's most
desperately poor rural areas to be "rural enterprise zones" and make
them tax-free to investors, domestic or foreign, willing to develop
rural infrastructure, commit capital and work with peasant
organizations to transfer out of corn production and into
higher-value-added products? Why not match poor farmers with local
and international marketers, retailers and processors in mutually
advantageous arrangements?</TE>
<TE>   Let market demand for products aid the Mexican farmer's shift out
of corn and beans, rather than sending in aid workers with
government-funded projects for products that may have no market.
Government can play a role in getting a few pilot, private-sector
matches started, helping to guarantee sanitary standards, creating
cooperative extension services and providing credit guarantees for
viable projects.</TE>
<TE>   The "Partnership for Prosperity" is, in sum, the next step beyond
trade. It is a model that could work not only for Mexico but for the
hemisphere at large, especially should Bush's dream of a Free Trade
Agreement for the Americas become a reality. Keep your eyes on this
one if you want to see where the most immediate progress in
U.S.-Mexican relations will be made.</TE>

<HD>Society Will Pay the Price of Cutbacks</HD>

<AU>NEAL HALFON and PETER V. LONG</AU>
<BD>Neal Halfon is director of the UCLA Center for
Healthier Children, Families and Communities, and professor of
pediatrics and public health. Peter V. Long is a doctoral candidate
at the UCLA School of Public Health.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the roller coaster that is U.S. health care policy, things started
looking up in 1997. That year, Congress approved the children's
health insurance programs (CHIP) to provide health insurance to the
children of the working poor. Since then, 4.6 million uninsured
children have been enrolled in the program. But now the downward
plunge has begun. As a front-page story in The Times documented last
week, many states, including California, are cutting back on the
program or curtailing expansion. Some states have established new
eligibility limits and erected barriers to enrollment. In California,
Gov. Gray Davis has proposed a delay in expanding the program, known
here as Healthy Families, to parents of children in the program until
July 2003.</LD>
<LD>   As states reduce benefits, the number of uninsured children will
rise across the country. As a consequence, sick children will likely
get sicker; children who do not receive preventive care and
developmental assessments will develop preventable physical and
mental problems that may impede their ability to learn.</LD>
<TE>   But these are not the biggest problems with cutting back on
Healthy Families: We now know that what happens in childhood--even in
utero--has a major impact on physical and mental health conditions
that develop at age 50 or 60. If we're not doing everything we can to
insure the health and development of infants and children, we will
unquestionably pay the price later.</TE>
<TE>   For many years, the prevailing view guiding American health policy
and research has been a paradigm of "cumulative risk." This view
holds that the cumulative influence of poor diet, lack of exercise,
stress, smoking and other vices increases the risk for common,
debilitating conditions like heart disease. This is of course true,
but we now know it is only part of the story. Over the past ten
years, epidemiologic studies from around the world have demonstrated
that experiences in early life and in utero can have lifelong impacts
on the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, hypertension,
asthma, cancer and many other conditions.</TE>
<TE>   We've learned, for example, that babies who were malnourished in
the womb or who don't gain enough weight in the first year of life
have higher rates of heart disease when they are 60, even when other
known risk factors are controlled for. Since an infant's genetically
determined operating system is programmed by its early conditions and
experiences, this relative deprivation sets in motion certain
physiologic processes. A baby getting too little nutrition, say,
develops an altered metabolism to maximize the benefit from the
cholesterol in its diet. Unfortunately for future health, these
metabolic patterns are not necessarily easy to change. If one's
cholesterol metabolism has been "up-regulated" early in life due to
relative malnutrition, it will continue to metabolize cholesterol in
the same way even if the child's diet changes dramatically. And in a
world of abundant cheeseburgers and potato chips, that can spell
heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Similar links between conditions in early life and health
conditions in later life have been established for diabetes,
hypertension and asthma, as well as for the onset of puberty and
menopause. This growing body of research on the early-life precursors
of adult medical conditions is complementary to an increasing body of
research about the importance of the early years for brain
development. The evidence clearly suggests that there are critical
and sensitive periods in early life that influence lifelong physical
and mental health. Which brings us back to CHIP.</TE>
<TE>   When Congress approved the program in 1997, it represented the
first major federal focus on children's health since the Medicaid
program (known as Medi-Cal in California) was launched more than 30
years earlier. It also reflected a whole new approach to children's
health policy, in that it created a mechanism at the state level to
move large numbers of uninsured children into mainstream managed
care, with its performance standards, accountability systems and
quality improvement mechanisms. It raised the hope that every child
in every state could be insured, and in doing that raised hopes that
the primary public health thrust for children could shift from merely
getting them insured to promoting optimum health and development.</TE>
<TE>   Since Healthy Families came to California, child advocates have
used it as a platform for launching ambitious early child development
and school readiness programs. The state legislature is creating a
new master plan for education. But such initiatives can provide full
benefits to children only if those children already have access to
the medical, mental health, dental and developmental services
required for school success and lifelong learning.</TE>
<TE>   A recession, an energy crisis, and Sept. 11 have all hit
California hard. And in times of shrinking revenues it is generally
accepted that the last thing funded is the first thing de-funded. But
this principle is not acceptable for children's health. Retreating
from Healthy Families would undermine the state's future, both by
keeping children from reaching their potential and by insuring
greater future health care costs.</TE>
<TE>   Congress was quick to jump on Enron's collapse, holding hearings
that allowed every committee member to grab the microphone and decry
the scandal. But cutbacks to children's health are no less
scandalous. Like that undernourished infant whose propensity for
heart disease will likely go undetected for decades, the consequences
of cutting back on children's health care may not be immediately
apparent. In the end, though, society will bear the costs.</TE>

<HD>Generations of Violence</HD>
<DH>The politics shift and the enemy changes, but Colombia's
war just drags on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>Sandra Hernandez is a freelance journalist living in
Colombia.</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA</DL>
<LD>In Colombia, there are no new wars, just brief pauses followed by
resumptions of violence.</LD>
<LD>   War officially resumed here on Feb. 20, just after 9:30 p.m., when
Colombia's president proclaimed the death of peace talks between the
government and the country's largest rebel group. By 11:32 that
night, I could see the first signs of war from the window of my
apartment: tanks rolling down the Avenida Septima, Bogota's
equivalent of Wilshire Boulevard. The rumbling sound of metal
replaced the usual cacophony of buses, cars and street life.</LD>
<LD>   Soldiers and military police were already a part of life here.
They inspected bags and purses at bus stations, stood guard at
bridges and overpasses and patrolled street corners. Violence, too,
was a fact of life. One night late last fall, I arrived at a party
where the guests were abuzz. Just before my arrival, the building's
night watchman had rushed into the apartment of the party's hostess
and started shooting from her window at a suspicious looking man who
had just stolen a gun from him. The guests dropped to the floor until
the shooting ended, then resumed their conversations.</LD>
<TE>   But until last week, the danger and the military presence were
part of the background. The culture had learned to live with a
constant, low-level hum of violence. Now the volume of the conflict
is once again a piercing cry.</TE>
<TE>   As I sat and watched the tanks and then the truckloads of soldiers
pass on the street below early on the morning of Feb. 21, I thought
of my father. Fifty years earlier he watched as the very street I was
looking at became a battleground. The violence that time around
flared up after a charismatic political leader was killed outside his
office in downtown Bogota. His murder plunged the country into a
bloody war between conservatives and liberals that later became known
simply as La Violencia. Some 200,000 died and many of those who
remained behind became actors in the wars to come.</TE>
<TE>   My father, a young soldier then, was sent out to patrol the
streets of Bogota. He watched as the Septima was set ablaze, as
looters broke into shops, as snipers fired down from atop the city's
national cathedral. Colombia was in chaos.</TE>
<TE>   The brother of my father's close friend was beaten and shot to
death, his body dragged through the streets of his hometown. Already
disillusioned with the government, my father's friend was spurred by
the incident to leave the army and head to the southern part of the
country to help form one of the Colombia's first guerrilla movements.</TE>
<TE>   My father stuck it out for more than a decade of continuing
violence, but eventually he decided to move his family to the United
States. His reason was simple: the United States had opportunities.
Now that I'm living in Colombia myself I understand that what he
really meant is that Colombia does not. Nothing changes here. In the
three decades since he left, the violence he saw as a young soldier
has continued to flare up and die down.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, the government declared war on cocaine kingpin Pablo
Escobar and the narco-trafficantes of Medellin, a war that spurred
new violence throughout the country. Overlaid on the drug wars was
violence from the now-defunct Marxist M-19 guerrilla movement, which
staged a daring attack on Colombia's Justice Palace in November 1985
that left the courthouse littered with the bodies of 11 Supreme Court
justices and 84 others who died in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   These days the war is against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, the country's largest rebel group. In November
1998, the government granted the rebels a chunk of land the size of
Switzerland and peace talks began. Now, after more than three years
of negotiations that tamped down the violence but were otherwise
unproductive, the country is back at war.</TE>
<TE>   In the cities, residents worry about bombs placed in shopping
centers and office buildings. Rumors of poisoned water reservoirs
abound. And it's hard to know what to believe. One day the newspapers
dismiss the stories; the next they report that irregular substances
have been found in the water supply. Doctors and nurses are being
trained to deal with attacks on their hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   But Colombians have learned to live with fear, or so I am told. A
taxi driver recently spoke of the benefits of living with a long war.
You learn to cope with uncertainty, he maintained. Still, he added,
"I tell my family to avoid going to the mall if they can."</TE>
<TE>   In the countryside, campesinos are afraid the violence that has
already pushed thousands of them to abandon their farms will
intensify. The cities are bursting with displaced families; some beg
on the streets, other stay in the shantytowns that have popped up on
the outskirts. Most eat little more than a small plate of food a day.</TE>
<TE>   And in the former demilitarized zone that was given to the FARC in
1998 and now is the target of a bombing campaign, people are afraid.
Last weekend I traveled to San Vicente del Caguan, once the
headquarters of the rebels. Residents there had just one question for
President Andres Pastrana when he arrived to announce that their
region was once again part of Colombia: How would he protect them?</TE>
<TE>   A poor hamlet tucked into the jungle, San Vicente's residents
watched three years ago when the rebels came through to build their
camps. Recently, they watched the same rebels hastily moving out in
their four-wheel drive SUVs. When I visited, residents had spent the
past two nights without electricity, listening as bombs fell in the
distance. They had watched as hundreds of soldiers arrived to see
what the rebels had left behind. The soldiers were followed by dozens
of reporters. Pastrana's announcement was met with little applause.
Villagers were less concerned with whether they were part of Colombia
or not than with what they would face in the days to come.</TE>
<TE>   "No one ever asked us if we wanted to live in the zone. We just
woke up and suddenly we were living in the safe haven," one woman
told me, as she watched Pastrana arrive in San Vicente del Caguan
surrounded by Black Hawk helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   She described sleepless nights spent in darkness recently because
the electricity had been cut off. Her daughters stood close to her
and stared at the sea of reporters and soldiers. The soldiers were
here now, but she feared that violence would break out as soon as
they moved on. Paramilitary groups were rumored to be nearby and
rebels were nearby too.</TE>
<TE>   I watched the young girls by their mother's side and realized that
they will be the next generation to learn the lexicon of war. Unlike
my family, which left, those who remain have few choices. The war
will deal them their hands. They will become rebels or soldiers. They
will bury their dead and grieve. They will flee to the shantytowns or
silently suffer. They will write the next chapter in Colombia's
seemingly eternal war.</TE>

<HD>Can Reorganization Tame the MTA Beast?</HD>
<DH>Large transit agencies tend to perform less efficiently
than their smaller counterparts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN E. D. RICHMOND</AU>
<BD>Jonathan E. D. Richmond, a Boston-based consultant on
transit operations and organizational change, proposed dividing the
MTA into MTA-owned regional operating companies in his book "The
Private Provision of Public Transport."</BD>
<DL>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</DL>
<LD>L.A.'s Metropolitan Transit Authority management has come up with a
potentially revolutionary proposal to transform the agency's poorly
performing bus services. According to the plan, bus-service
operations would be divided into five geographic semiautonomous
"sectors." Small-scale sector operations could lead to local control,
better bus service and lower costs.</LD>
<LD>   That was the promise of transportation zones, too, a previous MTA
idea that languished for reasons of politics and indecision. Under
the zone concept, service would have been entirely removed from the
MTA and transferred to local zone operations, typically privately
run, under the aegis of local operating authorities. With sectors,
service is transferred from central to local management, but is
operated by organizations that still are part of the MTA. Both
scenarios provide for a degree of local political control. In the
case of the zones, however, local officials have complete control of
operations; with sectors, the nature of local input will be
determined by the MTA board.</LD>
<TE>   But the MTA management's initial presentation of its sector idea
is, unfortunately, inadequate. The MTA's board only recently received
an outline of the plan and was not involved in its conceptualization.
That should be a warning. The bureaucratic confusion and political
strife that followed previous attempts to rebuild L.A.'s
transportation institutions could continue to haunt the MTA unless it
accepts disciplined analysis, planning and consultation, as well as
the establishment of systems to measure performance.</TE>
<TE>   The now faltering zone idea was based on the perceived success of
Foothill Transit. Privately managed Foothill Transit--operations are
contracted out on a competitive basis--has undeniably revitalized bus
service in the San Gabriel Valley. Ridership has increased and costs
have dropped. But low costs have come at the price of substandard
wages and poor benefits, as unions feared, and organized labor has
proved a formidable opponent to the establishment of new or expanded
zones.</TE>
<TE>   The fight over whether to keep bus operations in the MTA's public
hands or transfer them to private management has overshadowed the
many achievements of small independent municipal operators in Los
Angeles County. It turns out, however, that efficiency depends not on
privatization but on the quality of management--whether public or
private--and on the scale and structure of operations. Across the
United States, large transit organizations tend to perform less
efficiently than their smaller counterparts, at least partly because
their size distances them from both their workers and customers. The
MTA's bureaucracy is particularly dysfunctional. For example,
divisional managers who oversee bus maintenance and delivery of
service have been hampered in improving productivity because the MTA
bureaucracy downtown doesn't supply them with information on how much
their operations cost.</TE>
<TE>   Small public operators, such as Santa Monica's Big Blue Bus,
perform much better than the MTA, with costs comparable to those at
Foothill. Santa Monica shares Foothill's reputation for high quality
service and community responsiveness, but its wages and benefits are
similar to those at the MTA, and much higher than those offered by
Foothill. Add a management that regards labor as a valued resource
and the personal scale possible at a small operation like Santa
Monica's--and it is not surprising that labor relations there are
good, while the unions are bitter about every aspect of Foothill's
existence.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking up the MTA's bus service into five sectors thus offers
great promise. But to be effective, the new units should be
autonomous, accountable and locally responsive. Unfortunately, MTA
management may have violated that standard already, by hiring three
sector general managers, without soliciting local input. The boards
governing the sectors could be either advisory or have real power,
according to options that management has presented to the MTA board.
But unless the agency forms wholly owned MTA operating companies,
each with a separate and locally accountable board empowered to
direct management and monitor performance, the concept is unlikely to
work.</TE>
<TE>   It is disturbing that MTA management has already drafted budgets
for each of the sectors based on current costs for serving their
respective territories. Not only should regional disparities and
goals be considered in setting new budgets, but budgeting should be
flexible enough to reflect changing local needs. As important,
budgets should encourage creativity and efficiency by incorporating
rewards and penalties. Cost reductions could be rewarded by using the
savings to pay for new and improved local services. Penalties could
be assessed, a common and effective practice in the private sector,
for poor on-time performance or the presence of graffiti. Sector
managers should themselves be on performance-based contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Sector managers should be free to innovate to improve service and
reduce costs, but this would require union cooperation. The United
Transportation Union has, however, stated it will enforce all aspects
of its contract with the MTA. Goldy Norton, a consultant to the
union, says the MTA "can hire any way it wants to but where [the
workers] will work will depend on seniority in the contract." The
union contract means that someone living in the San Fernando Valley
could be hired there but assigned to the South Bay, defeating the
advantages of local identity and community made possible when
management hires locally.</TE>
<TE>   The transit unions have been instrumental in retaining outdated
and inefficient practices. On the other hand, MTA management has
provided little reason for the unions to trust it. To undo this
history, it should make implementation of the sector proposal a
win-win situation, demanding concessions on productivity in return
for avoiding the imposition of low wages for new local services.
Management should also show its willingness to develop friendly and
supportive local work units if the unions agree to cooperate.
Regrettably, this key element, which in itself requires substantial
organizational change, is not even mentioned in the sector proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Of greater concern is that MTA management would apparently
transfer some managerial staff and duties to the five sectors but not
as part of an overall restructuring effort to streamline the MTA
central bureaucracy. The whole point of small transit organizations
is that they typically perform their entire work with lean and
tightly integrated staffs. But management's proposed organizational
chart indicates that many central-support functions would be
retained, which promise unnecessary bureaucratic complexity and
duplication of management services. It is unlikely any money would be
saved this way.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the central MTA should morph into a relatively small
umbrella organization, restricting itself to coordination, oversight
and performance review of the subsidiary operating companies
operations, as well as non-transit and regional responsibilities that
cannot be delegated locally.</TE>
<TE>   As part of previous discussions on transportation-zone formation,
MTA management leaders said they could shed relatively little
staffing even though it was abandoning transit services to the zone.
It is unlikely they will be any more prepared to give up their own
empires in the development of sectors. The MTA board should consider
hiring a management consulting firm experienced in corporate
restructuring to assess the redesign of the entire MTA as the only
way to reform the current bureaucratic mentality and bring focus and
efficiency to the new organizational elements.</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake about it. The sector idea has much to offer, and
MTA management is to be commended for putting it on the table. But at
this stage of development, MTA management's plans do not form an
adequate blueprint for effective organizational development. If the
MTA board is to make this sector concept work, it must force itself,
along with MTA management, to confront wholesale organizational
reform in order to streamline overall efficiency and provide control
at the new local units. It must build in structural elements that
provide incentives to develop high-quality, low-cost local services.
And it must open itself to a new start with labor, one capable of
overcoming the old adversities and building on the positive labor
relations often achieved in smaller transit operations. Perhaps
hardest of all, the MTA board must show it has the discipline to
divest itself of direct operational powers and let the new local
boards do their jobs effectively.</TE>

<HD>Latin America Is Unsettled By Washington's Rhetoric</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SHIFTER</AU>
<BD>Michael Shifter is vice president for policy at the
Inter-American Dialogue and teaches Latin American politics at
Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Is the war in Colombia a matter of drugs and politics? Or is the
Colombian government facing a concerted attack from terrorists? These
are questions being asked in Washington. And the fact that they are
even being discussed here is making many Latin Americans once again
nervous about U.S. intentions.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the United States does in Colombia, the hemisphere's most
troubled country, will unquestionably affect its neighbors, who worry
that, as in the past, Washington will act unilaterally in pursuit of
its own interest without regard to the region's concerns.</LD>
<LD>   Colombia was already the largest recipient of U.S. security aid
outside the Middle East. Now the U.S. State Department has included
three Colombian groups on its list of 28 terrorist organizations,
opening the door to Washington stepping up its involvement in
Colombia as part of its global campaign against terrorism. Colombia's
problems are complex and nuanced, not reducible to a simple military
initiative to defeat the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia
(FARC), the country's largest insurgency. Not surprisingly, other
governments in the region, already uneasy about the risks of greater
"spillover unrest" from Colombia and worried about their own fragile
security situations, are tracking Washington's policy review with
keen interest.</LD>
<TE>   The signals have been mixed. Some in the administration have
explicitly pushed to expand operations in Colombia as part of the war
on terrorism. Last Wednesday, President Bush, sensing some
congressional misgivings, seemed to pull back from a significant
policy shift. For the time being at least, he put aside proposals to
eliminate the official distinction between aid to fight drugs and aid
to fight guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are unmistakable indications that the administration
is determined to test the limits of the current policy, which has
been narrowly focused on counter-narcotics operations. The
president's 2003 budget proposal, for example, contains a request for
$98 million to provide the Colombians with training and helicopters
to protect a strategically important oil pipeline that has often been
the target of rebel attacks. The administration has also plainly
sought to pave the way for greater sharing of U.S. intelligence with
the Colombian military. And on Tuesday, before Bush's comments, drug
czar John Walters suggested that legal restrictions on the use of
anti-drug assistance be reconsidered.</TE>
<TE>   Such signals, coupled with reports of the United States moving
ahead with military operations in the Philippines, the former Soviet
republic of Georgia and now Yemen have fueled nervous speculation
about what Washington might have in mind for Colombia. The
trepidation in Latin America is reminiscent of the region's strong
reaction to the $1.3 billion U.S. contribution to Plan Colombia, the
largely military anti-drug package passed in July 2000. Although most
Latin Americans would welcome greater U.S. engagement with the
region, they would prefer an approach aimed at enhancing political
and economic ties. The focus on a military role--whether to fight
terrorists in Colombia or drugs in the wider region--carries echoes
of the Cold War, when a country's underlying problems and development
aims were considered subordinate to immediate U.S. strategic
interests. In a region where memories of excessive U.S. military
intervention are still fresh, the resurfacing of the term
"counterinsurgency" in the U.S. Colombia policy debate is cause for
concern.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the U.S. role, the region's security situation is
complicated not only by the remarkable cruelty of Colombia's
conflict--dramatized most recently by the kidnapping of presidential
candidate Ingrid Betancourt--but by a growing and generalized sense
of insecurity, uncertainty and tension in adjacent countries. To
varying degrees, Colombia's neighbors must cope not only with their
own economic and political issues, but with spreading criminality and
violence, an expanding drug trade and a growing number of refugees
fleeing across borders.</TE>
<TE>   Existing strains between countries have intensified. In Venezuela,
wild-card President Hugo Chavez, while expressing support for
Pastrana's decision to end peace talks, also made clear his sympathy
for the rebels, which has caused further tensions between the two
countries at a time when Venezuela already has plenty of domestic
problems on its plate. In the past two weeks, four military officials
there have called for the resignation of Chavez, a former paratrooper
who, a decade ago, led an unsuccessful coup against an elected
government.</TE>
<TE>   No country is more vulnerable to the "spillover" effects of the
widening Colombian conflict than Ecuador. Although the pervasive
violence and vast numbers of refugees predicted by some observers as
inevitable consequences of Plan Colombia have not materialized,
Colombians fleeing the conflict are moving across the porous border
between the two countries. Disturbingly, Ecuador for the first time
is starting to produce coca, no doubt the result of the displacement
of coca production in Colombia. The development of the drug trade
could well aggravate an already serious security problem and provide
an incentive for Ecuador to expand its military, which has long
enjoyed disproportionate political and economic power. Ecuador's
foreign minister, Heinz Moeller, has expressed apprehension about
possible Washington policy shifts, making it clear that a U.S.
military base in the coastal area of Manta could only be used for the
purpose of fighting drugs--not fighting rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Peru, too, is worried about growing security imbalances. Its
foreign minister, Diego Garcia Sayan, has acknowledged that there
have been incursions of the FARC into Peruvian territory. Peru's
home-grown insurgency, the Shining Path, responsible for some 30,000
deaths, is showing signs of resurgence. In addition, some of the
country's noteworthy advances during the 1990s are in danger of being
reversed. A combination of market forces, the displacement of coca
farming in Colombia and a year-long suspension of drug interdiction
flights has resulted in a sharp increase in coca production--which
had dropped dramatically. Peruvians worry about the rhetoric coming
from Washington. The country's newspapers are full of speculation
that the main purpose of President Bush's scheduled visit to Lima on
March 23 is to announce the installation of a new military base near
the border with Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   With the rupture in Colombian peace talks and the consequent
prospect of escalating violence in Colombia in the coming
months--along with uncertainty about how far and in what capacity the
United States is prepared to get involved in response--both the
Ecuadorean and Peruvian militaries have been put on alert and have
fortified their borders. Panama, too, which has been without a
military since 1989, is profoundly concerned about refugee flows and
paramilitary and rebel incursions. Brazil, the South American
powerhouse whose strategically sensitive Amazon region borders
Colombia, is also monitoring the signs from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   When President Bush meets with the leaders of four key Andean
countries later this month in Lima, he will likely be greeted warmly.
But there will also be many questions simmering beneath the surface
about U.S. motives and plans. He should view the visit as a welcome
opportunity to focus high-level, positive attention on a region that
has been relegated to relatively low priority--especially since the
global anti-terrorist campaign began.</TE>
<TE>   Given what is at stake in the region, Bush should consider
advancing two fundamental and positive ideas. First, he should commit
diplomatic and political resources aimed at bringing the Colombian
conflict to an end. This is entirely in keeping with increased
security aid to enable the Colombian government to assert authority
and gain control over its territory within a context of respect for
human rights. And, second, he should try to energize a genuinely
multilateral approach to the drug problem. Above all, he should seek
the counsel and cooperation of our partners in the region in forging
a common agenda.</TE>

<HD>As Aristide's Support Ebbs, Tensions Grow</HD>

<AU>J.P. SLAVIN</AU>
<BD>J.P. Slavin worked as a freelance foreign correspondent
in Haiti from 1990-93. From 1994-98, he was the editor of Haiti
Insight, the newsletter of the U.S.-based National Coalition for
Haitian Rights.</BD>
<DL>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti</DL>
<LD>Haitians were still dancing in the streets at the end of this year's
Mardi Gras. But the moves were not lascivious, as they had been a
week earlier. By Fat Tuesday, the dancing in this capital city was
aggressive, furiously spirited, near riotous. The American guards
protecting the Caribbean country's embattled president were on high
alert, as were the U.S. Marines at the U.S. Embassy.</LD>
<LD>   Things turn dangerous quickly in Haiti today, especially in the
sprawling and increasingly lawless capital, Port-au-Prince. The
slums, plagued by a dangerous mix of firearms and hunger, have become
near-war zones, overrun by gangs. Humanitarian relief organizations
need armed guards to work there. Most foreign journalists enter the
casbah only after negotiating in advance with local warlords, who
provide gang-member bodyguards armed with assault rifles.</LD>
<TE>   For President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the turmoil is a threat to
his government. In some neighborhoods, like Cite Soleil, one of
Port-au-Prince's most notorious ghettos, the
liberation-theologian-priest-turned-married-Head-of-State is still
revered as the righteous man who whipped former dictator Jean-Claude
"Baby Doc" Duvalier and his Tontons Macoute thugs. Cite Soleil
residents remember how Aristide persuaded then-President Bill Clinton
to deploy more than 20,000 U.S. troops to Haiti in 1994 to put him
into power after he was exiled in a 1991 coup.</TE>
<TE>   But in the cross-town slum of St. Martin residents are openly
contemptuous of the president. "I voted for Aristide but I won't
again. The government has failed," a 24-year-old unemployed high
school graduate told me during a recent visit. "We need a hospital,
schools, food and more electricity. At best we get six hours of power
a day. The president is doing nothing. How long can we live without
food? One day we will do something."</TE>
<TE>   Port-au-Prince has become a tinderbox, with growing tensions
between Aristide's supporters and detractors. The question of the
moment is whether there will be a popular uprising against Aristide.
A European diplomat warned, "Once the good cheer of carnival wears
off, we're expecting trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Judging by the size of his personal security detail, Aristide sees
the threat as real. While the National Palace is protected by a force
of hundreds, Aristide looks for his own protection to a personal
security force of 40 to 60 foreign guards on private contracts. Most
are former U.S. military personnel, including some from the U.S. Army
Special Forces. About 10 are with him nearly always. When he leaves
the palace it is always in a motorcade with an escape helicopter
rented from the Dominican Republic flying overhead. In a country
where government employees--from surgeons to garbage collectors--are
sometimes not paid for years, Aristide's foreign bodyguards earn as
much as $90,000 a year, plus living expenses.</TE>
<TE>   While the security force is in some way understandable--Aristide
has survived multiple assassination attempts--it is offensive to many
Haitians. In this poorest country of the Americas, where two-thirds
of its nearly 8 million people live in poverty and infants die from
diarrhea, Aristide's security costs seem a gross
extravagance--especially for a ruler who came to power as a "man of
the people."</TE>
<TE>   Security is not his only problem. While Aristide remains the
nation's only political leader with legitimate popularity across the
country, he has been increasingly associated with scandals. Recently
a group of Aristide supporters--including some elected
officials--diverted rice from an Aristide-linked food program and
sold it on the open market.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is sufficiently alarmed at Aristide's failings
that U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell recently warned that the
U.S. would continue to block $200 million in much-needed
international loans to Haiti out of concern that Aristide has done
too little to further democracy in the country. The U.S. is pushing
Aristide to resolve a long-running dispute with opposition parties
over rigged parliamentary elections held in May 2000 and to improve
its record on human rights, something that has concerned even the
Cuban ambassador, who recently raised concerns to other diplomats
here about Aristide's treatment of opposition political parties.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is also slapping Aristide where it hurts most,
in his personal security. Since late last year Washington has been
removing active-duty U.S. military personnel and intelligence
operatives it had covertly placed in Haitian security units that are
charged with helping to protect the president and National Palace.</TE>
<TE>   But despite the U.S. stance, the Bush administration will continue
to work with Aristide, because the alternatives are worse. No one in
the opposition is credible or popular, and the most likely successors
to Aristide from within his own political party are tied to drug
trafficking or racketeering schemes.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is deeply concerned that if Aristide were elbowed
aside, it would make room for the ambitious Sen. Dany Toussaint, a
man who has been compared to Liberian President Charles Taylor--a
strongman whose trademark is a necklace with a dangling bullet.
Toussaint, a former army major and Aristide bodyguard, received
military training in the United States in the 1980s and proudly
displays on the wall of his office a framed certificate for
completing a course in covert photography at Fort Benning, Ga. Rep.
Porter J. Goss (R-Fla), a former CIA officer and chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee, and Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio), have
accused Toussaint of being "credibly linked...to narcotics
trafficking." Toussaint has also been charged with involvement in the
April 2000 murder of Haiti's most prominent journalist, Jean Leopold
Dominique, but has avoided trial by claiming parliamentary immunity.
Toussaint has enough gunmen at his disposal (an estimated 1,500 in
Cite Soleil) that even Aristide has been reluctant to move against
him.</TE>
<TE>   If Washington faces a dilemma about whether or not to support the
Aristide regime, for the people of Haiti the situation is even more
dire. As a Haitian intellectual, an early supporter of Aristide who
is now a harsh critic, told me recently, "The future holds more
isolation for the country. And we are again part of a mad dream."</TE>

<HD>Extending Copyright Helps Corporations, Not Artists</HD>
<DH>Creators should be wary of industry thirst for perpetual
ownership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TASINI</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Tasini, president of the National Writers
Union, was the main plaintiff in the suit by freelance writers
alleging copyright infringement against media companies.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Later this year, the U.S. Supreme Court will consider whether
Congress violated the Constitution when it extended copyright
protection four years ago. Individual creators will instinctively
side with Congress, believing that control of copyrights should go on
as long as possible. They are mistaken. Congress acted
unconstitutionally and, by doing so, chose the economic interests of
corporations over culture, knowledge and society.</LD>
<LD>   In 1998, Congress extended the term of copyright from life plus 50
years for individual creators to life plus 70 years. In other words,
my heirs can control any works I create and own for 70 years after my
death. The law, known as the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,
also added 20 more years of protection to "corporate" copyright.</LD>
<LD>   The main plaintiff in the case, Eric Eldred, runs an Internet
library that posts works in the public domain. He contends that
Congress' extension violated the constitutional copyright principle
embodied in Article I, Section 8, which reads, "The Congress shall
have power to ... promote the progress of science and useful arts, by
securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive
right to their respective writings and discoveries."</LD>
<TE>   The copyright principle set forth by the framers is one of
balance. Society should value the work of authors and inventors, and
culture will only thrive when they receive a fair return from owning
their work. But this exclusive right should be "limited" in time
because the flowering of the arts and sciences, as James Madison
believed, could only occur when people have access to information in
the public domain. Madison also believed the only way to ensure a
free and democratic society is to ensure that no single entity
controls information. By allowing individual authors to have the
power to license use of their work, whether for a fee or for free,
Madison thought the government would find it harder to control
information.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the Sonny Bono act say that adding 20 years to
copyright protection brings U.S. law into compliance with European.
It would certainly be a step forward if U.S. policymakers decide
international law is something to respect on more than a selective
basis. In intellectual property, the U.S. could start by adopting
"moral rights," an important protection enjoyed by individual authors
in Europe, which the U.S., because of opposition from the media
lobby, refuses to recognize for its individual creators. But,
regardless, the Bono Act is unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The most amusing argument for the life-after-death copyright
protection is that it inspires new creativity. In other words, before
art is created, the creator asks herself: "How much will my heirs
earn 70 years after I'm dead from the work I'm about to make?" More
likely, she is thinking about the rent, the electric bill, health
insurance or her child's tuition. This is the Shirley MacLaine
defense--"I will create after I am dead."</TE>
<TE>   The fundamental problem is, copyright is no longer an individual
right but a corporate piece of property. Corporations are vacuuming
up copyrights by either stealing them or forcing creators to give up
them up. As we successfully showed in our landmark U.S. Supreme Court
case last year, companies have simply stolen hundreds of thousands of
articles, photographs and illustrations from their original creators.
When they don't steal, they force freelance writers, illustrators and
photographers to sign over their copyrights in perpetuity for no
extra pay.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of benefiting an individual creator for a certain time in
order to promote more new ideas and new contributions to culture, the
arts and sciences has been replaced by the industry's drive to create
a copyright monopoly. Within a few years, media companies will own
virtually all copyright, creating a digital iron curtain behind which
they can enforce the control and sale of information and content.
Indeed, the 1998 legislation was a rich subsidy for the Walt Disney
Co., which trembled at the approaching end to its monopoly on the use
of Mickey Mouse.</TE>
<TE>   For sure, media companies and their hired guns will trot out
individual creators and bemoan their plights. But if they really
cared about individual creativity, these companies would cease
bludgeoning creators while they are alive. Writers would maintain
ownership of their copyright and be paid fairly for electronic use of
their material. Record companies would stop cheating musicians out of
their money and pay royalties they are withholding from the use of
their music on the Internet. Screenwriters and actors would get a
bigger cut of new-media revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Individual creators should be wary of supporting the media
industry's thirst for perpetual copyright. Indeed, such support could
be harmful to creators' financial health. The success of song-swap
software company Napster showed that tens of millions of people
apparently believe all creative work should be free. Apart from the
ease of digital downloading, they had no qualms about denying a
dollar to large media companies. And people will continue to "steal"
copyrighted works until they believe that individual artists, not
large corporations, are harmed.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever royalties heirs of dead creators may receive because of
perpetual copyright protection, we cannot justify the future harm
such protection may inflict on society as a whole. If there is no
reasonable time limit on copyright, our heirs will have to pay more
for access to information. Public libraries they might like to visit
will have less information because they cannot afford the exorbitant
fees to obtain it. They may even enjoy fewer works of art because
future creators may lack easy access to the art their creations build
on.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than carry the water for an industry bent on impoverishing
us in this lifetime and reaping the benefits long after we are gone,
creators should embrace the principle that human knowledge advances
when information is shared, that cultural expression belongs to the
public and that the intellectual wealth of a nation, in the form of
ideas and information, cannot--and should not--be locked up as the
property of a few.</TE>

<HD>This Time, Finish the Job</HD>
<DH>To remove Iraq's Hussein, Bush can't stop short.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWARD N. LUTTWAK</AU>
<BD>Edward N. Luttwak is a senior fellow at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has not decided what to do about Iraq, but if
it does act to remove Saddam Hussein from power, it would use all
means, including a full-scale war if absolutely necessary.</LD>
<LD>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin says that he supports the war
against Islamic terrorism but opposes war against Iraq. The Russian
Foreign Ministry, however, rejects Iraqi requests for the
unconditional removal of sanctions, insisting that Iraq must submit
to "serious" U.N. inspections to uncover and destroy its weapons of
mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. State Department is trying to reach an understanding with
Putin's negotiators to define U.N. inspection procedures that could
finally eliminate the threat. If these talks are successful, the U.S.
and Russia would present the plan to the U.N. Security Council for a
vote.</LD>
<TE>   At least some key U.S. officials, including Secretary of State
Colin Powell, would welcome this peaceful solution. Just as welcome
is the opportunity to cooperate with Russia in a tangible way.</TE>
<TE>   Other key U.S. officials, including the Pentagon's civilian
leaders, do not oppose the U.S.-Russia talks, but they view the Iraq
problem as Hussein's rule in itself, not just his weapons of mass
destruction. They see Hussein as motivated by dreams of revenge
against the United States and therefore believe that it would be
highly irresponsible to leave him free to act when it suits him.
These officials hope that if agreement is reached on U.N. inspection
procedures, Hussein will refuse to accept them, thus triggering a new
crisis that would make it easier to justify an attack against him.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have not stated a
position, but their preferences are reflected by National Security
Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who leans toward the Pentagon's position.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the media have been reporting a wide-ranging
debate within the administration on how to remove Hussein from power.
The CIA is said to favor a coup by Iraqi military officers, organized
by former generals who have fled Iraq. This option is the easiest to
attempt because it requires neither diplomatic nor military
preparations, let alone U.S. forces.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon civilians predictably favor a repeat of the Afghanistan
formula: the combined use of small teams of Special Forces and
extensive precision bombing to motivate, supply, lead and support
Kurdish militias operating from "Free Kurdistan" and Iraqi opposition
volunteers based in Kuwait and possibly Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon's military chiefs and their staffs, by contrast,
insist that Hussein's armored forces cannot be defeated by lightly
armed militias and volunteers. In their view, only a substantial
army--200,000 troops have been mentioned--could do the job, operating
from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and with heavy air support. This "real
war" option may be the only reliable way of defeating Hussein, but it
also reflects classic bureaucratic perspectives. Having played no
role in the 1999 Kosovo war and only a minor one in Afghanistan, the
regular Army and Marines cannot afford to sit out another war.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the White House need not choose even if it does
commit to decisive action. The three options are not mutually
exclusive; in fact, they fall into a logical sequence. Accordingly,
the CIA has been ordered to go full speed ahead with its coup plan.
If it succeeds, no further action would be needed. But the CIA also
has been ordered to send operatives to Kurdistan to pave the way for
the Afghan option, and the CIA is collaborating in the intelligence
preparation for the real war option.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Special Operations Command has been ordered to plan and
prepare for an Afghanistan-style campaign, while continuing to
provide its normal staff support for a real war option. The Air Force
and Navy have been directed and funded to acquire the weapons needed
for a full-scale air bombardment campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Unless CIA coup plans succeed, much diplomatic preparation would
be needed to secure allied support and access to bases in the
essential countries: at the very least Turkey, Kuwait and possibly
Jordan for the Afghan option; Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states as
well for the real war option. The leaders of those countries already
have publicly opposed a war against Iraq. But the Bush White House is
highly confident that if it does decide to eliminate Hussein, it will
have the cooperation of the essential countries.</TE>
<TE>   It is not yet certain that anything will happen. The CIA's track
record in mounting covert operations is far from impressive, while
the fighting options could be stopped cold if Iraq accepts U.N.
inspection. But one thing is certain: If the administration does
launch an attack to remove Hussein, it will persist until it
succeeds, even if it takes a full-scale war.</TE>

<HD>Left and Right: Enron, Monica and Blue-Light Specials</HD>
<DH>"The bras will madden them. The panty ads will turn their
hearts against the squinting Mullahs forever."</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GALE HOLLAND</AU>
<BD>Gale Holland, a Los Angeles journalist, surveys the
right-wing and left-wing press each month for Opinion.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's nothing that pricks up the ears of the chattering classes
like a whisper of presidential scandal, preferably a lovely quagmire
to which the suffix "gate" can be appended. Watergate,
Iran-Contragate, Monicagate--a seemingly endless parade of White
House imbroglios play out with a ceremonial majesty. They present a
kaleidoscopic pageant of congressional hearings, subpoenas and leaked
testimony, providing so many chances for TV face-time that they might
be termed the Punditocracy Full Employment Act.</LD>
<LD>   While the financial chicaneries of the fallen Enron energy trading
company have not yet achieved full "gate" status, partisan
commentators are testing the waters, hoping no doubt that President
Bush's cozy relationship with the Texas sharpies will provide a
platform big enough to ride at least into the midterm elections.
Predictably, liberals see Enron as the QE2 of scandals, while
conservatives dismiss it as a minor business story.</LD>
<TE>   Sean Wilentz in the American Prospect positively rhapsodizes that
Enron "is shaping up as quite possibly the largest political and
financial scandal in American history," dwarfing the Teapot Dome and
other Gilded Age excesses. Later in his piece, however, Wilentz
muddies the waters by opining that the $1.4 trillion savings-and-loan
bailout of the late 1980s "may well be the largest single theft in
world history." Ah, consistency, the hobgoblin of small minds.</TE>
<TE>   Wilentz goes on to concede that the Democrats are just as chummy
with K Street energy lobbyists as the Republicans. But three guesses
who's to blame for the Enron mess. "Enron is the belated culmination
of the age of Ronald Reagan, George Bush the elder, and Newt
Gingrich," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Not so, says Green Party mascot Ralph Nader, who, having been
spurned by the left for his quixotic electoral challenge to Al Gore,
is back in the fold with his broadsides against politicians of all
stripes who took money to do Enron's bidding, The Nation's John
Nichols reports.</TE>
<TE>   The conservatives are not taking Nader's bait, however. Rather
than going after the Dems, the party line seems to be that Enron is
no big deal. "Nobody lost electrical power. Kmart's bankruptcy was
more consequential economically," sniffs the National Review's Ramesh
Ponnoru. Well, that's a comfort. Except David Moberg of In These
Times says Enron is responsible for the power outages of California's
energy crisis one-and-a-half years ago. Or, at least a deregulation
bill shoved through by Texas GOP Sen. Phil Gramm on Enron's behalf is
responsible. How's a mere media columnist to know the truth?</TE>
<TE>   Raising the specter of impeachment, The Nation's editors link
Enron to the Monica Lewinsky scandal as the latest battle over
presidential "values." And, just in case you didn't get the point,
there's the witty cover art by Stephen Kroninger depicting Dubya,
looking suspiciously like Howdy Doody, with his finger in the air
echoing former President Bill Clinton's famously misleading
Lewinsky-era declaration, "I did NOT have financial relations with
that corporation."</TE>
<TE>   TV news elder Daniel Schorr, who's never missed a chance to trot
out a Watergate war story, hears the handcuffs jangling. And he's not
afraid to use the "G" word. "Watergate, Irangate, and now Enrongate?"
Schorr writes in the New Leader. Referencing news stories about Enron
execs frantically chewing up documents on their way out the door,
Schorr adds, "As a senior Gatekeeper, I say when you hear the
shredder at work, it's time to take notice."</TE>
<TE>   More surprisingly, National Review economics columnist Larry "Hang
'Em High" Kudlow also sees prison bars. "Jail 'em. All the Enron and
Arthur Andersen principals and then some," Kudlow writes, a bit of
right-wing apostasy that can be explained, Chris Mooney writes in
American Prospect, by the columnist's disclosure in the same piece of
the $50,000 in consulting fees he received from Enron.</TE>
<TE>   George Gilder of The American Spectator takes the long view on the
Enron fracas. Happens every recession, the fervent supply-sider
yawns, this "flood of factitious crimes, this parade of snaffled fat
cats and scapegoats...The proximal cause of these imbroglios is
nearly always found in government tax, regulatory and monetary
policies."</TE>
<TE>   Blond Republican babe Ann Coulter jeers at the outpouring of
sympathy for Enron employees who lost their pensions. "Before the New
York Times starts running 'Portraits in Grief' of former Enron
employees, it's worth remembering that even after the collapse, Enron
stock is still worth more than the entire Social Security 'trust
fund'," Coulter meows with her trademark sensitivity in FrontPage
Magazine, leftie-turned-rightie David Horowitz's online rag. "The
only beef Enron employees have with top management is that management
did not inform employees of the collapse in time to allow them to get
in on the swindle."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Kmart, the Blue-Light specialist seems to have
captivated the National Review, which has a second article poking
gentle fun at the big-box retailer's collapse. "The big retailer has
been world-famous for slow service," writes Dave Shiflett. "The
cashiers were trained to improperly ring up purchases, and a price
check could take a month or two, with the original checker resigning
halfway through the job and his or her replacement not coming along
for another six weeks ....I myself have been tempted, during slow
months in hackdom, to don the red vest of a Kmart employee. It
wouldn't have been so bad. I could have crept back to the supply room
and found a place to nap, along with the rest of the staff." Shiflett
goes on to memorialize the chain as a great American equalizer.</TE>
<TE>   The National Review also hosts a paean to the Queen of England on
the occasion of her Golden Jubilee. The Queen, not Prime Minister
Tony Blair or Parliament is responsible for turning its military into
a "smaller twin brother of American efficiency," British journalist
Paul Johnson enthuses. And we have her "matchless skills" and the
"convenience of a permanent head of state who is there by right, not
periodic election," to thank. Democratic claptrap like elections do
tend to get in the way of rolling out the caissons on time, eh,
Johnson?</TE>
<TE>   Collateral damage is another front-line issue for the left and
right this month, specifically civilian body counts. The Nation's
Christopher Hitchens gives Bush a pass on the issue, asserting that
the U.S. Afghan campaign concluded with "no serious loss of civilian
life, and with an almost pedantic policy of avoiding 'collateral
damage.'"</TE>
<TE>   But editors of The Progressive count 3,767 civilian bodies in the
first nine weeks of the U.S. war. "This heaping of death upon death
has led to a huge mound of bodies, which is no cause for
celebration," they say. Noam Chomsky, writing in Z magazine, asserts
that 100 people a day were dying in just one Afghan refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   The libertarian Reason magazine, however, cautions against death
counts circulated by "loonies on the left." Examining the
oft-repeated 500,000 child death figure cited by opponents of
U.S.-led sanctions against Iraq, author Matt Welch uncovers a comedy
of misrepresentations and mindless repetitions that fatally
contaminates the count. In the end, however, Welch says there's
evidence the sanctions have contributed to more than 100,000 deaths
since 1990, more than enough to justify revisiting Iraqi policy.</TE>
<TE>   But enough about death and taxes. Sex also reared its head in the
pages of the partisan press this month. Back at the American
Spectator, R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., who learned all about the power of
sexual peccadilloes in his relentless Monicagate/Troopergate pursuit
of Clinton, has a plan for cleaning up Al Qaeda's remaining
"dung-heaped dungeons": Air-drop Victoria's Secret lingerie catalogs.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone familiar with the September 11 atrocities knows that these
fellows are sexually repressed," Tyrrell writes. "In their last days
before they presented to Allah their spotless souls, the soterial
softas pursued research at advanced adult book stores and tutorials
with prostitutes in Boston and strippers in Las Vegas...The bras will
madden them. The panty ads will turn their hearts against the
squinting Mullahs forever." Soterial isn't in my vocabulary, but I'm
sure since it's in Tyrrell's, that it's a sneeringly good modifier
for softa (burningly zealous Mosque school student).</TE>
<TE>   Lest you worry that the conservative magazine views sex as merely
a political tool, the American Spectator's monthly edition also
features a Playmate of the Month. But don't get all hot and bothered.
American Spectator's Miss February, in all her glory, is ... the
envelope, please, ... Saddam Hussein. But rest assured, there's not a
bra or panty in sight, and the centerfold is fully clothed.</TE>

<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety has begun
enforcement of an ordinance passed by the Los Angeles City Council in
December requiring the installation of gas shut-off valves by home
sellers before the close of escrow, said a Department of Building and
Safety spokesman. Enforcement was delayed pending an amendment to the
ordinance by a City Council committee.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed amendment will allow townhome and condominium owners
to install the seismic devices only in their individual units at the
time of sale.</LD>
<LD>   The new ordinance requires that a seller of an apartment building,
however, install the valves in each unit of the building before the
close of escrow.</LD>
<TE>   The valves no longer will be installed by the Gas Co. but by
private contractors, whose work will be inspected by the Department
of Building and Safety. Homeowners can obtain a list of qualified
contractors from that agency. A permit, which costs $43.40, is
required to install the device.</TE>

<HD>Board's Actions Don't Show 'Good Faith'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN GLASSMAN and DONIE VANITZIAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I sit on the board of my condominium association in Rancho
Palos Verdes, and I don't like how the other board members manipulate
the published minutes reported to the other homeowners.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners who attend meetings are allowed to raise issues before
the board, but the board's secretary and the rest of the board parses
the homeowner's words when they report it in the minutes. They
intentionally twist what the homeowner says, then publish something
the homeowner did not say or intend, but they attribute the quote to
the homeowner. It is impossible for the homeowner to rectify this
because the board has an unspoken rule to ignore homeowner contact.</LD>
<LD>   We put things in the minutes that did not occur at the meeting. We
falsify what we discussed during the executive session, and we
basically cover ourselves with stuff we did not want to discuss in
front of other homeowners. We also don't report the many gifts the
management company and other vendors give us either.</LD>
<TE>   I've been going along with these fraudulent routines for the six
years I've been on the board. One board matriarch keeps telling us
that because we are "volunteers" the law covers our actions and we
can't get in trouble. I know as a board we've done some other things
we should not have done, but the homeowners will never learn of these
acts.</TE>
<TE>   The president of the board tells us the attorney advised him that
all we have to say is "whatever we do we did it in good faith." Is
this true, or can I as a board member get in trouble for these
things? If we are sued, will the courts protect us?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Your troubles were set in motion by your board's actions,
then compounded by the attorney's advice to simply mouth the words
"good faith" as a defense.</TE>
<TE>   With privilege comes responsibility and you and your board have
apparently enjoyed the former and ignored the latter.</TE>
<TE>   Intentionally misrepresenting homeowner statements at monthly
meetings, then falsely circulating them, is not tantamount to "good
faith." It is possible that those actions constitute a fraud. Courts
do not protect people; they serve as the arbiters of whether what was
done meets the applicable legal standard for the case being tried.</TE>
<TE>   If the acts do not meet that standard, board members may be
personally liable for damages their actions may have caused.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the legal responsibility to repair and maintain the
commonly owned property, every California homeowner association board
member is held to a "reasonable standard of care," and must perform
in accordance with the "ordinary prudent person standard" in making
reasonable inquiries, serving all homeowners in good faith and making
decisions in the best interests of the association (Corporations Code
section 7231).</TE>
<TE>   To avoid impropriety, homeowner association directors should
disclose any conflict of interest involving transactions or material
financial interests to the homeowners for their approval. Disclosure
includes any vendor gifts to board members.</TE>
<TE>   The Corporations Code says that a board member with a conflict
should refrain from voting on related issues.</TE>
<TE>   The cavalier attitude of not worrying about your actions because
insurance covers "volunteer" members is a breach of loyalty to all
the homeowners. The Corporations Code also states that "a person who
performs the duties of a director in accordance with" the Code "shall
have no liability based upon any alleged failure to discharge the
person's obligations as a director."</TE>
<TE>   But if the insurance company feels that the acts of the director
were not a part of the person's obligations they may decline to cover
that member for those acts, possibly exposing board members and other
homeowners to liability.</TE>
<TE>   Civil Code section 1365.7 of the Davis-Stirling Act accords a
statutory immunity for homeowner association board members,
protecting them from personal liability if the following conditions
are met: (1) The act or omission was within the scope of the
director's or executive officer's duties; (2) The act or omission was
performed in good faith; (3) The act or omission was not reckless,
wanton, intentional, or grossly negligent; and (4) Damages caused by
the act or omission are covered pursuant to the association's
liability insurance policy, which must be in place in accordance with
the Act.</TE>
<TE>   The code adds "the volunteer director or volunteer executive
officer shall not be personally liable for the damages if the board
of directors of the corporation and the person had made all
reasonable efforts in good faith to obtain available liability
insurance."</TE>
<TE>   These statutes were enacted so homeowners would volunteer to serve
on association boards without fear of personal liability in a
lawsuit. They were not passed for board members to circumvent the law
or their duties.</TE>
<TE>   Merely saying you acted in good faith is insufficient to establish
that you, in fact, did.</TE>

<HD>Efficient Space Heaters Can Take Chill Off Room</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES DULLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: A couple of rooms in my home are always chilly. I want to
use two small, efficient electric space heaters instead of turning up
the thermostat. How can I determine which designs are best and safest
for my children?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Using small electric space heaters is wise. Even if you
have a gas furnace, using a few heaters instead of cranking up the
thermostat can cut your utility bills. It can also improve your
comfort because you get heat where you need it the most.</LD>
<LD>   When you see the myriad electric space heater designs, styles,
sizes and prices, it can be mind-boggling.</LD>
<TE>   There actually are significant difference in the controls, heat
distribution and safety of the various designs and models, so don't
just buy the cheapest one on sale.</TE>
<TE>   Before buying an electric space heater, think about how it will be
used most often. This determines the best design and important
features to consider. The basic design types are convection (fan),
low-temperature radiant (oil-filled) and high-temperature focused
radiant heaters.</TE>
<TE>   To heat a large area, convection, baseboard or tall oil-filled
radiator types of electric heaters are effective. For smaller areas
or a specific spot, a high-temperature radiant heater focuses the
heat more effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Within the basic types are many design variations and features.
Since you mentioned safety around children, some of the newer
convection models use either non-glow elements or ceramic elements.
These reduce the chances of a hand getting burnt or having a child
ignite a piece of paper in the heater.</TE>
<TE>   Ceramic heating elements are unique in that they self-regulate the
heat output. As the room temperature gets warmer, the resistance of
the ceramic element increases so less electricity is used and less
heat is produced. The newest ceramic heaters can be programmed and
use digital displays.</TE>
<TE>   For the most precise temperature control in a room, select one of
the new convection heaters with a temperature dial. Instead of the
unit just switching on and off when the temperature setting is
reached, it stays on but the heat output slows. This maintains more
even room temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   Quartz heaters use elements that glow red to radiate heat that
targets a specific area. Some models also include a tiny, quiet fan
to gently circulate and mix the room air. Select one with a
child-safe, snap-off grill to enable you to replace the bulbs or
clean the reflectors.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, all electric heating elements are 100% efficient, so
do not let the packaging hype fool you. Check for these
features--adjustable thermostat, several heat settings and timers.</TE>

Bulletin No. 706, a buyer's guide of 10 electric space heater
manufacturers listing design types, heat settings, thermostats,
comfort and safety features, a savings chart and safe usage tips.</TE>

<TE>   Drippy Shower Spout Wastes Water and Energy</TE>
<TE>   Q: Whenever I take a shower, some water continues to flow out of
the spout below and the shower does not feel as forceful as it used
to. Is this normal or should I have the spout and shower valve
repaired?</TE>
<TE>   A: A little trickle of water from the bathtub spout is typical,
but a substantial flow is unusual. Since you noticed the force of the
shower is not as great as before, you should repair the valve.</TE>
<TE>   This problem not only causes a weak shower flow, but it also
wastes water and energy. If the shower flow is weak and slow, the
droplets tend to cool before they hit your body so you have to adjust
the water temperature even higher.</TE>

<AU>KENNETH R. HARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--What if your home-mortgage lender guaranteed you freedom
from last-minute settlement fee surprises?</LD>
<LD>   What if your lender promised to let you review and question your
closing costs weeks in advance of settlement?</LD>
<LD>   Some of the most powerful players in the American home-mortgage
market--including giant investor Fannie Mae--are planning to
introduce a more consumer-friendly way of obtaining home loans.</LD>
<TE>   Call it the "transparent" mortgage or "see-through" financing. Or
think of it this way: Lenders have heard your complaints. They've
heard Housing and Urban Development Secretary Mel Martinez lambaste
the industry for making the process of obtaining and closing a home
mortgage needlessly mysterious and unpredictably expensive.</TE>
<TE>   And they have read the bad publicity--lenders low-balling quotes
to loan applicants to get them in the door, then hitting them with
big fees at settlement. Or title companies and lenders inventing
hundreds of dollars in junk fees and larding them onto borrowers'
settlement sheets hours before the scheduled closing.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's partial answer to these criticisms? Open up the
loan process. Let home buyers see their settlement documents and
their complete loan files weeks ahead of the scheduled closing. And
cut out all the last-minute junk fees.</TE>
<TE>   To make all this happen, companies such as CitiMortgage Inc.,
Fannie Mae, E-Loan and others are participating in a concept dubbed
the "eMortgage Axis." It is the product of a high-tech California
company known as BridgeSpan Inc. Lenders who sign up agree to put
their entire loan files onto an electronic "platform" created and run
by BridgeSpan. The online platform can be accessed by all the key
parties to a mortgage loan transaction--most importantly, the
consumer.</TE>
<TE>   When you apply for a home loan, by federal law you're supposed to
receive a good-faith estimate of your closing costs within three
business days. But those estimates by the lender frequently have
little connection with the final charges the consumer sees on the
HUD-1 settlement sheet weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowers applying for a transparent mortgage are guaranteed that
last-minute surprises on fees won't happen. That's because they can
pull up their entire loan file--including final settlement
documents--weeks in advance via password-coded access to a secure Web
site. They can see their file anytime. Borrowers lacking an Internet
connection can see the same documents by facsimile or hard copies
sent by mail or courier.</TE>
<TE>   National lenders such as CitiMortgage have quietly begun
experimenting with the BridgeSpan plan, customizing it for their
needs. For instance, CitiMortgage allows customers to not only review
loan documents online but request changes in rates, fees and other
terms. Ram Lakshmanan, CitiMortgage senior vice president, said
borrowers can opt for loan modifications after seeing their
settlement fees.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, if you find your closing costs are going to total
$7,000, you may decide you'd prefer to hold onto that cash. The
CitiMortgage version of the transparent home loan allows you to
e-mail the lender and request that the closing fees be paid for with
a slightly higher interest rate on the note--an extra one-quarter of
a percentage point, for example, or get rolled into the principal
amount.</TE>
<TE>   CitiMortgage's program also notifies borrowers by e-mail every
time a document is added to their file or changed in any way. And for
those customers who prefer the latest in technology, the program
accepts "e-signatures" and "e-recordations," and even provides
settlement packages on compact discs. The first borrowers to use the
company's transparency program insisted on having their entire home
financing file on a single diskette--which they carried home with
them on settlement day, rather than lugging a pile of paper,
according to Lakshmanan.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae said it is enthusiastic about the transparent loan
concept because it's also tied in with a long list of technical
advances most consumers won't notice, such as faster deliveries of
closed mortgages to investors. Michael Williams, Fannie Mae's head of
e-business, called the transparency idea "the next major innovation
to hit the mortgage industry." Fannie Mae expects to begin purchasing
substantial volumes of such loans, once national lenders roll out
their own versions of the program in the months ahead.</TE>
<TE>   But aside from transparency and predictability on closing fees,
will the new approach actually lower costs for borrowers? Maybe
modestly, lenders said.</TE>
<TE>   CitiMortgage's Lakshmanan foresees offering borrowers who choose
transparent mortgages discounts on total loan fees of $500 to $1,000.
But the basics--title searches and insurance, escrow fees, loan
origination fees--won't change much.</TE>
<TE>   You'll just know with a whole lot more certainty what the fees are
upfront, and be able to shop--and choose lenders--accordingly.</TE>

<TE>   A Hollywood Hills home built in the early '40s for actor Gregory
Peck and sold shortly afterward to actor Boris Karloff has been
listed at about $2.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   The home has been owned for about three years by Seth Ersoff, an

<HD>Her Desert Stage</HD>
<DH>Carol Channing's memories are pure Broadway, but she's
writing them down from her Rancho Mirage home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH RYON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carol Channing doesn't live in New York, San Francisco or Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The Broadway legend, who starred in "Hello, Dolly!" and "Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes," hangs her gowns, instead, in a Rancho Mirage
condominium, though she is quick to explain: "This is not a home.
It's a place to write my book."</LD>
<LD>   Due out in September, the book is her first. Channing, who just
turned 81, thought about calling it "The First 80 Years Are the
Hardest," but its title is "Just Lucky, I Guess."</LD>
<TE>   "The loneliest job in the world is writing a book," she said of
her collection of memoirs about famous people. "I just stay here and
write about Yul Brynner, Ethel Merman, the queen of England."</TE>
<TE>   Drawn from New York to the Southern California desert by a cousin
who lives nearby, Channing plans to continue to live in the 700-unit
golf course community even after her book is published, she said. So
far, however, her condo hasn't many trappings of a personal
residence. The few mementos she has kept over the years are still
mostly in storage.</TE>
<TE>   "I bought this place a little less than two years ago for
$126,000, furnished, so all I had to do was sit down and write," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the white sofa and walls suited her when she bought the
1,320-square-foot condo, she threw away most of the artificial
flowers and rugs but kept some bright-yellow paper sunflowers in the
second bedroom, which doubles as an office. "I wanted this place
because of the sunflowers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The office is used by her secretary. Channing uses the dining room
table as a desk. "I write longhand and in pencil, so I can erase,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of many papers on the table is a small framed photo
of her father. "I keep him with me. He helps me all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Her father, George Channing, died when she was 34, just before she
was to appear in Las Vegas in an act staged by comedian George Burns.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that her father would want her to go on, she did. And she
has been going on with the show ever since.</TE>
<TE>   To keep her 6-foot, slender figure in shape, Channing, a singer
and dancer as well as an actress, has a personal trainer who comes to
the condo and works with her three mornings a week.</TE>
<TE>   "You should see this place when the sun's coming up," she said of
the way the early light brightens the greens.</TE>
<TE>   But Channing, an only child who was born in Seattle and raised in
San Francisco, doesn't consider herself a morning person. She often
works late.</TE>
<TE>   "I appreciate the security guards here," she said. "They keep a
good eye on me and stop by to see if all is well when I'm working at
night."</TE>
<TE>   The gated, 30-year-old community has swimming pools and tennis
courts as well as an 18-hole golf course, which she can see from her
bedroom, kitchen, dining area and living room.</TE>
<TE>   Because she is busy, Channing doesn't golf but is amused by the
view.</TE>
<TE>   "The osteoporosis club comes by every morning," she said. "They're
all men, and they sit in their golf carts and never get out of the
sitting position even when they get out of their carts. Then only
their feet move."</TE>
<TE>   One day, when the sliding-glass door of her living room was open,
a golf ball shot in with a bang. The room is one of the few places
that even hints that Channing lives there. On the walls are some
original black-and-white caricatures by the artist Al Hirschfeld.
Channing is depicted in most, alongside actress Angela Lansbury and
other friends.</TE>
<TE>   Channing's only child, Channing George Lowe, "grew up under Al
Hirschfeld's tutelage," she said. Her son is a syndicated political
cartoonist in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The actress was not a first-time buyer when she bought the condo,
but she has lived most of her adult life in hotels. "I've been
touring all my life," she said. "I never stopped working."</TE>
<TE>   Besides her Broadway stints, the Tony Award winner toured with
Mary Martin in the play "Legends," starred in TV specials, performed
in nightclub acts throughout the U.S., conducted symphony orchestras
nationwide as part of her stage act, recorded more than 20 children's
albums and did voice work in such animated films as "Hans Christian
Andersen's 'Thumbelina'" (1994) and "The Brave Little Toaster Goes to
Mars" (1999).</TE>
<TE>   She also won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Oscar
for her role in "Thoroughly Modern Millie" (1967).</TE>
<TE>   Though still working on her book, Channing has a calendar full of
appearances. Among them: In April, she'll be honored as the first
star on Manhattan's Walk of Fame; in June, she'll receive the Julie
Harris Award for Lifetime Achievement, presented by the Actors Fund,
and after her book is published, she will open in a stage show now in
the works.</TE>
<TE>   But Channing, single since her estranged husband-manager died in
1998 after more than 40 years of marriage, isn't all work.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed from her neck to the toe of her knee-high, high-heeled
boots in red--a color she adores even after wearing it in nearly
5,000 performances of "Hello, Dolly!"--Channing sports a 7-carat
diamond.</TE>
<TE>   The ring was a gift in December from Roger Denny, 62, a house
contractor and designer whom Channing met after moving to Rancho
Mirage.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a dear friend," she said. "Yes," she acknowledged seconds
later, "it is a romance."</TE>
<TE>   Is a wedding in their future? Channing fluttered her trademark
eyelashes. Her grin broadened into the wide smile that has
distinguished her all of her life.</TE>
<TE>   "A wedding?" she repeated. "Isn't that for children?"</TE>

<HD>Disclosure Is Meant to Reassure, Not Scare Off, Buyers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY STONE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Is the purpose of a disclosure statement to provide a
history of all repairs and past problems or to disclose current
defects? I'm preparing to sell my property and am wondering if a long
hairline crack in the basement wall that a general contractor
repaired by injecting a special epoxy into the crack should be
disclosed. It was a rather simple operation, and the crack has
remained unchanged for the last six years. Is it necessary to mention
the epoxy-filled crack in my disclosure statement or will this
disclosure needlessly alarm buyers?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The purpose of the disclosure statement is twofold. The
most obvious is to inform buyers of the condition of the property
they are buying. The added benefit, often overlooked, is the
liability protection provided for sellers. In this respect, the
disclosure statement helps to minimize the likelihood of claims,
disputes or lawsuits occurring after the close of escrow.</LD>
<TE>   Reasonable buyers are not likely to be troubled or concerned about
a repaired hairline crack, but there is always the potential for
litigious individuals against whom one must be ever vigilant. It is
not so much a matter of whether you are required to disclose the
crack. Rather, it is to your advantage to disclose it. In so doing,
that condition becomes one less issue with the potential to incite
future conflict. In the unlikely event that a problem regarding the
crack should ever arise, your defense would be strengthened by the
fact that you had made full disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   The process is actually quite simple. Just declare, in writing,
that the crack was evaluated and repaired by a reputable licensed
general contractor, and include a copy of the paperwork that you
received from the contractor. This should reassure, rather than
alarm, most potential buyers.</TE>

<TE>   Fire Rating Is Key  to Replacing Door</TE>
<TE>   Q: We want to replace the door that leads from our garage into our
home and would like to use a six-panel oak door. What is the fire
safety requirement for a door between a house and garage?</TE>
<TE>   A: Fire-resistive construction is required between a garage and a
dwelling. The code specifies that this be a one-hour, fire-rated
wall. Any door that is part of a garage firewall must be solid core
or fire-rated and must also be self-closing. If you plan to use an
oak panel door, be sure that it has a fire rating tag on one of its
edges.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's Tough to Get Builder to Fix Flaws After the Sale</TE>
<TE>   Q: When I purchased my home, it was brand-new, but my home
inspector still found some defects.</TE>
<TE>   The developers promptly repaired these as a condition of closing
escrow. Since then, more problems have turned up but now the
developers are no longer interested.</TE>
<TE>   I've complained numerous times, but they won't return my calls.
I've even notified the appropriate state agencies but all they offer
is red tape and further delays. How does one deal with this?</TE>
<TE>   A: Builders in most states are required to guarantee their work
for one or more years, depending upon specific laws where the
construction occurs. Unfortunately, not all property developers take
these obligations seriously.</TE>
<TE>   At this stage of the process, after the new home has been sold,
the integrity of the individual builder is plainly revealed.</TE>
<TE>   Regulatory agencies are empowered to compel full compliance with
applicable requirements, but inefficiency and negligence on the
bureaucratic level often thwart the enforcement of consumer
protection laws.</TE>
<TE>   For effective action against a recalcitrant builder, you may have
to employ an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   But before going that route, you might try this: Send a certified
letter, giving the developers 30 days to correct a list of specific
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Inform them that failure to perform in a timely and forthright
manner will cause you to hire your own contractors and that all bills
pursuant to that work will be forwarded to said developers.</TE>
<TE>   If you carefully document these proceedings, a Small Claims judge
is likely to view your position with favor. But be sure to obtain
legal advice before pursuing this course of action.</TE>

<HD>Low Interest Rates Spur Strong January Sales</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A surge in Southland home sales accounted for the strongest January
in 13 years, the result of reasonable mortgage interest rates and
increased sales of affordable homes, according to DataQuick
Information Systems.</LD>
<LD>   A total of 22,011 new and resale houses and condos were sold in
Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, Ventura, San Bernardino and Orange
counties in January. That was down 11.6% from 24,913 for December,
and up 22.2% from 18,010 for January last year.</LD>
<LD>   A decline from December to January is normal for the season. The
sales count was the highest for any January since 23,379 homes were
sold in 1989.</LD>
<TE>   "Some of the January surge may be spillover activity, deals that
couldn't close in December. Lenders, appraisers and title companies
have been scrambling because of the refinance boom, and some December
escrows had to be extended into January," said Mike Ela, DataQuick
president.</TE>
<TE>   The jump in sales was particularly noticeable in lower cost
Riverside and San Bernardino counties, which are attracting more of
Southern California's first-time home buyers. The two counties
account for half of all sales less than $125,000, up from one-third
five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The median price paid for a Southland home in January was
$236,000. That was down 4.5% from $247,000 for December, and up 12.9%
from $209,000 for January last year. The year-over-year increase was
the strongest since July 1989 when prices rose 14.7% to $179,000 from
$156,000 a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The typical monthly mortgage payment that Southland buyers
committed themselves to paying was $1,195 in January. A year ago it
was $1,066. The all-time peak was April 1989 at $1,360, DataQuick
reported.</TE>

<HD>Tenant Is Tangled Up in Telephone-Line Confusion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Project Sentinel</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: There is a telephone line in my apartment that I can't use
because the previous tenant still has the line active with a small
local telephone company. The telephone company I have chosen
explained to the property owner how to remove the existing phone wire
from the utility box so my line can be installed. My line can't be
hooked up until this is done, but the owner says I have a working
line and he doesn't want to be bothered.</LD>
<LD>   Since the current telephone line and account belong to the
previous tenant, I don't have a working telephone. Can you help me?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: California Civil Code 1941.4 states that a landlord is
responsible for installing at least one usable telephone jack and
maintaining the inside telephone wiring in good working order.</LD>
<TE>   Even though it may be true that there is a working telephone jack
in your unit, the question is: Is it available to you? It seems the
answer is "no" since the telephone line is in another person's name.</TE>
<TE>   You could try to close this account, but chances are you would not
be permitted, since it is not in your name. Even if you were to plug
a telephone into this line, your calls would be billed to the
previous tenant, which could be an additional problem for you.</TE>
<TE>   The property owner needs to adhere to the civil code and fix this
problem. Contact a local housing mediation program for assistance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Must Landlord Install Lock That Tenant Wants?</TE>
<TE>   Q: I own a single-family rental house. The new tenant wants me to
install a deadbolt lock on the door between the garage and the
kitchen for additional safety. I have already put deadbolts on all
the entrance doors. Do I have to put a lock on this additional door?</TE>
<TE>   A: According to California Civil Code 1941.3(1), landlords are
required to provide deadbolt locks on main swinging entry doors
(except for sliding doors).</TE>
<TE>   In your case, the operative word is "entry." If the garage is not
enclosed, the door between the garage and the kitchen would be
considered an "entry" door and would require a deadbolt.</TE>
<TE>   If the garage is enclosed and has its own outside swinging entry
door and deadbolt lock, there is no requirement for the
garage/kitchen door to be equipped with a deadbolt. However, looking
at the bigger picture of your tenant's safety concerns and your
general duty to act reasonably and with due care, you may want to
install the additional deadbolt or give your tenant permission to
install the lock.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Collecting Rent Doesn't Require Real Estate Broker</TE>
<TE>   Q: My sister and I own a small rental duplex. I take care of
interviewing and selecting the tenants, and she is responsible for
collecting the rent and all other management duties. The current
tenants tell me that my sister must be a licensed real estate agent
or broker to collect the rent. Is this true?</TE>
<TE>   A: No. Real estate or broker licenses are not required for owners
or co-owners to perform rental management duties, such as collecting
the rent. This also applies to paid employees, such as resident
managers.</TE>
<TE>   Since your sister is a co-owner, she can continue to collect the
rent and perform required management duties without having a license.
Having said that, we suggest it is a good business practice to have a
manager who is experienced in all aspects of landlord-tenant matters,
efficient and knowledgeable of the law, and also a good communicator
and administrator. A manager can either cause problems or prevent
them for the property owner.</TE>
<TE>   Many local schools and community colleges offer management
classes. If your sister is not an experienced property manager,
perhaps she would be willing to undertake some basic training in the
field.</TE>
<TE>   Contact your local fair housing agency or legal services office to
see if they can provide training on landlord/tenant and fair housing
laws. Additionally, since your tenants have brought up this question,
maybe something has occurred between them and your sister that needs
to be addressed.</TE>

<HD>Block Off Routes Used by Termites</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To discourage termites from entering your home, remove their welcome
mat.</LD>
<LD>   Many homeowners not only invite termites, they unknowingly provide
superhighways with improperly planned and planted trees, shrubs and
mulch that create rush-hour traffic for the hungry hordes flowing
into their home.</LD>
<LD>   Termites are attracted to plants, shrubs and trees. Don't plant
anything within 18 inches of your home. Mulch is a problem, too. Use
a layer of inedible gravel or flagstone instead.</LD>
<TE>   Termites also need moisture, so be sure nearby ground slopes away
for water runoff. Also, large trees shouldn't be closer than 20 feet
because their extensive root systems form a perfect underground
highway system leading directly into your home.</TE>

<HD>They're Bouncing Back in 'Bama</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Former UCLA assistant Gottfried has
Crimson Tide seeking new heights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TUSCALOOSA, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Not since Wimp Sanderson glowered courtside in the "Plaid Palace" has
Alabama basketball seen such high times.</LD>
<LD>   The sixth-ranked Crimson Tide have already clinched their first
Southeastern Conference title in 15 years and locked up a return to
the NCAA tournament after a seven-year absence.</LD>
<LD>   In the process, Mark Gottfried's team has done its best to mend
the wounds left from NCAA sanctions to the state's most treasured
icon: the Tide football team.</LD>
<TE>   He's also accomplished a difficult feat at his alma mater: The
basketball team is, at the moment, the school's headline act, filling
up the 15,316-seat arena for six of the last eight home games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to see Alabama basketball back to where it was" in the
mid-1980s, said Sanderson, Gottfried's former coach, who was known
for his plaid sports coats and fiery sideline demeanor.</TE>
<TE>   The Tide (24-5, 12-3) secured their first SEC title since
Gottfried's senior year, in 1987, with Wednesday night's 73-68
victory over Auburn. That was also the last season Alabama had been
ranked in the Top 10.</TE>
<TE>   "Alabama's got all the tradition in football and I think Alabama's
been building tradition in basketball over the last 10 or 15 years,"
said Jim Farmer, Gottfried's college roommate and a former NBA and
Tide player.</TE>
<TE>   "I think his goal is to take it to a level it's never been.
Alabama's always been a team able to make it to the final 16 and that
kind of thing. He wants it to be a team that can make it to the Final
Four every year and be a Top 10 team."</TE>
<TE>   Gottfried is one of only four men to win an SEC title as a
basketball player and coach, joining Joel Eaves (Auburn), Joe B. Hall
(Kentucky) and C.M. Newton (Alabama/Kentucky).</TE>
<TE>   Former UCLA coach John Wooden cautioned Gottfried about the
potential pratfalls of returning to coach your alma mater.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'You know, Mark, sometimes expectations are a lot harder
for you at your alma mater,'" Gottfried, a former Bruins assistant
under Jim Harrick, said. "'First, other people want you to do well,
but you also put more pressure on yourself.'</TE>
<TE>   "He just advised me to be aware of that."</TE>
<TE>   Gottfried left UCLA following the Bruins' 1995 national
championship season to take over at Murray State, leading the Racers
to five postseason trips in six years.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no doubt in my mind" that Gottfried would be a
successful head coach, Wooden said in an interview Thursday. "Just
getting to know him personally and seeing him as a family man and
seeing what he did at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that he had a lot to do, as assistants always do, with
them winning the national championship in 1995."</TE>
<TE>   That was also the last year Alabama made it to the NCAA
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   As for coaching at your alma mater, Wooden said, "the advantages
outweigh the disadvantages," including the added pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "But I also told him that this is outside pressure and if you
permit outside pressure to affect you, you shouldn't be in this
business," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gottfried rebuilt from scratch his first two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   He inherited a team in 1998 that returned three upperclass
starters, but only had one returnee or signee, former sixth man Doc
Martin, that made much of an impact.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if people really can comprehend where our program
was and that we had to make the decision to rebuild the whole team,"
Gottfried said. "That was the hard part.</TE>
<TE>   "A number of times, you walk into a situation where you have
sophomores or juniors who are proven players at this level. We were
kind of void of that. There wasn't a lot to build on."</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, Gottfried brought in the class that would put his
stamp on the program. Among the newcomers were Erwin Dudley, Rod
Grizzard, Terrance Meade and Kenny Walker--all three-year starters.</TE>
<TE>   Grizzard and Dudley, the front-runner for SEC Player of the Year
honors, both already ranked among the school's top 20 career scorers.
Dudley is ninth in rebounding with 857.</TE>

<HD>Putting the Squeeze   on Grapefruit League</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Florida anxious about changes, because spring
training is big business to local communities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>David Cardwell, executive director of the Grapefruit League Assn.,
can't wait for this weekend's full slate of spring training
action--and the end of an off-season of uncertainty.</LD>
<LD>   But more changes are ahead for the Grapefruit League.</LD>
<LD>   Two teams, the Kansas City Royals and Texas Rangers, will leave
for Arizona after this season, dropping the league to 18 teams, the
fewest in a decade.</LD>
<TE>   The Florida Marlins want to move from their training venue in
Viera to Palm Beach County following an ownership change. Officials
in both communities are upset about that.</TE>
<TE>   Throw in the still-simmering debate over eliminating two major
league franchises, and there's little doubt why Cardwell is eagerly
waiting to hear the umpires shout "Play ball!"</TE>
<TE>   "For an off-season like this, you probably have to go back to
1990, when there was a lockout," Cardwell said from his Orlando
office, where he directs the Grapefruit League's lobbying
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Spring training is big business in Florida, so how the Grapefruit
League shakes out will resonate through the state.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, more than 1.5 million fans attended games at the
state's 19 ballparks. That means an estimated economic impact of $490
million and the creation of more than 5,500 full-time jobs, according
to the Florida Sports Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   That's why government and business leaders associated with the
Grapefruit League flinch every time commissioner Bud Selig mentions
contraction.</TE>
<TE>   "We're already going to lose close to $50 million with the Royals
and the Rangers," Florida Sports Foundation spokesman Nick Gandy
said. "We're not excited about seeing any less."</TE>
<TE>   Days after a thrilling World Series last fall, baseball officials
said eliminating two franchises was the best way to deal with
financial problems facing the league.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Twins and the Montreal Expos were said to be the
most likely targets. The Twins train in Fort Myers, on the southern
Gulf coast, and the Expos train in Jupiter, about 90 minutes north of
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   The speculation continued until just days before pitchers and
catchers reported to Florida. Baseball officials put the plan on
hold--for now.</TE>
<TE>   "[The Expos] are still here, but who knows for how much longer?"
asked Palm Beach County Administrator Robert Weisman. "I'm kind of
wondering who's going to come and see the games."</TE>
<TE>   Although anecdotal evidence around the Grapefruit League seems to
show attendance won't be hurt by contraction worries, Cardwell noted
that having league officials poor-mouth the sport seemed to be an odd
way of promotion.</TE>
<TE>   "Too often, I see the league and the teams get so preoccupied with
their own concerns that they forget what they're doing in terms of
relationships with their [spring training] venues," Cardwell said.</TE>
<TE>   Major league baseball responded to Cardwell's criticism by, in
essence, confirming it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they understand the economic situation in
baseball," Selig spokesman Rich Levin said. "We have a very serious
competitive imbalance problem that we have to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   While the threat of contraction isn't going away, the Royals and
Rangers are joining the Cactus League next year. The teams will share
a new stadium in Surprise, Ariz., a suburb of Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers have spent the last 16 springs in Port Charlotte, and
the Royals have trained at their Baseball City complex in Haines City
since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, we'll miss Kansas City," Cardwell said. "They love
Baseball City and would stay there as long as they could, but that
property is being sold by Anheuser-Busch and they're going to have to
get out.</TE>
<TE>   Cardwell said there wasn't anything Florida could do to keep the
Rangers. "I believe their current owner was committed to going to
Arizona, and it was a matter of working out a deal."</TE>
<TE>   In Arizona, 10 teams play in new stadiums and have long-term
commitments. The Cactus League hasn't lost a team to Florida since
the Cleveland Indians left before the 1993 season. Three teams have
left Florida for Arizona in the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   A team staying in Florida seems to be creating the most headaches
within the Grapefruit League.</TE>
<TE>   Just before spring training began, former Expos owner Jeffrey
Loria bought the Marlins and said he wanted to move the team's spring
venue from Viera, south of Cape Canaveral, to Jupiter's Roger Dean
Stadium. The Expos currently share that stadium with the St. Louis
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   "The Jupiter complex is one that would be very helpful in
introducing our fans slightly north of [Miami]. You want to draw from
everywhere," said Loria, who has a home in West Palm Beach County.
"It's a beautiful facility. The players I've had there before respond
very well to it. And we own it."</TE>
<TE>   The fallout from Loria's announcement was immediate--and
overwhelmingly negative.</TE>
<TE>   In Viera, Brevard County officials are upset that the Marlins
would break their lease, which runs another 15 years. Also, they
don't want to lose one of the top draws in the Grapefruit League.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say there's lot of disappointment," Brevard County
Manager Tom Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   And in Jupiter, government officials are concerned that a South
Florida team training in South Florida would hold down tourism.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the team, obviously, that will generate most economic
activity in the county," said Charles Lehmann, executive director of
the Palm Beach County Tourist Development Council. "And since we're
paying for the stadium in bed taxes, we want heads in beds. It's that
simple."</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins' move has set off another chain reaction in the
Grapefruit League.</TE>
<TE>   Brevard County is already looking for another team to play at
Space Coast Stadium. And where--or if--the Expos will play next year
is anyone's guess.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles and New York Mets have all
been mentioned as possible candidates for Viera.</TE>

<HD>Promoter Fights All-Boys Club</HD>
<DH>Boxing: A hairstylist by day, New Jersey woman is
matchmaker at heart. Her cards are increasing in popularity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The tomboy childhood, the muscle cars and the pool tables, the karate
lessons and the Friday nights spent watching boxing on TV--all could
be explained in one simple phrase.</LD>
<LD>   "My Dad wanted a son," Diane Fischer said, adding, "He also told
me I could do anything I wanted in the world."</LD>
<LD>   Fischer, 55, took him at his word. If only the sport of boxing
would.</LD>
<TE>   Five years after she decided to become a boxing promoter, the
brassy redhead with the salty vocabulary and the sequined suits is
still trying to make a name for herself.</TE>
<TE>   Since embarking on her unlikely second career in 1997, she has
staged 48 fight cards in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Louisiana and Panama, but is only now beginning to make money. Not a
lot, mind you. She still works a day job--hairstylist at a casino
salon--to make ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a woman hasn't helped me. I know it's an all-boys club. But
I'm not going away," she said. Fischer had taken her lumps before she
ever got into the fight game. By then, she'd been married and
divorced--three times--and suffered the loss of a 16-year-old
daughter in a traffic accident.</TE>
<TE>   But she never lost the interest in boxing that she acquired as a
child, watching the "Friday Night Fights" on TV or listening to the
radio by her father's side.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer, an only child, went fishing with her father. He taught
her how to fight, and introduced her to baseball, basketball and
boating. On her 16th birthday, she got a pool table. Then there was
the souped-up 1950 Ford coupe and the Austin Healy Sprite she raced
as a teen-ager.</TE>
<TE>   Married at 18, she worked various jobs while daughter Dawn was
growing up. She earned a brown belt in karate but never boxed.</TE>
<TE>   Going to see fights in Atlantic City casinos in the 1980s, she
noticed two things: the boxers were mismatched and no local fighters
were on the cards.</TE>
<TE>   So she decided to try her hand at promoting. How tough could it
be?</TE>
<TE>   Very tough--especially for a neophyte, or someone living in
Vineland, N.J., a rural southern New Jersey farming community, or a
woman. And she was all three.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no school for this," Fischer said. "I couldn't call up
Don King and say 'How do you become a promoter?' So I learned as I
went."</TE>
<TE>   At first, it was women's boxing, a novelty act for the undercards
of men's matches. The next year, she staged an all-women's fight card
at Tropicana Casino Resort with fighters Dora "The Destroyer" Webber,
Eva "Black Magic" Young and Vienna "The Stalker" Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Now, her Dee Lee Promotions has 16 fighters under contract--14 men
and two women. Though she mainly promotes men, she includes at least
one women's bout on every card.</TE>
<TE>   She turns the tables on convention whenever she gets a chance.
Instead of hiring young female models to do the job, Fischer's fights
have "round card guys."</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, she used Carlo Maiorano, the muscle-bound
29-year-old son of a friend, as the round card guy for a 10-round
featherweight fight between Kelsey Jeffries and Alisa Ashley.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing camouflage pants, combat boots, a baseball cap turned
backward, no shirt and a temporary Dee Lee Boxing tattoo on his back,
he strutted around the ring, eliciting boos from the crowd in the
Bally's Atlantic City ballroom.</TE>
<TE>   The night's first two bouts were solid, well-matched fights,
prompting a fan to yell out to Fischer from his seat. "Hey that's
some pretty fancy matchmaking, Diane," the man said.</TE>
<TE>   She is increasingly gaining respect.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been tough for her," said Larry Hazzard, New Jersey's boxing
commissioner. "There have been obstacles put in her way,
intentionally. Doors have been opened to other promoters that have
been closed to her. But with all she's had to endure, she's starting
to come around. Now, she's got the connections. Fighters are
beginning to look her way."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia boxing promoter Russell Peltz said Fischer won't make
it big until she signs big-name fighters, which in turn will lead to
TV coverage of her events.</TE>
<TE>   "She's scrappy," he said. "She doesn't let hard times deter her. I
told her years ago it would really be tough for her, not because
she's a woman but because it's so tough to get TV dates. But she's
persevered. She's hung in there."</TE>
<TE>   Fischer doesn't blame her struggles on sexism.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only put on the fights you can put on. I can't offer
Tyson or Lennox Lewis," she said. "But the guys I put on are good
fighters. I hear my fans walking out saying, 'That was a good fight.'</TE>
<TE>   "You can't tell me I'm not going to put shows on. I may not make
any money at it, but my fighters are fighting. I've never once
thought about giving it up," she said. The 81-year-old father who
inspired her now sits in the seats at her fights, thrilled at what
she has become.</TE>
<TE>   "You ain't kidding, I'm proud of her," Jack Trevethan said. "I
can't brag about her, but she's done pretty good."</TE>

<HD>She's a College Senior Who Lives Up to That Title</HD>
<DH>Golf: Judy Street, 61 and using her last year of college
eligibility 44 years after she started, is just one of the girls on
the Barry University team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI SHORES, Fla.</DL>
<LD>School days are busy for Barry University golfer Judy Street, who
typically rises at 6 a.m., works out, studies, practices with her
teammates and then attends classes at night.</LD>
<LD>   She also finds time to keep in touch with her four children.</LD>
<LD>   And her six grandchildren.</LD>
<TE>   At age 61, Judy Street is a college senior in more ways than one.
The 1959 intercollegiate champion is now the No. 3 player for the
Barry Buccaneers, and perhaps the oldest athlete in NCAA history.</TE>
<TE>   "It has made me young again," she says, the words accompanied by a
smile and coated with the soft drawl of her native Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   As Judy Eller she was the U.S. junior champion in 1957 and 1958.
She played at the University of Miami but left school after three
years to get married.</TE>
<TE>   "I got my Mrs. degree," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Street quit golf at 30 to raise a family and took up the game
again 23 years later in 1994. She decided last year to finish her
degree and use her final year of eligibility at Barry, a Division II
Catholic school.</TE>
<TE>   "She's incredible," says freshman Renee Trudeau, at 18 the
youngest player on the team. "I think of her as my grandmother, but
she doesn't act any different from any of us. We talk about our
weekends and joke about how much we partied. It's great."</TE>
<TE>   NCAA officials say that while they keep no records in the
category, they're unaware of anyone as old as Street competing in a
sport.</TE>
<TE>   If 61 is a record, it deserves an asterisk because Street hardly
looks her age. Tan, trim and tall at 5-foot-8, she appears fit enough
to carry a golf bag for 36 holes, which she does in tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   But her hair makes her stand out even a fairway away.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her the gray hair has got to go," says LPGA Hall of Famer
JoAnne Carner, who has been Street's close friend since childhood.
"She's out there with kids looking like a grandma."</TE>
<TE>   Until she swings a club. Street hits 220 to 240 yards off the
tee--farther than when she was young, and farther than most of her
teammates--and still hits a 5-iron 150 yards.</TE>
<TE>   There's something to be said for experience.</TE>
<TE>   "She has a very refined swing," coach Roger White says. "And she
makes the best banana bread you've ever had."</TE>
<TE>   Putting, which was Judy Eller's strong suit, has kept Judy
Street's average score this season in the mid-80s. She ruefully
recalls missing three one-footers in a single round.</TE>
<TE>   Street bought a new putter for the first time in 40 years but
admits the problem is mostly nerves.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a good putter when I was younger," she says. "I thought,
`Why can't people putt? It's so simple.' If I didn't make every
10-foot putt, I'd had a bad day."</TE>
<TE>   The definition of a bad day is different now, and Street hasn't
had many since commencing her college comeback.</TE>
<TE>   It began with a casual conversation at a Barry athletic banquet.
Street attended as a guest, and as she talked with coach White,
someone jokingly mentioned that she had eligibility left.</TE>
<TE>   With research, White determined Street did indeed have one year
remaining in Division II. Eligibility in Division I ends five years
after an athlete's initial enrollment, but in Division II there's no
such restriction.</TE>
<TE>   White encouraged Street to return to school, complete her degree
and join the team. She decided it sounded like fun, although she had
reservations about playing with a bunch of youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, `How are these kids going to accept a 61-year-old
woman? What's she trying to prove?' I'd probably think the same
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Those fears were unfounded, and teammates welcomed her warmly,
especially when they saw her level of commitment. Street hired a
personal trainer and sought counsel from Carner to get her game into
shape.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thoroughly amazed that she was going to attempt it," Carner
says. "But she's hitting the ball better now than she did as an
amateur."</TE>
<TE>   Age imposes some limitations, however, as Street discovered one
day shooting baskets in the gym.</TE>
<TE>   "I had these dreams of being a two-sport athlete," she jokes.
"That quelled very quickly after I shot for two hours and couldn't
walk for three days. So just golf. I've got to grow old gracefully."</TE>
<TE>   Her college career will end in May, perhaps with the Buccaneers'
first berth in the NCAA tournament. She'll remain in school until
December, when she earns a degree in liberal studies. Street made the
dean's list the first semester with a 3.9 grade-point.</TE>
<TE>   Her taste in subjects--anthropology, philosophy, literature and
film--has changed a lot since her college career began 44 years ago.
She's pleased to note that the world of women's sports has also
changed.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have any equipment back then," she says. "A sports bra
was a Playtex Living Bra. You paid your own way, and we didn't think
anything about it. Now Roger says, `How many golf balls do you need?
Here's a club. Would you like to order some shoes?' It's a wonderful
opportunity for these young girls."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, life was a lot different in the 1940s in Old Hickory, Tenn.,
where Street grew up the daughter of a golf pro. She says the first
time she walked was on a putting green, and six decades later she's
retracing those steps.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder she feels young again.</TE>

<HD>West Is Satisfied to Be Standing in the Shadows</HD>
<DH>College basketball: NBA may have to wait another year for
Xavier center, who doesn't seek the spotlight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>David West would love to be heard and not seen.</LD>
<LD>   If he had to make a living away from the basketball court, one of
the country's most renowned college players would pick an anonymous
profession -- studio announcer.</LD>
<LD>   "You know how when you watch the movies there's the preview guy? I
want to do that," said West, who has the smooth voice to pull it off.
"You can't see him. You don't know what he looks like, but you hear
his voice. I'd love to be the guy in the background doing the voice."</LD>
<TE>   As much as he wishes he could, Xavier's 6-foot-8 center can't stay
in the background anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Playing at a small Jesuit school that values degrees over dunks,
West has become a star while resisting stardom. NBA scouts watch
every game, national publications list his name and giddy fans
approach for autographs wherever he goes.</TE>
<TE>   It's a taste of what players on the nation's top-ranked teams deal
with regularly. West would rather sit and have a bowl of mint
chocolate chip ice cream in his apartment than go out on the town and
savor celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I could deal with what Kansas or Duke goes
through," West said, his easy smile replaced by a frown. "That's not
me. I just don't like to be in the spotlight. I'd rather be in the
shadows. I want to be successful, but I'd rather just do what I do
quietly."</TE>
<TE>   He's been able to do that most of his life. Attention took its
time finding him.</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing to stamp West as a future star when he was
growing up in a middle-class neighborhood of Teaneck, N.J. In
addition to sports, he was first-chair tuba in the school band and
played the drums at the  church his family attended.</TE>
<TE>   West has two brothers, one sister and few friends who remain
close. Much of his boyhood was spent on the blacktop in the family's
backyard, where his father put up a homemade backboard anchored to a
tree.</TE>
<TE>   Amos West admired the Lakers' James Worthy for his no-frills
approach, and he passed his philosophy along to his second-oldest
son.</TE>
<TE>   Just play, he told him. Don't show off.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not shy. He just doesn't glory in himself," said Amos West,
a retired postal supervisor. "He doesn't pat himself on the back. He
just plays the game. If anybody else wants to make a big deal, fine.</TE>
<TE>   "When he has a game and then calls here, we ask how he did. He
says he did all right. That's all he says. We have to go on the
Internet to look up his stats."</TE>
<TE>   West was small enough to play guard in grade school. That changed
between his freshman and sophomore years at high school, when he grew
five inches and got moved under the basket.</TE>
<TE>   It took time to learn to his new position. The growth spurt left
him gangly and uncoordinated. He wasn't considered a top college
prospect.</TE>
<TE>   He spent a year at Hargrave Military Academy to strengthen his
grades and his game, and Xavier was one of the first teams to show a
strong interest. He wouldn't forget it.</TE>
<TE>   West blossomed as the season went along. Bigger schools came
calling and offering scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   West was loyal to Xavier, a 6,500-student school that felt right.
His mother, Harriett, liked the school's emphasis on academics --
every senior player has graduated since the 1985-86 season.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take him long to settle in. West led the Atlantic 10 in
rebounding as a freshman with 9.1 per game. He also averaged 11.7
points and started getting national attention.</TE>
<TE>   He made dramatic improvement as a sophomore, scoring 17.8 points
per game with 10.9 rebounds as he led Xavier to the NCAA tournament.
His numbers have been comparable this season (18.3 points, 10.4
rebounds) despite a severe ankle sprain early in the season and
double- and triple-teams by defenses determined to stop him.</TE>
<TE>   Xavier has no other prominent front-line player, so West gets most
of the attention -- off the court as well as on.</TE>
<TE>   "It's interesting to me to watch my little boy go somewhere and
people are calling his name -- 'Oh, that's David West!"' Harriett
West said. "So far, he's dealing with it. I told him, 'David, you
just have to learn. This is part of your life now. It's not going to
get any better."'</TE>
<TE>   The attention has taken a new twist. Everywhere he goes these
days, West gets asked if he'll break Xavier's tradition and become
the first to leave early for the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "I get asked that five to 10 times a day," West said. "Yesterday I
was in the grocery store and a guy said, 'How are you doing? Are you
coming back next year?"'</TE>
<TE>   West tries not to think about it, focusing on tournament time
while leaving the big decision for later.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell him it's not a decision," said one NBA scout, sitting
courtside for a recent game. "He should stay for one more year. That
one more year would really help him."</TE>
<TE>   Scouts won't talk for attribution because he's an underclassman.
They concur that he won't be a lottery pick if he leaves school
early, but could develop into one if he stays at Xavier for another
year, adds 10 or 12 pounds and gets more experience playing away from
the basket.</TE>
<TE>   West's father believes that is what his son will do. Xavier has
emphasized front-line players in recruiting, so West should have more
help if he stays for his senior year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he'll go back," Amos West said. "They have a big class
coming in. And he likes being with those guys."</TE>
<TE>   His parents will support him in whatever he decides. They'll also
continue to give the advice that has shaped him.</TE>
<TE>   "When I talk to him before games," Harriett West said, "I tell
him, 'Be blessed and do your best. And remember who you are."'</TE>

<HD>Here's One Man in Favor of a Tyson-Lewis Fight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL WILBON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Put the Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson fight right here in Washington,
right now.</LD>
<LD>   I can't believe there are so many moralists running amok, or that
there's even this much debate. If the District of Columbia can't put
on this fight, it might as well stop bidding on the 2012 Summer
Olympics right now.</LD>
<LD>   This isn't a referendum on Tyson; he's been a disgrace often. Most
people agree on that, or at the very least acknowledge his presence
anywhere raises legitimate issues, but we'll return to Tyson later.</LD>
<TE>   This is about Washington's ability to stage an international event
that will generate between $6 million and $10 million for the town's
economy. It's about putting people to work who in many cases haven't
worked since last September. It's about showcasing Washington as a
place good for something other than being home to congressional hot
air and an embarrassing murder rate. It's about stimulating the local
economy by attracting other major events that could put people to
work for longer than two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the lawyers and journalists and politicians who comprise
Official Washington haven't noticed, maybe their worlds haven't been
particularly upset since Sept. 11, but let's not kid ourselves; the
local economy is in trouble. We're not a blue-collar town; D.C. needs
tourism for its service industry. The people who drive limousines and
work in the catering business and work at the hotels need a boost.</TE>
<TE>   A Lennox Lewis-Mike Tyson fight can't solve those problems, but it
can jump-start the process. The D.C. Board of Trade ought to be
ashamed to have come out against the fight. Maybe some of its members
don't understand the economics of boxing sufficiently to realize an
event this large is more than one night of prize fighting in one
arena; it's days of international visitors, of eating and drinking
and shopping and riding around. People who come to fights spend huge
amounts of money, and if they can't spend it in a Las Vegas casino,
they're going to spend it somewhere. That's mandatory in the culture
of the fight game. How foolish would we feel to see folks spending
that dough elsewhere, like Detroit?</TE>
<TE>   Before going any further, let me declare my personal friendship
with Michael Brown of the D.C. Boxing and Wrestling Commission. This
bashing of Brown is wrong. If he hadn't tried to attract the fight,
then who would have? He declined to take commission fees when he
joined the commission and isn't getting paid a cent for trying to
bring the fight here. By doing so, he attempts to promote D.C. He's
not going to promote the fight.</TE>
<TE>   If we're really lucky, staging Lewis-Tyson will beget other huge
events, which is important for several reasons. Presuming the city
asks Abe Pollin to host the fight at MCI Center, it would continue to
make the arena an economic stimulus downtown, which in case you
haven't noticed still isn't Broadway in New York or Michigan Avenue
in Chicago. I've had disagreements with Pollin over the years on
various issues, but never on his willingness to stick out his neck
for the city of Washington. Whether it's going after an event like
the NBA All-Star game (which some folks feared would start World War
III), building an arena or sending poor kids to college, Pollin has
always done right by D.C.</TE>
<TE>   And Mayor Anthony Williams needs to go to Pollin and guarantee
security for Pollin's building, the one Pollin financed out of his
own pocket, then work with pay-per-view television backers' money and
all the resources available to secure the arena and the streets
around it. Let's not be naive; the gangsta nation that often follows
Tyson's fights can't be allowed to disrupt this town.</TE>
<TE>   Is this a huge challenge? Yes. But it's nothing compared with
putting on the Olympics. And in talking to Olympic insiders over the
last week, it's clear that they feel D.C., if it's going to be a
serious player in trying to secure the bid for the 2012 Summer Games,
has to start proving it can stage and secure a series of complex
events of international consequence.</TE>
<TE>   As one person with intimate knowledge of IOC interests explained,
"The city is going to have to try and attract auto races, bigger NCAA
basketball events, more international soccer events, figure skating
and gymnastics events. D.C. has to be more creative, in the wake of
9/11, in trying to attract event business. Are the critics of this
fight aware of this?"</TE>
<TE>   Either they're not aware, or so obsessed with Tyson's part of this
equation that they're ready to let him hold the city hostage. Let's
face it, the objections to this fight are about Tyson. And I'm not
going to spend one sentence defending anything he's done the last 10
years. The D.C. Boxing Commission and whoever promotes the fight has
to have one simple conversation with Tyson: If you do anything
outside of the rules of boxing, you will forfeit your purse and we're
putting that in the contract.</TE>
<TE>   And you know why Tyson will say yes to that?</TE>
<TE>   Because he needs the payday. The District of Columbia and many of
its residents need the payday. It's time to stop cowering and put on
the fight. It's just a fight. An event we can handle.</TE>

<HD>THE PIECES DON'T FIT</HD>
<DH>Jayson Williams, a Former Self-Described 'Knucklehead' Who
Became One of the NBA's Most Respected and Wittiest Players and Made
a Second Career as a TV Commentator, Faces Manslaughter Charges,
Seemingly as a Result of a Cavalier Attitude Toward Gun Safety</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL POWELL</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>MILFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>MILFORD, N.J. -- No one here is sure how to reconcile the two Jayson
Williamses. There's the fellow who rides a gleaming chrome beast of a
motorcycle and walks into a local joint and tells the bartender: I'm
buying drinks for the house.</LD>
<LD>   He's the 6-foot-10 bon vivant, a pool-shooting pal of carpenters
and electricians and celebrities, too. Impossibly wealthy and witty,
he's got a bestselling book on his days in the National Basketball
Association--"Loose Balls"--and a career as a sports commentator on
NBC-TV.</LD>
<LD>   He throws fundraisers for kids with cancer and has adopted the
children of his dead sisters. A few weeks back, he took an arthritic
goat from a local animal shelter and brought it to be cared for at
his 31,000-square-foot mansion, a place named "Who Knew?"</LD>
<TE>   The other Jayson Williams faces manslaughter charges. He's a
retired jock fond of guns and booze, a fellow who threw a party on
Feb. 14 and, prosecutors say, twirled a loaded shotgun--until it went
off and the blast hit his chauffeur full in the chest.</TE>
<TE>   The limousine driver died in Williams' bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, 34, walked into Kingwood Township state police barracks
this past Monday. The police fingerprinted and photographed him, and
Williams posted $250,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he walked out, his life had become a cliche, rendered
in news accounts as that of another pro athlete with too much money,
too much arrogance and too little judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Except nothing about Williams' life or this incident tracks quite
so neatly. This is a man about whom Sports Illustrated wrote in 1999:
"More than any other player, Williams makes sure that the face of the
NBA has a smile on it." Even prosecutors have noted there is no
evidence that Williams intended to hurt anyone that night.</TE>
<TE>   No one even says he was angry.</TE>
<TE>   But Williams is a retired pro athlete. And he has discovered that
life's defining moments are as often accidental.</TE>
<TE>   Williams came of age on Manhattan's Lower East Side, a
self-described "knucklehead." His mother was of Italian descent, his
father African American. In the sensitive argot of his neighborhood,
kids nicknamed him "Zebra."</TE>
<TE>   He fills his book with tales of his scrapes and belt-straps
swatted across his butt. When he was 12, a junkie mugged his oldest
sister, Linda. She survived the attack but contracted AIDS from the
blood transfusions.</TE>
<TE>   She died when he was 15. Five years later, his other sister,
Laura, also died of AIDS. They both left children behind. Williams,
raised a Catholic, felt adrift from any notion of God's mercy.</TE>
<TE>   He was 6-6 when he arrived at Christ the King High School in
Queens, a hoops powerhouse. A half-dozen pros once worked their way
through its halls.</TE>
<TE>   At St. John's University, Williams tossed a metal chair at a fan,
argued with his coach and threatened to quit a dozen times. Then he
shut up and stayed and graduated, crediting his coach, Louie
Carnesecca, and his father, E.J. Williams.</TE>
<TE>   His early years in the NBA were not auspicious.</TE>
<TE>   He was traded from Phoenix to Philadelphia, just another brawling
scrub best known as Charles Barkley's after-hours running partner.
"He probably cost me about four years off my life," Williams wrote.
"Because of [him], my liver is about the size of two footballs."</TE>
<TE>   The narrative works this way: Williams gets traded to New Jersey,
meets a former NBA great--coach Paul Silas--and is persuaded to turn
his life around. Williams buys into that story, sort of.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a big contract in 1998 because I'm a good citizen, and a
good teammate and I don't do some of the wild stuff I used to," he
wrote. "But mostly I got the money because I rebound."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, his career ended just two years later, after he suffered
two bone fractures. But the Nets agreed to make good on his $86
million contract. He began a career as a television analyst.</TE>
<TE>   He has adopted two of his sisters' children, donated $2.5 million
to St. John's and devoted hundreds of hours to raising money for AIDS
charities.</TE>
<TE>   But the other Jayson Williams never quite disappeared. In 1994,
Williams fired a pistol at the hubcap of a van parked outside the
Nets' arena. Williams was arrested, although his police record was
expunged after he took out newspaper advertisements urging children
not to use guns.</TE>
<TE>   About two years ago, Williams was hanging out at his estate,
barbecuing for Jets wide receiver Wayne Chrebet and some other guys.
They walked over to his private shooting range, where everyone took
turns firing a .50-caliber Desert Eagle.</TE>
<TE>   Williams fired without checking who was around him. His blast
missed Chrebet's face by inches, the concussion knocking the football
player unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   The moment played as comedy in his telling, and didn't scare him
away from guns.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 13, Williams was in a splendid mood. He went down to
Pennsylvania to see a Harlem Globetrotters game. Then Costas "Gus"
Christofi, the limousine driver, took him and his friends back to
Williams's mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Williams insisted on giving everyone, Christofi included, a tour
of the mansion. They walked past the indoor basketball court, the
pool, the par-3 golf course and the movie theater. At some time after
midnight, as they walked upstairs, Williams playfully twirled a
shotgun in his hand, according to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   The gun went off and Christofi was hit. Prosecutors are still
examining whether Williams was drunk.</TE>
<TE>   Williams has remained secluded in his mansion. His lawyer and
agent did not respond to requests for an interview. His friends say
he feels terrible, he's praying. He had hoped this home would stand
as a symbol of everything that had gone right in his life.</TE>

<DL>MONTEVERDE, Costa Rica</DL>
<LD>Part of the thrill of coming to Monteverde, the site of this
country's oldest and best-known nature reserve, is seeing the
glorious views of the Gulf of Nicoya and the quick succession of
ecosystems you encounter on the rough and rocky road that leads from
the coastal lowlands into the Cordillera de Tilaran.</LD>
<LD>   Alas, it was a pleasure my wife, Stacie, and I would not know
during our whirlwind New Year's holiday--because we ended up making
the drive at night, thanks to our tardiness, a fairly natural
occurrence here, where there is so much to see. So we missed the
spectacular views, but, given the darkness, the lack of guardrails
and the condition of the road, we were lucky that's all we missed.
Every bone-jarring pothole on the 11/2-lane dirt road brought us that
much closer to bird-watchers' heaven, in the literal and spiritual
senses.</LD>
<LD>   The last 18 miles took nearly two hours, even in a
four-wheel-drive vehicle. We had hitched a ride with our newfound
Canadian friends, Hoi and Carolyn, and by the time we arrived, we
felt like an overprocessed martini: shaken and stirred.</LD>
<TE>   Monteverde (literally "green mountain") is one of the most fertile
places in the world to watch for--but not necessarily see--birds.
Lots of them, in fact: about half of Costa Rica's 850 species, as
well as 100 species of mammals, 120 kinds of reptiles and amphibians,
and 2,500 types of plants, including 420 identified species of
orchids. In the modern world of biodiversity, Monteverde is a mega
hot spot.</TE>
<TE>   By the time we rumbled in, however, Monteverde was decidedly
chilly. A wet wind had begun howling through copses of shadowy trees
in a suspiciously untropical way. Much too late for dinner, we
retreated to our room to see what morning would bring.</TE>
<TE>   In dawn's misty gray light we could clearly see that Monteverde,
the mountaintop community of 4,000 about 150 miles west of San Jose,
was nothing like Tamarindo, the Pacific Coast surfers' beach where we
had watched giant leatherback turtles nest two nights before. And
except for the Wild West streetscape, thick with hotels and trail
outfitters, we detected no traces of Monteverde's American roots.</TE>
<TE>   Monteverde was founded in 1951 by Quakers from Alabama who
preferred emigration to the threat of being drafted during the Korean
War. They chose Costa Rica because progressive President Jose Maria
Figueres, known as Don Pepe, had abolished the nation's standing army
after winning a 40-day-long civil war. Once here, they selected
isolated Monteverde to build their Quaker community. They took up
dairy farming because it didn't involve killing the cows and because
processed cheese was one of the few products that wouldn't spoil on
the weeks-long trip down the mountain by oxcart.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure the purity of their cows' water supply, the
environmentally savvy Quakers set aside about 1,350 acres of
regenerating mountaintop forest. And so things stood until American
biologists George and Harriet Powell were drawn to the area by the
1964 discovery of the 1-inch-long neon orange sapo dorado, or golden
toad. The Quakers gave 800 acres in perpetuity as a wildlife
sanctuary to be managed by the Tropical Science Center, a nonprofit
Costa Rican research organization. Three years later, an adjacent
tract of 1,370 acres was acquired with assistance from the World
Wildlife Fund, and Monteverde, the eco-destination, was born.
(Unfortunately it was too late for the sapo dorado, last seen in 1989
and now presumed extinct.)</TE>
<TE>   Today "greater" Monteverde consists of five separate but
contiguous private reserves, the largest of which is the Children's
Eternal Cloud Forest, a 22,000-acre reserve begun in 1988 when
Swedish schoolchildren, concerned about the world's rain forests,
pitched in to purchase about 15 acres for $1,500. Adding to the
confusion, the community of Monteverde is really a strung-out amalgam
of three settlements that abut the reserves to the south and west:
Quaker-controlled Monteverde proper (where bars are still taboo);
tico (what the Costa Ricans call themselves)/gringo (what they call
Americans)-controlled Santa Elena; and Cerro Plano, where we had
settled in at the chalet-style Hotel Heliconia.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel, one of the area's first and most respected eco-lodges,
is neat, clean and spacious and has its own 10-acre finca, or ranch.
We were awakened by the sounds of horses whinnying for their
breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   Lingering over homemade granola and locally grown Monteverde
coffee at the Paradise Bagel Cafe, we plotted our day as we listened
to vintage Bob Marley, watched hummingbirds feed in the garden below
and, most encouraging of all, saw the first shafts of sunshine cleave
through the swift-moving clouds.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward we walked down to collect Hoi and Carolyn at the
Monteverde Inn. They had long finished their breakfast of banana
pancakes but had become mesmerized by a family of cara blanca monkeys
(white-faced capuchins) cavorting in the enormous ficus tree outside
the dining-room window.</TE>
<TE>   Across a clearing overhead, a pair of green, long-tailed parrots
raced for cover. Things were definitely looking up. Perhaps we would
glimpse the elusive green and red quetzal, Costa Rica's resplendent
national bird.</TE>
<TE>   While visiting my uncle, a recent retiree, in San Jose, we had
been told repeatedly that the Santa Elena Reserve was where we should
go--"what Monteverde was like 20 years ago" was the stock phrase. But
it was the original Monteverde we had come to see, so we piled back
into the faithful four-wheel-drive steed and negotiated the four
miles to the end of the road.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way we passed the Monteverde Coffee roaster and the new
cheese factory, both of which offer tours, samplings and sales and
are worth a more leisurely visit. But I did insist on a quick stop to
see the "modern" Quaker compound. Out back a middle-aged bearded man,
wearing a distinctly dated madras print shirt and pushing his
children on a 1950s-era swing, directed me to the original
meetinghouse, now incorporated into the classroom/adult education
building.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, plain wooden benches, arranged in an octagon, were
passively presided over by a mildewed black-and-white engraving of
17th century founder George Fox. The tranquil simplicity here made it
clear that Fox's mid-20th century adherents had not only successfully
established but also maintained their way of life.</TE>
<TE>   With a mile still to go, we had our first wildlife sighting: A
Land Rover taxi had broken down in the middle of the road, disgorging
six Germans who were steamed at their driver's insistence that they
still pay full fare. Colorful but a fairly common species here, to be
sure.</TE>
<TE>   Our late start that day ended up costing us as well: The reserve,
which allows only 120 people in at a time, was full. "Maybe a
half-hour," we were politely told, and then we were promptly directed
to the adjacent photo gallery/gift shop to observe the aerial antics
of vibrantly colored hummingbirds as they descended on plastic
feeders in quick-strike sorties.</TE>
<TE>   Long before we tired of watching the hummers, our number was
called, courtesy of a party of 20 early risers who had come, seen and
departed. But the guided tours were still full, leaving us to our own
devices on the popular but still not populated Bosque Nuboso (Cloud
Forest) Trail.</TE>
<TE>   No sooner had we passed through the mahogany ticket barrier than
the practical difference between a rain forest (what Monteverde is
commonly called) and a cloud forest (what it really is) became
dramatically apparent: floor-to-canopy foliage. Monteverde gets as
much as 13 feet of precipitation a year, some of it as rain, some of
it as a mist from those moisture-laden clouds. Seemingly every
exposed surface is covered with growth, the natural result of which
is a continuous and aesthetically overwhelming living tapestry of
greens and browns.</TE>
<TE>   It also makes for challenging bird-watching. In nearly three hours
we caught fleeting sight of only a handful of resident avians, and
even then only when they flitted deeper into the forest. A guide
would have been able to tell us only what we had missed.</TE>
<TE>   But for us, the cloud forest itself was the primary attraction,
and it wasn't going anywhere, except in and out of the periodic mist.
During our leisurely three-mile walk we passed through six ecological
zones, including a ridge-top dwarf forest where steady winds have
stunted the growth of otherwise normal trees.</TE>
<TE>   The sunlight rarely penetrated to the forest floor, but the
remnants of the morning's rain could constantly be heard working
their way down through the overlapping layers of foliage. It was
everything a good cloud forest should be--and that even the best rain
forests can't be.</TE>
<TE>   Until about 10 years ago these simple but magnificent walks in the
clouds constituted the "Monteverde experience." But realizing that
even nature lovers love variety, eco-entrepreneurs began coming up
with other things to do. Today the gamut of second-generation
eco-attractions includes a snake garden, a butterfly garden, a frog
garden, an orchid garden, an ecological farm and an aerial tram near
the reserves. But nothing pulls in modern adventure travelers and
leaves them gasping for more like a canopy tour.</TE>
<TE>   I've been on canopy tours before--swaying metal bridges strung
between towering trees. And Monteverde certainly has these, except
that they call them "sky walks." A canopy tour, by contrast, is not a
tour at all but a daredevil amusement park ride in which you zip
across thin steel cables that are strung through and over (as much as
400 feet over) the cloud forest, suspended only by a small metal
pulley and a body harness. It's fun, it's exhilarating, but it's
definitely not EC (environmentally correct), despite the fact that
you are seeing the cloud forest from the monkey's point of view.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose we could have been traditionalists and gone with the
"Original Canopy Tour," but Sky Trek's claims of being the biggest
and tallest of Monteverde's canopy tours swayed us. And so, too, did
Freddy, our tour guide/bilingual stand-up comedian whose job it was
to see that our group of eight was properly equipped, physically and
mentally, for the two-hour, 10-ride challenge.</TE>
<TE>   I readily admit to having been a bit nervous (perhaps post-9/11
fear of flying), but after the first short ride it was obvious that
the body harness was up to its job. On the second, I had time to look
down--and I realized that if I did fall (and no one has yet), the
outcome wasn't going to be materially affected by whether I dropped
50 or 250 feet. From there it was all downhill, so to speak.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn, Hoi and Stacie, daredevils all, enjoyed it even more than
I. Hoi even zipped across on one trip without holding onto the pulley
so he could take pictures.</TE>
<TE>   By the time we had completed our thrilling final run, a
1,400-footer, the late afternoon mists had swirled back in, bringing
the promise of another chilly night. We raced the tropical darkness
back to the Hotel Heliconia for a warm shower and an early dinner,
for with little to do (or see) after dark, there is no sense staying
up late.</TE>
<TE>   Not wanting to get back on those appetite-suppressing roads, we
decided to walk to the nearby Sapo Dorado Hotel and Restaurant, run
by the descendants of one of Monteverde's original Quaker families.
Over local cheeses and a bottle of perfectly adequate Concha y Toro
Chardonnay (Costa Rica's most popular brand), we relived our day in
the cloud forest.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner was very good--rosemary chicken for me, sea bass for
Stacie--but dessert proved especially memorable: cubes of
coffee-flavored gelatin under a dollop of fresh whipped cream. It's
called the temblor, in honor of the earthquakes that are common here.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning also broke misty and cold, but by midmorning the
mist had burned off, and we started back toward San Jose and our
flight home. We would never see a quetzal (or most of Monteverde's
399 other avian species, for that matter), so to remind us of what we
had missed, we bought a life-size, hand-carved wooden quetzal for our
wall.</TE>
<TE>   But we didn't miss any of the glorious views as we jounced our way
on a four-hour trip down Monteverde's eastern flank toward aquamarine
Lake Arenal and the still-active Arenal Volcano. We emerged from the
mists of our eco-adventure far more stirred than shaken.</TE>

<TE>   Guidebook: Checking Out Life in Costa Rica's Clouds</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: From LAX, direct service to San Jose is available
on LACSA and TACA. Restricted round-trip fares begin at $627.</TE>
<TE>   From San Jose there are two routes to Monteverde. The traditional
"direct" route on the legendary dirt road approaches from the
Pan-American Highway to the west, and the "new" route comes from the
east via Tilaran and Lake Arenal. Many travelers arrive one way and
depart the other. Both can be traveled by rental car (four-wheel
drive is strongly recommended) or public or private bus. Public bus
fares from San Jose begin at $5, private about $50.</TE>
<TE>   When to go: During the rainy season from May through October,
roads can become almost impassable, discouraging all but the most
dedicated naturalists or die-hard adventurers. On the other hand,
during the heart of the snowbird season from December to March,
accommodations can become scarce (and more expensive), and tours and
other activities frequently sell out.</TE>
<TE>   Telephones: To call the numbers below from the U.S., dial 011 (the
international dialing code), 506 (country code for Costa Rica) and
the local number.</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: There is no shortage of accommodations in the
Monteverde area, with options ranging from basic rooms to eco-chic.</TE>
<TE>   We stayed at the Swiss chalet-style Hotel Heliconia in Cerro Plano
(mailing address: Aptdo. 10921-1000 San Jose), 645-5109, fax
645-5007, www .costaricabureau.com/heliconia.htm, paying $95 for a
spacious double in the high season.</TE>
<TE>   Other centrally located, top-end accommodations include the Sapo
Dorado, 645-5010, fax 645-5180, www.sapodorado.com, doubles $74-$99;
and the Monteverde Cloud Forest Lodge, 645-5058, fax 645-5168,
www.monteverdeinfo.com/cloud-forest-lodge, doubles $60-$70. For a
little more opulence and setting, try the Monteverde Lodge, 645-5057,
fax 645-5126, www.monteverdelodge.com, where doubles are $115-$130
during high season.</TE>
<TE>   Where to eat: Where you eat is going to be determined primarily by
where you stay. After a full day of outdoor activity there is little
incentive to venture too far down Monteverde's dark, hilly dirt
roads. As a result, most hotels have their own restaurants, though
not always good ones.</TE>
<TE>   For reliable quality, try the Sapo Dorado (see number above). We
had a very good dinner there. Entrees are about $11-$14. Also
recommended: Hotel Fonda Vela, 645-5125, www.fondavela.com (entrees
about $11-$13) or Monteverde Lodge.</TE>
<TE>   If breakfast doesn't come with your bed, try Stella's Bakery,
645-5560, or Paradise Bagel Cafe, 645-6081. And for good Italian
fare, head to Pizza Johnny, 645-5066, which features more than its
name implies (main dishes $8-$10, large pizzas $14-$21), or
Restaurante de Lucia, 645-5337 (entrees $10-$12). All are on the road
between the cloud forest reserve and the village of Santa Elena.</TE>

<HD>Movie Theme Park to Be New Neighbor for Disneyland Paris</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disneyland Paris Resort will get the Hollywood treatment this month
when the Walt Disney Studios theme park opens next door.</LD>
<LD>   Patterned after the Disney-MGM Studios at Walt Disney World in
Florida, the 61-acre park outside Paris, costing more than $500
million, is divided into four zones designed to give
behind-the-scenes views of the movie and animation industries. Among
them is the Front Lot, with a mock-up of Sunset Boulevard with
hundreds of movie props. The Backlot focuses on the wizardry of
special effects, featuring the movie "Armageddon," and also has a
roller coaster and live stunt show.</LD>
<LD>   Three hotels are being developed near the site, which will
increase the number of rooms in the Disney resort area from 5,800 to
6,900.</LD>
<TE>   The park will be open daily starting March 16; hours vary by
season. Admission also varies by season, ranging from about $21 to
$28 for adults and $18 to $22 for children ages 3 to 11--the same as
at Disneyland park next door.</TE>
<TE>   Combined tickets good for both parks and multiday passes are also
available. 011-33-1-6030-6081, www.disneylandparis.com.</TE>

<HD>Paris Really Cooks in New Michelin Ratings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Shaw</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the editors of the Guide Michelin recently announced their new
ratings of the best restaurants in France, all attention was focused
on the restaurants that were promoted to the top three-star level:
Guy Savoy and Ledoyen in Paris and L'Arnsbourg in Untermuhlthal, in
the Moselle region. But the full list, officially released Friday,
was notable on several other counts too.</LD>
<LD>   This is only the third time in the last 30 years that more than
two restaurants have been elevated to the highest level in the French
gastronomic firmament in the same year. The two new three-stars in
Paris bring the total there to nine, the most since 1934, when there
were also nine. One of the newcomers, Ledoyen, served its first meal
in 1791.</LD>
<LD>   There were also significant demotions. The one that drew the most
attention was that of Le Crocodile in Strasbourg, dropped from three
stars to two. "No words can appease the pain that is eating away at
our hearts and stifling our spirits," Emile Jung, the chef/owner of
Le Crocodile, said after the announcement. Jung won his first
Michelin star in 1972, his second in 1975 and his third in 1989.</LD>
<TE>   Of greater historical resonance, near the end of the list of 22
restaurants that were being demoted from one star to none, was La
Mere Brazier in Lyon.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, when Alain Ducasse won three-star ratings for his
restaurants in Paris and Monte Carlo, most of the international food
press trumpeted this "unprecedented" six-star feat. But it wasn't
unprecedented. More than 60 years earlier, in 1933, Eugenie Brazier,
the first female chef to win three stars, also became the first
six-star chef, with La Mere Brazier in Lyon and La Mere Brazier in
Col de la Luere near Lyon. Both restaurants ultimately lost all their
stars except the 60-seat La Mere Brazier in Lyon, which kept a star
and was run by Brazier's granddaughter, Jacotte. Now it has no stars.</TE>
<TE>   Among the seven restaurants elevated from one star to two this
year was Moulin de Mougins in Mougins. This reversed a decade-long
decline in the kitchens of longtime chef Roger Verge, one of the
founders of the nouvelle cuisine movement. Verge won his third star
in 1974, then lost both it and his second star in the 1990s.</TE>

<HD>Vegas Hotels Cash In on Higher Room Rates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Gorman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LAS VEGAS--Tourism continues to rebound here, and with it, the price
of a hotel room.</LD>
<LD>   Advance room rates for the week ending March 16 were higher than a
year ago--the first year-over-year increase in weekday and weekend
periods since before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Wall Street
lodging analyst Jason Ader reported.</LD>
<LD>   The increase may be the result of an influx of gamblers betting on
the NCAA basketball finals, spring break for students and a 13%
increase in convention business from the same period last year, said
Ader of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.</LD>
<TE>   He said the projected room rates represent the second consecutive
week that the Bellagio has charged full price--$199 for weeknights,
$399 for the weekend, reflecting an 83% increase from the post-Sept.
11 midweek low of $109, which occurred Nov. 24, and a 151% increase
from weekend low of $159, charged Oct. 20.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect that these higher rates ... should allow other
properties, which view Bellagio as a benchmark, to continue to bump
up their rates," he added.</TE>

<HD>VIP Lines at Airports Are Canceled, Then Restored</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The major airlines' VIP lines were briefly thrown into disarray late
last month after the new Transportation Security Administration took
over airport security checkpoints. The lines typically let first- and
business-class passengers and some frequent fliers end-run the crowds
to reach the checkpoints.</LD>
<LD>   After reports circulated that the federal agency had banned the
lines, some airlines stopped operating them for a few days, then
mostly restored them. In the interim, the Air Transport Assn. asked
the TSA for clarification, and it now understands that "we [the
airlines] are in charge of the queues. The government is in charge of
the checkpoints," said spokesman Michael Wascom.</LD>
<LD>   A senior TSA spokesman last week confirmed that policy. He added,
however, that screening passengers at airport clubs, practiced by
some airlines, is now banned.</LD>

<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Its radical heritage aside, Berkeley today is in the vanguard of
upscale shopping, dining and real estate as much as anything else.</LD>
<LD>   One symbol of Berkeley's hippie era, Peet's Coffee, is now a chain

change is what drew me north last month.</LD>
<LD>   My Berkeley memories come mainly from 1980s college road trips
with raggedy fellow travelers. We protested what we could, scavenged
for food and crashed on someone's floor for the night.</LD>
<TE>   That still sounds like an appealing weekend to me, but my wife,
Shiru, would kill me for even suggesting it. Our 2-year-old daughter
wouldn't be too happy either.</TE>
<TE>   So the consumerist side of Berkeley beckoned. Its genteel pursuits
would be agreeable to a graying and softening (physiologically and
ideologically) family man. Now that I can afford plane tickets, a
hotel room and food from sources other than vending machines, they
would be accessible too. Maybe bourgeois Berkeley would fit bourgeois
me.</TE>
<TE>   After flying from Ontario to Oakland to get the cheapest fares and
avoid LAX crowds, we checked in late one Friday at the Bancroft
Hotel, a 22-room converted clubhouse across from UC Berkeley. The
Bancroft's chief attractions were location, price ($119 per night
plus tax and parking) and its Arts and Crafts charm, with lots of
stained glass, tile fireplaces and dark wood.</TE>
<TE>   Our third-floor walk-up room (there is no elevator) was tidy but
small. With the queen bed plus a squishy rollaway ($10 extra), there
was little room to walk. We slept in Saturday morning, then fueled up
on coffee, fruit, muffins and croissants, all included in the rate.</TE>
<TE>   Before plunging into upscale Berkeley, I also wanted to find a few
unique spots that would give my daughter some sense that not all
places in America are alike.</TE>
<TE>   La Pena Cultural Center on Shattuck Avenue fit the bill. A
nonprofit performance space and cafe, La Pena maintains an almost
daily schedule of live music, poetry readings and political forums,
much of it with a Latin American theme. It also holds weekly Saturday
morning children's programs, perfect for our rainy weekend.</TE>
<TE>   On display at La Pena were some of the amusing quirks of the
Berkeley left. In a place devoted to multiculturalism, the audience
of 100 was about 90% white.</TE>
<TE>   I also got a kick out of two wall posters. One proclaimed
"Cultural Activism for Social Justice," while just below was another,
"Please Watch Your Valuables."</TE>
<TE>   We watched our valuables as Gary Lapow, a local singer-songwriter
for children, took care of the activism for justice. Lapow's songs
preach compassion, and his performances always include one number in
American Sign Language. With his bouncy style and slightly nasal
voice, Lapow looked to me like a lefty Richard Simmons.</TE>
<TE>   From the concert, we drove north on Shattuck toward Cedar Street,
a couple of miles but a world away, to the neighborhood called the
gourmet ghetto. It's the home of Chez Panisse restaurant, where Alice
Waters pioneered the use of organic produce and seasonal ingredients.</TE>
<TE>   Across the street from Chez Panisse is the Cheese Board Pizza
Collective, an extraordinary cheese store and pizza shop in two
storefronts. Like Peet's Coffee, the Cheese Board has been in the
neighborhood since the late '60s. The store takes its decentralized
structure and collective decision-making (there is no manager) very
seriously, upholding '60s ideals while meeting a very modern demand.</TE>
<TE>   A board above the counter lists about 280 kinds of cheese, from
Abondance to Wensleydale. The pizza shop, by contrast, produces only
one kind of pizza, with toppings that change daily but are always
vegetarian. A slice sells for $2, a half for $8 or a whole for $16.</TE>
<TE>   The pizza of the day was covered with mozzarella, onion, sun-dried
tomato, pesto, yellow squash, zucchini, feta cheese, olive oil,
garlic and parsley. The thin-crusted pie was topped in the right
proportions, not top-heavy despite the variety of vegetables. The tab
for all of us was $10.50--less than what we spend at fast-food
joints.</TE>
<TE>   A woman deftly pecking out jazz on the house piano, the aroma of
baking pizzas and my glass of Cote du Rhone formed one of those
perfect moments when food, sound and scent make you feel that you've
taken in the essence of a place all at once. I've felt that way with
my wife at makeshift food stalls in Seoul and Taipei, with hot bowls
of noodles cooked on an open fire well past midnight. As Elly stood
on her chair and swayed to the music, happily munching her pizza
crust, I realized it was the first time I'd had one of those moments
with my child.</TE>
<TE>   After lunch we strolled through the neighborhood, which prides
itself on its lack of chain stores. The sentiment may be
anti-corporate, but the shopping is far from populist. The natural
fiber clothing boutiques, sensible shoe shops and jewelers are almost
all expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Our next stop was the 4th Street shopping area. Unlike the gourmet
ghetto, 4th Street makes no pretense of being anything but a
collection of pricey chain stores. Like Old Pasadena or Santa
Monica's Third Street Promenade, 4th Street is a high-end outdoor
mall built in a formerly down-in-the-dumps area. A Crate &amp; Barrel
outlet, Sur la Table and Discovery Channel Store are among its
offerings.</TE>
<TE>   I was unable to book a table at Chez Panisse on short notice.
(It's best to try a month ahead.) So we had dinner Saturday at
Rivoli, another innovative, organic-and-seasonal-ingredients kind of
place in another fashionable Berkeley neighborhood, on Solano Avenue
in the northern part of the city.</TE>
<TE>   We started with one of the house specials, portabello fritters
with lemon aioli, Parmesan, arugula and caper vinaigrette. The thick
slices of meaty mushroom fried in a light batter were a perfect
finger food for Elly. We also tried the mushroom, leek and potato
soup, which was heavy with cream.</TE>
<TE>   Entrees were elaborate. Shiru had a roast eggplant and potato cake
stuffed with goat cheese. I had sour cabbage with shrimp, steelhead,
lobster sausage and fingerling potatoes. For Elly we ordered saffron
angel hair pasta with tuna, green beans, tomato and olives.
Everything was done just right. Though a bit crowded, Rivoli's dining
room was comfortable and looked out to a lovely garden, where Elly
enjoyed watching two cats having their own meal.</TE>
<TE>   We took an evening stroll on Telegraph Avenue, the shopping area
just off campus. I was surprised at how dead it was on Saturday night
and amused by the "Drug Free Zone" sign posted on the street. We
picked up ice cream at a small shop and took it to La Strada Cafe
next to our hotel, where we ordered hot apple cider, steamed milk and
some cranberry upside-down cake to go with it.</TE>
<TE>   Our flight schedule didn't leave us much time Sunday, especially
since we were told to arrive at the airport two hours early for
security checks. Skipping the hotel breakfast, we returned to the
gourmet ghetto for Masse's Pastries on Shattuck. We got a brioche, a
chocolate croissant and four cookies--gingersnap, chocolate, macaroon
and one called a cappuccino thin, all of which were fabulous.</TE>
<TE>   We left Berkeley after finding much of what I had expected--plenty
of fine food and a few funky holdovers. Unexpectedly, I also found an
answer to a great life question. It was on a sign at the Cheese Board
explaining its senior discounts. Customer older than 60 get 10% off,
70 and older get 15% off, and so on. For those 100 and older, the
policy read, "What you see is what you get." I used to wonder why
anyone would want to live to 100. In Berkeley I found an answer.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Slot canyons, distinctly colored rock formations, palm oases and
ridge tops with far-reaching views are the reasons for a hiking
pilgrimage to the Mecca Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The hills, southeast of Palm Springs near the northern tip of the
Salton Sea, offer textbook displays on geologic faults and the power
of earthquakes. Rock dating back 600 million years has been pushed up
and overturned. Geologists think the last big push took place about a
million years ago when the Mecca Hills were thrust up between the
Painted Canyon and San Andreas faults.</LD>
<LD>   Painted Canyon, in the heart of the hills, exhibits a multitude of
mineral deposits in hues of pink, rose, red, purple and green.</LD>
<TE>   Keen-eyed wildflower lovers also will find the rare Mecca aster, a
lilac-tinted bloom resembling a daisy.</TE>
<TE>   It's an excellent hiking destination, one that can be explored by
way of a loop through Ladder Canyon, named for the ladders that aid
hikers along the path. Just remember to bring lots of water, be
prepared for hot weather and stay on established routes.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From Palm Springs, Palm Desert or
any of the other Coachella Valley cities, follow California 111 east
to Mecca. Turn east at 66th Avenue. The street takes the name Box
Canyon Road, and after 41/2 miles it bends northeast. A quarter of a
mile after crossing the Coachella Canal, you'll spot a sign for
Painted Canyon Road on the left. Turn left onto this road and proceed
four miles to the trail head.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: Head east (right) up the wide canyon a quarter of a mile
to the entrance for Ladder Canyon. The route skirts a rockslide and
soon brings you to a ladder. Climb to a long slot canyon, continue
the ascent for about a third of a mile, then join a switchbacking
trail to a ridge. Inexperienced hikers will want to turn around here
and retrace their steps to the trail head.</TE>
<TE>   Experienced desert hikers with a good sense of direction can
follow the path north along the ridge as it serves up views of the
Mecca Hills, the Salton Sea to the south and Mt. San Jacinto to the
west. After following the ridge for slightly more than a mile, the
trail descends into Painted Canyon. Bear south, down the canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Continue to a narrow spot where another ladder helps you reach the
canyon bottom. The trail head is slightly less than a mile farther.</TE>

<DL>LA CEIBA, Honduras</DL>
<LD>Our flashlights speared the jungle darkness, opening tiny portals
into a riot of tropical vegetation--broad, varicose-veined leaves,
messy braids of liana and thick-tendoned trunks--that in daylight
would be considered lush. At night it is merely impenetrable.</LD>
<LD>   Sweating in the damp heat, we picked our way down a freshly carved
trail, guiding our beams slowly along the latticed limbs, beneath
leaves and across the brush-smothered floor. It was the first time my
wife, Monique, and I had hiked in pitch black--intentionally,
anyway--and the first time we had ever been led by a guide.</LD>
<LD>   We were in search of local wildlife, a long and intriguing roster
of nocturnal creatures that includes jaguars, ocelots, kinkajous,
tree frogs and glow-in-the-dark millipedes. The neighborhood also
houses less savory residents: boa constrictors, eyelash vipers,
tarantulas. I was comforted by the experience of our guide, James
Adams, a Vermont transplant who once led trips in Mexico's back
country and who has traversed the rain forest here for three years.</LD>
<TE>   His first piece of advice: Watch where you step. His second: Look
up too. "There's as much above you as on the ground below," he told
our group of five as we set out.</TE>
<TE>   Such is the vacation night life in Pico Bonito National Park, a
dramatic 414-square-mile swath near Honduras' Caribbean coast that is
at the forefront of the country's budding campaign to shoulder its
way into Central America's eco-tourism market, now dominated by
Belize and Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   Anchoring the effort here is the Lodge at Pico Bonito, built two
years ago on farmland below the 8,000-foot mountain for which the
park is named. Tucked between two rivers about 20 minutes' drive from
seaside La Ceiba, the lodge offered the best of both worlds: a week
of muddy-booted fun in a pristine natural wonderland and pampering in
luxury accommodations that demonstrated we could have the forest and
the frills. After particularly harried months leading up to our
January visit, we were in need of both.</TE>
<TE>   Our post-holiday trips have taken us to several out-of-the-way
Caribbean spots in recent years. This time we had no plans until I
tripped across an article on Pico Bonito in an outdoors magazine. It
mentioned the lodge and a region that promised tropical birds, good
hiking, white-water rafting and limitless mountain-gazing.</TE>
<TE>   A phone call secured our private cabin: $190 nightly, excluding
meals. It would be a splurge, but we had earned one. We booked a
flight from Los Angeles to San Pedro Sula, the country's
second-biggest city, and called a U.S.-based travel company that
serves Honduras to arrange our air link to La Ceiba, a half-hour
away.</TE>
<TE>   As we neared La Ceiba aboard a 19-seater, a lashing rain blocked
our view of the Nombre de Dios mountain range, which includes the
cleft-topped Pico Bonito. For much of the week, a shawl of
ever-swirling clouds would mask the mountain's crown but not its
steep, forested body, glinting here and there with the froth of
tumbling wild water.</TE>
<TE>   We were picked up at the little airstrip by a lodge shuttle van.
Staffer Ingrid Sylvester explained possible outings as we drove along
a plain of pineapple farms, then bumped along a gravel road to the
lodge past stands of cacao and coffee trees. As we ascended, the
forest thickened. To arrive at the lodge is to be swallowed into a
lushness of palms and citrus trees, flowering bromeliads and
heliconias. The 200-acre grounds are a color-splashed botanical
showcase, landscaped with 80 kinds of palms plus soursop and cashew
trees, flaming-red torch ginger and more than 120 varieties of
orchid.</TE>
<TE>   The lodge, perched at the edge of the national park, is a trio of
airy, plantation-style buildings housing the reception area, dining
room, bar and a conference center, plus 21 rooms in 14 wooden cabins
arrayed beneath a canopy of cacao, acacia and mahogany trees. The
tranquil garden courtyard has a swimming pool and is an ideal vantage
point for sipping tropical drinks and watching the shifting mountain
cloudscape, as if before an Olympian movie screen. There is also a
spa, offering massages, and a short walk takes you to the lodge's
butterfly farm and reptile house. The lodge is owned by a partnership
of U.S. and Honduran investors and was the brainchild of Kent Forte,
a former Peace Corps volunteer who remains a co-owner.</TE>
<TE>   We were hoping for privacy and got it. Our cabin at the edge of
the lodge grounds was within earshot of the Coloradito River and so
shrouded by the surrounding greenery that few of the other cabins
were even visible. The room was simple but lovely, with a four-poster
king bed, stained pine woodwork, ceiling fans and louvered windows. I
was at first dismayed to see a telephone but later came to appreciate
its main role: ordering breakfast, which was delivered to our cabin
each morning. The private deck, with hammock, proved a great perch
for a couple of non-bird-watchers like us to try our hand. We saw two
toucans.</TE>
<TE>   We were tempted to venture off campus after our first dinner in
the lodge's dining room. The cuisine is nouvelle Meso-American, an
inventive mix of fresh local ingredients and modern tastes and
presented as if for a photo shoot. During our week, we would feast on
grilled grouper and red snapper with fresh salsas, pepper steaks,
shrimp dishes, conch soup, curry rice, a variety of steamed
vegetables, Key lime and coconut cream pies and flan.</TE>
<TE>   The dining room was as elegant as the dishes served, with towering
beamed ceilings and huge screened windows that looked past the
sprawling porch to the garden and, just beyond, the mountain range.
(Much of the material used to build the lodge came from trees felled
by Hurricane Mitch, which slammed the country in 1998.) Decorating
the room and the deck were pots of every size, crafted by Honduras'
Lenca Indians and gathered during shopping trips around the country
by the general manager, Michael Wendling, an American who helped
launch three other hotels in Central America, including Francis Ford
Coppola's Blancaneaux Lodge in Belize.</TE>
<TE>   Stuffed with grouper and dessert, I still found room for another
favorite Central American treat, a rum called Flor de Cana, which I'd
encountered before in Nicaragua. Our bartender happily poured one to
go, and we trooped back to our cabin for our first night, swathed in
a luxury bedspread, in the shadow of Pico Bonito.</TE>
<TE>   After a breakfast of eggs, sliced fruit, home-baked pastries and
locally grown coffee, then a lazy morning capped by a fresh-fish
lunch, we laced up our boots and set out to explore the trails
leading into the mountain park. Lodge staffers seemed surprised that
we would go without a guide, a service offered for free, but we
assured them we were comfortable hikers and would be just fine with a
trail map. (They had none, one of the few lapses we encountered all
week.)</TE>
<TE>   The trail entered the park along a narrow ridge that, in one spot,
allowed us to glance 500 feet below to the roiling Coloradito on one
side and to the equally boisterous Corinto on the other. Rivers in
stereo, Monique said. The trails lead, steeply in places, past
towering hardwoods, through a former cacao plantation and past vines
as tightly coiled as telephone cords. Along the way, the lodge has
built three towers that hoist the visitor above the forest cover and
a wooden deck that juts over a set of rapids on the Coloradito.</TE>
<TE>   We huffed our way to what seemed the trail's summit, but, with
darkness approaching and uncertain which way to go, we decided to
complete the loop the next day. Our descent served up the trip's
first name-that-animal mystery: a brown woodchuck-like critter that
scrambled into our path atop spindly, scissoring legs. Once back,
Monique headed straight for the lodge bookshelf, with its helpful
collection on tropical life, and got an answer. It was an agouti, a
Central American rodent we would later see scooting around the lodge
regularly.</TE>
<TE>   We made good the next day on our promise to finish the hike,
walking in a warm downpour along the Coloradito and to a remaining
lookout tower, which gave us an up-close look at the dangling homes
of the oropendola, a noisy bird whose nests hang from branches like
soggy stockings. Even as we dried out, we already were looking
forward to our next outing: a visit the following day to the Cuero y
Salado Wildlife Refuge, an estuary that is home to endangered
manatees, howler and white-faced monkeys, butterflies and uncountable
water birds.</TE>
<TE>   Getting to the refuge was an excursion in itself. Accompanied by
lodge guide Nina Polo, a recent biology graduate from Honduras'
capital, Tegucigalpa, we were dropped at the town of La Union half an
hour's drive away. There begins the route of a tiny, narrow-gauge
diesel train, or burra, that once lugged coconuts from a Standard
Fruit plantation and now ferries tourists six miles to the estuary.
Sitting on a wooden bench in our open-sided car, we clattered past
the village's mud-skirted shanties, beside fields dotted with egrets
and cranes and through the ghostly landscape of the old plantation.
Its trees now are headless stumps--the victims, Nina told us, of a
virus that has afflicted crops around the Caribbean in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Our escort for the two-hour boat tour of the refuge was Jorge
Mendoza, a buoyant longtime environmental activist who volunteers for
the nonprofit foundation in charge of the 14-year-old refuge. Winning
the designation was arduous, Jorge explained in Spanish, and managing
the refuge at times has placed the environmentalists in conflict with
local fishermen rankled by a ban on net fishing and ranchers who
would sooner use the surrounding land for grazing. Though relations
are improving, past threats have made the volunteers keenly aware of
the delicate diplomacy required here.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways the refuge mirrors the country's wider, uncertain
foray into ecological tourism at a time when Honduran cities have
been beset by a crime wave. Here in the mostly peaceful countryside,
there is hope that by fortifying the estuary's role as a draw for
nature lovers--only 2,000 people visit the refuge yearly--residents
may benefit by adding small-scale lodging to the platform tents
available now. At the moment, though, locals are pushing for
construction of a road to La Union, now reached only by horseback,
bicycle and the little train. "It's hard work. It's good work, but we
have to overcome a culture of destruction," Jorge said.</TE>
<TE>   As we motored slowly over the placid waters, Jorge greeted
scattered fishermen in their dugout canoes and trolled along
mangrove-choked shores in search of wildlife. We saw blue morpho
butterflies, a turtle sunning itself on a log, a water-skipping Jesus
lizard, a 6-foot crocodile and lots of birds, from kingfishers, brown
jays and black vultures to the diving anhinga and the odd-looking
boat-billed heron. We fell short on our goal of seeing a monkey
despite Jorge's best efforts, which included pulling out a bamboo
flute to play a tune he said always seemed a simian favorite. (It was
"Greensleeves.")</TE>
<TE>   The train ride back revealed the savage side of bird paradise when
a brawny caracara, a kind of flying Rottweiler, swooped down over the
field and seized a fully grown crane, then winged away, the long legs
of its prey trailing like streamers. It was awesome to see and a
thrilling reminder that this was nature, unadulterated and unfiltered
through a television camera.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since my first river-rafting adventure in Maine two summers
ago, I had been eager to go again. I had my chance now near Pico
Bonito on the Cangrejal River, which has Class III and IV rapids and
is considered one of Central America's best spots. From Monique's
past comments, I understood that rafting for her would rank on a list
of preferred activities somewhere between sword-swallowing and
slamming her hand in a car door. I would be on my own for this, half
an hour's drive from the lodge. Once delivered to the river guides,
it was my good luck to share a craft with Rick and Sue Woolery, warm
and spirited Aspen, Colo., innkeepers who were celebrating their 25th
wedding anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   Our 12-foot raft at first seemed impossibly small to accommodate
us and two guides down the boulder-strewn river, but we sluiced down
the churning chutes, bouncing off the granite walls but not once
overturning. The only scary moment came during a riverside break,
when we were dared to join a bunch of local crazies and their tourist
companions in plunging off a 15-foot cliff into the rapids below.
Rick and I cinched our helmets and stepped off. Sue, unashamed of her
good sense, was happy to watch from the top.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the lodge that night, Monique and I joined a New York
couple and Ingrid, the lodge staffer, for the guided night hike. The
big cats were having nothing to do with us. Our flashlights at first
managed only to produce sightings of a climbing rat, hunkered
wide-eyed at the base of a fig tree, and a prehistoric-looking beetle
that our guide James said was cousin to the cockroach. (I joked to
the New Yorkers that a hike featuring rats and roaches must have made
them feel at home.)</TE>
<TE>   James then spied a tarantula crawling into its half-dollar-size
hole, and Monique picked out a molting dragonfly as it emerged,
pinkish and fresh, from its old shell. Ingrid was best at spotting
the pinpricks of light emitted by the luminescent millipedes.</TE>
<TE>   I was determined to locate a snake--a big one, I hoped--lying in
repose at a discreet distance. But like the cats, and the monkeys two
days earlier, they were not to be seen. They were not here on our
terms. We were on theirs--and that, of course, was all the objective
we had brought along.</TE>

<TE>   Guidebook: High Life in Honduras</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: From LAX, connecting flights via San Pedro Sula to
La Ceiba, the most convenient city to Pico Bonito National Park, are
available on several airlines, including American, Continental, and
TACA and LACSA (both Central American carriers). From San Pedro Sula
you must change to a smaller plane for the 30-minute flight to La
Ceiba. Round-trip fares begin at $630. U.S. citizens need a passport
but not a visa.</TE>
<TE>   Where to stay: The Lodge at Pico Bonito, U.S. reservations (888)
428-0221, or direct dial 011-504-440-0388, fax 011-504- 440-0468,
www.picobonito.com, is the only hotel at the national park. Rates for
cabin rooms are $145-$190 nightly, depending on the season. You can
pay for each meal separately or save by buying a daily meal plan: $44
per person, including tax and service, for breakfast, lunch and
dinner; $34 per person for breakfast and dinner only.</TE>
<TE>   La Ceiba, the third-largest city in Honduras and about a 20-minute
drive from the lodge, has several hotels. The seaside city is said to
have a lively disco scene and a few decent restaurants, though we
never ventured out of the forest at night.</TE>
<TE>   When to go: High season is Christmas to Easter and June to August,
when it's warm and dry. Low season is the rainy months, September to
November. The best months for bird-watching are February to April and
July through August.</TE>
<TE>   What to do: Hiking trails lead into the national park, and the
lodge can arrange, for an added fee, guided excursions to the
surrounding area inside the park and outside. Among the outings are a
guided night hike near the lodge, $25 per person; a hike to the
waterfalls of the Rio Zacate, $30; a tour of the Cuero y Salado
Wildlife Refuge, $65; white-water rafting on the Rio Cangrejal, $75;
and a visit to the Amaras Wild Bird and Animal Rehabilitation Center,
a nonprofit refuge for wildlife confiscated from the illegal pet
trade, $30. The lodge's farm and butterfly and reptile house are free
for guests.</TE>

<HD>In-the-Red Amtrak Has No Deficit of Devotees</HD>
<DH>On the line's popular Western routes, a growing number of
leisure riders finds much to love as well as things to loathe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you follow the news these days, you're hearing a lot about Amtrak.
The government committee that oversees the passenger rail service
says Amtrak has no chance of making a profit by 2003, the deadline
Congress set five years ago to stop the federal subsidies that keep
the system alive. Amtrak last year ran $1.1 billion in the red, the
biggest deficit in its three-decade history.</LD>
<LD>   In the congressional debate that has ensued, some have suggested
that passenger rail is obsolete in the U.S. and that few would mourn
its demise. Amtrak carries only one-half of 1% of all "passenger
miles" on intercity routes, compared with 50% for auto and 48% for
airlines. Even buses, with 1.5%, carry more people, according to the
Bush administration's proposed budget for 2003.</LD>
<LD>   But for vacationers, the train is a bit more popular than those
figures suggest. About 6% of U.S. leisure travelers took the train in
the last year, according to a 2001 survey by YPB/Yankelovich
Partners. I'm one of them. Rail travel is fun and ecologically sound
(at least compared with autos), and it relieves me of driving. An
America without trains would disappoint me and, I suspect, many of
those 6%.</LD>
<TE>   We rail travelers in the West have been largely absent from
Washington's debate over Amtrak. This is curious because the Pacific
Surf- liner, which plies 347 miles along the California coast between
San Diego and San Luis Obispo, is Amtrak's second-busiest route,
after the so-called Northeast Corridor, which serves Boston, New York
and Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the Surfliner carried 1.7 million riders, 10% more than
two years earlier. And although many think of such local routes as
"commuter rail," only 27% of the Surfliner's passengers used it for
commuting, business or school purposes. The rest were leisure
travelers, according to Amtrak West, the division that oversees the
operation.</TE>
<TE>   The Surfliner's growth is no fluke. In January, ridership
increased 4.8%, but California's two other local routes did even
better: 6.8% on the San Joaquins, which run from Bakersfield to
Oakland and Sacramento, and 21.7% on the Capitol Corridor, which runs
between Auburn and San Jose via the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak officials are still sorting out the reasons for the
increase, which could be a two-for-one fare sale, a continuation of
the "Sept. 11 effect" that made some travelers choose trains over
planes, or something more permanent.</TE>
<TE>   On a day trip one Saturday in February with my partner, I was
reminded of what keeps some people traveling by train--or avoiding
it. We took the Surfliner north from Los Angeles and planned to hop
the Coast Starlight, the long-distance train that runs 1,289 miles
between Los Angeles and Seattle, for the return from Santa Barbara.
We found plenty to love--and hate--on our trip.</TE>
<TE>   On the negative side, let's start with the fare: $34 per person
round trip. Pretty expensive considering we could have driven the
180-mile round trip for about $12 (assuming $1.35 per gallon of gas
and an average of 20 miles per gallon), or $6 per person for two. (Of
course, this doesn't figure in the additional cost of owning and
maintaining a car.) We finessed the fare problem by taking advantage
of the two-for-one sale that was to expire Feb. 28. There was no
finessing the parking fee at Union Station in downtown Los Angeles,
though: $10 for the day.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the time issue. The train takes about two hours, 40
minutes on a trip we could have made by car in an hour and a half.</TE>
<TE>   Once aboard, we found the bathroom in our car out of order. For a
few nervous minutes, the door between our car and the cafe car
refused to open, trapping me in the cafe car until a crew member
rescued me. As for the return trip, we never got on the southbound
Coast Starlight. It was 10 hours late because of bad weather in
Oregon, the agent at the Santa Barbara station said; passengers were
being bused south from Emeryville, near San Francisco. The northbound
train was tardy too, 13 hours and counting, having arrived late in
Los Angeles because of the same weather. We caught a later Surfliner
instead.</TE>
<TE>   While our experience may have been extreme, Amtrak's long-distance
trains were on schedule only 56% of the time in 2000 (the most recent
data posted on its Internet site), compared with the 77.4% on-time
average posted by major U.S. airlines in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the trip had positives: the relaxed pace, an amiable crew,
comfortable seats with ample legroom and the opportunity for both of
us to view the passing scenery (including some spectacular beaches in
the last 45 minutes). The trains ran on time, typical for Amtrak's
short-distance trains, which were on schedule 81% of the time in
2000. And in Santa Barbara, it let us off at the foot of tourist
central: State Street, near the beach.</TE>
<TE>   We also had a chance to chat with fellow passengers like Camarillo
residents Rick and Cheri Ramirez, who were taking their 21/2-year-old
grandson, Jackson, to Santa Barbara for the day. Rick uses the train
regularly to visit his wife at her job in San Luis Obispo. "Twenty
bucks each way--cheaper than taking my truck," he says, adding, "It's
so relaxing."</TE>
<TE>   Bernie Reynolds, a golf pro based in Houston who has another home
in La Costa, was going to Simi Valley, clubs and all, to play golf
with a friend. "I hate L.A. traffic," he says. "This is so much
easier."</TE>
<TE>   As for subsidizing Amtrak with tax dollars, Reynolds says, "If the
federal government can spend billions to search for Bin Laden, it can
keep Amtrak going."</TE>
<TE>   After all, as Amtrak supporters are fond of pointing out, more
than $14 billion in federal funds is going to support air travel this
year in the FAA budget, and more than $33 billion is earmarked to
support car travel in the Federal Highway Administration budget.
(Some contend that Amtrak shouldn't be expected to make a profit
because no national passenger rail system does, but that position is
dubious. Japan's three large passenger railways, for instance, are
privately owned and "profitable by any reasonable definition," says
Lou Thompson, railways advisor to the World Bank. He allows, though,
that "most public railways do operate at a loss.")</TE>
<TE>   I empathize with Robert L. Coffman, a self-confessed "train nut"
from San Diego who wrote The Times a letter last month about his
recent cross-country train trip. He braved "double-deck sleepers with
no in-compartment lavatory or wash basin," no working toilets or
shower in his car from Albuquerque and other annoyances. But
equipment east of Chicago was better, and "the service crews were
tops," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   He concludes: "Everyone should see our wonderful country at ground
level at least once. It is not just empty ground to fly over, stuffed
in an aluminum tube."</TE>

<LD>Cleveland grandmother Beatrice Brill won't let anything--not airport
hassles, not the economic slowdown, especially not fear--stand in the
way of keeping a long-held promise to take her 10-year-old grandson
Julian on a grand adventure complete with river rafting and wild
monkeys.</LD>
<LD>   They leave for Costa Rica later this month, accompanied by
Julian's dad. Beatrice is continuing a tradition that the 76-year-old
widow began more than a decade ago when she took her oldest grandson
to Alaska. Since then she has made six trips (three of them to
Africa) with grandchildren, and she's not going to stop now. "I've
got two more grandchildren to go after this one," she says. "I'm not
worried."</LD>
<LD>   That let's-get-on-with-life's-adventures attitude has begun to
translate into a spate of inquiries and bookings for upcoming family
trips--hiking in the Canadian Rockies, checking out wildlife in the
Galapagos Islands, safaris in Africa--according to adventure
outfitters from Boston to California. Vigorous and presumably
well-heeled grandparents like Brill are as likely to be initiating
the planning as parents are.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a perception that people will be safer in the
wilderness," says Brian McCutcheon, a spokesman for O.A.R.S., a major
California-based rafting company. "We're booming."</TE>
<TE>   "People got through the holidays without incident, and the phones
started ringing again Jan. 2," says Jim Kackley, director of Thomson
Family Adventures in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   For some, Sept. 11 was a reminder not to put dreams on hold. But
one big change is that families are booking much closer to their
departure dates, weeks rather than months in advance.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to get out and do what's important to you before the
kids are too old," says Paula Dobrow, a nurse from suburban Boston
whose family, joined by close friends in New York, has signed on for
a trip to Africa that they have talked about for years. "You just
can't live in a bubble."</TE>
<TE>   So many families are seeking adventures closer to home that
companies such as Abercrombie &amp; Kent, (800) 323-7308,
www.abercrombiekent.com; Austin-Lehman Adventures, (800) 575-1540,
www.austinlehman.com; Backroads, (800) 462-2848, www.backroads.com;
Thomson Family Adventures, (800) 262-6255, www.familyadventures.com;
and O.A.R.S., (800) 346-6277, www.oars.com, are offering a growing
number of guided family adventures in places ranging from Yellowstone
National Park to Georgia's outer islands, with energetic counselors
to amuse pint-size adventurers.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rica, Belize and the Galapagos are also proving popular
because they are considered safe as well as pristine.</TE>
<TE>   "January was better than [January 2001]," says Michael Kaye of
Costa Rica Expeditions, 011-506-257-0755,
www.costaricaexpeditions.com. "It surprised me. But I think we're all
trying to find experiences where we can focus on each other, and
being out in nature helps."</TE>
<TE>   Thomson Family Adventures now offers a Costa Rica adventure
designed for teens and their parents. Seattle-based Wildland
Adventures, (800) 345-4453, www.wildland.com, touts a Belize trip
that lets families get far off the tourist track and meet the locals.</TE>
<TE>   There are many positives to any family adventure, whether a modest
camping trip to a state park or an expensive bike trip to Europe.
Children gain confidence knowing they can handle themselves in
unfamiliar surroundings. They learn to be more tolerant of those
whose customs and looks are different from theirs. Parents and kids
gain a new perspective when they're away from the usual territory.
Everyone gets some much-needed time together, forging lifelong
memories in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Adventure travel has been gaining in popularity, according to the
Travel Industry Assn. It seems parents want vacations that involve
more than just playing on the beach or touring historic sites.
Grandparents want a memorable way to spend time with grandchildren
who are growing up too fast.</TE>
<TE>   That's why outfitters are offering such an array of family
itineraries. Backroads, for example, has more than 200 bike and
multi-sport family trips. Abercrombie &amp; Kent got so many requests
that it now offers 100 family holidays--everything from staffed
Tuscan villas to American river-rafting trips.</TE>
<TE>   Many so-called soft adventures don't come cheap; trips to Africa
can cost upward of $20,000 for a family of four. But others won't
dent a family budget much more than a cruise or a trip to Disney
World. Snagging a bargain air fare helps keep costs down.</TE>
<TE>   Outfitters say that despite the uncertain economy, adventurous
families aren't deterred by cost. If anything, they're more willing
to pay top dollar in order to leave all the logistics to experts.</TE>
<TE>   "All you've got to do is show up with the kids," says Seattle dad
Ben Slivka, who has signed on for a second family bike trip this
summer. "There are no hassles."</TE>
<TE>   And that, as any traveling parent knows, is priceless.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, 80-year-old New England grandmother Cay Maxwell plans
to join her five grandchildren, whose homes are scattered around the
country, on a hiking adventure in the jungles of Belize. She can't
wait.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really too bad if people stop traveling," Maxwell says.
"It's the best way to be together."</TE>

<LD>I was surprised to read Pam Schulz's letter ("Parting Shot," Feb.
17), in which she accuses me of cultural insensitivity by climbing to
the head of a Buddha statue in Bamian. That requires an explanation.</LD>
<LD>   Our trip to Bamian in 1965 was taken as an assignment from the
Ministry of Public Works in Afghanistan, where I was employed as an
architect and urban planner. The main purpose was to prepare an
inventory of remnants of frescoes on the walls and ceilings of
several grottoes on the way to the Buddha statue's head.</LD>
<LD>   Led by two Afghan guides, we took a strenuous climb to the top of
the Buddha statue through a network of corridors and niches inside
the mountain, taking as many photos as possible. The most important
were the decaying medallion frescoes above and around the Buddha's
head.</LD>
<TE>   Standing at the top of the statue's head, I prepared the photo
inventory of existing frescoes, to be used for the future plan of
their preservation by the Afghan government. My last photo from this
assignment was the one printed in My Best Shot.</TE>

<HD>Internet Fares Are Not Client-Friendly</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your article "Travel Agents Cry Foul Over Internet Fare Deals" (Feb.
17) didn't address the real reason most agencies are not making
Internet bookings for clients. It lies in control. The Internet fare
providers do not offer any service beyond the initial purchase.</LD>
<LD>   If we were to purchase a ticket on a client's behalf and there
were a dispute, there would be no recourse for correcting errors.</LD>
<LD>   Many travelers' plans change between the time a ticket is
purchased and the travel date, or even after departure. Tickets
bought on the Internet are more difficult to change, unlike those
purchased through our Computer Reservations System (CRS) or from the
airlines over the phone.</LD>
<TE>   Especially for business travelers, the ability to reach us by
phone and make near-immediate changes to itineraries is worth
whatever nominal fees we may charge and often even the slightly
higher CRS fares.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in many cases, when we offer a lower fare from the
Internet, it is available with times, schedules or carriers that do
not meet a traveler's preference.</TE>
<TE>   We realize that no one source for airline tickets is going to
consistently offer the lowest price. Although a good, experienced
travel agent should be able to meet or even beat many Internet fares,
we find that the Internet helps us do our job better by finding a
combination of flights that can be booked in the CRS at the same or a
lower fare.</TE>

<TE>   In my one and only experience with Web air fares, I went through
the rigmarole of signing up as an Orbitz member because it had
advertised some great fares from Chicago to Miami. I had been
watching the listings for several days--nonstop flights, fares
starting at $177 round trip, and at two or three convenient times.</TE>
<TE>   When I went to make a reservation and pay the fare, I was told
that the flight was no longer available. I tried the next two most
convenient times and fares and received the same message. I thought
the system was having problems, so I waited a couple of days and
tried again--with the same results. I finally ended up with a flight
that left at the crack of dawn and paid $256 round trip.</TE>

<HD>Tuscan Villas Right Out of a Painting</HD>
<DH>In Lucca's hills, centuries-old mansions and gardens
inspire and amuse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DALE M. BROWN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LUCCA, Italy</DL>
<LD>A Tuscan city hitherto unknown to my wife, Liet, and me, Lucca opened
its treasures to us on a trip to Italy last summer. Surrounded by a
high brick wall on top of which runs a tree-shaded walk, the heart of
Lucca was full of surprises.</LD>
<LD>   But our greatest find lay not in old Lucca but in the countryside
within easy driving distance of the city. Between the 15th and 19th
centuries, rich Lucchese bankers and merchants created magnificent
summer retreats for themselves. Their grand villas and even grander
gardens remain, pleasing the senses and transporting visitors into
scenes usually glimpsed only in Italian Renaissance and Baroque
paintings.</LD>
<LD>   At first we were confounded to learn that about 300 of these
villas, large and small, still exist in the arc formed by the hills
behind Lucca. With only a day at our disposal, which ones should we
see? A printed guide from the tourist office helped us narrow our
choices to four of the most magnificent: the villas Reale, Grabau,
Oliva and Torrigiano (also known as Camigliano, after the original
owner).</LD>
<TE>   The first three were close to one another, and the fourth was not
far by car, giving us a morning and afternoon to explore them with
enough time to linger over lunch at a small hillside restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   First on our list was Villa Reale. We approached it by a wooded
path that hid the house. Then, suddenly, it was before us, a
three-story cream and terra-cotta pink structure standing against a
backdrop of green hills. Mysteriously, the 30 windows of the facade
were shuttered, as though the villa were asleep.</TE>
<TE>   Built in the 17th century, Reale was for centuries the summer home
of several distinguished families and patrons of the arts. Eventually
it became the country residence of Napoleon's oldest sister, Elisa
Bonaparte Baciocchi, who, thanks to her brother's propensity for
putting his family on the thrones of Europe, became the ruler of
Tuscany. She modernized the house in the then-fashionable Empire
style and enlarged the grounds by incorporating the adjacent estate
of the bishops. Fortunately, she left the 17th century gardens
intact.</TE>
<TE>   After Napoleon's downfall, Reale passed through the hands of
several aristocrats, including one known as the Mad Prince for his
religious zealotry and strange behavior. He accumulated so many debts
that upon his death in 1918, Villa Reale and its land had to be put
up for sale, the contents of the house auctioned and many of the
ancient trees cut and sold for lumber. Before the destruction was
complete, Reale was bought by the Count and Countess Pecci-Blunt, who
hired a prominent French landscape architect to restore the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Drawn by the villa's reputation, American artist John Singer
Sargent came here to paint in the early 20th century. The present
owners, children of the count and countess, continue to welcome
artists. They have also opened the gardens to the public, but the
house remains off-limits.</TE>
<TE>   From our vantage point at the far end of the lawn, lined on either
side with paths, shrubs and tall trees, the house bespoke the power
of its many owners, but the gardens on the right soon provided
another picture of them. Not only did these tell of their delight in
nature tamed for beauty's sake but also of their whimsy, even their
humor, with one building, as we found out, a practical joke.</TE>
<TE>   After pausing in the shade of a high-walled grotto to look at a
decorative fountain, we came to the formal lemon garden, with dozens
of miniature trees, heavy with fruit, growing in terra-cotta pots
arranged around a large pond in which swans floated. Beyond, hidden
at first by foliage, was the Teatro di Verdura, a grass-carpeted
semicircle backed by giant laurels, the actors represented by
full-size terra-cotta figures in antique attire. Off to the side,
tunnel-like avenues through bushes and trees once provided entrance
and egress for audiences and a chance, perhaps, for lovers to be
alone while plots unfolded on the green stage.</TE>
<TE>   Led by an enthusiastic guide who spoke only Italian, but whom we
seemed to understand--if only because Italian is such an emotive
language--we moved through one such passage into a sunny park. Our
first pause was at the ochre-colored, stuccoed bishops' house, built
around an arcaded cobblestone court. No longer lived in, it may soon
become a romantic ruin for lack of maintenance--a place Sargent, were
he around today, might want to paint.</TE>
<TE>   Not many feet away we came upon a square two-story building, open
to the elements on the ground floor and studded inside and out with
cobbles and pebbles laid out in the rustic style of Renaissance
garden structures. Grotesque stone faces had been set into its
interior walls, turning it into an ogre's cave.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as we stepped outside, the guide, with a mischievous
smile, bent down to some protruding pipes and turned the handles.
Water sprayed in every direction, up from the floor, down from the
lintels and across the path. One unwitting German tourist got caught
between the streams and emerged doused but laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Water, as we came to realize during the day, was as important as
plants in the villas' garden schemes. Used for ponds and fountains,
water was taken from the streams rushing down the hills and was not
wasted. The runoff from the gardens nourished the flower beds and the
farms just outside the main grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Our second villa, Grabau, stood next door. At our arrival, we were
startled to see rolls of green Astroturf (or the Italian equivalent)
unfurled side by side on the lawn, forming roller-coaster waves in
front of the house. As we learned from the young guide who took us
through the high-ceilinged first story, this was the work of a
contemporary architect commissioned by Martini &amp; Rossi, producer of
vermouths, to celebrate and update the historic art of garden
decoration. Juxtaposing the real and the unreal, the presentation
succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   Dating to the first half of the 16th century, Grabau, which gets
its name from the German couple who bought it in 1868, first belonged
to the Diodati family, powerful merchants. But as Calvinists in a
Catholic culture, they abandoned their estate for their beliefs and
took up residence in Geneva. Acquired eventually by the Cittadella
family, the house underwent changes, becoming a prime example of
neoclassical architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Here, as at Reale, are lovely gardens, replete with a box-hedge
theater, an oval, flower-bordered pool, shady paths that twist
through tall hedges and a lawn embellished with more than 100
terra-cotta pots containing century-old lemon trees. We were much
taken with the 18th century building where the trees are sheltered in
winter. A gorgeous rusty red, it consists of a row of stone-framed
arches with a second row of similarly framed circular windows.</TE>
<TE>   Grabau's other great decorative feature lies inside the house, an
elegant drawing room with parquet floor, whose walls seemed to be
draped in green, fringed silk. Close examination revealed that the
decoration had been painted on the plaster. The color is still as
vibrant as the day the finished room welcomed its first guests.</TE>
<TE>   Then we drove a short distance to Villa Oliva, an exquisite
example of Renaissance domestic architecture. The builder, Matteo
Civitalli, was a sculptor by profession, a true Renaissance man. We
found no one selling admission tickets at the wide-open gate, so Liet
and I walked onto the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Our initial glimpse of the house startled us: Six 10-foot-tall red
firecrackers (mock ones) stood upright on the lawn in vivid contrast
to the dignified villa behind them, with its beautiful arcaded
facade. The firecrackers had been installed as part of the Martini &amp;
Rossi celebration, and I liked them, however out of place they might
have seemed. The past needs to be tweaked from time to time.</TE>
<TE>   Our entry into the garden had not gone unnoticed, and we were
approached by a worker who sold us admission tickets and then pointed
the way to the elegant stables, where the varnished wood stalls
looked almost like beds. The straw was so fresh and fluffy that it
seemed the owners--only the fourth family to possess Oliva since
1500--do not keep horses.</TE>
<TE>   Next to the house, red and pink begonias formed a bright carpet,
and just beyond was an alcove terrace overlooking the aquamarine
swimming pool, bordered with pots of geraniums. I was charmed by a
mossy cascade that spilled down a low, steep slope, guarded by twin
lichen-splotched terra-cotta figures riding beasts that were half
horse, half fish. But the feature I liked best was the so-called
coffee house, a deeply shaded "room" in the middle of a grove of
trees, furnished with a large stone table, at the center of which
stood a graceful stone urn.</TE>
<TE>   With three villas visited by 1 p.m., we needed rest and lunch. We
knew of a restaurant in a converted mill nearby, but it was closed
when we arrived. So we drove up a hill and spotted another eatery,
jammed with guests. Knowing that it is hard to get a really bad meal
in Italy, we stopped. And lunch was indeed a delight--a ring of dark
green, freshly picked arugula dressed with olive oil and vinegar,
surrounding a generous serving of paper-thin slices of home-cured
prosciutto. The pungent combination--consumed with bread and chilled
white wine--proved delicious. My only regret was that I could not try
farro, or spelt, an ancient wheat grown in the region that has
recently come back into vogue. It is used in western Tuscany in soup
or mixed with rice and flavored with nutmeg, pecorino cheese, grated
lemon rind, salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Our last villa, Torrigiano, which lay half an hour away by car,
was the grand finale to the day. For so theatrical a house, "finale"
is just the right word. As the house came into view across an expanse
of lawn, framed by the double columns of its gate, I felt like
applauding.</TE>
<TE>   Without doubt, the villa is a tour de force, a great ornament of
the Baroque period. Not only do statues adorn the two levels of the
balustrade roof, but they also fill the niches and archways of the
facade, the lower part of which is fitted stone, the upper yellow
stucco.</TE>
<TE>   Before roaming through the gardens, we visited the interior with
an English-speaking guide. Some of the chambers bore gorgeous
frescoes on their ceilings and walls--depictions of the four seasons
in the bedrooms, scenes from classical mythology in the drawing rooms
and Roman history in the cavernous main hall. Portraits of ancestors
and other valuable paintings gave us a further sense of the owners'
rich lifestyles.</TE>
<TE>   The family descends from the Marquis Nicolao Santini, who was the
republic of Lucca's ambassador to the court of France's Sun King,
Louis XIV. The old ambassador, all these years after his death, is
the greatest presence at the villa.</TE>
<TE>   He was sunstruck by the opulence he found at the Palace of
Versailles. Upon coming home, he had the villa's rooms decorated with
its frescoes, the facade done over in its present dramatic mode and
the estate laid out in the formal style of Versailles' guiding
genius, the landscape architect Andre Le Notre.</TE>
<TE>   A visitor to the grounds will find trees from around the world and
a wide assortment of rare camellias, but there is nothing to match
the sunken garden at the base of a double staircase. In its
intricately patterned beds filled with bright flowers, you will see
why, like the house itself, the old marquis continues to spread
enchantment.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: "You can just imagine how long it has been there,"
Manhattan Beach reader Sandy Irons says of this centuries-old partial
Buddha statue eerily enclosed in a tree trunk. Irons was touring
Thailand with her husband last year when she snapped this photo in
Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya, more commonly shortened to Ayutthaya, about
50 miles north of Bangkok. From the 14th to 18th centuries, Ayutthaya
was the capital of a kingdom that ruled much of Southeast Asia; it
was a place of royal palaces and magnificent temples, the ruins of
which have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This Buddha
statue likely was severed by the Burmese, who invaded in 1767 and
destroyed much of the capital--but left hints of Ayutthaya's splendor
scattered across town. Says Irons, "You still see all these statues
with no heads."</CP>

<HD>A Successful Undertaking</HD>
<DH>'Six Feet Under' quickly became a hit for HBO last season.
The series, about a mortician family, returns Sunday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>HBO is quick to boast that "Six Feet Under" drew larger audiences
last year than any other freshman series in the cable network's
history, even outgunning "The Sopranos."</LD>
<LD>   And the darkly comic drama from "American Beauty" scribe Alan Ball
won the Golden Globe for best dramatic TV series, upsetting Tony
Soprano's mob and NBC's "The West Wing."</LD>
<LD>   But perhaps the most important indicator of its popularity? "Our
extras casting director says she has a waiting list of people who
want to be corpses," says Ball, creator and executive producer of the
series about a family-owned mortuary.</LD>
<TE>   "One of the funniest things I hear now on the set is, 'OK, cameras
are rolling and dead people take a deep breath--and action!'"</TE>
<TE>   Michael C. Hall, who plays mortician David Fisher, says that he
often feels for the extras who play the dead bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, they build a prosthetics thing onto their bodies so we
can sew into it, so it looks like we're stitching up actual flesh.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's really strange for some people. They said [to
themselves], 'This is a good gig. I'll go in and work a day'--and
they find themselves lying on a slab in the prep room."</TE>
<TE>   The series explores life and death through the eyes of the
dysfunctional Fisher family, which owns and operates Fisher &amp; Sons
Funeral Home in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Hall, "Six Feet Under" stars Peter Krause as Nate Fisher,
David's older brother, who returned home to work in the family
business after the death of their father (Richard Jenkins); Frances
Conroy as their scattered mother, Ruth; Lauren Ambrose as their
troubled teenage sister, Claire; and Rachel Griffiths as Nate's
emotionally- charged girlfriend, Brenda.</TE>
<TE>   "Six Feet Under," which premiered last summer, returns for its
second season of 13 episodes on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Although the first season was shown while the broadcast networks
were in reruns, the second is going up against new episodes of "The
X-Files," "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent" and "Alias."</TE>
<TE>   But nobody seems worried. "We felt it had a lot of strength and
momentum," says Carolyn Strauss, HBO's senior vice president of
original programming.</TE>
<TE>   "Alan was willing to be ready for March, so we took advantage of
that."</TE>
<TE>   HBO always has been savvy in marketing its original series and
movies. Strauss points out that the cable network did "a very big
push for the show last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our marketing department is excellent at getting the word out. So
I think this year we will have another very visible push for the
show."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe too visible. "We are being asked to do lot of press while we
are in production," says Ball.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all stretched a little more in that direction. Last year,
it was very convenient that we finished production and we could do
all the promotions stuff. This year we are having to balance that. It
makes things a little more hectic."</TE>
<TE>   Ball, though, doesn't feel any internal pressure over second
season expectations. "For whatever reason, I am able to not pay
attention to those things," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how to second guess what people want and give it to
them. The few times in my life where I have tried to do that, I have
failed miserably. All I know is how to do the show I would watch.
That is what I am doing."</TE>
<TE>   Though Ball won't give away plot points for the coming season, he
does explain his decision to afflict Nate late last season with
arteriovenous malformation--an unusually enlarged and entangled group
of blood vessels--in his brain.</TE>
<TE>   "Nate is a character who has been running away from death his
entire life," Ball says.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like [death] would be his worst fear, in a way.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all mortal, and something could happen to us at any
moment, but for a man who grew up surrounded by death and has found
discomfort with it, it seems like, in a lot of ways, this is the best
thing that could happen to him because it is really going to force
him to face his own mortality."</TE>
<TE>   "Six Feet Under" can be seen Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO. The network
has rated it TV-MA (unsuitable for children under 17).</TE>

<HD>Agoura Hills Vote to Decide Big-Box Issue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The time has come to settle the score in Agoura Hills' battle of the
big-box stores.</LD>
<LD>   Voters will decide Tuesday on Measure H, a ballot initiative that
would prohibit construction of any retail building larger than 60,000
square feet.</LD>
<LD>   For months, the issue has divided the 21,500 residents of this
upscale, semirural community in western Los Angeles County. Neighbors
argue about it, parents and teachers debate outside schools and
letter writers weigh in for or against the measure in the local
weekly newspaper, the Acorn.</LD>
<TE>   The two sides have spent thousands of dollars on campaign phone
banks, petitions, ads, fliers and lawn signs.</TE>
<TE>   "To say I'm looking forward to an end of all this is an
understatement," Agoura Hills Mayor Denis Weber said Friday evening.
"This has split the community."</TE>
<TE>   The measure arose from business owners and residents ruffled by a
proposal to build a Home Depot on Agoura Road, near Kanan Road and
the city's most prominent point, Ladyface Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Selleck, president of Selleck Development Group in Westlake
Village, submitted a preliminary proposal a year ago for an 11.4-acre
project that would include a 115,000-square-foot anchor store
alongside a 24,000-square-foot garden center.</TE>
<TE>   Selleck has yet to file a completed application with the city, but
that hasn't stopped Measure H proponents from trying to ban Home
Depot or other large stores from setting up shop in Agoura Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The project would generate an estimated $500,000 in sales tax
revenue in the first year of operation and $750,000 by year 10,
according to Selleck and Weber. The money would go toward police,
fire, road improvements and other city services, Weber said.</TE>
<TE>   Without the money, the mayor said, the council would have to
consider raising taxes. The city has no utility or business license
tax.</TE>
<TE>   If Measure H passes, developers would have to convince voters to
overturn the law in a future election before they could draw plans
for large stores.</TE>
<TE>   "Not many people understand that this is not just about the Home
Depot," a reason that Agoura Hills' council members and former mayors
oppose Measure H, Weber said. "We can't close the door to free
enterprise."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, officials said city codes already ensure that any
proposal for a large retail development undergo strict scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Misinformation in campaign brochures and the press has confused
the issue, said Weber, Selleck and other leaders in both camps. Last
month, the Los Angeles Times reported erroneously that the city had
prepared an agreement pledging public funds for the Home Depot
project.</TE>
<TE>   Figures on traffic flow, environmental impacts and specific costs
are still being hammered out, Weber said.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has the city decided how much money--if any--it would
contribute to the project or related improvements, such as widening
roads, Weber and other officials said.</TE>
<TE>   All of those decisions would be made after the council holds
public hearings.</TE>
<TE>   But Measure H supporters said they do not want a big-box store of
any kind. "They don't fit in with the community," said Antonette
Krpan-Giglio, co-author of the initiative and a member of Citizens
for Responsible Growth, which opposes large retail stores.</TE>
<TE>   Besides being ugly, Krpan-Giglio said, she feared the Home Depot
would cause traffic jams and noise, destroy trees and streams, drive
down property values and attract day laborers.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is so divided," said Krpan-Giglio, who has lived in
Agoura Hills for 11 years. "It's been a very painful process."</TE>
<TE>   Spearheading the pro-Measure H movement are Do-It Center, Agoura
Equipment Rentals, Roadside Lumber and other stores that would
compete with Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   Jess Ruf, owner of 10 Do-It Center stores in California, including
the one in Agoura Hills, said he is not against competition, "but I
have a right to defend my business. A Home Depot just opens the door
to more big-box stores. Next, there will be a Target."</TE>
<TE>   But Thom Bancroft, co-chairman of Taxpayers Opposing Special
Treatment, a group fighting Measure H, said the city needs big
stores.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of going to Westlake Village or other communities, why
not keep the sales tax in our community?" Bancroft said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the obstacles, Home Depot wants to be in the community,
said Greg George, real estate manager for the Atlanta-based chain's
regional offices in Orange. Stores in nearby Woodland Hills and
Thousand Oaks receive a steady stream of Agoura Hills shoppers, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The company has grappled with unwelcoming cities, but having to
overcome a ballot initiative is rare, said George, who has helped
broker Home Depot deals for 14 years. It has given $75,000 to the
anti-Measure H efforts, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Selleck, a longtime Agoura Hills resident, said his
Craftsman-style Home Depot would complement the new City Hall and
library. He also said it would eliminate the rubbish, vacant lots and
garish billboards dotting the area.</TE>
<TE>   "We're cleaning up the blight," he said.</TE>

<LD>A Panorama City man was in custody Saturday after Los Angeles police
and federal officers found a cache of assault weapons and counterfeit
money during a search of his home.</LD>
<LD>   More than 75 assault rifles and about 100 handguns were seized at
the house in the 8000 block of Greenbush Avenue, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery of at least two hand grenades prompted police to
evacuate the neighborhood for about two hours until a bomb squad
determined them to be inert.</LD>
<TE>   Officers also found materials and a machine for making credit
cards and a large number of counterfeit $20 bills. Agents of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the U.S. Secret Service
are investigating.</TE>
<TE>   Police initially spotted some of the weapons while helping a
bounty hunter search the house for another man wanted on two
$1-million warrants.</TE>
<TE>   That man remains at large, police said. Authorities did not
release the name of the man in custody.</TE>

<HD>2nd District Race May Shift Council Balance</HD>
<DH>Win by Cardenas could solidify Padilla's presidency. Nine
members are backing Greuel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With control of the Los Angeles City Council at stake, voters will
choose Tuesday between two political veterans when they elect a new
2nd District representative from the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblyman Tony Cardenas of Panorama City and DreamWorks SKG
executive Wendy Greuel of Van Nuys, both young Democrats, are
battling for the job.</LD>
<LD>   There is excitement over the prospect of a new representative for
the district after three decades under Joel Wachs, who resigned last
year.</LD>
<TE>   "They bring fresh viewpoints, and they are eager to find out who
you are and what they can do for you," said Polly Ward, vice
president of the Studio City Residents Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Council President Alex Padilla has campaigned hard for Cardenas,
his former boss when Padilla was an Assembly aide. Cardenas' election
would shore up Padilla's wafer-thin support on the council.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only has Tony clearly shown he is committed to the community,
but he has a track record in Sacramento for five years of getting
things done," Padilla said.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel is backed by nine council members, including several in a
faction that opposed Padilla's election as president and want a
change.</TE>
<TE>   "Wendy is more qualified for the city position. This is the city,
not the state," said Councilman Hal Bernson. "She isn't as beholden
to all the unions and other interests, like Tony is."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas says his priority is Valley residents, not special
interests.</TE>
<TE>   As of Wednesday, Greuel had spent $389,000 and Cardenas $265,000.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, more than $106,000 in independent expenditures were
made by outside groups favoring the candidates, including Clear
Channel Outdoor, which spent $41,500 on billboards touting both
candidates; the United Firefighters Local 112, which spent $19,800 on
political brochures favoring Cardenas; and the Apartment Assn. of
Greater Los Angeles, which spent $8,000 on radio and newspaper ads
favoring Greuel.</TE>
<TE>   The race also has divided Hollywood. DreamWorks founders Steven
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen have hosted
fund-raisers for Greuel, while Disney Co. executives, including
Chairman Michael Eisner and President Bob Iger, hosted a fund-raiser
at the studio for Cardenas. (Katzenberg had a bitter falling out with
Eis ner after being denied the No. 2 job at Disney.)</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas surged out of the primary election last year with
momentum, winning 47.7% of the vote to Greuel's 42.5%. But Greuel
picked up the endorsement of third-place finisher Jamie Cordaro, a
Republican, and has taken advantage of a slight fund-raising lead to
blitz the district with mailers attacking Cardenas.</TE>
<TE>   The district stretches from Studio City to Sunland-Tujunga,
including Shadow Hills, La Tuna Canyon and parts of North Hollywood,
Mission Hills, Lake View Terrace, Arleta, Valley Village, Van Nuys
and Panorama City.</TE>
<TE>   The district's Latino population has jumped from 34% to 47.3% in
the last decade, while the white population has declined from 53% to
35.4%. Despite the shift, Latinos make up only 25% of registered
voters.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas said he has been elected three times to state office in
the northeast Valley "with a lot of crossover vote."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said she is much better known and has a broader base of
support than she did when she first began campaigning last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to fight for the San Fernando Valley's fair share," she
said. "I am an independent voice for the Valley, not a career
politician."</TE>
<TE>   Greuel, 40, has criticized Cardenas for taking contributions to
his council campaign and an aborted run for secretary of state from
special interests cultivated in Sacramento, including Indian tribes
that operate casinos.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas, 38, said he has spent five years in the Assembly
representing the interests of residents of that district, which
includes much of the council district.</TE>
<TE>   "I put the Valley first," he said. "I was born and raised in the
northeast Valley. I have owned a business in the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   A former real estate company owner, Cardenas cited his experience
as powerful chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee. He was
instrumental in bringing $591 million in transportation funding to
the Valley, as well as $68 million for police and youth programs, and
millions more to develop 17 parks.</TE>
<TE>   "My track record shows that I have worked on bills that improved
education, public safety and the lives of senior citizens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel asserted that Cardenas shares some blame for the state's
$17-billion projected budget deficit. Cardenas said the major factor
in the deficit is the economic slowdown, exacerbated by the events of
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel is no stranger to government. She worked as an intern for
Wachs, who has endorsed her. She also served for a decade as an aide
to then-Mayor Tom Bradley, under whom she helped develop the LA's
BEST after-school program. She worked for four years for the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development before taking a job as
government and community affairs executive for the DreamWorks
entertainment company.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel recently released a 51-point plan for Los Angeles that
includes increasing the police force by 1,500 officers and expanding
the senior lead officer police program.</TE>
<TE>   She also supports creating a Valley transit agency to handle bus
service, the proposed east-west busway in the Valley and increasing
parking near subway stations.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas has criticized Greuel's plan as too costly. He supports
an expansion of the police force from its current 8,900 officers to
at least 10,000, as well as efforts to improve officer morale,
recruitment and retention.</TE>
<TE>   He promises to bring department managers into the district so they
can see needs firsthand. Like his opponent, Cardenas says he will
emphasize improved basic city services, including tree trimming and
sidewalk repairs.</TE>

<LD>A slumping economy. A projected $17.5-billion budget shortfall.
Lingering fallout from a costly energy crisis. These issues form a
bleak backdrop to the race for governor of California, and are widely
viewed as Gov. Gray Davis' biggest political weakness as he makes his
case for a second term.</LD>
<LD>   California's sudden fiscal malaise provides a priceless
opportunity for the Democratic governor's three Republican
challengers to sound classic GOP themes of fiscal conservatism and
smaller government. And in a relentless barrage of sound bites, the
Republicans have attacked Davis' economic record, accusing him of
recklessly spending a massive state surplus, making disastrous
financial decisions in the heat of the power crunch and allowing the
state bureaucracy to mushroom.</LD>
<LD>   "Gray is great in clear weather, but when the clouds come, he
heads for cover," said Secretary of State Bill Jones, one of the main
GOP challengers. "That is not someone you want in office."</LD>
<TE>   "He took the highest surplus in the history of our state and he
didn't put any of it away for a rainy day," said another, former Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Yet beneath the vitriol, there has been little substance. Jones,
Riordan and financier Bill Simon all have done little to distinguish
themselves as the candidate of choice on fiscal issues, according to
economists, political experts and budget analysts following the
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Each has offered few detailed answers to the difficult question of
how he would sort out the budget mess without harming crucial public
services. Riordan, who had been the GOP front-runner until a late
surge by Simon, has not unveiled any budget plan whatsoever, and does
not intend to do so before Tuesday's primary. And the vague economic
stimulus proposals the Republicans have put forth all sound strangely
similar.</TE>
<TE>   "It illustrates how easy it is to be a candidate compared to
actually being governor," said Jean Ross of the California Budget
Project, a nonpartisan advocacy group for the poor. "Obviously, since
there is no good news here, they have made the calculation that there
is nothing to be gained by sketching out a framework for how to deal
with this problem. Richard Riordan has taken that to an extreme by
offering nothing at all."</TE>
<TE>   Some economists and campaign experts say they are especially
surprised that the Republican challengers have not made better
political use of the state's budget problem, the worst in more than a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Davis may be forced to make deep cuts in politically
popular programs such as education and health care--or even raise
taxes--this summer to bridge the gap, budget watchers say. And
critics say Davis was downright Clintonian on the volatile tax issue
earlier this year when he vowed he "would not advocate raising
taxes," leaving open the possibility that he would sign a tax hike
into law if it were placed on his desk by the Legislature. The
Republican candidates for governor have all vowed not to raise taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Up for Grabs: Whose Fault Is It?</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a major issue, but it's interesting to me that
... it has not been a major campaign issue," said Tom Lieser, senior
economist with UCLA's Anderson Forecast, which studies the state's
economic well-being. "The campaign has been focused on issues that
should be trivia. Nobody's been seriously talking about which
expenditures to cut, which programs to sacrifice."</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, Davis' chief campaign strategist, says there is a
reason for his opponents' lack of detailed emphasis on California's
financial problem: All over the country, states are encountering
similar budget difficulties, a sign that the problem is related to
the national economy.</TE>
<TE>   "People are smart enough to understand that this is taking place
under a national recession, which was underway before Sept. 11 and
was made worse by those events," South said. "It's not a pretty
picture. I am sure there will be a lot of angst and pain caused by
the necessity of closing the shortfall. But I find it hard to believe
this is the knockout blow the Republicans seem to think it is."</TE>
<TE>   There is also the issue of the larger economic picture under
Davis: Current woes aside, he presided over one of the bigger booms
in modern state history. Even with a recent rise in unemployment, the
state has added nearly a million new jobs since Davis took office.
The California economy grew from what would be the seventh to the
fifth-largest among nations, placing it between Britain and France.</TE>
<TE>   Though the energy crisis forced the state to spend billions of
taxpayer dollars on electricity, the lights stayed on last summer,
when many experts predicted that months of mass blackouts would
cripple businesses. And though the economy's short-term outlook
remains poor, indicators suggest that the state, like the nation, may
already be pulling out of its mini-recession, which a year from now
could look like a bump in the road.</TE>
<TE>   Though Davis' Republican foes love to point out that the state
budget has grown roughly 37% during his tenure, exceeding population
and inflation increases, campaign spokesman Roger Salazar noted that
they rarely mention how little it grew in the decade before he took
office, when GOP Gov. Pete Wilson struggled with an even bigger
budget problem. Wilson had to make draconian cuts to numerous
programs, notably health care and welfare. Davis, Salazar argued,
came in with a mandate from voters to boost education, transportation
and health spending--and that is what he did.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor makes no apologies for that," he said. "That is what
you are supposed to do in the good years."</TE>
<TE>   Threadbare as their proposals have been, the Republican contenders
have all offered some glimpses into how they would attempt to extract
California from its budget problem.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has touted a so-called zero-based budgeting plan that
would evaluate bureaucrats' demands for money every year instead of
simply accepting the previous year's budget as a starting point for
negotiations. He has proposed a cut in the sales tax on manufacturing
equipment, a strategic move his advisors say would spark economic
growth and create jobs. And he proposes a team in his administration
to help business leaders cut red tape.</TE>
<TE>   "We are giving a sense of what we want to do," said Riordan's
policy director, Joel Fox. "A lot of it is an attack on the
bureaucracy."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, an advocate of the supply-side economic theories
popularized by President Reagan, has advocated a reduction in the
state's capital gains tax as a way to spur investment. He wants to
conduct a fresh evaluation of all programs and eliminate those that
are not "cost-effective." And he wants to establish a second state
budget reserve, dedicated solely to dealing with natural disasters.
"It's fairly well proven by this point that when you reduce taxes,
that fuels economic growth, because businesses have more money to
reinvest," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who has the most government experience of the three
candidates, proposes to put before voters any plans to spend a state
surplus greater than $2 billion. He wants to limit the governor's
ability to expand government with a strict spending cap that would
mirror increases in population and inflation. And he wants to
eliminate the so-called phantom jobs that permeate the bureaucracy,
vacant positions whose salaries are often diverted to pay for other
things.</TE>
<TE>   "People have said to me, 'You are taking away the flexibility of
the governor,'" Jones said. "My answer is: Yes, that is true, but if
you look at Gray Davis and his inability to stop spending money,
that's not such a bad thing."</TE>
<TE>   While the proposals provide some indications of how the candidates
would approach their task if elected, they also illustrate the
political dangers of being specific.</TE>
<TE>   A Few Specifics, and Risks Therein</TE>
<TE>   In proposing a manufacturing tax cut, for example, Riordan is
betting on increased jobs, but the immediate impact would be a
reduction of $380 million a year from state coffers--hardly a step
toward erasing the budget shortfall. Simon proposes trimming all
pork-barrel spending from the budget, an idea that may sound good to
voters fed up with government as usual, but to several budget experts
it reinforced the notion that the political neophyte hasn't a clue
how to move his agenda in Sacramento. And while Jones repeats his
populist plan to get rid of phantom jobs, an idea also backed by the
other candidates, he does not provide any money to offset what would
be a dramatic hit on state agencies, notably the prison system.</TE>
<TE>   With Davis' unorthodox decision to launch negative advertising
against Riordan before the primary election, some pundits believe
that the governor has skillfully changed the tenor of the campaign
and moved it away from the financial issues.</TE>
<TE>   Former GOP campaign strategist Allan Hoffenblum, editor of the
nonpartisan Target Book elections guide, said the budget shortfall
emerged as a key issue in the race in January, when Davis made his
slippery statement on taxes during his State of the State address.</TE>
<TE>   "It's where Davis is the weakest, without a doubt," Hoffenblum
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis succeeded in changing the subject by attacking Riordan
on abortion, the death penalty and energy.</TE>
<TE>   "He took the spotlight off the budget," Hoffenblum said. "The
whole issue of the campaign [became] who is Dick Riordan and what are
his positions on the issues."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike crime or education, the budget and economy are somewhat
abstract issues. It is for that reason, in fact, that Riordan has not
planned to release a budget plan until May, when Davis has to flesh
out his budget cuts and the human impact of the financial mess will
become clear.</TE>
<TE>   "People have grown weary of the rhetoric surrounding the budget,"
Jones said, adding, "I will not run against Gray Davis on the
economy. I will run against Gray Davis on the little mother in Fresno
who can't pay her power bills."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, when the budget battle heats up this summer, and
painful but unavoidable decisions to cut popular programs have to be
made, politicos predict Davis will still be in a fight to justify his
economic record. The California Constitution requires passage of a
balanced budget, making it more difficult for Davis to dodge the
budget problem by postponing it.</TE>
<TE>   "The state budget isn't yet real for most people," said Sherry
Bebitch Jeffe, who teaches political science at USC. "I don't think
it's registering with the ordinary Californians. They are far more
concerned with their own economic well-being."</TE>
<TE>   But Bebitch Jeffe predicted that will change as the year goes
on--particularly if a spending plan is not approved by the July
deadline and a partisan budget battle drags into late summer. Because
the budget needs two-thirds approval of the Legislature, and thus
requires some Republican support, many already predict just such a
scenario.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, economists and political experts say, the challenge
for Davis will be to communicate his overall record in office, and
make a case that the shortfall is due to a short-term economic
downturn from which the state is already emerging. By contrast, the
challenge for the eventual Republican challenger will be to focus on
the current deficit and paint it as the result of Davis' policies.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP hopefuls have shown signs of trying just that.</TE>
<TE>   How Will Blame Work With Voters?</TE>
<TE>   "It all started when he became governor," Simon said when asked to
explain why Davis caused the budget problem. "You can get away with
that [excessive spending] in government for a period of time, but if
you head into a soft economy where tax revenues decline, like we have
been in for some time now, the rocks are going to show."</TE>
<TE>   "He was blindfolded. He did not see [the recession] coming, when
it was clear," Riordan said. "He should have been making major cuts a
year ago, when it was clear the Internet stocks were going down the
tubes."</TE>
<TE>   Economist Ross C. DuVol of the Milken Institute said voters may
not keep up with the latest financial minutiae coming out of
Sacramento or Washington, but evidence suggests that they draw
distinctions between the state and national economy through
conversations with friends, neighbors and business colleagues, and
what they read in the local newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were an incumbent governor, knowing about this trend, I
would be doing everything I could to remind voters of my record
during my four years in office, and make the case that the technology
sector made California more vulnerable to the economic downturn,"
DuVol said.</TE>
<TE>   But history suggests Davis may have a problem making his
case--especially if he waits too long. When former President Bush was
entering the final stages of his 1992 race against Bill Clinton,
DuVol noted, indicators showed the country was coming out of
recession.</TE>
<TE>   But by then, it was too late for Bush. Clinton had seized the
economic issue, and beat him.</TE>

<HD>Girl Scouts Burn U.S. Flags-- Out of Respect for Old Glory</HD>
<DH>Patriotism: Mt. Wilson Council collects about 150 aging
banners for retirement ceremony in Altadena. Federal law calls for
their disposal in a 'dignified way.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Emmy Petermann of Arcadia loves this country. She loves its flag. But
Friday night, she burned it.</LD>
<LD>   Petermann's flag--which she flew for more than 50 years--was the
centerpiece of a rarely performed flag retirement ceremony at the
Girl Scouts' Camp Mariposa in Altadena.</LD>
<LD>   As a teenage Cadette played taps on her flute, members of a Girl
Scout color guard slowly lowered Petermann's flag over a smoldering
fire pit. The Scouts, all from the Mt. Wilson Vista Girl Scout
Council, waited until it was engulfed by fire--and then tossed 13
more flags into the pit to burn.</LD>
<TE>   In the nearly six months since the attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, America has been in the grip of flag fever.</TE>
<TE>   Public buildings have been adorned with giant canopies of red,
white and blue; street medians are decorated with flag-like bunting;
and handkerchief-size standards wave from automobiles everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   But on many of those flags, colors that were once vibrant and
dramatic have faded. Crisp lines and defiant stripes are now
threadbare and soiled. Their owners have tucked them away in garages,
attics and closets, many unsure of how or where to dispose of them.</TE>
<TE>   Petermann, 85, who immigrated to the U.S. from Germany when she
was 10 years old, said she donated her aging flag--adorned with only
48 stars--to the Girl Scouts after seeing a notice about the ceremony
in the local paper.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fringed at the edges and had started to get
funny-looking," she said. "The white was very yellow."</TE>
<TE>   Hers was among almost 150 flags collected by the Scouts for the
retirement rite. The Girl Scouts chose to make it the centerpiece of
their ceremony because, in the 1950s, it flew over the Petermanns'
home in North Hollywood, where Ronald Reagan and his then-wife, Jane
Wyman, once lived. The Pasadena Elks lodge donated eight flags to the
Girl Scouts; the city of Duarte brought 85, neatly folded and bagged.
But most of the flags were from people who felt moved to do something
about their symbols of national pride that had been wasting away.</TE>
<TE>   The burning of an American flag has long been a symbol of protest,
one that conjures up a Supreme Court case, congressional debates and
images of rioters around the globe protesting American foreign
policy.</TE>
<TE>   But the people who donated flags to the ceremony see themselves as
true patriots. By this act of destruction, they were demonstrating
their reverence.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I did when I came here was put up a flagpole,"
said Dean De Bois, a World War II Navy bugler who now lives in a
mobile home park in El Monte and donated three flags to the Scouts.
"I fly a flag 24 hours a day. I've had extras out, with the war going
on in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "When they fade, I save them up. This time, I saved them until I
saw someone was going to have a ceremony."</TE>
<TE>   Federal law says that when a flag "is in such condition that it is
no longer a fitting emblem for display, [it] should be destroyed in a
dignified way, preferably by burning."</TE>
<TE>   According to the American Legion, individuals can do this
"discreetly, so the act of destruction is not perceived as a protest
or desecration."</TE>
<TE>   But in part because many areas prohibit outdoor fires, the
ceremony has become the provenance of Scout troops and such civic
groups as the American Legion.</TE>
<TE>   Such retirements are usually held on Flag Day, June 14. But
Kathleen Vallee Stein of the Mt. Wilson Vista Girl Scouts said they
felt the ceremony was needed sooner because so many new flags were
bought after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The Girl Scouts burned 14 flags Friday; the rest will be retired
at a time when fire risks are lower.</TE>
<TE>   For the teenage and preteen Cadettes who participated in the
ceremony, the idea of burning a flag to honor it took a little
getting used to.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Paccone, 12, of La Canada Flintridge, one of the ceremony's
color guards, said that when she told her mother what she would be
doing in the ceremony, her mother thought that she was mistaken. "I'd
never heard of a flag retirement ceremony," Kate said. "But I thought
it would be an honor to participate."</TE>
<TE>   She and her fellow Scouts kept vigil over the flames overnight,
then buried the ashes at dawn on the Camp Mariposa grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Espinoza, 15, of San Gabriel, another color guard, said the
hardest part of the ceremony was watching the flags be destroyed.
"But you gotta do it," she said. "You gotta do it."</TE>

<HD>Democrats Slug It Out in Bid for Hertzberg Seat</HD>
<DH>First-time candidates Cherny and Levine trade charges in a
close contest for the Valley's 40th Assembly District.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The race to succeed powerful Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg has
transformed from the anointing of his handpicked successor to a
roiling, no-holds-barred political street brawl.</LD>
<LD>   Both Hertzberg's choice for his San Fernando Valley district,
Andrei Cherny, and his opponent, Lloyd Levine, are young, ambitious
and backed by powerful forces in the Democratic Party. Both are
running for office for the first time and are expected to spend more
than $500,000 by their party's primary on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In a district where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 49%
to 31%, liberal credentials are crucial. Though a Republican will
face Tuesday's winner in November, the Democrat will almost certainly
be the 40th District's next representative.</LD>
<TE>   Cherny's credentials were questioned last week by the Valley
chapter of the National Organization for Women, which broke with
tradition to endorse Levine. The group was incensed that Cherny had
portrayed Levine, who is rated 100% pro-choice by several groups, as
anti-abortion rights in mailers.</TE>
<TE>   The flier was "really dirty politics," said Jan Tucker,
spokeswoman for NOW's San Fernando Valley/Northeast Los Angeles
chapter. Then Thursday, actor and environmentalist Ed Begley Jr.
withdrew his endorsement of Cherny, citing mailers he called "false,
libelous and racist."</TE>
<TE>   Cherny's camp deflected the criticism without answering it, and
tried to revive its offense by accusing Levine's side of stealing one
of their fliers before it was mailed. (Coincidentally, it was about
crime.)</TE>
<TE>   Observers call the 40th one of the closest primary contests in the
state, and its shrill tenor supports that. A top Democratic
strategist calls the race between former Assembly aides a "knockdown,
drag-out" street fight.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anybody who thinks they know what's really going to
happen," Darry Sragow said.</TE>
<TE>   In the final days, the two Valley natives have been inundating
voters daily with full-color fliers on their campaigns' key issues:
education, crime and traffic.</TE>
<TE>   From Cherny's manifesto on contemporary American politics, "The
Next Deal: The Future of Public Life in the Information Age" (Basic
Books, 2000), Levine's backers picked passages to portray Cherny in
alignment with Republican positions on Social Security, school
vouchers and missile defense.</TE>
<TE>   For an Assembly district that is stably Democratic, the
competition between Cherny and Levine has been especially volatile.</TE>
<TE>   Although some Democrats were surprised when incumbent Hertzberg
(D-Sherman Oaks) tapped a 26-year-old aide to succeed him, they
nevertheless assumed the former White House speech writer would be
the heir to the southwestern Valley district.</TE>
<TE>   But late last year, 32-year-old Levine stepped in with a lineage
of his own--his father has run the campaigns of many of Southern
California's most prominent Democrats and is a leader of the group
trying to keep the Valley a part of Los Angeles. Both Cherny and
Levine say they oppose Valley secession, but think a public vote
should settle the question.</TE>
<TE>   Levine's family connections quickly became an issue when his
parents loaned him $88,000 for his campaign. Cherny complained the
loan was illegal, but the state's watchdog commission has not ruled.
When Cherny brought up the loan at a recent debate, after Levine had
returned the money to put the issue to rest, Levine shot back, "I
guarantee you my parents aren't corrupting me."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the spending in the race has been by outside groups. The
California Alliance, a coalition of lawyers, environmentalists and
nurses, has put more than $70,000 behind Levine, while Cherny has
benefited from roughly the same amount from a political action
committee of the California Chamber of Commerce. Californians for
Common Sense, a committee representing the beer, oil, construction
and energy industries, has spent about $20,000 to support Cherny,
according to the "California Target Book," which tracks campaign
finances and handicaps races.</TE>
<TE>   "The Valley business-types are going with Cherny, and labor and
the more liberal groups are going with Levine," said Target Book
Publisher Allan Hoffenblum.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that divide, Hoffenblum pointed out, "I don't think
there's that much difference between the two when you get right down
to it."</TE>
<TE>   The lone Republican in the race said she hopes to inject some
difference in the general election, despite the GOP's long odds in
the 40th District, which encompasses Van Nuys, Reseda, Northridge,
Canoga Park, North Hills and Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Connie Friedman, who is recovering from surgery to remove a brain
tumor, said she has been following the race between the "two young
men" and both have impressed her.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman, 60, said her experience running a human-resources
consulting business gives her an edge.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic side of the race is too close to call, unless, of
course you ask the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a close race," Cherny said.</TE>
<TE>   Levine's prediction: "I think I'm about to win."</TE>

<HD>Agenda Is Gender in Coast City</HD>
<DH>Election: Seal Beach voters will decide whether the town's
charter should refer to he and she.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A simple matter of housecleaning. That's what the Seal Beach city
clerk said is behind the measure on Tuesday's city ballot that seeks
to eliminate the use of male-only gender references like "he" and
"his" in the city charter.</LD>
<LD>   Shucks. No feminists burning brooms. No downtown blockades by
protesters of the city's Historic District. Just chalk it up to
modernization.</LD>
<LD>   "We had some old charter language that refers to city jobs all as
'he,'" said City Clerk Joanne Yeo. "And we're trying to bring the
city's charter into the 21st century."</LD>
<TE>   Example: "The City Manager will be responsible for the City
Council. He will...."</TE>
<TE>   Goodbye pronoun, hello equality. If perturbed, thank city
officials. They wanted to raise the city manager's threshold to
authorize contracts without council approval from $5,000 to $20,000
and needed to change the charter.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, they found a few cobwebs in the language that
governs this sleepy little coastal Shangri-La.</TE>
<TE>   In its early days, Seal Beach had a reputation for its gambling
and houses of prostitution. The city was well-known to sailors,
explained historian Gordon Shanks, who helped bring back a Pacific
Electric Red Car to the city in 1972, which now serves as a museum.
"This was in the 1920s and 1930s when sailors would get off boats at
Long Beach and take a cab to Seal Beach to take advantage of gambling
and prostitution," Shanks said.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach had been founded "by conservatives," he said, and Seal
Beach was the Southland's Las Vegas, and no one in Long Beach could
change it, "because it was across the county line."</TE>
<TE>   By the time the city chose a charter in 1964, it had cleaned up
its act. The recreation of choice became surfing as blond-haired
locals humming Beach Boys tunes rode long boards near the famed pier.</TE>
<TE>   What did it matter that every job description in the charter made
it look like Dude City?</TE>
<TE>   According to the city attorney's impartial analysis, a yes vote on
the measure, designated SS, will replace gender-based designations in
the city charter with gender-neutral terms. A no vote retains the
current language.</TE>
<TE>   It's a choice that has many residents just rolling their eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd think the city would have something better to do with their
time," said one of the gray-haired male retirees sitting in a chair
at the Main Street Barber Shop.</TE>
<TE>   But for Kimberly Salter, "I think it's about education and we have
to educate people [that] not everybody is a he and not everyone is a
she." Salter is president of a local branch of the National
Organization for Women. "If you have a daughter at school and she
hears that the city manager is a he and the coach is a he, it sinks
into [her] subconscious. You don't want your daughters thinking, 'I
can't do that job because only a man can do it,'" she said.</TE>

<HD>Recall Campaign Jolts Glendora</HD>
<DH>Drive to oust three City Council members for alleged abuse
of power is the first such effort in city's history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Glendora has a reputation as a folksy community. A place renowned for
its bougainvillea vines, old-style downtown and antique shops.</LD>
<LD>   High school basketball, and bears and deer wandering into town are
what usually count for excitement.</LD>
<LD>   But a recall campaign against three City Council members has
jolted the once sleepy town into the political fast lane.</LD>
<TE>   By a simple majority, Mayor John Harrold and councilmen Richard
Jacobs and Paul "Sonny" Marshall could be ousted from office Tuesday
in the community of 49,415, set in the foothills 27 miles east of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The three are advocates of slow growth in a 19.5-square-mile city
traditionally favorable to developers of upscale homes in its
foothills.</TE>
<TE>   Glendora Citizens for Responsible Government accuses the three of
abusing their power since becoming the governing majority on the
five-member council last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sad mess they've made of the city," said Bob Kuhn, a
former mayor and recall advocate. "They kicked out dozens of
volunteer city commissioners to make way for their cronies. They
fired a popular city manager and secretly hired a city attorney."</TE>
<TE>   The recall group has raised more than $200,000 in its effort to
oust the three men, making for plenty of lawn signs and mailers. That
is nearly 10 times as much as the incumbents have garnered.</TE>
<TE>   Art Ludwik, one of the owners of Glendora-based Rainbird Sprinkler
Manufacturing Corp., and his wife have contributed and loaned the
recall campaign about $80,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The same arrogance and brashness that led 7,400 registered voters
to sign the recall petition has led to a broad range of contributors
to give to the campaign," said Doug Tessitor, the recall committee's
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Harrold, Jacobs and Marshall, however, say the recall is driven by
a small group of development-friendly leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a recall election engineered by an arrogant elitist
ruling class from their country club," said Jacobs, a retired
professor of environmental studies at Cal Poly Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs doesn't like his chances in the election. "It is a
beautiful test," he said. "I think they are going to win. Money does
win elections."</TE>
<TE>   On their anti-recall Web site, the three categorize their critics
as "The Fat Cats" and "The Sore Losers." They warn: "Don't Let
Wealthy Developers and Special Interests Buy Glendora's City
Council." The three portray themselves as the protectors of the
foothills that have gradually disappeared as homes climbed up the
canyons in recent years. They also seek to capitalize on the city's
class and geographic divides.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the recall campaign contributors, Jacobs said, live in the
wealthy foothills, home to gated communities and the country club. He
said those people for years ignored residents south of Alosta Avenue,
now named Route 66.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of divisiveness is exactly why the three have to go,
Tessitor said.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than bringing the community together, they are trying to
tear it apart," he said. "I'm not a member of the country club nor
are most people involved in the recall."</TE>
<TE>   Planning Commissioner Ken Herman is making a bid for Harrold's
seat, former Judge Eugene Osko and business executive Gary Clifford
are vying for Jacobs' seat, and Azusa Pacific University basketball
Coach Cliff Hamlow hopes to replace Marshall. Herman, Clifford and
Hamlow are endorsed by the recall committee.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 24,000 registered voters are eligible to cast ballots to
replace one, two or all three council members in the first recall
election in city history.</TE>
<TE>   Incorporated in 1911, the "Pride of the Foothills" was a quaint
town surrounded by citrus groves until the 1950s, when large
residential developments began to spring up.</TE>
<TE>   As land became scarce in the 1990s, controversy emerged over
development.</TE>
<TE>   Then homeowner Robert Gagne sued the city for violating his civil
rights, claiming it illegally allowed a house in the foothills on a
too-small lot above his home. That suit, settled when the city paid
Gagne $800,000, further made development a hot-button issue.</TE>
<TE>   Harrold and Jacobs won council seats in March 1999. The next year,
they opposed a retail development, Glendora Marketplace, which
includes Home Depot, Sam's Club and other stores.</TE>
<TE>   With one of the five council members recusing himself, the council
deadlocked 2-2 on the project, slated for an area known as the old
strawberry patch.</TE>
<TE>   Harrold and Jacobs dissented, claiming it was too close to a
neighborhood and would be better used as a park. Shortly afterward,
voters approved the project in a citywide referendum by a 2-1 margin.</TE>
<TE>   Although the referendum passed, Harrold and Jacobs got a new ally
on the City Council when Marshall was elected last March.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of that victory, Kuhn said, the three became brash and
rude toward opponents. They passed an ordinance last May to replace
many longtime city commissioners--people who had volunteered for
years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand them wanting like-minded planning commissioners,
but some of these commissions are far from political," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kuhn complains that the three councilmen fired the city manager,
Gary Napper, and charges that they violated the state open meeting
law by hiring a new city attorney after meeting with him privately.</TE>
<TE>   Recall supporters say the three have created a crisis of
confidence in Glendora that makes the community less attractive to
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Harrold said they never fired a single commissioner--just asked
them to reapply and comply with a new ethics code. They did remove
the city manager, he said, but that is not unusual in local
government. He said they chose a new city attorney in public in
compliance with the law.</TE>
<TE>   "When Jimmy Hahn or George Bush were elected," he said, "no one
said they couldn't appoint who they wanted."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Firm to Bid for Global Crossing</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy: Gores Technology Group joins a short list
wanting the telecom giant, which lost $5 billion building a vast
fiber-optic network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles investment firm that specializes in buying distressed
technology companies is making a bid to land the biggest bust of them
all: Global Crossing Ltd.</LD>
<LD>   The investment company, Gores Technology Group, will make a bid
for Global Crossing in federal Bankruptcy Court in New York as early
as this week, The Times learned Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The offer represents the third bid for Global Crossing, which lost
more than $5 billion building an unrivaled fiber-optic network that
covers much of the globe. Although its network was envied, the
telecommunications company was ultimately brought down by its
crushing debt and slowing demand for space on its network.</LD>
<TE>   Unable to stave off anxious bankers, the Bermuda-based company,
which has executive offices in Beverly Hills, filed for bankruptcy
protection last month, listing $22.4 billion in assets and $12.3
billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   The action makes it the nation's fourth-largest bankruptcy case,
and the largest yet in the crumbling telecommunications industry.</TE>
<TE>   Financial terms of the Gores Technology bid haven't been
disclosed, but the company will offer "substantially more value" for
Global Crossing's creditors than a much-criticized $750-million bid
made by two Asian companies, a source familiar with the offer said
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   A Gores Technology spokesman would neither confirm not deny the
pending offer, saying the company does not comment on speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Gores Technology is run by Israeli immigrant Alec Gores, who has
gained a national reputation as a top-flight turnaround artist.</TE>
<TE>   His firm has acquired more than 35 mostly small technology
companies over the last 12 years, but its biggest catch came in
October 2000 with the purchase of the deeply troubled Learning Co.,
the children's software unit owned by toy giant Mattel Inc. of El
Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   If Gores' past actions are a guide, his moves at Global Crossing
could include bringing in a team of managers to rein in costs and
losses, giving managers and employees a stake in the firm, then
turning the operations back over to company executives. In most
cases, Gores has not replaced existing managers.</TE>
<TE>   Many believe that Global Crossing could survive, and perhaps
thrive, once its debt was erased. But it won't be easy.</TE>
<TE>   The company's core asset--its worldwide communications network--is
of solid quality, but many of its routes are now crowded with
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   With too many players chasing too little data traffic, network
prices have plummeted in some regions, exacerbating the financial
woes at Global Crossing and many of its rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Its most promising routes, the intra-Asian fiber-optic lines, are
only partly owned by Global Crossing, through its 59% ownership stake
in Asia Global Crossing. That company, which has not filed for
bankruptcy, is now in grave need of more cash.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Global Crossing, Gores would be not only taking on
a financially challenging project, but also walking into a company
rife with employee resentment over executives' high salaries and
bonuses, which have been paid out even as thousands of employees lost
their jobs, retirement investments and severance pay.</TE>
<TE>   The company also faces investigations by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the FBI over accusations that Global Crossing
used accounting tricks to mask its deteriorating financial health.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's creditors are not happy, either. Under the only
other reorganization plan under serious consideration, their cash
allotment amounts to mere pennies for every dollar they are owed.</TE>
<TE>   That offer was submitted by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd. and Singapore Technologies Telemedia, two companies that
already hold interests in a Global Crossing affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   Their plan includes a $750-million cash investment in Global
Crossing and gives them 79% ownership in the reorganized company.
Existing shareholders would be wiped out, and creditors would get
$300 million, plus $800 million in new debt and a 21% stake in the
new company.</TE>
<TE>   The Asian companies' plan has been widely criticized.</TE>
<TE>   Creditors believe that the $750-million investment is
low--amounting to just $50 million more than the company's current
cash balance of $700 million.</TE>
<TE>   Others believe that the bid raises national security concerns,
because Hutchison Whampoa's Li Ka-shing maintains close ties to
Chinese leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some worry that a recently discovered investment by
Global Crossing Chairman Gary Winnick in a Singapore firm could be
somehow linked to the Asian group's offer.</TE>
<TE>   To date, the only competing bid for Global Crossing has come from
a shareholders group that said it would raise $5.5 billion over three
years to repay creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Once Gores' offer is revealed, others also may surface. Analysts
believe that many telecommunications firms are eyeing Global
Crossing's assets, but it's unclear which firms will have the money
and muscle to launch a credible bid.</TE>
<TE>   Among those likely to be interested are overseas giants Deutsche
Telekom, France Telecom and Japan's NTT, as well as U.S. players
ranging from SBC Communications to Verizon Communications and from
AT&amp;T Corp. to Sprint Corp., or even cash-rich AOL Time Warner.</TE>

<LD>   It's a routine the freckle-faced boy has kept for 2 1/2 years
while operating an informal organization he calls Johnnie's Charity.
The toys are given to children as a reward for enduring uncomfortable
spinal taps and a procedure called a bone marrow aspiration.</LD>
<TE>   Every month Johnnie and his grandmother, Edie Layland, fill the
treatment room's "treasure chest," a large wooden cabinet, with the
toys they've collected from friends, neighbors and corporate
sponsors. Then they sit and wait for the poking and prodding to
begin.</TE>
<TE>   Johnnie is in remission from leukemia. He again has a full head of
hair and enjoys karate and computer games as much as any boy.</TE>
<TE>   Unpleasant Procedure</TE>
<TE>   He speaks matter-of-factly about his treatment, but his brave
front cracks just a little when he sees the needle that nurse Maria
Lapinid will use to administer the chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's OK, take a deep breath," Lapinid instructs as she taps the
back of Johnnie's hand in search of a vein.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, he is holding her hand as physician assistant Mitzi
D'Aquila begins the spinal tap.</TE>
<TE>   Johnnie is told to bring his knees up to his face so D'Aquila can
find the proper place to inject.</TE>
<TE>   "Go really slow," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go really slow," D'Aquila says. "You just let me know."</TE>
<TE>   "What are you learning in math right now?" Lapinid asks Johnnie as
D'Aquila begins draining spinal fluid into three small plastic vials.</TE>
<TE>   "Fractions, multiplying fractions," Johnnie says quietly.</TE>
<TE>   "You're doing great," Lapinid says.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, the procedure is over.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine "falling on a rock and then having someone push you
against that rock. That's how it feels," Johnnie explains later.</TE>
<TE>   Spinal taps, also known as lumbar punctures, and bone marrow
aspirations are used to diagnose and monitor certain cancers.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes leukemia cells can hide in the fluid surrounding the
spine and cushioning the brain, explained Lapinid. For patients like
Johnnie, it's the most direct way to see whether leukemia cells have
returned.</TE>
<TE>   During bone marrow aspirations, doctors remove marrow fluid from
the hip bone. Doctors usually apply a numbing cream to the area, and
some children are sedated, but the tests can be painful.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and nurses at Childrens Hospital have tried to make the
experience less traumatic by rewarding children with toys afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "During these procedures, the child is actually held down and he
or she loses a sense of control," says Maria Tome, a child life
specialist at the hospital. "Children sometimes can't conceptualize
why we're doing this to them, but we've found that when they are
rewarded with something, it helps them not to see the procedure in a
completely negative light."</TE>
<TE>   But Johnnie remembers very slim pickings the first time he looked
into the treasure chest three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing for boys," he recalls. "There were a couple of
Barbies, but there was nothing really good in there."</TE>
<TE>   Donations to the chest were down that year, so Johnnie decided to
take matters into his own hands. He told his grandmother he would use
his own savings to buy Legos for the toy box. Layland agreed and
offered to match his $15, and the two went to Toys R Us.</TE>
<TE>   And that's how Johnnie's Charity was born.</TE>
<TE>   Johnnie and his grandmother are not sure how many toys the charity
has donated to the hospital, but they've managed to keep the wooden
treasure chest full--no small feat at a facility that performs five
to seven spinal taps and bone marrow aspirations a day.</TE>
<TE>   The toys are also given to patients on their birthdays.</TE>
<TE>   'Donating Like Crazy'</TE>
<TE>   Johnnie's Charity is still very informal, and he and his
grandmother never know who will be donating from month to month, but
they have been successful relying on good old-fashioned word of
mouth.</TE>
<TE>   The monks at Layland's church talked about Johnnie one day during
Mass and "people started donating like crazy," Johnnie says.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Jennifer, a Santa Monica hairstylist, mentioned
Johnnie's Charity to one of her clients and he donated the latest
batch of Hot Wheels and Double Dare board games.</TE>
<TE>   Creators of "The Simpsons" and Lego Co. have also become donors.
The charity received dozens of boxes full of "Simpsons" and
"Futurama" toys and puzzles. Lego Co. sends building kits every five
months or so. Some people have donated money, but most send new toys
to Layland's home or to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Johnnie would like to expand the charity to include Children's
Hospital of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Another goal is to raise enough money to buy a Sony Playstation
for every room on the fourth floor of the Los Angeles facility, where
all the patients hospitalized with cancer stay.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Mitchell Jaimes, 7, of Los Angeles went to the hospital
for one of his regular lumbar punctures. He is sedated, but usually
reminds his mother, Wendy, of something even as he becomes woozy.</TE>
<TE>   "His eyes are closing and he reaches out to me and says, 'Get me
my toy,'" she says.</TE>

<HD>Couple Not Aware Girl Was Missing</HD>
<DH>Probe: Deputies want to know how San Clemente 4-year-old
wandered off undetected for half a day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County sheriff's deputies spent Saturday investigating how a
4-year-old girl managed to wander away from her San Clemente home
without her parents realizing she had been missing for more than 14
hours.</LD>
<LD>   The parents of Kiana O'Leary contacted the Sheriff's Department
about 7:35 a.m. Saturday after learning that deputies had found their
daughter roaming the neighborhood the day before, said sheriff's
spokesman Jim Amormino.</LD>
<LD>   The couple did not realize Kiana was missing until a relative
alerted them after seeing TV news reports about the girl, who was
found by deputies about 5:30 p.m. Friday, he said. The department did
not release the parents' names.</LD>
<TE>   Deputies discovered the girl after a passerby spotted her on a
street corner by the Shorecliff Golf Course, about a half a mile from
her home, and called the Sheriff's Department, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   Not knowing where Kiana lived, deputies took the girl to
Orangewood Children's Home. They then spent five hours knocking on
doors in the neighborhood in a fruitless search for her parents,
Amormino said. Her parents never reported her missing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Amormino said Kiana wandered off while home with her mother. Her
father, he said, was out with the family's three other children at
the time. "It could have been a lot worse," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kiana remained at Orangewood on Saturday and will probably spend
today there, Amormino said. Meanwhile, officials will try to unravel
how she went missing and why her disappearance was unnoticed for so
long.</TE>

<HD>Tough Issues. Big Price Tags</HD>
<DH>Yes, it's an 'off-year' election, but Orange County voters
face big issues, from El Toro airport to school bonds to district
attorney.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER and JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the nation's most expensive land-use battles will face its
fourth ballot test Tuesday when Orange County voters decide whether
to replace plans for an airport at El Toro with zoning for a large
urban park.</LD>
<LD>   Voters face the airport decision and dozens of others, from
whether to reelect a judge charged with child molestation to
consideration of several multimillion-dollar school bond proposals.</LD>
<LD>   Factions have battled for eight years over the 4,700-acre Marine
base, which closed in July 1999. Nearly $100 million has been spent
in the debate, including about $50 million by the county to plan for
the airport.</LD>
<TE>   Measure W would rezone the base for non-airport uses; the only way
to change that would be by yet another vote. Airport foes hope this
vote will be the last, citing shifting political winds and the
evaporation of significant financial support from airport boosters.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody is looking at this to be the final decision,"
said Cynthia P. Coad, chairwoman of the Board of Supervisors, which
has backed the airport by 3-to-2 votes.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not everybody.</TE>
<TE>   "The election doesn't stop the need for airport capacity in Orange
County," said Bruce Nestande, chairman of the chief pro-airport
group.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors haven't said what they would do if the measure passes
Tuesday. A poll commissioned by the Los Angeles Times found that a
majority of likely voters in Orange County support the measure, with
support even stronger when voters were told that it could kill the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials also haven't said how they would react to a
rezoning of the base</TE>
<TE>   Airport opponents have waged a nonstop election campaign with
newspaper and television advertisements touting development of a
"Great Park" for the base, though the initiative only changes zoning
for the property within the county general plan and does not actually
call for a park to be built.</TE>
<TE>   Airport backers argue that developing the park would require a tax
increase because of the cost of building the museums, sports fields
and other amenities envisioned. Measure W backers say no tax increase
would be needed.</TE>
<TE>   The core of opposition to an El Toro airport comes from the cities
nearest the base, which was built on bean fields east of Irvine.
Critics worry that property values will plunge and that the airport
will destroy their suburban quality of life. Supporters say an
airport would ensure Orange County's economic future.</TE>
<TE>   The El Toro battle affects Coad's bid to keep her 4th District
seat. Staunchly pro-airport, she faces Fullerton City Councilman
Chris Norby, an El Toro airport foe.</TE>
<TE>   If Norby unseats Coad, it would shift the majority on the board
and effectively kill the airport plan regardless of what happens with
Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   Coad won her seat four years ago by campaigning not just as an
airport supporter, but also as a reformer who would revitalize
neglected North County neighborhoods. Her work made her popular with
voters in Anaheim and Orange, but her district has been redrawn to
reflect the 2000 Census and no longer includes some of her
strongholds.</TE>
<TE>   Coad came under fire from Republicans--including Norby--hoping to
keep organized labor from spreading in Orange County after she
supported a landmark pact requiring that union members make up at
least 85% of the workers on new major county public works projects.
The pro-airport majority forged the pact to get union support for the
El Toro plan.</TE>
<TE>   Norby crusades for redevelopment reform. He believes local
officials should create alliances to stop companies with big retail
projects from pitting cities against each other to get bigger tax
breaks.</TE>
<TE>   The race for district attorney has become one of the most bitter
in recent history, as veteran prosecutor Wallace Wade challenges his
boss, Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   Wade's campaign is focused almost exclusively on charges
Rackauckas abused his authority for political gain during his three
years in office. Rackauckas, in turn, criticizes Wade's record as a
prosecutor and questions whether he has the skill to run the office.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas easily defeated Wade for the office four years ago,
enjoying broad support from prosecutors. But some of those working
for him have since said they were unhappy with their boss for various
personnel moves and his handling of some cases.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest dispute came over Rackauckas' involvement in a
consumer-protection case involving George Argyros, who is now U.S.
ambassador to Spain and who donated $1,000 to Rackauckas' 1998
campaign through his real estate management company.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas ordered prosecutors to withdraw a lawsuit against the
company, which was accused of unfairly keeping security deposits from
thousands of tenants. Rackauckas then took over settlement
negotiations himself. After critics faulted his actions, Rackauckas
handed the case over to the state attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   Backers say Rackauckas is a fair prosecutor being attacked by
malcontents upset over lost promotions. They also say that under
Wade's supervision, the county's Family Services Division failed
repeatedly to meet federal efficiency standards and was ranked among
the state's worst.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the judicial elections have escaped headlines. In one
race for judge, the only candidate on the ballot is Ronald C. Kline,
who is charged with child molestation and possession of child
pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Since Kline's arrest, 11 write-in candidates have announced their
candidacies.</TE>
<TE>   To keep his seat, Kline needs 50% plus one of the votes. If the
write-in candidates together garner at least that many votes, they
will force a runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Kline has pleaded not guilty to the charges and has not mounted a
formal campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Although greatly overshadowed by Measure W, another referendum is
on Tuesday's ballot: the county charter initiative. The main impetus
behind Measure V is to let voters decide how vacant county supervisor
seats should be filled. The governor currently fills them. If Measure
V passes, special elections would be held.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say approval would be a victory for democracy, while
opponents see it as an attempt by Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who is
running for the 71st Assembly District seat, to control who succeeds
him should he win.</TE>
<TE>   Around the county, six school districts and the North Orange
County Community College District will ask voters to approve more
than $730 million in construction bonds for schools and facilities
improvement projects.</TE>
<TE>   The flurry of bond proposals is prompted by the passage of
Proposition 39 in 2000. Under that law, school districts now need
only 55% of votes to pass bond measures, instead of the former
two-thirds majority.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim City School District, which failed to pass a $48-million
bond measure in 1998, is going to the polls again, this time seeking
$111 million. Officials want to build five schools and make
improvements to most of the district's 23 campuses. The district is
one of the state's most overcrowded. Anaheim Union High School
District is asking voters to approve $132 million to build a new
junior high school and for modernization projects.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton Joint Union High School District needs $67.9 million in
bonds for new buildings at each of its six campuses and improvements
to existing ones.</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton School District hopes to pass a $49.7-million measure
for a new elementary school and facilities upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach City School District also wants to make
improvements at its 10 campuses and seeks a $30-million bond measure
to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District officials say they
need two new elementary schools, a middle school and a high school,
as well as to make improvements at most of the district's 31
campuses. They are asking their voters to approve $102 million in
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   And the community college district, with campuses in Fullerton and
Cypress, has a $239-million bond measure for construction projects,
including libraries and improved parking.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds would be paid with increased property taxes in the
districts. Rates would range from $18.41 per $100,000 of assessed
value in the college district to $32.20 per $100,000 of assessed
value in Placentia-Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   The measures would qualify for matching funds from a statewide
bond measure likely to go to voters in November. If the state bonds
fail to pass, or if the money runs out, districts would have to scale
back or delay their projects.</TE>
<TE>   In the only contested city council race on the ballot, Seal Beach
Councilman Shawn Boyd is trying to hold onto his seat amid an
investigation into possible violation of conflict-of-interest laws.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd cast votes on the city-financed purchase of a mobile home
park by a nonprofit group even though he had a business relationship
with the park's owner. The ongoing probe focuses on $104,000 Boyd
received from the park owner from other business dealings but
allegedly did not disclose.</TE>
<TE>   He faces three opponents: Charles Antos, a former planner for the
city and now a planner for Orange County; Walt Miller, a retired
accountant; and Beverly Pearce, director of housing and economic
development in Baldwin Park from 1986 to 1991.</TE>
<TE>   In local city government initiatives in Huntington Beach, Seal
Beach, La Habra and La Palma, voters will be asked to decide several
issues. Among them: whether to create an infrastructure fund in
Huntington Beach, set utility tax rates in La Habra and La Palma, and
to eliminate the use of gender-based designations in city documents
in Seal Beach.</TE>

<HD>Political Comeback King Agran Shares Laurels in Airport
Battle</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If ever someone had a right to gloat, it is Larry Agran. Once the
designated whipping boy of the county's conservative establishment
and consigned to the political scrapheap, Agran has roared back.</LD>
<LD>   Like a battle-scarred warrior summoned back to the front, Agran,
57, has delivered big-time. If, as expected on Tuesday, Orange County
voters pass Measure W and drive a stake through the proposed El Toro
airport, historians will be hard-pressed not to include Agran's name
among the most significant in modern county history.</LD>
<LD>   Such trumpet-blowing normally would be music to the Irvine mayor's
ears. Agran, not burdened by a small ego or self-doubt, has a style
that at times has antagonized not only opponents but potential
allies.</LD>
<TE>   And now, on the verge of a likely election victory he had a huge
hand in forging, Agran has every reason to crow.</TE>
<TE>   But while chatting over lunch last week at an Italian restaurant
in Irvine, he refuses. Moreover, he quickly shares the credit with
the vast anti-airport coalition that appears set to replace the
county's plans for an international airport with those for a giant
park and cultural amenities.</TE>
<TE>   Confident about Tuesday's outcome but not guaranteeing victory,
Agran will at least concede that the airport's demise unfolded just
as he envisioned a few years ago and that the anti-airport movement
has saved the county from a planning disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Parceling out credit for killing El Toro is difficult, but Agran's
contribution is clear-cut. He was the key figure in realizing that,
following two countywide pro-airport votes in the mid-1990s, voters
wouldn't veto an airport without something tangible in its place. And
in the crucial follow-up phase, Agran is the person most closely
linked to the "Great Park" plan that became that substitute. As
Irvine's mayor, he led the way in loosening that city's purse strings
(to the tune of $10 million) to help finance the anti-airport effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt the final initiative would have to have what I called a
true choice," Agran says. "Not a false choice. It had to be not only
popular enough to pass but something that was genuine, something that
actually can and should be unifying [for the county]. This isn't
Irvine's deal, and it isn't South County's deal."</TE>
<TE>   By 1998, when Agran came out of political retirement to run for
mayor with the express intent of killing El Toro, airport supporters
had won two elections. As early as the first vote in 1994, however,
Agran sensed the project wasn't wildly popular but feared momentum
might push it through.</TE>
<TE>   After the second defeat in 1996, Agran was six years out of office
and chafing. "Our allies thought we just have to turn out more South
County voters [in future elections]," he says. "My response was, yes,
but we need to make the case to people in North County.... What we
learned in two elections is that you can't beat something, even a bad
idea, with no idea."</TE>
<TE>   In early 1998, another anti-airport group had come up with an
alternative plan, but Agran wasn't convinced it was enough. What came
out of Project 99, the group Agran headed, came from surveying
thousands of Orange County households and would prove to be the
seedling for the current Great Park project.</TE>
<TE>   The park's critics say it's a sham and never will be created. "Our
opponents say it's just a political ploy," Agran says. "What they're
going to learn starting March 6 is that me and my colleagues on the
council and the others who have waged this battle are just as
determined to implement this vision as we were to defeat the airport.
There won't be any hiatus, any hesitation.... We want to accelerate
this process because, frankly, we want the joy of being able to do
this in our lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   I ask if defeating the airport would be a crown jewel in his
career. "In a way, it is," he says. He lumps it in with Irvine's 1988
agreement with the Irvine Co.--during his first mayoral tenure--that
secured thousands of acres of open space for the city.</TE>
<TE>   "This stacks right up against that," he says. "This is a threat
that came out of the blue after I was out of office, and it allowed
me to get back into public life, but in a way not only to defeat this
threat to our community and our heritage of sound planning, but to
allow for something positive to happen."</TE>

<DH>Community college funding, the L.A. County sheriff and
O.C.'s proposed airport are among key issues.</DH>

<LD>One of the nation's most expensive land-use battles will face its
fourth ballot test Tuesday, when Orange County voters will decide
whether to replace plans for an airport at El Toro with a land-use
designation that calls for a large urban park.</LD>
<LD>   The fate of the airport joins a host of issues in Orange, Los
Angeles and Ventura counties, including whether L.A. County voters
will reelect Sheriff Lee Baca, two county supervisors and, in some
areas, members of Congress and city councils.</LD>
<LD>   At least six community college districts, including Santa Monica,
Pasadena, Long Beach, Glendale and North Orange County are asking
voters to tax themselves from $13 to $23 per $100,000 of a property's
assessed value to repair aging and crowded campuses.</LD>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the two candidates vying for the open district
attorney's seat have spent a combined $1.4 million. Prosecutor Ron
Bamieh is challenging Greg Totten, the chief assistant to longtime
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides in the costly El Toro debate have spent a total of
almost $100 million--including $50 million spent by the county to
plan for the new airport--in the battle over the future of the
4,700-acre Marine base, which closed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W on Tuesday's ballot would rezone the base for
non-airport uses; the only way to change that would be by yet another
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Airport foes hope this vote will be the last in their eight-year
fight, citing shifting political winds and the evaporation of
significant financial support from airport boosters. They have waged
a nonstop election campaign touting development of a "Great Park" for
the base, though the initiative would only change zoning for the
property within the county general plan and does not actually call
for a park to be built.</TE>
<TE>   Airport backers cite the need for airport expansion throughout
Southern California and point out that building a park would require
a tax increase. "The election doesn't stop the need for airport
capacity in Orange County," said Bruce Nestande, chairman of the
chief pro-airport group.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody is looking at this to be the final decision,"
said Cynthia P. Coad, chairwoman of the board of supervisors, which
has backed the airport by 3-2 votes.</TE>
<TE>   Also in Orange County, the race for district attorney has become
one of the most bitter in recent history as veteran prosecutor
Wallace Wade challenges his boss, Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   Wade's campaign is focused almost exclusively on allegations that
Rackauckas abused his authority for political gain during his three
years in office. Rackauckas, in turn, criticizes Wade's record as a
prosecutor and questions whether he has the skills to run the office.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the judicial elections in Orange County have escaped
headlines, becoming an embarrassment for the county bench. That's
because in one race for judge, the only candidate listed on the
ballot is Ronald C. Kline, who is charged with child molestation and
possession of child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Since Kline's arrest, 11 write-in candidates have announced their
candidacy. They hope outrage over Kline's legal troubles will benefit
them. Still, political observers say that by not having their names
listed on the ballot, they face an uphill battle.</TE>
<TE>   Voters around Los Angeles County will be asked whether to reelect
Supervisors Gloria Molina and Zev Yaroslavsky. Baca, who was elected
four years ago, is challenged by Sgts. Patrick Gomez and John Stites.</TE>
<TE>   Voters will also choose from among three candidates in the
Democratic primary for California's newest congressional district,
located in southeast Los Angeles: attorney Linda Sanchez, South Gate
City Councilman Hector De La Torre and Assemblywoman Sally Havice
(D-Cerritos).</TE>
<TE>   In the east San Fernando Valley, voters will be asked to select
between Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City) and businesswoman
Wendy Greuel to fill the City Council seat that was vacated by
longtime Councilman Joel Wachs. Wachs resigned to take a job in New
York City.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles voters will decide whether to approve bond financing
that would pay for two new police stations, repair existing police
and fire stations and build facilities that officials say would speed
response times.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County is asking voters to decide on a measure that
would expand the command staff of the Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Community college district officials are promoting bond proposals
prompted by the passage of Proposition 39 in 2000. Under that law,
school districts now need only 55% of votes to pass bond measures,
instead of the former two-thirds majority.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds would be paid for with increased property taxes in the
districts. Districts seeking bond fundings include:</TE>
<TE>   * Glendale: $98 million for parking, plumbing and seismic
retrofitting. Property owners would pay about $23 per $100,000 of
assessed value.</TE>
<TE>   * Long Beach: $176 million for expansion projects, seismic
retrofitting and repairs to aging facilities. Cost would be $14.78
per $100,000 of assessed value.</TE>
<TE>   * Pasadena: $150 million to create new classroom space and improve
technology programs. Annual property taxes would rise by up to $14
per $100,000 of assessed valuation.</TE>
<TE>   * Santa Monica: $160 million for construction of a new liberal
arts building, among other improvements. Cost would be $19.21 per
$100,000 of assessed value.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, district attorney candidate Bamieh has been
waging an uphill battle against Totten, who is backed by the law
enforcement establishment.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh's wealthy father, GOP contributor Sam Bamieh, gave his son
just over $1 million. Totten has raised about $400,000 from more than
700 backers.</TE>
<TE>   Two Ventura County supervisor seats will also be decided. In the
Simi Valley-based 4th District, incumbent Judy Mikels is being
challenged by John Lane, a Moorpark fraud investigator. Lane's chief
support has come from law enforcement unions; Mikels is backed by
developers, farmers and conservative Republican groups.</TE>
<TE>   In Thousand Oaks, businessman Randy Hoffman will face off with
Linda Parks, a city councilwoman and slow-growth supporter. Hoffman
ran for Congress two years ago and lost.</TE>

<DH>More than $1 million has been spent recently on El Toro,
supervisor issues. Write-ins for judge bankroll selves.</DH>

<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County donors poured more than $1 million into local and state
political races in the last 10 days, including $200,000 from Cynthia
P. Coad to help her own hard-fought race for reelection to the Board
of Supervisors, campaign reports show.</LD>
<LD>   The money paid for mailers, television advertisements and
telephone banks as campaigns mobilized precinct walkers and other
volunteers for the final weekend push before Tuesday's primary
election.</LD>
<LD>   State law requires that contributions of $1,000 or more be
reported to election officials within 24 hours during the last two
weeks leading up to election day.</LD>
<TE>   Coad's latest loan to her campaign for reelection to the 4th
District supervisorial seat is more than double what she loaned the
campaign through Feb. 21. The money was budgeted for late in the
race, her husband and chief strategist, Tom Coad, said Saturday. Coad
spent $600,000 of her own funds to win the seat in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to be a close election but we're
enthusiastic," Tom Coad said as the couple organized precinct
walkers.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Coad said the campaign has had to spend money to counter
advertising financed by South County supporters of Chris Norby,
Coad's challenger. Norby is a Fullerton City Council member who
opposes an airport at the closed El Toro Marine Corps Air Station,
while Coad has been among the proposed new airport's supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Norby said he is supported by residents around the county who are
tired of the battle over what to do with the 4,700-acre base.
"They're very worried," Norby said of the Coads.... Mine is a vast
grass-roots effort trying to change the way of county government."</TE>
<TE>   The Measure W campaign, meanwhile, attracted donations on both
sides, with Yes on W forces reporting more than $100,000 in late
contributions from several donors and No on W proponents reporting
$25,000 from John Vedder Croul of Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Groups working to defeat Measure W had raised nearly $300,000 by
Feb. 21. Groups in favor of Measure W reported raising nearly $1
million and have said their contributions and pledges will total $2.5
million by election day.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer was among those who gave money to the Yes
on W campaign. Spitzer, one of the board's two anti-airport
supervisors, covered $28,000 in mailing expenses. He is running for
Assembly. Other donations to the Yes on W effort included $12,500
from Medix Ambulance of Mission Viejo and $10,000 from businessman
Pat DiCarlo in Newport Beach. DiCarlo is a high-profile supporter of
Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas, who is facing a tough reelection fight
against Assistant Dist. Atty. Wally Wade. Wade has courted
anti-airport support, while Rackauckas, who angered anti-airport
forces in the past, has endorsed Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   In other contributions reported, the union representing Orange
County prosecutors gave $5,000 to Wade for an upcoming mailer. The
union has voted to give Wade $50,000 for his race.</TE>
<TE>   The largest local donation listed for the period was from American
Sterling Inc., an Irvine investment firm, which gave $500,000 to
Republican gubernatorial candidate Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Other late money for Riordan included $25,000 from developer
William Lyon and $10,000 from CKE Restaurants, the parent company for
Carl's Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Other donations reported include $63,000 from several
out-of-county law firms, Los Angeles radio stations and the
California Teachers Assn. for Measure Z in the Anaheim Union High
School District. The measure would authorize the sale of $132 million
in bonds with the goal of attracting $125 million in state matching
funds for building classrooms and a new junior high school, upgrading
fire and electrical systems, and other school repairs.</TE>
<TE>   The largest contribution to Measure Z--$12,500--came from Bank of
America in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the race to unseat Orange County Superior Judge
Ronald C. Kline, who stands charged with child molestation and
possession of child pornography, write-in candidates are digging into
their pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Only Kline's name will appear on the ballot, prompting write-in
candidates to spend thousands of of their own money on publicity.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Robinson, a Costa Mesa city councilwoman, has loaned herself
$25,000.</TE>
<TE>   Gay Sandoval, who took three months off work to run against Kline,
said she has about $25,000 in loans from her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the pack in spending is Dana Point attorney John Adams,
who has loaned himself $38,000.</TE>

<KH>L.A. THEN AND NOW</KH>
<HD>Onetime 'Liquor Czar' Ended Life a Fugitive</HD>
<DH>'Big Bill' Bonelli was a powerful deal-maker in pre-WWII
California, but wound up fleeing the law into Mexico.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A radio minister called him one of the "criminals who spoil
paradise." Before World War II, he was a powerful presence in L.A.'s
smoke-filled rooms, where political deals were made. His fall from
the pinnacle to disgrace was as dramatic as his climb, and today his
name--William George Bonelli--has virtually disappeared from the
history books.</LD>
<LD>   Bonelli rose from the Los Angeles City Council to head the
far-reaching state Board of Equalization. He was accused of using the
job to collect protection money and sell liquor licenses to suspected
mobsters and ex-cons, or of swapping the licenses for political
favors.</LD>
<LD>   During the early 1950s, when government hearings enthralled
television audiences, Bonelli was grilled on nationwide TV about his
reputed connections with organized crime.</LD>
<TE>   He died a fugitive in Mexico, where he had fled to avoid another
of his many indictments.</TE>
<TE>   Bonelli built the first tract homes in the Santa Clarita Valley
and turned a piece of land in Saugus from a rodeo arena into an auto
raceway. But his notoriety surpassed those accomplishments; he was
the central figure, the "Liquor Czar," in scandals that reached all
the way to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Born on his family's ranch in Kingman, Ariz., Bonelli came to Los
Angeles about 1912. He graduated from USC, then pursued a master's
degree at Occidental College and a law degree from Southwestern
University. In 1927, as a professor of political science at
Occidental, he was elected to the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, rumors of Bonelli links to organized crime began to
surface. In his popular radio broadcasts, the Rev. "Fighting Bob"
Shuler spoke out against Bonelli. In 1931, when his broadcasting
license was revoked, Shuler used his pulpit to help drive elected
officials such as Bonelli from office.</TE>
<TE>   Bonelli vaulted onto the ballot to run for mayor against John
Clinton Porter in 1929. He lost. But in 1931, Bonelli won a seat in
the state Assembly and, three years later, he worked on acting Gov.
Frank Merriam's election campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Reportedly as payback for helping Merriam raise $10 million to
wage a highly charged smear campaign to defeat socialist Upton
Sinclair, Bonelli got a $6,000-a-year job as director of what is now
the state Department of Consumer Affairs. In that capacity, he
regulated contractors and construction companies, all the while
working as an attorney and director of a construction company that he
and his friends owned.</TE>
<TE>   Through the company, Bonelli acquired loans to buy up failed
ranches in the Santa Clarita Valley and elsewhere, eventually
becoming a prominent landowner. He developed the area's first tract,
a set of 300 houses still known as "Bonelli homes."</TE>
<TE>   In 1939, the year after Merriam appointed Bonelli chairman of the
Board of Equalization, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Buron Fitts
indicted Bonelli and five others on charges of bribery and payoffs
involving skid row saloons and "B-girls"--women who enticed men to
buy drinks. Fitts accused them all of owning stock in Hillview Oil
Co., an alleged front for a multimillion-dollar Los Angeles gambling
syndicate.</TE>
<TE>   Bonelli retorted that he didn't know whether he owned a share of
stock in Hillview, but that he had put about $5,000 into the company
and had never gotten anything in return.</TE>
<TE>   Huffing and bluffing before the trial, he publicly banned corrupt
B-girls but did nothing to revoke the licenses of those violating the
ban.</TE>
<TE>   For 16 sensation-packed weeks, prosecutors accused Bonelli of
running an army of men, including legislators and law officers, who
contributed regularly to his election campaign.</TE>
<TE>   One of Bonelli's foes testified that the payoff scheme helped
finance Bonelli's campaign fund. Several scheduled witnesses received
death threats and either refused to testify or were placed under
armed guard. One, a saloonkeeper, had his liquor license revoked,
presumably on Bonelli's orders.</TE>
<TE>   On May 27, 1940, Judge William J. Palmer concluded that the
prosecution had failed to link four of the defendants, Bonelli among
them, in the purported graft plot. He issued a directed verdict of
not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Bonelli donned his white Stetson for his getaway before
confidently calling the charges a "$10-million political hoax by the
district attorney, which cost the taxpayers approximately $300,000."</TE>
<TE>   Bonelli kept landing on his feet. Two years later, he was
reelected to the Board of Equalization.</TE>
<TE>   From his office in the Black Building at 4th and Hill streets, he
continued to hand out liquor licenses for the state fee of
$525--reportedly in exchange for much pricier campaign contributions
and other payoffs. These licenses were routinely resold for up to
$12,000.</TE>
<TE>   When reporters challenged him, Bonelli retorted, "Sure, there are
hoods and criminals in this business, but not any more than there are
in the newspaper business."</TE>
<TE>   Those who didn't want to jeopardize their liquor licenses,
including the maitre d' at Billy Gray's Band Box, a flashy comedy
club, reportedly paid a hefty price to Bonelli and his cronies to
stay open after hours. Bonelli often frequented the restaurants and
clubs, usually with an attractive woman on each arm and always
getting the best table.</TE>
<TE>   The war years turned much of the government's attention elsewhere,
but in 1951, Bonelli was put on nationwide TV in front of the federal
Kefauver Commission and grilled about his alleged connections with
organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   He was also asked about involvement in a license scandal in which
more than $1 million was paid under the table in Los Angeles County.
Bonelli used his charm and intelligence to circumvent the questioning
and put into the record the three-hour ruling Judge Palmer had
written in his favor more than a decade earlier.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the investigation, a federal grand jury indicted
Bonelli on charges of income tax evasion. He was not cleared of that
until 1966.</TE>
<TE>   During most of his early political career, he was a buddy of Harry
Chandler, publisher of the Los Angeles Times. But when Dorothy "Buff"
Chandler, wife of new Publisher Norman Chandler, who sometimes
steered corporate decisions of the Times-owned Los Angeles Mirror,
gave the go-ahead, reporter Art White investigated Bonelli.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1953, a series of eight explosive articles accused "Big
Bill" Bonelli, the "Cowboy Saloon Czar," of overseeing a Southern
California liquor empire, using kickbacks and contributions to his
political campaigns to buy land and fund his courtroom defenses. The
articles also linked him to known and suspected underworld figures.</TE>
<TE>   Bonelli fired back with a $1.5-million libel suit. He attacked the
Chandler family in his 1954 book, "Billion Dollar Blackjack: The
Story of Corruption and the Los Angeles Times." Rumors flew that the
Chandlers corralled all the copies and burned them, but according to
retired Times Publisher Otis Chandler, the book was so unsuccessful
that Bonelli started that rumor to increase sales.</TE>
<TE>   But it was already too late for Bonelli. He had lost his seat on
the Board of Equalization in 1954. That was the year voters approved
Proposition 3, a Times-Mirror-endorsed initiative stripping the Board
of Equalization of its power to grant liquor licenses.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 25, 1955, Bonelli was at his Arizona ranch when he was
arrested and charged with violating California's election laws for
allegedly receiving $250,000 in bribes from the liquor industry.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than return to California, Bonelli slipped across the
border into Mexico, where he was promptly arrested at the request of
the U.S. government. In May 1959, after he'd spent almost four years
in a Mexico City prison, authorities refused to extradite him, and
set him free. For the last 15 years of his life, he stayed in Mexico,
a fugitive from justice or, as he liked to say, "from injustice." He
died of emphysema in Hermosillo in 1970. Seven years later, his
widow, Mary, sued the state for his $167,000 pension. She won on
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Bonelli's homestead on the Saugus Speedway was torn down in 1987.
The track closed in 1995.  (Another site that carries the Bonelli
name, Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park in San Dimas, was named for the
late Los Angeles County supervisor, who was not related to William G.
Bonelli.)</TE>

<HD>Lower Topanga Tenants Facing Eviction by State</HD>
<DH>Land: Some have lived cheaply near the sea for decades.
Wetlands restoration is planned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 30 years, Ginger Kershner has reveled in a beach lover's dream
pad: an affordable five-bedroom rental on two acres in lower Topanga
Canyon, with room for kids, horse, dogs and cats, a quick skip across
Pacific Coast Highway from sand and surf.</LD>
<LD>   She is heartbroken--not to mention hopping mad--at the prospect of
having to leave.</LD>
<LD>   But vacate she must, or so says the California Department of Parks
and Recreation. On April 1, the agency plans to send eviction notices
to Kershner and about 70 other tenants in lower Topanga Canyon, with
the expectation that they will be gone by July 1.</LD>
<TE>   Park officials say they need the tenants out so they can begin
restoring lower Topanga Creek to its free-flowing self and removing
invasive plants that have crowded out native sycamores and willows.</TE>
<TE>   When the state parks department completed its $43-million purchase
of 1,659 acres in the lower canyon last summer, a key goal was to
extend the reach of the 11,000-acre Topanga State Park. Park
officials say that, after the tenants are out, they intend to begin
reviving coastal wetlands and carving out the first uninterrupted
hiking trail from the San Fernando Valley to the sea.</TE>
<TE>   But the lower Topanga residents--a hardy colony of artists,
actors, filmmakers and retirees--are in no hurry to relinquish their
funky, secluded enclave, where "newcomers" have spent a mere 20 years
in perhaps the region's last affordable coastal pocket that isn't a
mobile home park.</TE>
<TE>   Even the prospect of what by most accounts is a generous
relocation package is not enough for these longtime month-to-month
renters to embrace the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a travesty," said Scott Dittrich, a lower Topanga resident
and maker of surf films. "They're destroying a vibrant community."</TE>
<TE>   Residents Hope Lawyer Can Gain Some Time</TE>
<TE>   Led by Dittrich, residents have hired Craig Dummit, an attorney
who helped win a 20-year reprieve for residents of Crystal Cove in
Orange County when the state wanted to use their properties for a
historic park. Those residents moved out only recently.</TE>
<TE>   Dummit also has some history with Topangans. Back in 1970, he
helped Topanga Beach residents who were threatened with eviction
after the state bought a stretch of coastline. Through legal
wrangling and a settlement, some residents managed to delay moving
for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Dummit said, many lower Topanga Canyon residents know
they will have to leave eventually. They just want more time, and he
said many are inclined to go to court to get it.</TE>
<TE>   Dittrich and others were especially distressed to learn recently
that the state parks department plans to maintain some of the
existing structures as homes for park security officers.</TE>
<TE>   "The residents aren't saying they should stay there forever or
that they should have priority in the use of the property over the
public," Dummit said. "But they don't want to have to move from their
homes before it's absolutely necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Living in lower Topanga Canyon has involved trade-offs, residents
say. In exchange for paying below-market rents ranging from $400 to
about $1,300 (for a six-bedroom home), residents have done all their
own maintenance, including the building of crude roads and bridges.</TE>
<TE>   Dittrich estimated that he has invested $200,000 in his compound,
which has a main residence and three other buildings. He spent $5,000
for a new roof, among other repairs, he said. And he helped build a
diversion channel to tame the creek, which rises in heavy rain to
within feet of where he keeps his horse.</TE>
<TE>   Residents Are Called Good Stewards of Land</TE>
<TE>   He considers himself and most other residents to be good stewards
of the land.</TE>
<TE>   A state parks scientist sees it differently. Human habitation,
says Suzanne Goode, a senior resource ecologist, has threatened the
fragile ecosystem of Topanga Creek, home to the endangered southern
steelhead trout and the tidewater goby, another rare fish.</TE>
<TE>   Dikes erected by residents have thwarted the creek's meanderings,
she says. When the creek is low enough, residents drive across it
many times daily, depositing grease and brake-lining fluid and
stirring up sand.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time a car drives through the water, it disturbs the
sediment, sending it downstream," Goode said. "[The traffic is] a
source of sedimentation and pollution."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, analyses show that the water upstream from the
residences is relatively clean. Downstream, particularly near an area
that once housed a rodeo and is still called Rodeo Grounds, a recent
test revealed much higher concentrations of fecal matter, park
officials say. They suspect that the problem is caused by leaking
septic tanks and free-roaming pets.</TE>
<TE>   Also troubling to Goode is the presence of nonnative plants,
including eucalyptus trees, nasturtiums, oleanders and morning
glories.</TE>
<TE>   On a tour of the canyon, she pointed to clump after giant clump of
a bamboo-like plant called arundo, the worst offender. Arundo grows
so thickly that it diverts the creek and crowds out trees that would
serve as shade for the stream and habitat for birds and other
animals.</TE>
<TE>   Vegetation Is Prolific, Highly Flammable</TE>
<TE>   It is also highly flammable. Whenever residents clear away the
arundo to reduce the danger of fire, they inadvertently propagate the
plant, and it soon roars back in even more locations.</TE>
<TE>   Arundo is one of many reasons that biologists have applauded the
state's takeover of the property, which the Los Angeles Athletic Club
bought in the 1920s in hopes of building a marina, before the Great
Depression quashed the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Topanga represents a very unique opportunity," said Rosi Dagit,
senior conservation biologist with the resource conservation district
of the Santa Monica Mountains. "The whole park was bought because
it's such an exceptional biological treasure in urbanized Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Topanga is the third-largest watershed draining into Santa Monica
Bay and has the most biological diversity because it is large and
relatively well protected, Dagit added.</TE>
<TE>   To ease the relocation process, the state has earmarked more than
$5 million to be divided among the tenants.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, some of these people are going to get very large
relocation payments," said Barry McDaniel, senior vice president of
Pacific Relocation Consultants, hired by the state to help tenants
find other housing. The average payout per household is expected to
be about $80,000, with some much higher.</TE>
<TE>   Area Businesses Get a Reprieve</TE>
<TE>   In August, when the state parks department announced its purchase
of the land from LAACO Ltd., which owns the Los Angeles Athletic
Club, three-fourths of the residents wouldn't even talk to relocation
officials. Most have since begun cooperating, McDaniel said.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the few businesses in the area got a reprieve. The
beauty salon owned by Kershner--Ginger Snips--can stay open at least
two years, along with others, such as the Topanga Ranch Motel and
Reel Inn Fresh Fish Restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Residents will be eligible for reimbursement of moving expenses
and help finding comparable housing. And if they move into a more
expensive place, they could receive 42 months of payments to help
defray the costs.</TE>
<TE>   The payments afford little solace to Coliene Rentmeester, 71, who
has lived next to the Dittrich family for 21 years. Rentmeester has
lately pored over rental ads. Malibu houses comparable to her
three-bedroom, $1,200 lower Topanga rental would easily fetch $3,000
a month or more, she said. She does not yet know how much
supplemental aid she will receive.</TE>
<TE>   "What freaks me out is [I] can only stay there for three years,
and then I'm on the streets," Rentmeester said.</TE>
<TE>   She acknowledged that she has known since she signed her
month-to-month lease 21 years ago that this day would come.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rentmeester said, "I don't want to go. If you saw this
place where I live, it's gorgeous. I worked on it so long. It is very
personal and very dear to my heart."</TE>

<HD>GOP Hopefuls for Congress Focus on Economy, HMOs</HD>
<DH>Election: Beth Rogers and Don Regan are in a solidly
Democratic district stretching from Ventura to Cambria.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Republican candidates Beth Rogers and Don Regan both think they have
a shot at unseating Rep. Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara) in November,
despite the district's solid Democratic majority.</LD>
<LD>   First, the two GOP rivals must slug it out in Tuesday's primary.</LD>
<LD>   They have had to cover a lot of ground in a district whose newly
drawn boundaries sweep more than 200 miles of narrow coastline, from
Oxnard, Port Hueneme and parts of Ventura to Santa Barbara and even
farther north to Cambria in San Luis Obispo County.</LD>
<TE>   Rogers, 57, is an anthropologist with an MBA who lives in
Carpinteria and owns a Camarillo-based sod farming business. She
leads the money-raising race with $156,000, about half of which she
loaned herself.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers has a higher statewide profile than her challenger. A
delegate to the 2000 Republican National Convention, she also has
made contacts as president of the Seneca Network, which assists
Republican women seeking office in California. She has served on the
Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board and with various
business groups and charitable organizations.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Rogers said she would be an advocate for agriculture,
from Central Coast wineries and greenhouses to row crops. "High-end
agriculture is the only thing keeping us from turning into the San
Fernando Valley," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She also wants to expand federal loan programs for vocational
training for young adults. And she advocates changes to the tax code
that would make child care and senior care fully deductible and
provide extra relief to families in which one spouse stays home.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to arrive as a freshman congresswoman and rewrite
the tax code," she said. "But I can start a dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   Regan, 55, an audiologist from Grover Beach, has mostly funded his
own $35,000 campaign. About $6,500 came from individual contributors.
He has mentored Latino students and formerly served on the state
Speech Pathology, Language and Audiology Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Regan says improving voter turnout, making HMOs more responsive to
patients and increasing Medicare payments are at the top of his
priority list.</TE>
<TE>   He also wants more study of alternative energy. "As a government,
we've been inappropriately committed to petroleum," he said, adding
that every citizen must share responsibility. "If you don't want oil
[drilling] in your backyard, don't drive gas-guzzling cars."</TE>
<TE>   Regan admits he has done most of his campaigning in a light truck,
but says if he advances to the general election he plans to drive a
gas-electric hybrid on the campaign trail.</TE>
<TE>   Regan criticizes Rogers as "a policy wonk." Rogers criticizes
Regan for not being enough of one.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand what people want and I also know technically how to
get it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Both GOP hopefuls say Capps, who took office in a special election
in 1998 to replace her late husband, hasn't done enough to
distinguish herself.</TE>
<TE>   The seat was once a Republican stronghold. Since last year's
redistricting, however, registered Democrats have outnumbered
Republicans 45% to 33%. Meanwhile, Capps has more than $500,000 in
her campaign account. Coastal voters tend to back Democrats, and
Capps' hometown is the heart of the district.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks to the redistricting by the leaders of both parties last
fall, virtually every congressional seat in California is now safe
[for the incumbent]," said Republican strategist Dan Schnur.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers and Regan insist they can defeat the incumbent by
portraying Capps as a party-liner with no original ideas. Both say
that while environmental protections are crucial on the coast, too
many layers of regulatory agencies are strangling farming, private
property rights and the region's economy.</TE>
<TE>   Ideological moderates, both say abortion isn't the government's
business and that euthanasia and stem cell research are issues that
should be guided by doctors rather than politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Both also say they are better connected to Latino voters than
Capps. Rogers speaks fluent Spanish and has a 30-year-old foster son
from El Salvador. Regan speaks elementary Spanish and is married to a
Latina.</TE>
<TE>   Schnur said those arguments may not be enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Rogers or Regan could pull off an upset if the Republican
gubernatorial candidate wins by a large enough margin" because other
Republicans running for state office could be swept in on his
coattails, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Failing that, any constituent of Lois Capps who is unhappy with
her service in Congress has only one option," Schnur said. "It's
called moving vans."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Gosford Park" and "A Beautiful Mind" were the feature film winners
Saturday night at the 54th annual Writers Guild of America Awards.</LD>
<LD>   Episodes of "The Sopranos" and "Everybody Loves Raymond" took home
awards for TV series writing.</LD>
<LD>   Julian Fellowes won for best screenplay written directly for the
screen for "Gosford Park," director Robert Altman's sophisticated
satire of the British upper class in the 1930s.</LD>
<TE>   Fellowes is also nominated for an Academy Award for his
screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   Akiva Goldsman, who won the Golden Globe in late January, won for
best screenplay based on material previously produced or published
for "A Beautiful Mind." The drama about schizophrenic math genius
John Nash is based on the award-winning book by Sylvia Nassar. Like
Fellowes, Goldsman is also nominated for an Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   "A Beautiful Mind" and "Gosford Park" are also Academy Award
nominees for best picture.</TE>
<TE>   Several other Oscar-nominated screenplays, including Christopher
Nolan for "Momento" and Todd Field for "In the Bedroom," weren't
eligible for the writers guild awards because their films were not
WGA signatories.</TE>
<TE>   Terence Winter (writer and story) and Tim Van Patten (story) were
honored by the WGA in the episodic drama category for the "Pine
Barrens" episode of HBO's "The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   Philip Rosenthal won the episodic comedy award for "Italy, Parts 1
&amp; 2" of CBS' sitcom "Everybody Loves Raymond."</TE>
<TE>   Other major winners at the ceremony, which took place at the

<HD>Up Against a Tough Foe, Dubious Voters</HD>
<DH>Many see his bid to oust popular Rep. Henry Waxman as
quixotic. But Kevin Feldman is serious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everywhere he goes, he gets the Why question.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes it is delivered politely by a potential supporter who
wants to hear Kevin Feldman's ideas for making government work
better. More often, however, it comes wrapped in a tone of
incredulity, sometimes even hostility, and accompanied by a list of
reasons he cannot possibly unseat a fellow Democrat.</LD>
<LD>   Why is he challenging Westside Rep. Henry A. Waxman, one of
Southern California's most enduring and respected officeholders?
Waxman, after all, has not had a primary challenger since 1994, and
he got nearly 76% of the vote in his last election.</LD>
<TE>   "Why should I interview your guy? He could be a crackpot," the
editor of a community newspaper recently told a campaign aide seeking
coverage of Feldman's quest to oust Waxman in Tuesday's primary.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman is no crackpot, and he is serious about his candidacy even
while acknowledging his long odds. The 34-year-old, who holds a
master's degree from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of
Government, has long been active in local Democratic politics and in
gay-rights causes. He quit his job as a vice president for the
Charles Schwab brokerage firm to campaign full time.</TE>
<TE>   Clean-cut and conservatively dressed, he stumps energetically
throughout the 30th Congressional District, which fans from the
Westside west and north into Malibu, Westlake Village and the west
San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Running for office has been "a life's dream," Feldman says. He
thought about seeking a City Council seat, "but the issues I have the
most passion about are the big, meaty issues" that Congress faces. He
ruled out state office because he believes California's fiscal
problems are so severe that they will monopolize legislators'
attention for the next several years.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman is one of scores of candidates tackling extremely long
odds in their election challenges to entrenched incumbents this year.
Already better known and better financed than their challengers, the
incumbents got an added boost last year when the congressional and
state legislative districts were redrawn with the goal of creating
safe seats for nearly all current officeholders in both major
parties.</TE>
<TE>   So why do these challengers do it? Why put in the time and effort,
maybe even mortgage the house to pay for a political mailer or a
phone bank, only to risk resounding defeat at the ballot box?</TE>
<TE>   A few--including a handful of perennial candidates--run mainly for
the pleasure of seeing their names on the ballot, political experts
say. Others hope to position themselves for future campaigns by
making a decent-enough showing to earn the respect of party leaders
and donors.</TE>
<TE>   The nominee of a party that is woefully behind in district
registration may get clobbered on election day but will automatically
earn a spot on the party's policy-making state central committee.
Such a position is guaranteed, for example, to West Hollywood
bartender Tony D. Goss, the only Republican on the ballot in the 30th
District, where Democrats hold a 52%-28% registration edge.</TE>
<TE>   Other longshot candidates are afflicted with what political
analyst Allan Hoffenblum calls "candidate-itis."</TE>
<TE>   "You become so convinced that you are right and you have all the
answers that you believe that if you can only reach enough people,
you can win. It's very common among marginal candidates," said
Hoffenblum, a longtime Republican consultant whose California Target
Book tracks congressional and legislative races throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman seems to fall into the last category. He said he has grown
impatient with a political system that discourages new leaders with
fresh ideas, so he decided to take on Waxman--against the advice of
insiders he has come to know in his 10 years of fund-raising and
other activism in the Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people said, 'Don't do it,' especially the elected
officials, but they were focused on could I win and not on whether I
was talking about the right things," Feldman said. With the help of a
small paid campaign staff, including three student interns from his
alma mater, UCLA, Feldman has crisscrossed the district, walking
precincts, going to farmers markets, addressing Kiwanis and Rotary
clubs and accepting invitations to speak at small gatherings at
supporters' homes. He has scored interviews for stories in several
community papers--including the one with the plain-spoken editor.</TE>
<TE>   He uses a Web site, www.feldmanforcongress.com, to keep supporters
up to date, and his distinctive purple and lime-green campaign colors
are turning up on billboards, lawn signs and the fliers he hands out
on stops across the district.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of January, he had raised about $26,000, which included
a $10,500 loan to himself, according to reports filed with the
Federal Election Commission. Waxman reported having around $550,000
on hand and said recently he expects to use some of it to help
Democrats in other, presumably tighter, races.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman, who grew up in Malibu and Los Angeles and lives in West
Hollywood with his partner of 11 years, Tom Nash, said he is
concentrating on the roughly 40% of the district that is new to
Waxman.</TE>
<TE>   In last year's redistricting, Waxman lost some of his
Hollywood-area neighborhoods and picked up such communities as
Calabasas and Agoura Hills, as well as a substantial part of the West
Valley. Feldman said he believes voters there are more in sync with
his priority issues--the economy, transportation and education--and
appreciate his business background.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledges that he shares Waxman's political views on many
issues, but "our priorities are different, and so are our ways of
reaching the goals. I have more of a private-sector approach" to
solving problems.</TE>
<TE>   Waxman, 62, also is spending time in the new parts of the district
and running on a record that includes working for better medical
benefits for the elderly, combating abuses in nursing homes and, most
recently, investigating failed energy giant Enron Corp. He disagrees
with Feldman's contentions that he is not in tune with voters and
that he should step aside for a new generation of leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done a good job. I've been there fighting on the issues
[that voters care about]," said Waxman, noting his seniority will put
him in key assignments if the Democrats regain control of the House
of Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime Democratic power player, Waxman first won a seat in
Congress in 1974 and has been reelected by big margins ever since.
The nonpartisan Almanac of American Politics calls him "one of the
ablest members of the House, a shrewd political operator who is a
skilled and idealistic policy entrepreneur."</TE>
<TE>   Waxman's work, which also includes battling tobacco interests,
pushing for campaign finance reform and championing environmental
issues, has made him popular in the district, home to many of the
entertainment industry's liberal political activists and
contributors.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many favored incumbents, who dislike providing a forum (and
perhaps a credibility boost) to their little-known challengers,
Waxman has a long-standing policy of sharing a podium with his
political opponents. He and Feldman have made several joint
appearances, most notably Feb. 19 on commentator Bill Rosendahl's
public affairs program on Adelphia Cable TV. "I've always felt that's
the proper thing to do," Waxman said. "I have always been willing to
make my case when I ask the voters for support every two years, and I
see no reason to fear or run away from debating my opponents."</TE>
<TE>   Feldman said he got a much chillier reception where he least
expected it--from many in the district's politically active gay and
lesbian community.</TE>
<TE>   Active in gay-rights causes for more than a decade, Feldman
expected many in his community would welcome the opportunity to elect
an openly gay man to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he said, he encountered hostility from those who disliked
his challenge to a powerful incumbent with an outstanding record on
issues important to gays and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   "I found there was a lot of working behind the scenes against me,"
Feldman said.</TE>
<TE>   But he said most gays and lesbians, as well as other voters he has
approached, have responded positively to his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope people defy the conventional wisdom ... and vote for
me."</TE>

<HD>Costly D.A. Race, Board Contests Fail to Excite Electorate</HD>
<DH>Primary: Only 154,000 of Ventura County's 385,000 voters
are expected to go to the polls Tuesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT and TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a million-dollar district attorney's race and two prickly
contests for seats on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors,
election officials are projecting a ho-hum 40% turnout for Tuesday's
off-year primary election.</LD>
<LD>   The battle to replace retiring Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury is
the costliest ever for a local seat. Two supervisorial races could
decide whether the board gets more aggressive in a growing land
conservation movement and whether sheriff's deputies win a rich new
retirement benefit.</LD>
<LD>   But even with meaty issues at stake, county elections chief Bruce
Bradley predicted just 154,000 of 385,000 registered voters will go
to the polls because there are no hot-button initiatives or national
contests to draw them out.</LD>
<TE>   "Statewide, the Republicans have a race for governor. That might
generate some interest there," Bradley said. "But if you look at the
rest of the ticket, most of the partisan offices are unopposed. To
get turnout up, you have to reach the people who are not regular
voters and I don't see that happening."</TE>
<TE>   As the final days of the campaign wind down, candidates for the
three high-profile county seats are keeping a hectic pace.</TE>
<TE>   District attorney candidates Ron Bamieh and Greg Totten were
planning to unleash a final volley of mailers and television ads in a
last-minute push to sway voters. Totten said he was bracing for a
barrage of negative hit pieces after Bamieh's war chest, bankrolled
by his wealthy father, swelled to more than $1 million last week.</TE>
<TE>   But Bamieh insisted he will stay above the fray and criticized his
opponent for slinging mud.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, businessman Randy Hoffman and Thousand Oaks
Councilwoman Linda Parks, who are facing off for the Thousand
Oaks-based 2nd District supervisor's seat, kept busy with
get-out-the-vote efforts while they fended off negative charges in
campaign mailers.</TE>
<TE>   In the other supervisor's race, incumbent Judy Mikels scheduled
back-to-back campaign stops to rally supporters while her opponent
for the Simi Valley-based 4th District seat, fraud investigator John
Lane, was sprinting to knock on hundreds of doors before Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to state races and propositions, Ventura County voters
will decide a number of local measures. Voters in Fillmore are being
asked to back a $15-per-year parcel tax to cover the cost of
maintaining a proposed public swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark will vote on a $33-million school bond issue to renovate
schools and upgrade technology in the classroom. Countywide, the
Ventura County Community College District is seeking approval for a
$356-million bond issue to repair and build classrooms, libraries and
other facilities.</TE>
<TE>   County voters will also be asked to reaffirm an existing business
tax for unincorporated areas. Supervisors had approved the tax, which
adds about $1.2 million to county government's treasury each year,
but a court decision requires that it be placed before voters.</TE>
<TE>   Six candidates will face off in the contest to replace
Clerk-Recorder Richard Dean, who is retiring after 20 years in
office. Vying for the post are county Board of Education member
Yvonne Gallegos Bodle, Oxnard City Clerk Daniel Martinez, former
county Republican Chairwoman Jackie Rodgers, financial executive John
Reid, assistant recorder Phil Schmit and attorney Michael Wesner.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Treasurer-Tax Collector Larry Matheney is expected to
step up to the top job at the end of the year, replacing retiring
Treasurer-Tax Collector Harold S. Pittman. Matheney's expected
opponent, former Thousand Oaks Councilman Mike Markey, withdrew from
the race last month but his name will still appear on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   This primary season has been marked by fewer candidates raising
more money--a departure from tradition.</TE>
<TE>   In years past, county government's most powerful offices have
drawn three or four candidates, forcing the top vote-getters to face
off in a general election. But the district attorney and supervisors'
contests this year offer just two candidates each, despite the fact
that in two races the incumbent is stepping down.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, fund-raising has reached record levels.</TE>
<TE>   The $1.4-million district attorney's contest is the most expensive
ever for a county seat--and possibly for any district attorney's
office in similar-sized counties statewide. The bulk was raised by
Bamieh with help from his father, San Mateo businessman and frequent
GOP contributor Sam Bamieh.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Bamieh gave his son $993,000--virtually all of the
$1.07 million the candidate has raised to date. Totten has raised
about $400,000 from hundreds of contributors.</TE>
<TE>   As the election nears, the two candidates have kept a frantic pace
to reach out to voters--appearing at 32 forums across the county.
They have also unleashed a barrage of slick mailers and television
ads in recent days that have stirred controversy.</TE>
<TE>   In a mailer sent last week, Totten attacked Bamieh's "never lost a
felony case" campaign slogan, which has played repeatedly on TV and
radio ads. The Totten brochure identifies 10 criminal cases that
Bamieh lost and suggests the prosecutor can't be trusted to tell the
truth.</TE>
<TE>   But eight of the so-called loser cases named in Totten's mailers
are misdemeanors Bamieh handled as a first-year prosecutor. The other
two are felonies. One was reversed on appeal and the other resulted
in a dismissal after the jury deadlocked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's negative, its mean-spirited," Bamieh said. "He says things
that are intentionally false."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Bamieh's vows to stay positive, a Totten campaign
strategist predicted Bamieh will sling mud this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect the unprecedented amounts of money Sam [Bamieh] is
funneling into the county will pay for some very negative last-minute
campaigning," strategist Debra Creadick said. Creadick said she hopes
Bamieh's big spending will backfire by offending voters.</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura County voters are very smart and over and over again we
hear from people that they find this kind of spending outrageous,"
Creadick said. "This is not a county where you can waltz in and drop
a million dollars and buy a seat. People won't stand for it."</TE>
<TE>   While the district attorney's race has dominated headlines, the
two supervisorial contests are also being closely watched.</TE>
<TE>   At stake are decisions on how the county will grow, including how
aggressively county supervisors move to create an open-space district
that would buy up land and development rights, and whether the board
will back away from its earlier approval of the 3,050-home Ahmanson
Ranch development.</TE>
<TE>   The election's outcome is also expected to influence contract
negotiations with the union representing sheriff's deputies. If
union-backed candidates win, the board would very likely come under
greater pressure to settle outstanding contract issues.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2nd District, Hoffman is backed by much of Thousand Oaks'
business establishment while Parks, a longtime slow-growth advocate,
is backed by residents who favor putting the brakes on nearly all
development.</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raising records have also fallen in this race, fueled largely
by big contributions to Hoffman's campaign. The former CEO of
technology giant Magellan Systems has raised $450,000, including
$91,000 from developer and Dole Foods CEO David H. Murdock.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, meanwhile, has limited donations to $500 per individual and
raised about $106,000.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' supporters accuse the Hoffman camp of orchestrating a smear
campaign, including Parks' recent censure by the Thousand Oaks City
Council for allegedly violating public meeting laws. Supervisor Steve
Bennett has come to Parks' defense in recent days, saying he decided
to speak up "to try to level the playing field."</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfair when you have one person limiting her contributions
and then being outspent by someone who is taking very large
contributions," said Bennett, a coauthor of the county's popular SOAR
growth-control initiatives. "She's independent of developer money and
her record of fighting inappropriate perks is solid.... Usually I'm
pretty cautious about endorsing candidates. But this one I feel
strongly about."</TE>
<TE>   Parks last week suggested that Assemblyman Tony Strickland
(R-Moorpark), a Hoffman supporter, was funneling more developer money
into Hoffman's campaign through a Strickland-controlled committee.
Strickland recently received a $25,000 contribution from builder
Miller Brothers Investments, and the next day gave a $10,000 loan to
Hoffman.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman said Strickland had pledged to give him $20,000 and was
merely fulfilling that promise. Hoffman said he didn't know whether
the cash came from Miller or other contributors to Strickland,
chairman of the Assembly Republican Caucus.</TE>
<TE>   "That position enables you to raise money," Hoffman said. "Where
he gets his contributions, I don't track that. But Linda is one who
sees a conspiracy behind every door."</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana's Cozy Zoo Is 50</HD>
<DH>Nature: After a $1.5-million upgrade, the facility hopes to
regain its accreditation soon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana Zoo turned 50 on Saturday, but its birthday party was aimed
at those much younger.</LD>
<LD>   There were clowns, ice cream cones, plumes of pink cotton candy
and children leading their families through the zoo.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to see the United States bald eagle," said 3-year-old
Connor Turnbow, his mother Donna and friend Brian Dazey in tow.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think they have bald eagles, honey," Donna Turnbow, 40,
of Cypress, told her son.</TE>
<TE>   But a few yards down a bamboo-lined alley, the raptor perched
inside a small enclosure. Connor pointed. "He's beautiful, isn't he?"
his mother exclaimed. A slow "yeah," followed from Connor.</TE>
<TE>   Turnbow and her son visit the zoo about once a month, she said.
She may have missed the eagle in previous visits, but Connor hadn't.
The 20-acre zoo is in Prentice Park, near the Santa Ana Freeway--an
oasis of fauna and flora in the middle of North Orange County's urban
sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   The park's animal exhibits are modest: a collection of rare
rainforest monkeys and birds, an assortment of barnyard animals,
lemurs, lamas and a pair of Asian elephants that can be ridden.</TE>
<TE>   It's the cozy atmosphere and accessibility that draw visitors,
those attending Saturday said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a perfect zoo for kids," said Betty Hamilton of Lakewood,
visiting with her daughter and two grandchildren. "Their attention
span is just about an hour. This is the perfect size."</TE>
<TE>   The zoo was founded on orange groves donated by Joseph Prentice.</TE>
<TE>   He was fascinated by monkeys, and his only stipulation to the city
was that the park always house at least 50 of them.</TE>
<TE>   Now, black and white colobus, brown capuchins and tiny tamarins
with their lion-like manes frolic in dozens of cages throughout the
zoo.</TE>
<TE>   The facility, which has struggled recently with accreditation
problems, put on a festive face for an expected 3,000 visitors. They
were treated to ice cream, and children put on dancing and singing
shows.</TE>
<TE>   The facility lost its accreditation from the American Zoo and
Aquarium Assn. in September 2000 because of delayed maintenance and
improvements, among other reasons. But the city has since spent $1.5
million to upgrade the facilities. Officials said they expect to
regain accreditation soon.</TE>
<TE>   Accreditation is not necessary to operate the zoo, but it can
affect fund-raising and the ability to borrow animals from accredited
zoos.</TE>
<TE>   "We are really confident," said Leslie Perovich, director of
Friends of the Santa Ana Zoo, a nonprofit support group, as she
greeted visitors Saturday. "This is still a great place."</TE>

<HD>Our Picks in Local Races</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some people refer to this as an "off" year in elections, meaning that
there are no presidential primaries to attract voters. But it's
anything but an off year for the Orange County ballot, with enough
important and controversial local races and issues to make it
interesting for voters and poll watchers.</LD>
<LD>   In recent weeks we have commented on selected races and the two
local measures before county residents on Tuesday's ballot. The
following is a brief recap of the recommendations we have made and
our reasons for them.</LD>
<LD>   The two most visible contests are Measure W, which seeks to bar
any planned airport use at the former Marine Corps airfield at El
Toro and rezone the area for park and other nonaviation use, and the
race between incumbent Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas and Wally Wade, an
assistant district attorney seeking to unseat him.</LD>
<TE>   On Measure W, The Times is recommending a "no" vote. While the
current airport plan is deeply flawed, we believe it is important to
the region to preserve some future aviation option for El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   The other countywide issue before voters is Measure V, which seeks
to make Orange County a charter county solely to change the way
vacancies are filled on the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   We see it more as a political maneuver aimed at keeping Democratic
Gov. Gray Davis from appointing a replacement, possibly a Democrat,
to fill the 3rd District seat of Supervisor Todd Spitzer, should he,
as expected, win election to the Assembly. Voters should reject the
end run around the more basic question of whether or not Orange
County should be a charter county, and what provisions a charter
should contain.</TE>
<TE>   In the district attorney contest, we urge Wade's election. Based
on his performance in his first three years in office, Rackauckas has
lost the support of the Assn. of Orange County Deputy District
Attorneys, which for the first time is not supporting its incumbent
boss. This switch to Wade highlights a growing lack of confidence in
the way Rackauckas is running the office. His term has been plagued
by persistent questions about whether his many political associations
make it difficult for him to do his job objectively.</TE>
<TE>   Wade, a 21-year veteran prosecutor, is well-qualified and
respected and should be elected.</TE>
<TE>   Another critical and prominent race on the county level has Chris
Norby, the veteran city councilman from Fullerton, challenging 4th
District Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad. Norby has broad experience and
is much better suited than Coad for the regional leadership of board
service. The board needs someone to stir the pot on a range of issues
and Norby can provide the questioning, thoughtful and independent
leadership that is so badly needed.</TE>
<TE>   There are other races for county posts that involve well-qualified
candidates worthy of voter support. Tom Daly, mayor of Anaheim, is
one of five people seeking the vacant clerk-recorder's office. He is
the most qualified and best able to provide the professionalism and
leadership needed to continue the office's efficient operation.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true of Vicki Landrus, who now serves as assistant
public administrator. She is by far the most qualified of the four
people seeking to replace the incumbent public administrator, William
Baker, who is not running for reelection. Landrus is a 20-year
veteran of county government who has Baker's endorsement and the
proven ability and experience to take over direction of services the
office provides.</TE>
<TE>   We also endorse the reelection of County Assessor Webster J.
Guillory. The management and technical skills he has demonstrated in
his first term have earned him reelection.</TE>
<TE>   In the county Board of Education contests, incumbents Del Clark in
Area 2 and Elizabeth "Liz" Dorn Parker in Area 5 are the most
qualified.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, an appointed incumbent and experienced local school board
member, has worked well with the county board and understands its
role in providing services to local districts.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, running for her sixth term, is one of the most experienced
and able school board members in the county and has distinguished
herself as an educational leader, not only on the local level but
statewide.</TE>
<TE>   A judicial race is generally one of the lowest-profile contests,
with few voters familiar with any of the candidates. Eleven
candidates are seeking to replace four retiring judges.</TE>
<TE>   Four candidates stand out from the field and have the legal
knowledge, judgment, temperament and other qualities that make them
best-qualified. We support the election of Kimberly Menninger for
Office No. 3, Lance Jensen for Office No. 8, Kelly Mac Eachern for
Office No. 22 and Glenda Sanders for Office No. 27.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of Tuesday's balloting can have considerable impact on
county land use and structure, education and the legal system. That's
why we have made the above ballot recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   And that's why it's important for residents to study the
candidates and issues--and vote Tuesday, rather than sitting on the
sidelines and letting others decide the future for them.</TE>

<HD>An 'Assessment'--or a Tax?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beyond the immediacy of election news in Orange County lies an
emerging political and fiscal challenge in this young year. Residents
suddenly are finding themselves on the spot to pay more for city and
school services that they once thought were part of the established
package of property and other taxes and special fees.</LD>
<LD>   Elected officials in some cities and jurisdictions, such as
Irvine, are under new pressure to justify requests for more revenue.
They had better be prepared to explain why they can't make do with
what they have as they seek ways around limits imposed by
initiatives.</LD>
<LD>   For homeowners and parents of schoolchildren, the lesson of the
hour seems to be that you get what you pay for--but maybe only that.
And for one city's political and bureaucratic leadership, there is a
reminder for those in government that a tax by any name stirs the
hackles of those who must pay.</LD>
<TE>   This battle over fees for services that were once thought to be
basic highlights a changing relationship between citizens and those
who tax them.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when art, music and street lights were staples of
everyday life.</TE>
<TE>   Today, they are beginning to look more like "options" on a car,
the equivalent of choosing headlights as extras from a dealer.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens baffled by this fundamental shift will understand readily
what this is all about if the bottom line on their property tax bills
goes up because a new "assessment" has been tacked on. But the
underlying relationship between state revenue and local services that
prompts this crisis is very complex.</TE>
<TE>   It is shaped not only by ballot initiatives and legal
interpretations in their aftermath, but also by the changing fortunes
of the state economy.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine is feeling the pain at the local level in city and school
services as a result of budgetary problems that have to do both with
what happens in Sacramento and because of its own local choices on
how to tax and spend.</TE>
<TE>   Witness an e-mail campaign started by a group of parents in
January, asking $100 for each of the Irvine Unified School District's
24,000 students as part of an attempt to make up for more than $5
million in recent cuts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999 and 2000, already on notice that the city faced drastic
cuts in extras such as art and music, city voters were asked to pay a
parcel tax to close the gap. Those measures failed, but the state's
financial position continued to deteriorate and there were fewer
contributions to the Irvine Public Schools Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   In January, the bottom line caught up with the district. It closed
an elementary school, cut science, art and music programs and
increased class sizes. Ahead lies the prospect of teacher layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   In the Saddleback Valley Unified District, a similar fund-raising
effort seeks $50 from each district family to address $8 million in
cuts. One hundred eighty-six nonunion teaching jobs and music and
science programs were cut.</TE>
<TE>   These are districts that have prided themselves on excellence.
Suddenly, individuals must decide whether to pay extra for what once
were basics. But if excellence has a price, at least the more
affluent communities have the opportunity of making a choice. Poorer
districts may not be so lucky.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is the new definition of what is "basic" more evident than
at the city level in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Property owners currently are reviewing mail ballots that give
them until April 9 to decide whether to increase their property
assessments for maintenance of parks, sidewalks and street lights.
Some are grumbling already.</TE>
<TE>   Most voters are unschooled in the nuances of such citizen limits
on taxation as Proposition 13 and the provisions of Proposition 218.
Now the choices are coming home to roost.</TE>
<TE>   City officials inclined to go to voters to keep the streets paved
may be able to ask once for an extension of an existing assessment,
as is happening in Irvine, but surely there will be limits to
taxpayer patience.</TE>
<TE>   Already one council member is insisting that the city make tougher
choices itself before going back to the well.</TE>
<TE>   In the school district, there are rumblings of recall for some
board members. And with the requests for more money for bond measures
and for school programs, sooner or later something has to give.</TE>

<HD>Kansas Oil Firm Frets Over Playmate's Case</HD>
<DH>Trial: Anna Nicole Smith could force a spotlight on
notoriously private Koch Industries, the key to late husband's
wealth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The executives at Koch Industries, the Wichita, Kan.-based oil
conglomerate and the second-largest privately held company in
America, have been keeping a close eye on former Playboy playmate and
lingerie model Anna Nicole Smith.</LD>
<LD>   But not for the reason you might think.</LD>
<LD>   The billion-dollar energy giant has been dragged into the middle
of Smith's nasty, six-year legal battle over the estate of her late
husband, oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall of Houston.</LD>
<TE>   At stake in the case, which is now before a U.S. District Court
judge in Santa Ana, is the Marshall fortune. The estate consists
almost exclusively of Koch Industries stock, a 16% ownership interest
that Marshall often referred to as his "family jewels."</TE>
<TE>   If Smith wins, the now-bankrupt Playboy pinup not only would lay
claim to a sizable chunk of the Marshall fortune but also could stir
up all sorts of financial headaches for the two brothers at the helm
of Koch Industries: Charles and David Koch.</TE>
<TE>   Just how big a splash Smith could make hinges on a
simple-yet-elusive question: How much was J. Howard Marshall and his
Koch Industries stock worth? Estimates range from $170 million to
$1.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Because Smith contends that her husband promised her half his
fortune, the answer, if she wins, could ultimately mean the
difference between an $85-million and a $750-million judgment.</TE>
<TE>   The value of Koch Industries has been debated for years, because
the company's stock has never been publicly traded--and 96% of the
shares are in the hands of Charles and David Koch and the Marshall
estate. A federal court ruling on Smith's behalf would put a value on
those assets and carry major estate-tax implications for the Koch
brothers and Marshall's heirs.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Marshall and Forbes magazine argued over the value of
his 16% stake in Koch, a company that has 13,000 employees and
operations in oil, natural gas, refining, petrochemicals, energy
services, trading and agriculture. Forbes figured it was worth enough
to make him one of the 400 richest people in the United States, which
both Marshall and his family have disputed.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, 34, met Marshall in 1991 when she was dancing at a Houston
strip club, GiGis. He was 89 when they married in 1994 and died 14
months later. The court battle over his estate commenced almost
immediately because Smith was left out of Marshall's will and was
never named as a beneficiary of his estate.</TE>
<TE>   Smith accuses E. Pierce Marshall, her stepson, of cheating her out
of any inheritance because he despised her and coveted his father's
wealth. Pierce Marshall, the sole heir, said his father left Smith
out of his will because he realized that marrying her was a mistake
after she squandered millions and rarely spent time with him in his
final years.</TE>
<TE>   A bankruptcy judge in Los Angeles sided with Smith a little over a
year ago, awarding her $475 million. Six months later, a Texas
probate court sided with Pierce Marshall, declaring him the sole
heir.</TE>
<TE>   The case is now before U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in
Santa Ana, who tossed out the bankruptcy court ruling and listened to
weeks of new testimony in December. His decision is expected this
month.</TE>
<TE>   If Carter rules in Smith's favor, she may be entitled to a portion
of the Koch stock, or at least a monetary equivalent, which could
force Pierce Marshall to put some holdings up for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubt Koch would want those shares in the hands of a third
party or sold to a third party that they are not comfortable with,"
said economist Ehud I. Ronn, director of the center for energy
finance research at the University of Texas, echoing a sentiment
voiced by some Wall Street analysts who monitor the company. "She'd
be entitled to reports, dividends, you name it."</TE>
<TE>   Generally regarded as a solid, well-run company, Koch Industries
is notoriously private about its business operations, Ronn said. With
more than $30 billion a year in sales, the company can well afford to
buy back those shares to prevent another party from breaking into its
inner sanctum, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if Carter determines a high value for the Koch stock, the
decision could increase the estate-tax liabilities for shareholders
and their heirs.</TE>
<TE>   "I presume [the Koch brothers] have done some estate planning, but
there still would be tax implications for the heirs," Ronn said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Pierce Marshall consider such speculation pointless
because they've already won the probate case in Texas and are
confident of a victory in the federal case.</TE>
<TE>   Still, officials at Koch were concerned enough to send an attorney
to the Santa Ana courthouse to monitor the trial. Not only is the
value of Koch stock at issue, but Pierce Marshall sits on the Koch
Industries board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   "It behooves us to understand what is going on," said Koch
Industries spokesman Jay Rosser in Wichita. "Pierce is a board
member. Ultimately, this will be a long and protracted litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Rosser declined to discuss the matter further. "I can't speculate
on what the judge's decision may or may not be," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Samuel Bufford ruled that
Marshall's Koch holdings were worth $1.6 billion and that Smith was
entitled to $449.7 million, the amount J. Howard Marshall's assets
increased during their 14-month marriage. Bufford made the ruling
based on estimates provided by Smith's financial expert in the case,
Wayne Elggren.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce Marshall's attorneys and their financial expert argued that
the real value of the Koch stock is closer to $170 million.</TE>
<TE>   They said Bufford failed to give proper weight to the lack of a
market for Koch stock.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, Marshall holds a minority stake of mostly nonvoting
stock, so as a shareholder he has no say about how the company is
run. Plus, unlike publicly traded companies, Koch stock is not traded
on Wall Street--so there never has been an established market price.
Finally, Koch is known for paying low dividends, so the income from
the investment is relatively small.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody who I can think is in their right mind would buy their
stock from him," said Rusty Hardin, Pierce Marshall's lead attorney.
"There's no market. Who would want it?"</TE>
<TE>   Smith's attorneys aren't the only ones who think differently,
however.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Forbes magazine has listed Marshall and, after his
death, his son, among the 400 richest people in America. Just this
week, Forbes magazine estimated Pierce Marshall's net worth at $1.3
billon. And for years, the Marshalls have demanded to be removed from
the magazine's list of richest people, saying Forbes had grossly
inflated the value of their stake in Koch Industries.</TE>
<TE>   "Forbes' calculation of my father's wealth is a wildly inflated
fantasy," Pierce Marshall said Friday, calling the list of
billionaires a shameless publicity stunt.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Pierce Marshall has said the family's net worth is a
fraction of the figure listed by the magazine. He also believes it
was the magazine's "wild speculation" about his father's wealth that
lured Smith to the altar.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's attorney, Philip W. Boesch of Los Angeles, said the
Marshall family has consistently low-balled the family's net worth to
reduce their potential tax liability and to keep Smith from her
rightful inheritance. And even if Smith gets half the estate, Pierce
Marshall will remain well off.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what happens," Boesch said, "Pierce Marshall is still
going to be one of the wealthiest men in the United States."</TE>

<HD>Fresno Mayor Wants Broader Power</HD>
<DH>Politics: His proposal to appoint local school board
members draws widespread opposition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>Reviving a campaign issue he raised more than a year ago, Mayor Alan
Autry says the time has come for local school board members to be
appointed by him rather than elected.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor's idea has touched off strong opposition all the way to
Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis said that he likes the mayor but that politicians
who feel strongly about school issues should consider running for
school boards themselves.</LD>
<TE>   The California School Boards Assn., a lobbying and service
organization that represents most of the state's local school
districts, also dislikes Autry's idea.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no culture for it in California," said Scott Plotkin, the
group's executive director. "We don't have the tradition of a
top-down East Coast big-city mayor who runs everything out here. He's
obviously bored with the job he was elected to do."</TE>
<TE>   Such comments aren't stopping Autry, who says the election of
school board members only "gives the illusion of democracy." In fact,
he says, voters rarely know anything about most candidates in school
board races.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly irksome to Autry is the way teachers who no longer
care about their jobs--so-called burnout cases--are handled by
Fresno's elected board.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a term called 'dance of the lemons,'" he said. "It made
me nauseous when I first heard it explained. Instead of firing a
teacher who is burned out, they move them around from one school to
another."</TE>
<TE>   The Fresno Unified School District is the fourth largest in the
state, with more than 79,000 students who speak 101 languages. A
fourth of the district's students receive public assistance and a
third have limited English skills.</TE>
<TE>   Like those in other large urban districts, Fresno schools have had
problems ranging from high dropout rates to low test scores. But
officials say the district has shown improvement in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Autry hasn't focused on any specific problem in making his case
for an appointed board, although he says the district could do more
to help low-performing students who often slip through the cracks.</TE>
<TE>   He says the main problem is that Fresno schools are simply mired
in state bureaucracy and too dependent on edicts from Sacramento.
Only radical change can restore local control, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno school board President Michael B. O'Hare responded, "He
wants to try to control everything.... He doesn't even live in the
school district."</TE>
<TE>   Describing himself as "the education mayor," Autry first proposed
that he should have the power to appoint two members of the
seven-member school board to their positions, then expanded that
proposal to the entire board.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Autry pushed through a new city ordinance establishing
a daytime curfew during school hours for children ages 12 to 17,
aimed at curbing school truancy. The school district took no position
on the curfew, and some officials think that may have angered the
mayor.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen major U.S. cities have local school boards that
are appointed rather than elected, Autry said. He pointed to Chicago,
Boston and Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno would become the first city in California to have a school
board completely appointed by the mayor. Oakland has a board of seven
elected and three appointed members. San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown
also is considering a formal proposal that the city move to some kind
of appointee system after he leaves office.</TE>
<TE>   Although he admits that his effort may have little chance of
succeeding, Autry said he will never drop the idea. "It's the first
soldiers on the beach who take the most lead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Autry's new push brought him face to face with school board
members recently at a forum held by the Fresno City Council. He said
the board is "entrenched with special interests and bureaucracy. You
have a group bent solely on turf protection."</TE>
<TE>   Strongly opposing the appointment concept were Fresno Unified
School District Supt. Santiago Wood and Fresno County Schools Supt.
Pete Mehas. All but one of the city's seven council members also
oppose the idea.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, district spokeswoman Jill Marmolejo said school
officials want to work with Autry on issues of mutual concern, but
oppose his proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time the public would lose a right to vote, it's serious,"
she said. "We believe the mayor is sincere on this, but off a
little."</TE>
<TE>   "We want to work collaboratively, but it's hard to take the
suggestion that our teachers don't care," Marmolejo added. "Our
teachers are dedicated people."</TE>
<TE>   The school board issue is one of two current controversies
involving Autry. Fresno's city attorney has asked the state Fair
Political Practices Commission to advise whether the mayor may have
inadvertently fostered conflicts of interest in creating a city film
commission last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Before Autry took office, the city's official liaison with the
movie industry was the Fresno Convention and Visitors Bureau. Autry
persuaded City Council members to fund a film commission with
$150,000.</TE>
<TE>   A former actor, Autry is a partner in a local film-making company,
Dirt Road Productions. He hired one of his Dirt Road employees to
help run the commission. The city's lawyer is asking whether that
relationship should preclude Autry from being involved in decisions
about films that might be made in Fresno.</TE>

<HD>Strike Averted at CSU</HD>

<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Union leaders representing Cal State University faculty approved a
tentative agreement Saturday for a three-year contract, all but
ending the threat of a strike against the 22-campus system.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement, following nearly a year of often-bitter
negotiations, would provide systemwide pay raises of 2% in each of
the first two years. It also contains a so-called reopener clause
allowing for the California Faculty Assn. and CSU administrators to
negotiate another increase in the final year of the contract.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, the union pay scale for full-time faculty ranges from
$41,940 for an assistant professor to $90,804 for a full professor.
The union negotiates for 22,000 teachers, librarians and
psychological counselors.</LD>
<TE>   A breakthrough came last week when a neutral fact-finder delivered
a report offering key compromises, ending a bargaining impasse. The
state's budget crunch, by limiting the amount of money available for
salaries, also pushed the administration and union negotiators toward
a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The deal must be approved by union members. Balloting is expected
to take place on CSU campuses this month. The CSU board of trustees
also will consider the proposed contract, but its vote will not come
until mid-May.</TE>
<TE>   Faculty have worked without a contract since July 1. The new
contract would run through June 30, 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Along with pay raises, the deal would provide various benefits
sought by the union, including expanded health care coverage and
greater job security for part-time instructors.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the CSU administration managed to limit the pay
increases and maintained its right to award merit pay, a point of
contention with the union. However, merit pay was put on hold until
at least the third year of the contract.</TE>

<HD>Eager to Watch the State's Money</HD>
<DH>An admitted cheapskate and a multimillionaire are among 10
vying for controller.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>For self-described cheapskate Tom McClintock, campaigning for state
controller a second time is familiar territory, including a recycling
of the same television ads he aired in 1994. He hopes, however, the
outcome this time will be dramatically reversed. His ads won a prize,
but the Republican candidate narrowly lost the election.</LD>
<LD>   For multimillionaire Steve Westly, a "philanthropist
[self-employed]," Democratic activist and former executive of the
online auction company EBay, running for controller is a first bid
for public office.</LD>
<LD>   But for two veterans, Democrat Johan Klehs and Republican Dean
Andal, who are termed out as members of the tax-collecting State
Board of Equalization, the controller's post offers another
opportunity to extend their government service careers.</LD>
<TE>   In one of Tuesday's most crowded primary races, 10 candidates are
seeking their party's nomination to succeed Controller Kathleen
Connell as the state's chief check writer, custodian of offshore oil
lands and watchdog of state spending. The Democrat is termed out
after eight years.</TE>
<TE>   The controller, who is paid $140,000 a year, also is a member of
the Board of Equalization and the Franchise Tax Board. The controller
additionally is an overseer of multibillion-dollar investments of the
public employee and teacher retirement systems, the largest pension
programs of their kind in the country.</TE>
<TE>   To hear the candidates tell it, the controller is positioned to
lead the sweep against government waste, get into the business of
economic development, and act as a check and balance against alleged
excesses of the governor and Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "I rank it as the most influential job behind the governor and
attorney general," said Republican contender Andal, a retired
assemblyman termed out as an eight-year member of the equalization
board.</TE>
<TE>   Andal, 42, is running against fellow conservative state Sen.
McClintock of Thousand Oaks for the GOP nomination. McClintock, whose
Senate seat is not up for election this year, narrowly lost to
Connell in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the GOP race are Nancy Beecham of El Cajon, a nurse and
business owner, and W. Snow Hume of Los Angeles, a certified public
accountant.</TE>
<TE>   On the Democratic side, Klehs of San Leandro, a member of the
equalization board and a former assemblyman, faces Westly, the
retired EBay executive and a longtime party activist.</TE>
<TE>   Westly, 46, who has put about $3.2 million of his money into the
campaign and raised another $1.5 million from contributors, said he
believes voters want a controller with experience in business and
government. He was a member of the U.S. Department of Energy during
the Carter administration and has served as deputy director of
economic development for San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the only person in this race with both a business background
and government experience," Westly said.</TE>
<TE>   Klehs, 50, who specialized in tax and revenue issues as a
legislator and waded deeper into tax administration as a member of
the equalization board, said the controller's office is no place for
on-the-job training.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a record of 20 years in public finance," Klehs said. "My
opponent is someone who made all his money at EBay in stock options
in three years."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, McClintock, 46, whose libertarian philosophy is to the
right of Andal and most other Republicans in Sacramento, is making
his second run for controller, calling himself a proven opponent of
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, McClintock co-wrote a law that rebated billions of
dollars in over-collections to taxpayers. More recently, he was a
prime force in eliminating the "car tax" on motor vehicles and
refunding a $300 fee that out-of-state motorists had to pay for a
virtually nonexistent smog abatement program when they registered
their cars in California. The program was ruled unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   But Andal has challenged McClintock's credentials as a tax
fighter, an action that embarrassed one of Andal's key big-name
supporters, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. In response, it sent
McClintock a letter praising him as an "outstanding champion" of the
taxpayer and repudiating the notion that he is anything but an
"unwavering ally" of the taxpayer.</TE>
<TE>   Although McClintock can come across as intense and dour, in
commercials he makes fun of himself as a cheapskate of Scottish
ancestry. In a recycling of the same humorous ads McClintock aired in
the 1994 campaign, a so-called cousin "Angus McClintock" pitches the
candidate as a tightwad: "How tight is he? He's as tight as a
bullfrog's behind, and that, me friends, is watertight."</TE>
<TE>   Tom McClintock, heavily outspent by Connell in the 1994 general
election, lost the race. But the 15-second Angus McClintock spots
went on to win a creativity award from the American Assn. of
Political Consultants.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates in Tuesday's primary include Ernest F. Vance of
the American Independent Party; J. Carlos Aguirre of the Natural Law
Party; and David Delano Blanco and Laura Wells of the Green Party.</TE>

<HD>36th Assembly Race Gets Nasty</HD>
<DH>GOP front-runners in High Desert contest accuse each other
of carpetbagging and political foul play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like off-road racing enthusiasts, High Desert voters are used to
watching the mud fly come election time.</LD>
<LD>   But this year's Republican primary fight in the 36th Assembly
District has amazed even seasoned onlookers, particularly the feuding
between front-runners Sharon Runner and Phil Wyman.</LD>
<LD>   Though incumbent George Runner is forced out of office because of
term limits, his wife, Sharon, is hoping to carry on his legacy in
this conservative stronghold. Her fiercest competition comes from
another law-and-order Republican, 34th District Assemblyman Phil
Wyman of Tehachapi, whose hometown was relegated to the 32nd District
in last year's reapportionment.</LD>
<TE>   Much of the 34th District, meanwhile, was absorbed by the new
36th, and Wyman, a 16-year veteran of the Assembly, decided to
relocate to a one-bedroom apartment in the 36th District town of
Phelan.</TE>
<TE>   Runner supporters such as Lancaster attorney R. Rex Parris say the
move is pure carpetbagging. "It is a 700-square-foot garage," Parris
said.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, Wyman campaign chairman Doug Haaland has accused Parris
employees of posing as Wyman campaign workers to snoop around the
apartment. Haaland also has written to the state Fair Political
Practices Commission, accusing the Runners of illegally using Sharon
Runner's political consulting company--which counts George Runner
among its clients--to skirt contribution limits set out in the
Political Reform Act. FPPC officials won't comment on the matter, but
Parris calls the charges "nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, some residents, such as Palmdale barber Gary
Lindsey, have rendered a similar judgment on the entire political
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely out of hand," Lindsey said. "We need a whole lot
more of the issues, instead of bringing in all this personal stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The focus on politics over policy may stem from the fact that the
two candidates aren't too far apart philosophically. Sharon Runner
said she shares the worldview of her husband, one of California's
more conservative assemblymen. Last year, Assemblyman Runner railed
against the quarter-cent state sales tax increase, and unsuccessfully
introduced a resolution to honor the Boy Scouts after the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that the group could exclude gays.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what differentiates her from Wyman--who was once part
of an ultraconservative Assembly clique known as "The
Cavemen"--Runner describes herself as a "compassionate conservative."</TE>
<TE>   "I would say we have ... not necessarily different views, but
different abilities in getting things accomplished," she said. "I
have relationships with Democrats in Sacramento, and I believe they
see me as someone who generally cares about them and doesn't bash
what they do."</TE>
<TE>   Runner said she is worried that Sacramento puts too much emphasis
on urban public schools at the expense of those in outlying areas.
She also wants to work for better all-around transportation for her
district, one of the fastest-growing suburban areas in California.</TE>
<TE>   One of the answers to California's energy problems, she said, is
building new power plants in the High Desert, where land is plentiful
and well-paying jobs are needed to help eliminate the grueling
commute thousands make to Los Angeles daily.</TE>
<TE>   Wyman, a rancher with a law degree, was first elected to the
Assembly in 1978. In 1992, he gave up the seat to run for Congress,
but lost in the primary to Howard "Buck" McKeon. Wyman then served in
the state Senate after winning a special election in 1993 for
District 17, but lost to Democrat Jim Costa a year later. He was
elected to the 34th Assembly District in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   During his years in Sacramento, Wyman has established a reputation
as an unwavering conservative.</TE>
<TE>   He was a Senate author of the 1994 three-strikes law, as well as a
1987 Assembly bill that would have required minors to get a parent's
consent before having an abortion. (The Supreme Court struck down the
legislation in 1997.)</TE>
<TE>   This session, Wyman has introduced legislation to speed up the
widening of dangerous California 138, known locally as "Blood Alley."
Another bill provides incentives and tax credits for the aerospace
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working on these issues for years," Wyman said. "My
knowledge of the [Antelope Valley] and its job needs totally eclipses
Mrs. Runner."</TE>
<TE>   Also vying for the Republican nomination are Palmdale Councilman
Mike Dispenza, a local businessman, and Ollie McCaulley, a Palmdale
resident who works for a nonprofit housing group.</TE>
<TE>   But the big money is with Runner and Wyman: Each campaign has
spent at least $200,000 so far. Wyman, however, is taking a hit from
the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn., which has endorsed
Runner and has been flooding local mailboxes recently with $250,000
worth of mailers.</TE>
<TE>   Wyman said the union is angry that he helped kill a bill last year
that would have shut down a number of privately operated prisons in
the High Desert.</TE>
<TE>   In the Democratic camp, Lancaster businessman Byron Bostic and
Palmdale TV producer Robert Davenport are vying for the nomination.</TE>

<HD>D. Hawkins, 88; Atomic Bomb Historian</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Hawkins, a philosopher who became the official historian of the
experiment that produced the atomic bomb, died of natural causes Feb.
24 in Boulder, Colo. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Hawkins was teaching philosophy at UC Berkeley in 1943 when his
friend J. Robert Oppenheimer invited him to join the Los Alamos
Laboratory in New Mexico. Oppenheimer was director of the Manhattan
Project, the top-secret military experiment that produced the world's
first atomic explosion.</LD>
<LD>   Hawkins was Oppenheimer's troubleshooter, whose duties included
inventing reasons to keep the project's many young physicists from
being drafted. As the program's historian, he came to know the
brilliant Edward Teller and other members of Oppenheimer's team.</LD>
<TE>   But Hawkins was so disturbed by the prospect of nuclear warfare
that he refused to witness the project's culminating moment: the test
blast that lighted the sky over a New Mexico mesa in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   "The climactic thing to me was my decision not to go see the
test," he said several years ago. "As the historian I could have
demanded a grandstand seat, but I didn't want to see it."</TE>
<TE>   Born in El Paso, Hawkins was raised in La Luz, N.M. His father was
William Ashton Hawkins, a lawyer who gained prominence for his work
on water law.</TE>
<TE>   David Hawkins spent his youth roaming the desert on horseback and
later in a Model A Ford pickup, hunting for minerals, rattlesnakes
and adventure. His intimate knowledge of the terrain would be pivotal
decades later when scientists were searching for a site for the first
atomic blast.</TE>
<TE>   He studied philosophy at Stanford University, graduating in 1934.
Over the next six years he earned a master's degree from Stanford and
a doctorate from UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   While completing his thesis on mathematical probability at
Berkeley, he met Oppenheimer, then a physics professor. They
discovered that they had at least two common passions: New Mexico and
leftist politics.</TE>
<TE>   Oppenheimer had toured northern New Mexico on horseback before
entering Harvard, a trip that took him to the Los Alamos Boys Ranch,
later chosen as the site for his laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   He and Hawkins helped organize a teachers union, an activity that
would cost both of them their security clearances during the
Communist-hunting 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins joined the UC Berkeley faculty in 1941, the year that
President Franklin D. Roosevelt secretly established the Manhattan
Project to beat Germany in the race to build an atomic bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Oppenheimer by then was scarcely seen on campus. By 1942 he was
director of the Manhattan Project, recruiting the best minds in
physics for his new research center in Los Alamos.</TE>
<TE>   He phoned Hawkins in 1943. "We need you," he said, barely audible
because of a bad connection.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins' wife, Frances, was a longtime pacifist who opposed the
building of the bomb. Hawkins, however, did not hesitate to answer
his friend's call.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it would be history," he said years later. "And I wanted
to be on the inside of history, not the outside."</TE>
<TE>   His first job was as a mediator between the civilian scientists,
who believed in freely sharing information, and the Army, which had
created Los Alamos as a military post and preferred to restrict
communication to a "need to know" basis.</TE>
<TE>   "The weakness of that," Hawkins recalled, "was that in science you
don't always know what you need to know." So he helped Oppenheimer
establish an atmosphere of greater openness.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when the Army was searching for a test site, Hawkins
remembered from his childhood an isolated strip of the desert called
Jornada del Muerto, or Journey of Death, the name given by Spanish
explorers, some of whom died trying to cross it.</TE>
<TE>   This remote patch became the so-called Trinity Site. Hawkins
believed he was the first to suggest the general area that was the
site of the historic first atomic explosion.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of July 16, 1945, the top members of Oppenheimer's
team assembled excitedly at Trinity Site. Hawkins, however, chose to
remain miles away.</TE>
<TE>   He was waiting solemnly by an office window when, at 5:29 a.m., a
huge ball of white light filled the horizon. The atomic age had
begun.</TE>
<TE>   Later that morning, the scientists returning from the test site
were "manic, joyous, delirious" with their success, Hawkins recalled.
But he could not share their elation.</TE>
<TE>   "I was disturbed by the enthusiasm many people seemed to have," he
remembered years later. "They seemed to have lost sight of the grave
consequences of doing this job."</TE>
<TE>   He left Los Alamos after finishing his history of the project. The
preface was dated Aug. 6, 1946, the first anniversary of the attack
on Hiroshima, where the bomb was first used in war.</TE>
<TE>   The history was classified secret for 15 years, and remained
virtually unavailable for 20 more. When it was more widely issued in
the early 1980s, Los Angeles Times reviewer Peter Wyden praised it as
"considerably more literate and revealing than most of the genre."
Among its revelations was that the highest-ranking member of the
Manhattan Project to die in a Los Alamos radiation accident had been
officially responsible for safety.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins later regretted his involvement in the program. After the
war, he lobbied in Washington, as Oppenheimer did, for international
controls on the development of nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947 Hawkins joined the University of Colorado, where he taught
philosophy and physical sciences and developed a strong interest in
improving science education. He and his wife, a leader in early
childhood education, founded the Mountain View Center for
Environmental Education, which for many years provided advanced
training for elementary and preschool teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "David certainly realized the danger of what they had created at
Los Alamos, and that people needed to be educated in science for its
values but also for its dangers," said University of Colorado
political science professor Jim Scarritt.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins was described by colleagues as a modest man of immodest
intellect. In 1981 he won a $300,000 MacArthur Foundation prize, more
commonly called a "genius grant." He hated the term.</TE>
<TE>   "He laughed at the notion of it being a 'genius grant,' because he
couldn't be a genius," said Polly Donald, a longtime friend and
Boulder educator. "He was very humble."</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins is survived by his wife; a daughter, Julie Peck of
Lebanon, Ohio; and two grandsons.</TE>

<HD>Rivals Are Closely Matched on Issues</HD>
<DH>Cindy Montanez has big funding lead in Assembly race, but
Yolanda Fuentes banks on her experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cindy Montanez ignores the barking dogs, scoots past the backyard
chicken coops and passes the lawn signs shouting support for her
opponent.</LD>
<LD>   That's how the 28-year-old mayor of San Fernando gets out the vote
on Fillmore Street in Pacoima.</LD>
<LD>   As the light drains from the sky over the stucco barrios, the
front-runner in the 39th Assembly District race slips down a dirt
alley, past laundry draped over a fence, and heads around back to a
tiny bungalow tucked behind the main house.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm the mayor of San Fernando," she tells the teenage girl who
answers the door.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God, really?" the girl says, eyes widening at the sight of
Montanez in blue jeans. "Nice to meet you!"</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, neither Jessica Montenegro, 18, nor her mother,
Rosa, is registered to vote. But that doesn't stop Montanez from
chatting with them for 15 minutes, explaining her plans to boost
public safety and education in the northeast Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if they're not registered to vote, I always like to
introduce myself," Montanez said as she headed to another house.
"They're still constituents, right? It's good for them to know who
their assemblywoman is going to be."</TE>
<TE>   Montanez has reason to be confident. As of Feb. 16, her campaign
had raised more than $325,000, compared with $74,000 collected by her
opponent, Yolanda Fuentes.</TE>
<TE>   Montanez also has lined up substantial union support, which may
prove critical in getting voters to the polls Tuesday, expected to be
a low-turnout election day.</TE>
<TE>   But Fuentes, 27, an aide to current Assemblyman Tony Cardenas
(D-Panorama City), insists that her Sacramento experience will carry
the day. Cardenas has endorsed her, as has Los Angeles City Council
President Alex Padilla, a popular leader raised in Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about money," Fuentes said. "We saw that with Tony. In
his first [1996] race, he was outspent, three to one....Even with all
the mail Cindy has sent out, people are still supporting me."</TE>
<TE>   The winner in the primary is virtually guaranteed victory in
November in this heavily Democratic area, where the party has
registered 61% of the voters. The working-class district includes
Sylmar, Lake View Terrace, Sun Valley and Pacoima--where Fuentes grew
up--as well as the city of San Fernando, Montanez's base.</TE>
<TE>   On the issues, there is little to distinguish either woman from
her opponent, although they emphasize different priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Montanez calls public safety her top concern, especially
tightening security at airports. She envisions clean neighborhoods
fortified by more school funding and solid jobs, and she favors
preserving historic homes.</TE>
<TE>   Fuentes, who helped craft state legislation to fund after-school
programs and parent centers, calls education her top priority. She
contends that the Los Angeles Unified School District would function
better if divided into smaller pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the race has been largely devoid of the vicious sniping
that has scarred candidates in the neighboring 40th District. But a
recent Fuentes mailer signaled a change in tactics.</TE>
<TE>   The piece showed a photo of Montanez with the word "Lawbreaker"
emblazoned across her forehead. "Would you trust a lawbreaker with
your future?" it read.</TE>
<TE>   The charge appeared to refer to a complaint made to the California
Fair Political Practices Commission that Montanez had not included
the addresses of some contributors in her campaign finance reports.</TE>
<TE>   The mailer, which included images of commission letters, claimed
that Montanez was fined for the violation. But an agency spokesman
said the commission had no record of a fine.</TE>
<TE>   "The gall of this woman, to consider running for office after she
forgot to put some addresses on her FPPC form!" said Parke Skelton, a
campaign strategist for Montanez, in mock horror. "I'm not going to
let my candidate be called a criminal without responding in some
fashion."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Taylor, a consultant working for the Fuentes campaign,
insisted that Montanez had broken the law. He said she was fined--not
by the commission but by the city of San Fernando, for a local
campaign violation.</TE>
<TE>   But Steve Klotzsche, the city's finance director, said: "We have
absolutely no record of her ever being fined by the city....As far as
we're concerned, there is no basis of fact to that particular
[charge]."</TE>
<TE>   Outside players have jumped into the scuffle. A nonprofit watchdog
group, Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse, has voiced concern about
Montanez's ties to trial lawyers. Michael Vallante, the Los
Angeles-based group's director, said he identified $125,000 in
contributions to Montanez from personal-injury attorneys and other
lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be a very strong consumer advocate, no doubt about
it," Montanez said.</TE>
<TE>   There's little sign of the bickering at Fuentes' campaign
headquarters in Arleta, a scene of pleasant chaos tinged with
optimism.</TE>
<TE>   A coffee machine burbles in the corner. One of Fuentes' former
high school teachers, Ellen Gigger, teeters atop a folding chair as
she hangs schedules onto the wall. A 67-year-old volunteer named
Ralph shows up to help.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Gigger, Ellen's husband and the retired marching band
director at San Fernando High School, brags about what a great leader
Fuentes was as drum major a decade ago. He will hear nothing of his
prized student's uphill climb in the current campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to think positive," he said. "She's got to win it."</TE>

<HD>Republican Senator, Songwriter Face Off</HD>
<DH>Bruce McPherson and tunesmith Ellie Michaels compete in GOP
lieutenant governor primary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It's a contest between a seasoned state senator and ... a Southern
California songwriter?</LD>
<LD>   In a particularly low-key race for statewide office, Sen. Bruce
McPherson, a former newspaper editor from Santa Cruz, is vying for
the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor against Ellie
Michaels, a singer and tunesmith who hails from Thousand Oaks. The
winner will face Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, the Democrat seeking a
second term, in November.</LD>
<LD>   Though each GOP candidate says education is a key issue, the
similarities between them appear to end there.</LD>
<TE>   McPherson, 58, a former assemblyman serving his second term in the
Senate, heads the Public Safety Committee and is vice chairman of the
Education Committee. He has backed bills to reduce class sizes and to
expand a program that helps needy students attend college.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think she has comparatively the background and the proven
record I do to stand up and be counted for the people of California
at the state Capitol," McPherson said of Michaels.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels, 51, is a former sales representative and a
self-described award-winning model who founded a music licensing and
distribution company.</TE>
<TE>   Her claim to fame is writing and producing "No Child Left Behind,"
a song she says was partly inspired by a campaign speech of
then-candidate George W. Bush. The tune, she said, was later used at
Republican campaign events.</TE>
<TE>   "I wrote this song because kids were killing each other at high
schools in our nation," Michaels said. "I wanted to send a message to
humanity about what I thought was the problem, what I thought was the
neglect of the education of the soul."</TE>
<TE>   The office of lieutenant governor comes with few responsibilities
compared with other statewide positions. They include serving as a
regent of the University of California, a trustee of the California
State University system and chairperson of the Commission for
Economic Development.</TE>
<TE>   Though the day-to-day duties may appear low-key, the lieutenant
governor is always hovering in the background ready to assume the
state's top job: running California in the event that something
happens to the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of who wins the Republican primary, Bustamante, 49, is
considered the favorite in November.</TE>
<TE>   A former speaker of the Assembly from Fresno, he made headlines in
his first term for accidentally using a racial slur during a public
appearance and for pushing legislation to empower the state to jail
electricity producers for overcharging.</TE>
<TE>   McPherson says Bustamante failed to show leadership that could
have helped prevent the state's current fiscal meltdown. "He hasn't
spoken up for the good of the state when he should have," McPherson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Richie Ross, a campaign consultant for Bustamante, brushed aside
McPherson's contention. "He's yelling from the back bench, where he
sits in the state Senate," Ross said.</TE>
<TE>   Most political analysts rate McPherson a heavy favorite in the
primary, based on fund-raising and his experience.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign contribution records show McPherson with $400,000 cash on
hand as of Feb. 16, compared with Michaels' $15,000. Bustamante,
waiting in the wings, had $1.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   "McPherson should do fine with his ballot designation alone, which
describes him as a California state senator," said Allan Hoffenblum,
publisher of the California Target Book. "I just don't see people
voting for a singer-songwriter."</TE>
<TE>   Dick Rosengarten, publisher of the state political news weekly
CalPEEK, put it this way: "If he were to lose to her, it would be the
biggest upset in the last 10 years in California politics."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Rosengarten predicted that Michaels will succeed in gaining
support from the GOP's right wing, where McPherson may be considered
unacceptable because of his views on abortion and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels, who received the endorsement of the conservative
California Republican Assembly, supports abortion only in cases of
rape or incest. McPherson supports abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   He lists a variety of law enforcement groups, Republican lawmakers
and actor Clint Eastwood as his backers. Both candidates support the
death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   As a state lawmaker, McPherson provided his Democratic
counterparts in the Senate the lone GOP vote needed to require health
insurance companies to cover birth control pills, and he was the only
Senate Republican to support a bill making it illegal for
Californians to buy more than one handgun a month.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels has seized on McPherson's voting record, saying "he's so
far left he could fall off the left side of the world."</TE>
<TE>   McPherson contends that as a moderate Republican, he is in a much
better position to accomplish his goals if elected to the executive
branch. In the Democrat-controlled Senate, he is one of only three
Republicans to chair a standing committee, and sits on several other
key committees, including budget and appropriations.</TE>
<TE>   He makes no apologies for siding with Democrats on a variety of
gun-control bills.</TE>
<TE>   "I see these as a matter of public safety, not as an imposition to
the 2nd Amendment of our Constitution," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gun violence touched McPherson and his family in November when his
son, Hunter, 27, was shot and killed in San Francisco during an armed
robbery. Though the tragedy may have set back McPherson's campaign,
he said it wasn't a reason for him to pull out.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided the worst thing we could do would be to quit,"
McPherson said of his wife, Mary, and daughter, Tori.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates for lieutenant governor include Jim King,
American Independent; Donna J. Warren, Green Party; Pat Wright,
Libertarian; Kalee Przybylak, Natural Law; and Paul Jerry Hannosh,
Reform Party.</TE>

<HD>Farris Bryant, 87; Fla. Governor at Time of Integration,
Growth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Farris Bryant, 87, Florida's governor during a period of racial
strife and rapid population growth from 1961 to 1965, died Friday in
a Jacksonville, Fla., hospital of complications from a fall and a
stroke.</LD>
<LD>   Considered an old Southern gentleman, a brilliant politician and a
practical man of his time, Bryant campaigned in 1960 to preserve
segregation as well as to expand state highways, overhaul education,
and lure tourists and businesses.</LD>
<LD>   A Harvard-educated lawyer, Bryant insisted that segregation was
the law at the time, and he felt honor-bound to uphold it. But with
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the law changed, and Bryant helped the
state integrate its schools and other institutions as smoothly as
possible.</LD>
<TE>   He was declared a Great Floridian in 1994, and revered for his
efforts in expanding highways and higher education, including
establishing the Board of Regents. He insisted higher education must
grow to train Florida residents for the high-tech jobs he worked to
attract around the burgeoning space program at Cape Canaveral.</TE>
<TE>   After Bryant left the governor's office, he was named by President
Johnson as director of the Office of Emergency Planning and a member
of the National Security Council and, in 1967, chairman of the U.S.
Advisory Commission on Intergovernment Relations. Bryant lost a
Democratic primary bid for U.S. Senate in 1970 and returned to the
practice of law.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanislav Libensky, 80, an internationally known artist who cut and
cast Czech glass into sculptures, died Feb. 24 in Zelezny Brod, Czech
Republic, about 60 miles north of Prague.</LD>
<LD>   Educated at the Prague College of Applied Arts, Libensky later
taught there and at small vocational schools, inspiring artists in
Europe, Japan and the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   "Glass," he once said, "allows us to form shapes as we penetrate
its mass, determine its center and touch its secrets."</LD>
<TE>   Libensky also adapted his artistic talent to architecture,
creating a landmark glass building near Prague's National Theater.</TE>
<TE>   His work was limited by the Communist regime after the 1968
Russian invasion of what was then Czechoslovakia.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, his works are in collections of such museums
as New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Corning (N.Y.)
Museum of Glass.</TE>
<TE>   A retrospective of his sculptures now on exhibit at the National
Gallery in Prague will open July 4 at the new Museum of Glass in
Tacoma, Wash.</TE>

<HD>Davis on Fence on Prop. 45</HD>
<DH>Despite the Democratic Party's backing of the bid to ease
term limits, governor stays neutral.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Saturday announced that he is taking no position
on Proposition 45, a ballot measure to ease legislative term limits,
even though his own Democratic Party is the initiative's largest
financial backer at $3.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   The governor's decision also runs counter to Democratic
legislators, who have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the
measure.</LD>
<LD>   Davis spokesman Roger Salazar declined to elaborate, saying the
governor "is just not going to take a position."</LD>
<TE>   All three of Davis' Republican challengers for governor--former
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, businessman Bill Simon Jr. and
Secretary of State Bill Jones--oppose the initiative, as does the
state Republican Party. Recent polls show the measure trailing
slightly among likely voters, but with large numbers of voters still
undecided.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps the governor should have raised his finger a bit higher
in the wind," said Dan Schnur, who is managing the No-on-45 campaign.
With a note of sarcasm, Schnur expressed "sympathy" for Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "On one hand," Schnur said, "he sees a majority of California
oppose the initiative. On the other hand, he has a Legislature full
of Democratic members whose votes he needs to pass a budget. Coming
out against them and their effort to extend their careers might be a
risky way to begin those negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) pushed to
get the measure on Tuesday's ballot. Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson
(D-Culver City) has called its passage one of his top priorities.</TE>
<TE>   If the measure fails, several veteran Democratic
lawmakers--including Burton, with whom Davis has an icy
relationship--would be forced to leave the Legislature in 2004,
halfway through the term of whoever is elected governor in November.
Wesson would be forced to leave the Assembly in 2004, but he could
run for a state Senate seat.</TE>
<TE>   If the initiative is approved, lawmakers will win the right to run
for one more four-year term in the Senate and two more two-year terms
in the lower house by gathering the signatures of 20% of the voters
who cast ballots in their districts in the prior election. Currently,
Assembly members are limited to three two-year terms and senators are
restricted to two four-year terms.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the endorsements of any politicians would make any
difference at this point," Bill Carrick, who is managing the
Yes-on-45 campaign, said, noting that the measure is backed by most
of the major interests in Sacramento, from business groups to unions
that represent police and firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   Davis opposed the 1990 initiative that instituted term limits in
California.</TE>

<LD>   The blaze erupted about 8:30 p.m. Friday in the 13300 block of
Ontario Drive, said American Red Cross spokesman Steve Bowcut. The
residents, both in their 80s, were able to escape without injury.</LD>
<LD>   The pair told authorities that the home was insured. The Red Cross
provided them with food vouchers and put them up in a nearby hotel

<HD>UC Schools Offering Guaranteed Transfers</HD>
<DH>Education: Critics say community college graduates meeting
requirements would be admitted anyway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA LEFF</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His Ventura College buddies may be sweating this spring as they wait
to hear whether they have been accepted for transfer to a University
of California campus in the fall, but not chemistry major Armando
Hernandez, who secured his scholastic future months ago.</LD>
<LD>   In August, Hernandez, 20, signed a contract with UC Santa Cruz
that guarantees him admission if he maintained a 2.8 grade point
average and took certain classes. By mid-November, weeks before the
application deadline, Hernandez received written confirmation saying
the school had reserved a place for him in its junior class.</LD>
<LD>   "It definitely boosted my self-esteem, because [it] alleviated the
worry that I wouldn't get accepted anywhere," said Hernandez, who has
dreamed of attending Santa Cruz since high school.</LD>
<TE>   Originally conceived as a regional partnership between individual
university campuses and their local two-year "feeder" schools, such
agreements are gaining popularity statewide as four-year institutions
face pressure to increase the number of community college graduates
who transfer to their campuses each year.</TE>
<TE>   Of the University of California's undergraduate campuses, all but
Berkeley and UCLA--the two most sought after--offer similar
guaranteed transfer programs, as do many of the colleges in the
California State University system.</TE>
<TE>   Even UC Berkeley and UCLA, though, try to encourage transfers.
Berkeley offers a transfer guarantee to applicants who applied as
freshmen and met the eligibility requirements but were not
admitted--if they complete a list of requirements at certain
community colleges. And UCLA, while not guaranteeing admission to
transfers, promises to give extra consideration to transfer students
from specified local community colleges, all in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   After years of maintaining an exclusive relationship with Santa
Barbara City College, UC Santa Barbara this year authorized
guaranteed admission arrangements with Ventura County's three
community colleges. UC Santa Cruz has guaranteed transfer deals with
96 of the state's 108 community colleges, including the nine in the
Los Angeles Community College District, and UC Davis has deals with
71 two-year schools.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the number of contracts multiply, opinions vary on their
value to students.</TE>
<TE>   Some Counselors Say Pacts Are Superfluous</TE>
<TE>   Some community college counselors argue that the documents are
essentially meaningless, because any student who meets the conditions
spelled out in the agreements would automatically be admitted to a
four-year college. The counselors say that the paperwork serves
mostly as a marketing vehicle for community colleges, which use their
admission pacts to promote university ties.</TE>
<TE>   "It does give people a little more comfort, if UC Davis, say, has
an admission agreement with Santa Monica, that this community college
thing must work," said Bruce Nannini, transfer coordinator at Santa
Monica City College. "But most of these kids have good enough grade
points to get into Davis and UC San Diego without the guarantee. I
tell them, 'Personally, I don't see the benefit.'"</TE>
<TE>   Supporters assert that the word "guarantee" is a powerful lure
that encourages community college students to get the academic advice
needed to ensure a successful and timely transfer.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a wonderful, wonderful tool for identifying students who
are serious about transfer," said Aiden Ely, transfer coordinator at
the California Community Colleges chancellor's office.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the agreements are still too new to gauge their
effectiveness in putting more community college students on the
transfer path. But at UC Davis, which has the longest track record
with such guarantees, officials say the contracts have helped boost
the transfer rate.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, Davis enrolled 1,900 transfer students, up from 1,500
two years ago. More than half entered under the campus' transfer
admission agreement program, said Michael Dang, associate director of
undergraduate admissions.</TE>
<TE>   Pacts Not Catching On at Some Schools</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the concept has been slow to catch on at many
community colleges. At El Camino College in Torrance, only about five
students signed a transfer agreement during the fall application
period, said Sue Oda-Omori, who directs the campus' transfer center.
Olivia Menchaca, transfer center director at Oxnard College, recalls
having just two turned in to her this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to put things in perspective: Students aren't required to
have one and they will get in, regardless, if they have met all these
criteria," Menchaca said. "They would be great at a school like San
Diego State or Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, but they have so many
students knocking at their doors they don't need these agreements."</TE>
<TE>   One reason the contracts aren't more popular is that the campuses
offering them tend to have liberal admissions policies--and savvy
students know it. Under UC Santa Cruz's guaranteed admission program,
community college students are promised admission if they maintain a
minimum 2.8 GPA. But Santa Cruz still admits every student who meets
the minimum UC transfer eligibility requirements, which require only
a 2.4 GPA.</TE>
<TE>   Chau Tranchi, 24, went into the Moorpark College transfer center
recently, fully expecting to sign a letter of intent with Cal State
Northridge. "I feel like I would have a higher chance of getting in,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   But counselor Patrick Aguirre told her the soonest she could
relocate to the Northridge campus under the university's guaranteed
transfer agreement would be fall 2003. Fortunately for Tranchi, she
has enough units and a high enough GPA--just over 2.0-- that she
could transfer later this year if she completes the required classes
by fall.</TE>

<HD>Art Lessons for Yuroz</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As an artist and teacher, I found David Ferrell's article
interesting ("Never Mind the High Praise. How About a Little Ink?" Feb.
3). He really put his finger on the problem. It is difficult for artists
to get any ink, but we work at it, and some are more successful than
others. Yuroz is a great talent and has a good business manager who knows
how to promote him as an artist. But aside from getting the museums'
attention, artists living in the Los Angeles area, especially in the San
Fernando Valley, get little or no ink from the print media. Most of us
have to promote ourselves, and we try to show our art in other parts of
the country because we get more attention from the press there.</LD>
<LD>   Lorraine Strieby</LD>
<LD>   Chatsworth</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alas, poor Yuroz! You only have a series of lofts downtown, a
six-bedroom ranch home in Camarillo, receive $150,000 "for some major
works" and feel you've been treated badly by the art world. I believe
your efforts in this life would be more fulfilling if you stopped whining
about what you don't have and started using your time and wealth to
benefit those in need around you. This might provide you with the
satisfaction in life that your wealth and fame evidently have not given
you.</TE>
<TE>   Teresa Pietrasanta</TE>
<TE>   Burbank</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yuroz suffers from a common misunderstanding about the purposes of
art. A fine artist's mission is to research the future of beauty, not
rehash the past. Most new works will be failed experiments, and even the
most successful work is usually incomprehensible to the public for years.
Thus the importance of historical context. Critics and curators aren't
Caesars who confer legitimacy with a thumbs up or down. Rather, most are
interested in how a particular work fits into current trends in
philosophy and social sciences--to explain the work rather than react to
it--so they have little to say about the purely decorative.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Sassoon</TE>
<TE>   Venice</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell argues that Yuroz "ventured down the path of commercialism"
and "that is enough to be all but blackballed by prestigious galleries
and museums." I believe his work speaks for itself: syrupy,
pseudo-Cubistic and completely out of touch with the lineage of art
history and the contemporary art world. His work clearly exudes
commercialism, regardless of where it has been exhibited. Yuroz seems to
think that his success in the private sector should entitle him to museum
exhibitions and a place in the pages of art history.</TE>
<TE>   I congratulate Yuroz on being commissioned by the U.N. and for
commanding prices of up to $150,000 for his major canvases. But contrary
to popular belief, the world of fine art is not some yippy, skippy fun
land where bohemian spirits freely express themselves. No, the art world
has its codes and rules, just like everything else in life. The fact that
Yuroz refuses to accept this means that his "art" probably will never
grace the walls of LACMA or any other major museum, even if it does land
on the cover of your magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Quinton Bemiller</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OK, let's see if I understand this: Yuroz, who often sells a single
painting for more money than I've made in the 22 years that I've been a
professional artist, stands in one of his several downtown lofts and
complains that he gets no respect. He's received a commission from the
U.N. He shows in galleries. He sells prints. He is, in his own words,
wealthy. And now he has The Times doing press flack work for him. What am
I missing here? Is it, perhaps, that I didn't realize life was so tough
at the top? Sorry, Yuroz, I'm not buyin' the sob story.</TE>

<LD>Thanks for printing "The Man Who Remembered Nothing" (by Gordon
Steel, as told to Dana Harris, Feb. 3). It is a touching story and
beautifully written. Surely we can all learn from Steel's determination
to overcome persistent memory loss and develop a career in a field where
memory is everything--and from the kind and useful assistance of his
friend Jerry Edelstein and the loyal support of his family.</LD>

<LD>Finally, after 70 years, honest to god and this time we mean it,
los angeles is going to return its most historically titillating bit of
public art to the public.</LD>
<LD>   Lack of funds, bureaucratic tangles and other impedimenta have
frustrated the re-displaying of David Alfaro Siqueiros' mural "Tropical
America" for a decade. Now, however, new plans have been approved by the
city, and the $4.5 million in funding (about $3 million of it from the
Getty Trust), is in place. "For the first time, it's really going to
happen," says Kory Smith, interim general manager of El Pueblo de Los
Angeles Historical Monument. Construction of a viewing platform and
protective shelter should begin by the end of the year. By next fall,
we'll be able to visit a new interpretive center and view what remains of
the once-inflammatory 18-by-80-foot mural above Olvera Street, the first
such public outdoor painting in the city, and probably the country.</LD>
<LD>   Siqueiros, who died in 1974, was one of the great masters of Mexican
mural art. He was also a devoted communist who fought as a boy in the
Mexican Revolution, commanded Republican troops during the Spanish Civil
War and, at the behest of Joseph Stalin, led a failed attempt to
machine-gun Leon Trotsky in Mexico in 1940.</LD>
<TE>   Siqueiros painted "Tropical America" in 1932, during a six- month
exile in Los Angeles. Consider the year: The Great Depression was in full
flower. Revolution was in the air. Los Angeles was hosting the Olympic
Games, and boosters were "restoring" the Olvera Street area to comport
with Anglo arriviste hallucinations about a serene, picturesque Mexican
past.</TE>
<TE>   The artist painted his work on the second-story wall of the Italian
Hall facing a rooftop beer garden. It took him and many volunteer helpers
a couple of months. As its Mayan temple, jungly vegetation and pair of
rifle-toting peasants took shape, the mural seemed to be in keeping with
the folkloric idyll suggested by its title. Siqueiros stayed up the
entire night before its unveiling, painting in solitude the mural's
central figure. That turned out to be an Indian peon crucified on a cross
with two horizontal planks. Atop the cross perched an American eagle,
copied from the figure on the U.S. quarter. It was clearly meant as a
symbol of Yankee economic imperialism. Moreover, it was right in the line
of fire of the peasants' rifles.</TE>
<TE>   You can imagine the reaction of the local babbittry the next day.
Within weeks, the part of the mural visible from Olvera Street was
whitewashed. In 1938, the rest of it was whited out.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1970s, rain and sun had degraded both whitewash and
mural, making restoration impossible. The mural deteriorated further
until 1982, when a narrow shed-like structure was built over it.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the shed today, the darkness is pierced by tiny shafts of light
from nail holes in the corrugated fiberglass facade. Pigeon feathers and
droppings carpet the floor and fleck the black canvas curtain that veils
the mural. The air is thick with dust and bird dander. The mural is a
mere apparition, its pigments having paled to near-indistinctness. "It
looks to me like what remains of early Christian painting," says Kristin
Kelly, who leads the conservation project for the Getty. "It looks
archeological." An instant ruin, so to speak, for an adolescent city.</TE>
<TE>   Standing near the wall, a viewer can make out very little. From a
distance, however, the ghostly work coheres somewhat better, which is why
the viewing platform will be set 40 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   No contemporary color photographs of the mural exist. Its hues can
only be guessed at. Even a half-scale model of the original planned for
the interpretive center likely will be in black and white.</TE>
<TE>   The mural's future roofed shelter will be bracketed by baffles for
keeping strong sunlight off the mural. Kelly says it's best seen either
in complete shadow or complete light. Because of the baffles, the latter
will be possible only from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. on winter days, when sunlight
is adjudged too weak to harm the painting further.</TE>
<TE>   The saga of "Tropical America" demonstrates the futility of
suppressing art, no matter how exasperating to majority tastes. Not only
did the mural shrug off its shroud of whitewash and come back from the
dead, but even while entombed it sprang up in altered form in the
hundreds of politically and socially motivated outdoor wall paintings
that have been one of Los Angeles' distinctions since the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   It's also a tidy emblem of our always troublesome relationship with
the past. Today the work carries none of the threat it held for those who
angrily rejected it as anti-capitalistic propaganda in 1932. Just as
we're better able to make visual sense of it from a distance of 10 or so
yards, so can we better place it in social perspective from a distance of
seven decades. As it reminds us, the past is inevitably problematical to
know, its true colors hard to ascertain. The best we can hope for is the
proper light for viewing it in the present.</TE>

<LD>Ask the new CEO of Little Tokyo's Japanese American Cultural &amp;
Community Center about cultural fragmentation, and Cora Mirikitani
becomes intense, concerned. Bring up the relationship between art and
society, and hear her passion roar. For 25 years, the 51-year-old arts
administrator has held posts such as developer of cultural programs in
Philadelphia and as director of performing arts and film at the Japan
Society in New York. A current expansion project at the 21-year-old
Little Tokyo center includes 24,000 feet of new space designed by
architect Toyo Ito, a new gallery, renovation of the Aratani Japan
America Theatre, which Mirikitani helped open in a prior posting at the
JACCC during the 1980s, and of the James Irvine Garden, and augmentation
of the center's cultural and educational programs.</LD>
<LD>   What is your charge at the JACCC?</LD>
<LD>   To preserve and present what is good about Japanese culture. We have
to be relevant to the next generations [and] find better ways to think
about doing our own work. How do New York and L.A. differ as art centers?</LD>
<TE>   L.A. is big, messy and diverse--a caldron of creativity. I love New
York. But it's not multicultural like here. New York still has a European
reference. It is more festival, tourism oriented. In L.A. you are in the
caldron with everyone else. The different cultures in L.A. need to
collaborate more. They haven't yet figured out how to do it. Where does
Little Tokyo fit in the caldron?</TE>
<TE>   Little Tokyo is not residential. You have to parachute in. The term
"community" is misleading. It's not just a shopping mall. It's an arm's
throw from City Hall, from the great downtown, from the Music Center. It
is part of East L.A., part of the downtown urban mix and also a
culturally specific destination.</TE>
<TE>   How are artists different from the people who run cultural
organizations?</TE>
<TE>   Artists understand risk and innovation, [but] they are hermetically
sealed away from society. There isn't the structure to bring people of
different sectors together, to discuss things and to learn. We need to
create new institutions that bring together the expertise of business and
art.</TE>
<TE>   How do you think of yourself ethnically?</TE>
<TE>   I was born in Honolulu. I am an American and a Japanese American. On
my first trip to Japan, I was a stranger. I don't speak Japanese. Here, I
have enormous latitude as a woman and a professional in the arts. In
Japan, it was very different.</TE>
<TE>   Why is it important to preserve Japanese culture?</TE>
<TE>   If we don't, who will? Now that Office Depot has moved into Little
Tokyo [and a Starbucks is set to open], is the community doomed to
cultural fragmentation? No, but we have to provide a place to go, a
virtual and a psychic Japanese community. You have to be able to touch
cultural things, to rub against them. To lose that would be a terrible
thing. It is a huge responsibility to preserve culture, to make sure it
is resonant and connecting and honoring.</TE>

<LD>They may be the U.S. Marines, but ghostbusters they're not. Things
still go bump in the night at Las Flores Adobe even though it became part
of Camp Pendleton in 1942. "One night [in 1999] my son was in his
bedroom, which faced the adobe," says Jerome Herrington, property manager
at the site since 1998. "He heard the sound of a horse neighing, but when
he went out, there was no horse or tracks."</LD>
<LD>   Paranormal whinnies are a more recent example of the weird goings-on
rumored at the 142-year-old adobe on the former Rancho Santa Margarita,
which was once part of missions San Juan Capistrano and San Luis Rey.
Nearly a quarter million acres, the ranch was a land grant in 1841 to Pio
Pico, California's last Mexican governor. It was later owned by Pico's
brother-in-law, Don Juan Forster; the now-decayed two-story
Monterey-style adobe was built for Forster's son and daughter-in-law.</LD>
<TE>   According to local legend, a priest was murdered at the site when an
outpost of Mission San Luis Rey stood near the adobe (one variation holds
that the killing was done by local Indians being used as forced labor for
the mission). In "Rancho Santa Margarita Remembered," author Jerome
Baumgartner, great-grandson of Richard O'Neill, who co-owned the ranch
with James Flood in the late 1800s, recounts a family story about two
women who saw a pair of Franciscan monks standing in their room in the
adobe. As the frightened women grabbed each other, the monks said, "Be
calm, my children" and drifted from the room. Elena Patricia Alderete,
niece of Ruth Magee (whose family leased the property from 1888 to 1967
and raised beans on the surrounding land so successfully that one Jane
Magee was known as "The Bean Queen"), visited Las Flores during the 1950s
and '60s, and remembers tales of a female ghost who roamed the building's
upper story. One rumor has it that the woman was a resident who died of a
wasting disease, possibly tuberculosis, on the premises.</TE>
<TE>   Decades ago, property manager (and Boy Scout ranger) Herrington says,
"a marine corporal checking on a sentry who guarded the adobe saw a man
wearing a burlap-colored priest's habit, speaking in a language he
couldn't understand. When he [looked] back, no one was there."</TE>
<TE>   The adobe became a historical landmark in 1968 and is now leased to
the Boy Scouts of America, who camp on the grounds and hope to restore
the building. For years, a favorite weekend retreat was billed as . . .
"Ghost Hunter."</TE>

<LD>It doesn't get much sweeter than Dewar's Family Candy Shop and Ice
Cream Parlor, a Bakersfield institution that pays tribute to the days
when girls swooned at soda jerks. Built in 1928, the long green building
with pink awnings still has its original candy shop and soda fountain
with 26 pink leather stools. "Customers tell us their grandma described
it, and they come back 50 years later and they're amazed that it's
exactly the same," says Paul Pavletich, Dewar's vice president of
marketing.</LD>
<LD>   James Dewar created the company in 1909, and his family still owns the
company. Fourth-generation members make Dewar's candy and ice cream every
day, churning out 50-pound blocks of caramel, fudge, peanut butter or
peanut brittle along with giant taffy pulls and thousands of gallons of
ice cream. The fountain serves floats, malts, shakes, freezes, sundaes
and double banana splits overflowing with syrup and nuts. "We don't make
a sugar-free product," boasts Pavletich. "We haven't changed the
ingredients."</LD>
<TE>   Nor will you see much change in employees: one has been with the
company for 54 years. The shop sells peppermints, lemon candy and
five-pound boxes of chocolate but is most famous for its peanut butter
chews, a sweet white toffee with a homemade peanut butter core. Local
hero and pro football Hall of Famer Frank Gifford is a patron. "It's his
first stop when he comes to town," Pavletich says of Gifford, once a
gridiron star at nearby Bakersfield High School. A framed letter from
Gifford confessing, "I love my peanut butter chews" is proudly displayed
next to a 1911 City of Bakersfield business license. Another Dewar's fan
is California Republican State Sen. Charles Poochigian, who drives 115
miles from Fresno with his wife, Debbie, just for the ice cream. Many
Bakersfield High students still come to Dewar's for the sweets, but
15-year-old Brittany Robertson says she loves the atmosphere. "It takes
me back."</TE>

<LD>In 1982, Eve Faulkner and her husband, Rick, bought a large 1906
home in Upland to foster-parent teenage girls. To repay their church for
helping with the girls, the Faulkners began holding weddings in their
house to raise money. One thing led to another, and soon Eve was putting
on weddings for others, too.</LD>
<LD>   Faulkner's interest in holy matrimony didn't stop there. Brides often
asked about Victorian romantic traditions, and she became fascinated with
the lacy, beaded satin bridal gowns worn from 1835 to 1935, and the
stories of the women who wore them. Around 1990, the attic of the Upland
home became the largest private wedding collection in the Western United
States. The museum traveled to different local venues during the late
1990s, and, in 1999, the Faulkners moved into a pink 1894 cottage in Old
Towne Orange and turned the first floor into the temperature-controlled
House of Victorian Visions Bridal Museum.</LD>
<LD>   Decorated with pink walls, wood floors, lace and velvet curtains,
chandeliers and images of Queen Victoria, the museum houses 50 wedding
gowns and hundreds of artifacts. Tours run $5 to $7.50 and feature a
history lesson given by Faulkner or a costumed docent.</LD>
<TE>   The elaborately constructed gowns (some with detachable bodices and
detachable high necks) were a Victorian bride's best dress and were made
for wearing on other occasions. "Before Queen Victoria, brides would wear
any color," Faulkner says, noting that the antique white satin worn by
the queen at her 1840 nuptials started the tradition of bridal white.</TE>
<TE>   Faulkner has gowns from London, Paris, Shanghai and America, including
some worn during the Civil War, and dresses from the Banning, Hatfield
and McCoy families. Faulkner also displays gowns from the flapper era to
point up how radically fashions have changed. (The museum's restoration
expert and gown designer, Elaine Hartley, has also created wedding gowns
for celebrities.)</TE>
<TE>   Faulkner won't discuss how much she pays for the garments, which she
funds through teaching and speaking engagements. Her husband, a newly
retired LAPD sergeant and watch commander, jokingly asks her if the
museum will ever turn a profit. But for Faulkner, that would merely be
icing on the cake. The point is the dresses and their connection to the
past. "When I buy a dress, I ask for something of the bride's--pictures,
letters, shoes. Each dress has a story to tell," says Faulkner, who hopes
one day to open a women's museum in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "Women in aviation, education, women who crossed the Rockies . . . I
wasn't at all into fashion before I started doing weddings, but I started
learning how what happens in the world affects how we dress, and, in
turn, the way women dress sets the moral temperature of society."</TE>

<DH>'That '80s Show' Makes It Official--the 'Re Decade' Is Back. So
Let's Crank the Boombox, Point the DeLorean Back to the Future and Party
Like It's 1999.</DH>

<LD>Given that there's been a lot going on in the world lately, this
news may have escaped your attention: Finally, belatedly, '80s nostalgia
has arrived.</LD>
<LD>   If you had been watching more closely, the subtle but unmistakable
signs were everywhere. Vintage 100% nylon parachute pants are for sale on
the Internet, and designers' fall lines were full of acid-wash denim and
'80s-style neon colors. Eighties cover bands, including The Breakfast
Club and the DeLoreans, are doing eerily perfect replicas of Duran
Duran's "Rio" and other era classics. A growing number of Web sites with
names such as www.intheeighties.com and www.awesome80s.com are popping up
to offer compendiums of song lyrics and glossaries of period lingo for
those who need guidance about the proper usage of "gag me with a spoon"
and "to the max." "The A-Team" is on cable, and the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art recently concluded a mini-retrospective on '80s
postmodernism. And, of course, Dick Cheney has made a comeback.</LD>
<LD>   But to make things official, that harbinger of pop trends, the Fox
Network, recently debuted a new half-hour sitcom, "That '80s Show," by
the creators of  "That '70s Show." Set in 1984 San Diego--"just one hour
outside of the big dream we call Los Angeles," according to the Fox Web
site--it premiered Jan. 23 to impressive ratings in prime demographic
categories. An estimated 11.4 million total viewers tuned in despite
somewhat less-than-impressive reviews.</LD>
<TE>   You may be asking, "Where's the Beef?" After all, we've been hearing
rumors, predictions and pronouncements of an '80s revival for years--at
least as far back as 1993, when a corporate trend-research firm called
Sputnik pointed to hipster jokes about Members Only jackets and Michael
Jackson as signs of an incipient fad. But compared to previous eras, '80s
retro, as a mass-market trend, took off with the sluggish acceleration of
the original four-cylinder Pontiac Fiero. Some took it as a sign that
perhaps American society's obsession with nostalgia at last had become
passe. Cycles of nostalgia, after all, have been rushing upon us faster
and faster, with shorter and shorter lag times. In the 1950s, Americans
went gaga over Davy Crockett, who'd been dead for more than a century. By
the mid-1970s, we were getting nostalgic about the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   During the actual 1980s, we burned through '60s chic so quickly that,
by mid-decade, you already could go to a dance club in Hollywood for '70s
night and see polyester-clad swingers discoing down to "Fly, Robin, Fly"
and "Love to Love You Baby," reviving a style that had barely made it
into the remainder bins. At that rate, like the feckless lover depicted
in Prince's "Little Red Corvette," '80s pop culture seemed chronically in
danger of running out of gas. A 1998 Roper poll showed that about
one-third of adults under the age of 30 thought of the '80s--their
coming-of-age era--as "the good old days." That doesn't sound too shabby
until you consider that nearly half as many people that age preferred the
'50s, an era before they were even born.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem with '80s retro, perhaps, is that previous waves
of nostalgia have always centered upon a yearning for the seeming naivete
of a simpler age. Fifties hot-rodders and prom queens were an appealing
fantasy for children of the '70s, partly because they didn't have to wait
in long lines for gasoline or grapple with the implications of feminism.
It's a little tricky to work up that sort of warm feeling about the junk
bond traders and corporate-takeover pirates of the '80s, when cynicism
was a virtue and the big event was the Predators' Ball.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the '80s was an era obsessed with ironically
re-interpreting the past, to the extent that Esquire magazine
contemporaneously knocked it as the "Re Decade." It was so heavily retro
that it's a challenge to find something original to recycle. When you try
to imitate Madonna imitating Marilyn Monroe on MTV, the joke gets a
little too incestuous. And much of '80s fashion would be difficult to
replicate, because the JFK-era tuxedo jackets and vintage lace that L.A.
hipsters found at Aardvark's Odd Ark on Melrose Avenue are likely to be
too moth-eaten and tattered for a third go-round. It's little wonder
that, thus far, the '80s have yet to inspire a lovingly meticulous
cinematic homage of the caliber of "American Graffiti." We have to settle
for "The Wedding Singer," which was more about Adam Sandler's vocal
shtick than it was about Reagan-era zeitgeist. (Granted, that guy break
dancing to a gloomy New Order song was an inspired bit of parody.)</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's time to give the '80s another chance. As we find ourselves
in an age in which there's precious little going on that we dare laugh
about, we have to admit that Bananarama is infinitely preferable to
Osamarama. So let's flip up our shirt collars, lace up those
candy-colored L.A. Gear sneakers and brush up on that moonwalking--or, as
the age's poet laureate, Billy Idol, once put it, "It's a nice day to
start agggaiiiiinn!" And once we scrape the jaded patina off a
non-comprehensive sampling of the decade's artifacts, fads and icons,
they do turn out to have a certain goofy charm.</TE>
<TE>   Bad Hair Decade</TE>
<TE>   Mullets, Mousse and Rat-Tails</TE>
<TE>   In recent years the mullet (a.k.a. "hockey hair" or "business in the
front, party in the back") has been lampooned as the classic tacky '80s
male hairstyle, though, in fact, the "bi-level" cut, as it is known in
barbering parlance, seems to have originated back in the '70s with
English rock stars such as Slade and Rod Stewart. (The term "mullet"
didn't come into usage until 1994, by way of the Beastie Boys' song
"Mullet Head.") More distinctly '80s is a close-cropped back that's long
on top, perhaps lacquered into a New Romantic pompadour or teased into a
spiky bristle and bleached, a la Billy Idol. But the mullet's
identification with the 1980s seems unshakable. Los Angeles comedian
Diana Alouise, who cuts the hair of volunteers onstage and thus has
incorporated the mullet into her stage act, sees her efforts as a way to
"get America back to where it was . . . it's an '80s thing."</TE>
<TE>   Another perverse male affectation of the age was a small braid at the
back of the neck, known as the rat-tail, worn most famously by the
members of New Kids on the Block. The messy, multicolored bird's-nest
coiffure popularized by the likes of Cyndi Lauper and Madonna achieved
its aerodynamically improbable configurations with the help of a new
product, styling mousse, first developed in Europe and introduced in the
United States in early 1984 by L'Oreal. The foamy fixative became an
overnight sensation, achieving $250 million in sales the first year.
Trendy African Americans affected Jheri curls, a bouncy mass of ringlets
named after Jheri Redding, a hair-product mogul. If you were willing to
sleep in a plastic cap and apply copious amounts of hair oil, you could
achieve the look worn by L.A. Clippers forward Michael Cage and Michael
Jackson, whose chemically enhanced coiffure caught fire during the
filming of a Pepsi commercial at Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Fashion Faux Pas</TE>
<TE>   Members Only, Bugle Boy and L.A. Gear</TE>
<TE>   At the dawn of the decade, an obscure company called Europe Craft
Imports revolutionized the men's outerwear market with a tight-fitting
shiny cotton jacket, adorned with a throat latch, snap epaulets and, most
important, a small but conspicuous "Members Only" tag over the left
breast pocket. True, there was a certain inherent paradox to a $65
mass-market product, available in two dozen hues, whose name spoke of
exclusivity.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't seem to faze the typical '80s Lothario, who appreciated a
design that allowed the flipped-up collar of his Polo shirt to remain
fashionably visible while retro-dancing to Motown classics at Crush Club
Continental on North Cahuenga Boulevard or waiting in line outside L.A.'s
other hot '80s singles scenes. (No wonder that a couple of decades later,
singer Sheryl Crow would lyrically observe: "He seems to be stuck in the
'80s/He wears his Members Only jacket/'cause he thinks it turns on all
the ladies.") Scrunched-up (as opposed to rolled-up) sleeves were
mandatory. Members Only jackets were in such demand that, by 1984,
counterfeiters were selling $5 million worth of phony ones a year.</TE>
<TE>   The origin of the leg warmers fad is a little less clear. One
historical source suggests that the bunched-up tube of knitted cotton, a
traditional bit of ballet garb, first emerged as an everyday accessory
during the frigid East Coast winter of 1981-1982, when women started
wearing them under their slacks. Others suspect it was the influence of
"Jane Fonda's Workout," the 1982 video whose cover showed the
actress-turned-fitness maven flexing her cotton-enshrouded gastrocnemius
muscles. In any case, leg warmer sales rose more than 340% that year,
according to Forbes magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Leg warmers were the first inkling of fitness fashion, in which
leotards and baggy sweatshirts--slipping off one shoulder, as worn by
"Flashdance" actress Jennifer Beals--became acceptable street wear,
creating the illusion that women were continually headed to, or coming
back from, an aerobics studio. In L.A., where that wasn't necessarily an
illusion, exercise fanatics had by 1985 taken to wearing two or three
pairs of leg warmers at a time, in varying colors.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most inexplicable fashion trend of the late '80s was
acid-wash denim, an Italian invention whose name was a bit misleading.
Instead of soaking jeans in acid, clothing makers put them in giant
washers, along with pumice stones soaked in bleach, for three to four
hours at a time. The tumbling created random spots and streaks on the
garments, giving them a sort of factory-reject look that teens and young
adults found irresistibly chic. It was the start of the "distressed"
look--strategically battered, tattered and ripped--pushed by clothing
makers Z. Cavaricci and Guess (though Jordache's 1987 "No Exit" apparel
line also had a Kevorkian-esque catchiness to it). By decade's end, as a
legal spat erupted over patent rights to the acid-wash process, the craze
finally began to, ahem, show some wear.</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, Chatsworth-based clothing manufacturer Bugle Boy, inspired by
Michael Jackson's hardware-laden wardrobe, dreamed up tight-fitting
parachute pants, which were made of nylon and decorated with multiple
zippers. The style caught on, supposedly because the slippery texture was
ideal for break dancing. Demand mushroomed so fast that in 1983 and 1984,
Bugle Boy and a single retailer, Merry Go Round, had the fad all to
themselves. They sold 10 million pairs in a single year.</TE>
<TE>   Then, just as Bugle Boy was scrambling to corner the market on
Taiwanese nylon twill, the fashion winds shifted. Bugle Boy was stuck
with thousands of pairs of the suddenly dorky pants, which it was forced
to dump for as little as a quarter a pair. Today you can buy a pair on
the Internet for $46.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, there's the quintessential '80s footwear, L.A. Gear
sneakers. The Marina del Rey-based brand was founded in 1986 by Robert
Greenberg, a multitalented impresario who once made $3 million in three
months peddling E.T.-themed shoelaces. While Nike and Adidas shoes were
functional, L.A. Gear shoes were all about fashion. One model came in
gold lame, while others had punk-rock style chains. With celebrity
spokespeople such as Paula Abdul, Belinda Carlisle and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, L.A. Gear quickly became the No. 3 sneaker brand in America
behind Nike and Reebok.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, the company tried to put itself over the top with "Bad," a
black buckle-laden shoe endorsed by Jackson. "Bad" turned out to be as
popular among teenagers as the nasty principal in "Ferris Bueller's Day
Off." L.A. Gear tried to convince trendoids that the next wave in
athletic shoes involved lots of clunky hardware, but it ended up losing
millions.</TE>
<TE>   Hell on Wheels</TE>
<TE>   DeLoreans, Yugos and Pontiac Fieros</TE>
<TE>   The '70s, which spawned such oddities as the egg-shaped AMC Pacer, is
difficult to challenge as the weirdest automotive era ever. But the '80s
had no shortage of doomed automotive experiments.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, former General Motors wunderkind-turned-independent car
manufacturer John Z. DeLorean--backed by the British government and
celebrity investors such as Sammy Davis Jr. and Johnny Carson--unveiled
the DMC-12, a high-end sports car that became known simply as "The
DeLorean." Produced at a factory in strife-torn Northern Ireland, the
innovative vehicle featured a stainless-steel body (that was designed to
stay rust-free forever), gull-wing doors and a glass-reinforced plastic
undercarriage. The DeLorean's rear-mounted V-6 engine enabled it to go
from zero to 60 mph in eight seconds, but at a pricey $26,000--the
equivalent of $60,000 today--sales sputtered. Fewer than 9,000 of the
cars were built before the company went out of business in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   DeLorean, too, suffered a peculiarly 1980s fate. He was accused of
selling $24 million worth of cocaine to raise funds for his struggling
plant, but he eventually was acquitted after arguing that federal agents
had entrapped him. The DeLorean car--which probably achieved its greatest
acceptance as Michael J. Fox's time machine in the 1985 hit "Back to the
Future" and its sequels--continues to have a cult following. A
Chatsworth-based company, DeLorean One, bills itself as "the world's
largest source for DeLorean parts, service and accessories."</TE>
<TE>   The same year that DeLorean became defunct, GM launched the Pontiac
Fiero, whose innovative design featured an all-plastic body and an engine
in the middle of the chassis. One hundred thousand of the stylish
two-seaters were sold during the first model year. Unfortunately, the car
that was supposed to turn Pontiac into GM's "excitement division" didn't
quite live up to its hype. In an effort to contain costs, GM put an
underpowered four-cylinder engine in the Fiero--it looked like a sports
car but performed like a subcompact. Its lack of power steering caused
some drivers to complain that it was hard to handle. In addition, early
Fieros suffered from other glitches, including cooling fans that had been
wired backward, sucking heat back into the engine. Some of the flaws were
later corrected, but the Fiero became a casualty of company political
struggles and was discontinued in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   No one ever suggested that the Yugo was innovative, except maybe in
terms of price, but it was the only Serbian-made car ever sold in
America. "What do you expect for $4,000?" a headline in the trade
newspaper Automotive Industries once asked rhetorically. Slapped together
by hand by $1-per-hour workers, the boxy vehicles were so shabby that
shortly after their 1985 U.S. debut, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration judged the Yugo to have the worst crash performance of any
car it had tested. The car's underwhelming performance inspired scores of
jokes ("What do you call a Yugo at the top of a hill? A mirage." And "Why
do Yugos come with heated rear windows? To keep your hands warm while
you're pushing").</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturer's U.S. subsidiary went bankrupt in 1991, and the
factory where the cars were built was damaged by U.S. bombs during the
Kosovo conflict in 1999. A few years ago, students at the Manhattan
School of Visual Arts took 39 junked Yugos and converted them for
innovative new uses, including a church confessional and a portable
toilet.</TE>
<TE>   The Box Boom</TE>
<TE>   Kaypro, Pac-Man and the Helix Wheely 5000</TE>
<TE>   Though personal computers made their debut in the late '70s, that
didn't stop Time magazine from picking the PC instead of a human as
person of the year (well, "machine of the year") in 1982. Once the
computer's supposedly miraculous labor-saving qualities freed the human
mind from drudgery, Time wondered, "will it race off in pursuit of
important ideas or lazily spend its time on more video games?"</TE>
<TE>   Today, such ruminations may seem hopelessly quaint in an age when
subsequent technological advances enable us to almost effortlessly
download Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee's honeymoon video. Back then, the
technological cutting edge was the Kaypro II, which displayed
headache-inducing fluorescent green characters on a nine-inch screen. The
Kaypro's microprocessor ran at a snail's-pace 2.5 megahertz and stored
information on pancake-sized floppy disks instead of a hard drive. The
CP/M operating system required users to type in cryptic commands ("PIP
B:=A:DB*.*" for example) rather than click on an icon. "Domo arigato, Mr.
Roboto," indeed.</TE>
<TE>   The portable personal stereo, better known as the boombox, actually
first appeared on the consumer electronics market in the late '70s. But
by 1980, when nearly 8 million of them were sold, they had become a
deafening presence on city sidewalks across America. "My radio, believe
me, I like it loud," LL Cool J rapped in 1985. "I'm the man with a box
that can rock the crowd/Walkin' down the street, to the hard-core
beat/While my JVC vibrates the concrete . . ."</TE>
<TE>   Boomboxes grew in size, as larger speakers, tape decks, 10-band
equalizers, flashing disco lights and even burglar alarms were added to
their design. Helix's Wheely 5000, produced in 1989, was perhaps the
largest boombox ever, at 3 feet wide and 2 feet tall. It weighed a
clavicle-crushing 41 pounds when loaded with 10 D batteries. It could be
wheeled behind an owner who wasn't quite macho enough to carry it.</TE>
<TE>   As legend has it, pioneering video game designer Tohru Iwatani looked
at the empty space in a pizza after he'd removed a slice and got the
inspiration for a game that stood out from Asteroids, Space Invaders and
others on the market. In 1980, Iwatani's employer, Namco, and its
partner, Bally Midway Manufacturing Co., unveiled the first video game
featuring an identifiable character--a yellow circle who crawled up and
down the pathways of a maze eating dots of light and fruit before he
himself was consumed by pursuing ghosts. The character initially was
dubbed Puck-man, but after the uncomfortable proximity to an
English-language expletive was noted, its name was changed to Pac-Man.</TE>
<TE>   Pac-Man was an instant hit in arcades across America, and the
manufacturers sold 100,000 games in the first year alone. Within two
years, Pac-Man had spawned an animated show, merchandise such as Pac-Man
air fresheners and whoopee cushions, and even a female companion, Ms.
Pac-Man. By 1984 the fad was starting to fade, but Pac-Man was eventually
revived in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Electro-Pap Playlist</TE>
<TE>   Wham!, Wang Chung and A Flock of Seagulls</TE>
<TE>   While the biggest hits of '80s music still get considerable airplay
two decades later--songs by Madonna, Michael Jackson, Prince, U2 and
others--the works of the Little River Band and Night Ranger have receded
into the mist. But from the theme to "Chariots of Fire" to Depeche Mode's
paeans to nihilistic angst to Bruce Springsteen's "Dancing in the Dark,"
there's one unifying characteristic in the diverse styles--that odd,
unnatural pulsating quality. Think of it as the aural equivalent of creme
brulee made with aspartame.</TE>
<TE>   Electronic synthesizers date back to the mid-1950s, but not until the
late 1970s did English pop musicians begin using the synthesizer, rather
than the guitar or piano, as their main instrument. The electronic
gadgetry could be programmed to mimic any conventional musical
instrument--or to play faster and more intricately. In January 1982,
"Don't You Want Me," by the all-electronic group Human League, was the
first example of synthpop to top the U.S. charts.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, beneath the digital bombast often lurked a deep
reservoir of genuine emotional pain. For some, that pain may have
followed the indignity of appearing on "Solid Gold," a popular, albeit
bizarre, syndicated TV series in which musical acts had to compete for
attention with a ventriloquist's dummy and a bevy of voluptuous dancers
in skimpy spandex. One performer who stood out, though, was singer Dale
Bozzio of Missing Persons, whose metallic spacesuits and Plexiglas
undergarments underscored her squeaky, affectedly mechanical New Wave
music.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the aural pyrotechnics of '80s rock, it was easy to miss the
poeticism of lyrics such as "I smell like I sound" (Duran Duran, "Hungry
Like the Wolf"), "Everybody Wang Chung tonight" (Wang Chung, "Everybody
Have Fun Tonight") and "Time can never mend/The careless whispers of a
good friend" (Wham!, "Careless Whispers").</TE>
<TE>   Some of those fine '80s tunes found their way into advertising
campaigns, creating remarkable juxtapositions of culture and commerce.
Lionel Richie's "Stuck on You" put a distinctive beat to a commercial for
dishwashing detergent. Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy" became
not only the musical mantra for Alamo rental cars, but also for the
policies of the first President Bush. And the U.S. Dairy Board used Adam
Ant's "Goody Two Shoes" to sell milk.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the way you have your hair," sang--somewhat
disingenuously--that early '80s sensation, A Flock of Seagulls. The
band's trademark was hairdresser-turned-musician Mike Score's
Chinese-crested coiffure. The band was one of the first successful
haircut bands, whose appearance was as crucial as its sound. (Photos from
the band's recent revival tour, disappointingly, show Score in a baseball
cap and goatee, as if he had been trying to evoke the '90s Seattle grunge
scene instead.)</TE>
<TE>   Towering hair also played a key role in the late-1980s halcyon days of
heavy metal, when bands such as Poison, Megadeth and Anthrax dominated
the album-sales charts. The latter group, whose works include 1985's
"Spreading the Disease" and 1987's "Among the Living," recently
acknowledged on its official Web site that its name now seems "not so
cool" in the wake of recent bioterrorism attacks. Fortunately, Anthrax
coped by joining with Judas Priest to stage the "Operation: Enduring
Metal" tour. Remember, if we can't enjoy our favorite '80s rock songs
about mass destruction and carnage, then the terrorists really will have
won.</TE>
<TE>Great Moments of the 1980s</TE>
<TE>   1980</TE>
<TE>   Ayatollah Khomeini is America's most wanted evildoer, though in
retrospect he seems no more threatening than Barney the lovable  purple
dinosaur. So that they can keep "Who Shot J.R.?" a secret, the producers
of "Dallas" shoot footage of each cast member committing the act, and
delay their decision until shortly before the November 1980 episode in
which the killer is revealed.</TE>
<TE>   1981</TE>
<TE>   Comedian Andy  Kaufman instigates  a brawl on "Fridays," ABC's pallid
clone of "Saturday Night Live," by throwing a glass of water on future
"Seinfeld" star Michael Richards. Janet Cooke wins journalism's highest
honor, the Pulitzer Prize, for a fictional account  of a school-age
heroin user. Children's TV activists criticize "The Smurfs" as sexist
because  "the show has only one Smurfette."</TE>
<TE>   1982</TE>
<TE>   Out of a toy manufacturer's concern that E.T. was "ugly," the first
generation of licensed dolls doesn't much resemble the homely alien.
Cowboy boots become inexplicably popular in Los Angeles. l First
liposuction performed in North America. The lite-rock group Toto wins
five Grammy Awards, guaranteeing that the strains of "Rosanna" will be
heard in  elevators for decades to come.</TE>
<TE>   1983</TE>
<TE>   Pity the fool who missed the explosive debut of NBC's "The  A-Team,"
starring the irascible Mr. T. ABC airs a made-for-TV movie, "Intimate
Agony," about herpes. Prince releases lascivious "1999" album. l
Sylvester Stallone directs John Travolta in "Saturday Night Fever" sequel
"Staying Alive." Alas, disappointing box office forestalls any hopes of a
Tony Manero trilogy.</TE>
<TE>   1984</TE>
<TE>   "My fellow Americans. I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed
legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five
minutes," says President Ronald Reagan, during the sound-check for his
weekly radio address. Apple Computer airs an Orwellian-styled "1984" ad
in which a woman liberates  en-slaved masses by tossing a hammer into a
screen depiction of Bill Gates--er, Big Brother.</TE>
<TE>   1985</TE>
<TE>   Mikhail S. Gorbachev gives up on concealing the birthmark on his head,
which had been airbrushed from official photos of the leader. Some
interpret this as a sign of increasing  Soviet openness. Stallone as
Rambo averages one killing every two minutes and six seconds of film. (A
breakdown, by mode of demise: 15 gunshots, 14 arrows, 3 explosions, 3
burns, 2 strangulations, 2 helicopter attacks.)</TE>
<TE>   1986</TE>
<TE>   Junk bond king Michael S. Milken, flush with success, reportedly
invests in  a more upscale toupee. Hands Across America organizers coax
millions of people into a human chain across the U.S., from New York to
Long Beach. The line gets sparse around Arkansas, but they raise $34
million for the homeless. Spy magazine dubs New York developer Donald
Trump the "short-fingered vulgarian."</TE>
<TE>   1987</TE>
<TE>   Iran-Contra scandal  figure Lt. Col. Oliver North's secretary, Fawn
Hall, denies an accusation that she smuggled sensitive documents out of
the White House by stuffing them  in her bra. Rumors spread that Michael

Diminutive presidential candidate Michael S. Dukakis dons a helmet and

<HD>The Quest for Cool</HD>
<DH>Art Center Alumnus Freeman Thomas Helped Design Volkswagen's New
Beetle and Conceived the Innovative Audi TT. But Can His Passionate
Designs Steer Struggling Chrysler Out of Dullsville?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Preston Lerner</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Freeman Thomas is bombing down the express lane of the 405. As
DaimlerChrysler's vice president of advanced product design strategy,
you'd expect him to be driving a company car--a Chrysler sedan, say, or a
Dodge pickup, or a Jeep Wrangler like the one he uses every day back home
in Michigan. Instead, his once-a-month visit to the company's advanced
design center in Carlsbad finds him in a generic rental car, and he's not
happy about it. Not because the econobox is beneath him. Not because it
makes horrible thrashing noises when he nails the accelerator. Not even
because it reeks of air freshener. But because it's so, well, cheesy.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not a bad car," he says. "It drives well. It's got decent power.
The exterior's not offensive. But this interior . . . ." He looks
exasperated. No, disappointed. He traces the top of the dashboard. "Look
at this slope, like it's been melted by the sun. Look at all these
different shapes! If they'd chosen one shape and repeated it, the
interior would have looked a thousand times more disciplined. I don't
mind that the sun visor doesn't have a clip. That's to save money. But
all these different textures? That's not about cost. That's about
somebody falling asleep at the wheel."</LD>
<TE>   Two years ago, the high-energy, high-concept, high-profile Thomas was
hired to change the direction of Chrysler's once-mighty design department
and conceive a new generation of unconventional vehicles that would put
the troubled company back in the black. Thomas, a Long Beach native and
graduate of the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, was coming off
a pair of stunning design triumphs. In 1994, he and J Mays--now the
design chief at Ford--created the whimsical Concept One show car that
morphed into Volkswagen's oh-so-cute, my-how-chic New Beetle. The next
year, he almost single-handedly produced the slick Audi TT, embodying a
cool, rational Bauhaus sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas' fusion of sunny Southern California playfulness and austere
European classicism has fueled a meteoric rise to industry celebrity. A
little more than a decade ago, after a stint at Porsche, he was a
self-employed designer making ends meet by teaching part time and
contributing styling analyses to a fledgling car magazine. Today he's one
of the world's hottest automotive designers at a time when designers have
never enjoyed more prominence or influence. Now he hopes to use his
position at Chrysler as a bully pulpit to promote a fresh approach to
design that's as much about marketing and brand image as it is about
styling.</TE>
<TE>   "In other companies, designers are basically handed a package and
told, 'Here. Put a pretty body on it,' " Thomas explains. "The way we do
it, I'm responsible for creating the architecture. I work very closely
with the advanced vehicle engineers. I work very closely with the
production car studios. I work very closely with marketing. I work very
closely with PR to come up with names and design the press packages, all
the way down to the typography and the script for the videos. It all has
to work together. At the end of the day, design is about communication."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas oversees three advanced design studios, two in Michigan and the
third in Carlsbad, creating products for the Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep
brands. Although he still does some hands-on design work, he focuses
mainly on the big picture. "He's an amazing ideas man," says Jeff Teague,
who worked with him at the Volkswagen/Audi design studio in Simi Valley.
"He loves playing ideas volleyball. But he's frustrating to play with
because he always beats you. No matter how good your idea is, he always
comes up with something better. He's a golden asset for Chrysler. He
understands how to strengthen a brand by building on its heritage. I
think he'll put new life into Jeep, for example, and make it an icon for
generations to come."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas is 44 years old, with a wife and a 10-year-old daughter, yet
there's still something of the kid about him. Despite a few gray hairs,
he has a pudgy face that gives him a vaguely cherubic quality. But his
apparent youthfulness is more a function of his live-wire personality
than his boyish looks. He's got pep, lots of it, and when he really gets
going, he can be almost manic, the words flowing in such torrents that he
occasionally stutters over them.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing energizes Thomas more than cars. "Freeman's the most
enthusiastic car guy I've ever met," says Dave Cole, another alum of the
VW/Audi studio in Simi Valley. "He has gasoline for blood. He eats,
drinks and sleeps cars. They're his life. I don't think I've ever met
anybody who knows more about cars, who's more fanatical about them. His
head is so full of information that he's a walking encyclopedia. When he
gets started talking about cars, he just can't stop."</TE>
<TE>   The express lane ends, and Thomas reluctantly merges with traffic on
the 405. (He's an assertive driver who travels with a pair of stringback
driving gloves like the ones Grand Prix champion Stirling Moss used to
wear.) As he inches along, he passes judgment on the sheet metal crowding
in around him: Thumbs-up for the new Nissan Altima. Mild thumbs-down for
the Porsche Boxster. Major thumbs-up for a 1957 Chrysler Imperial with
heroic tailfins. But he saves his biggest grin for a New Beetle scooting
past in the next lane.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel really good when I see people using the flower vase," he says.
"When I did the original sketch of the vase, J and I created a debate
about it in the studio. Everybody else said it was foolish, it was
stupid, it was unnecessary. J and I looked at each other and said, 'It's
going in!' We knew it was the gimmick that everybody would talk about.
The history of the Beetle gave the vase credibility, and the vase gave
the car a sense of humanity. These small successes are so cool."</TE>
<TE>   The New Beetle revived VW's fortunes by conferring a vigorous new
image upon a company that had all but fallen off American radar screens.
Now Thomas is being asked to give Chrysler a similar make-over. It won't
be easy. The company has lost more than $3 billion over the past 18
months, and despite merging with German giant Daimler-Benz in 1998,
Chrysler remains the weakest sister of the Big Three U.S. auto makers.
Also, Thomas is an outsider with no experience with the byzantine
politics endemic to that industry. On the other hand, he speaks German
fluently, and he understands the Teutonic suits that Daimler-Benz
exported to run Chrysler.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got the right tool kit, and he speaks the right languages," says
Jim Hall, vice president of AutoPacific, a firm that tracks the
automobile industry. "He's also a realistic designer, which means he
knows how to come up with vehicles that appeal to the public without
being obscenely expensive to manufacture. But he's got a tough job ahead
of him at DaimlerChrysler. We'll just have to wait and see if he can make
a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Harley Earl is the father of american car design. A flamboyant,
larger-than-life character partial to two-tone paint jobs and linen
suits, he cut his teeth fashioning custom bodywork for Hollywood stars of
the silent era. In 1927, he joined General Motors and put together the
world's first centralized automobile design department. While running
GM's design staff like a feudal despot, he essentially invented the
concept car, the full-size clay model and, yes, the tailfin.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Earl went the way of his chrome chariots, it was possible
to earn a degree in transportation design. Art Center was then, and
remains, the most prominent of the schools catering to would-be
automotive stylists; its grads run or have run the design studios of GM,
Ford, Chrysler and several European and Japanese auto makers. Yet it was
something of a secret sect, known only to initiates, and Thomas had never
heard of it until he stumbled across a reference in Road &amp; Track after
finishing a four-year stint as a flight-line firefighter in the Air
Force.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea you could earn a living drawing cars," he recalls. "So
I got the address and I went up there, and it was a revelation--like
finding your home. I said, 'God, I've got to get in here!' I didn't have
a portfolio; I had no art or design training at all. So I took a night
class in industrial design to build a portfolio, and during those three
months, I worked like a madman because I wanted to get in so bad."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas is the second of two children born to a career Air Force
enlisted man and the German woman he'd married while he was stationed
overseas. He can't remember a time when he wasn't fascinated by cars, and
after the family settled in Southern California--the cradle of hot-rod
civilization--his mania ripened into clinical automotive dementia. "We
spent our afternoons riding around the neighborhood on our Sting Rays
[bikes] looking at cool cars," recalls Jeff Zwart, who grew up with
Thomas in Cypress and now directs car commercials. "If we knew somebody
had a Porsche, we'd sit outside his house for hours just to hear it drive
up when he came home from work."</TE>
<TE>   At Art Center, Thomas immediately established himself as a standout
student, winning the scholarship he needed to pay for tuition. Porsche
hired him as a designer right out of school. (Actually, the company tried
to hire him before he graduated, but a professor persuaded him to get his
degree.) The pay was so parsimonious that he lived for years like a
starving artist, sleeping on a mattress on the floor in a tiny apartment
in Germany. Still, it was a dream job for a fresh-faced newbie with a
magnificent obsession for Porsches.</TE>
<TE>   Not only was Thomas working on the sort of exquisitely engineered
machinery that was his personal inspiration--he now owns two vintage 911s
and a 1956 Speedster--but he also got a chance to try his hand at design
projects ranging from forklifts to auto show displays. "I love the idea
of inventing a product," he says. "It doesn't matter what it is. Whether
it's a car or a piece of furniture, you've got a beacon of light, and
you're showing people the way."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, as Thomas was learning his craft in Germany, automotive
designers in the United States were being marginalized as never before.
In the wake of the fuel crises of the '70s, the Big Three were fighting a
losing battle with Japanese and European auto makers for domestic market
share. With bean counters running the show, aesthetic excellence was the
first casualty of war. But as the '80s gave way to the '90s, it became
clear that consumers wanted more than bare-bones transportation. With
this realization, American designers started getting some respect.
Besides being lionized by the media, rising stars were aggressively
courted by rival car makers hoping to catch lightning in a bottle.</TE>
<TE>   "In an era when the competition is greater than ever, design is the
most important differentiator in the marketplace," says David Cole,
president of the Center for Automotive Research. Adds Chris Cedergren,
the founder of Nextrend, a market research firm: "If you build practical
commodities that get consumers from Point A to Point B, you can make five
cents per vehicle. But if you want to make real money in this business,
you have to generate passion. And you generate passion with design."</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler was Exhibit A. After a decade spent cranking out K-cars and
minivans with all the sex appeal of farm implements, the company hit pay
dirt in the '90s with a stylish line of "cab-forward" sedans and a
dynamic series of muy macho pickup trucks. But by the end of the decade,
Chrysler products were again looking a bit dowdy. "I was hired to shake
the place up," Thomas says. "Design had stabilized and, in some cases,
stagnated. Some of the stuff was very, very good, but some of it got old
very quickly. My philosophical approach has always been more timeless: I
try to extract the engineering foundation out of an idea. If a design is
based purely on style, it's not going to stand the test of time."</TE>
<TE>   The first batch of Thomas-inspired concept cars debuted last year to
mixed reviews. The Willys, a robust variation on the Jeep theme, was a
hit, but the throwback Dodge Super8 Hemi was widely savaged. "We'll never
see it in production--I hope," says Robert Cumberford, a GM designer
under Harley Earl who's now the automotive design editor at Automobile
magazine. "It represented a terrible misunderstanding of what '50s cars
were all about."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Kellogg, who shared a design practice with Thomas in Irvine, also
questions the timelessness of his former partner's vision. "Freeman
respects tradition, but he's not very conservative," says Kellogg, who's
best known for his work on the seminal Studebaker Avanti. "He's
high-intensity, like the new headlights. He's a rap musician. His
products have attitude, and that's what people want these days."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas is remarkably sanguine about criticism. "When the TT debuted,
it was very controversial. At the Frankfurt show, Larry Shinoda told me
it was butt-ugly," Thomas recalls, referring to the late design legend
credited with the original Corvette Sting Ray. "But I'm not afraid of
controversy. Now, I'm the front man for my design team. It's my job to
put my head on the chopping block."</TE>
<TE>   The DaimlerChrysler Pacifica Advanced Product Design Center is located
in a nondescript building in a faceless industrial park more or less in
the middle of nowhere--the perfect spot for a facility where all the good
stuff is strictly off-limits to prying eyes. This is where Chrysler's
most speculative designs originate. ("Answers to questions that haven't
been asked," says Thomas, paraphrasing the tag line of his employer's new
image campaign.) Designers sit on one side of the building, engineers on
the other. Between them, forming the spiritual and physical core of the
center, is the large, open studio where alternative visions of the
automotive future take shape.</TE>
<TE>   This particular Friday, the main attraction is a full-size model of
one of the three concept cars Thomas' advanced design team created for
the North American International Auto Show in Detroit a few weeks
earlier. The Dodge Razor is a sleek slice of silver whose sweeping roof
line recalls the Audi TT. Surrounded by bold, futuristic renderings and
bathed in the artificial white light of science-fiction movies, it is the
dream machine supreme, an otherworldly styling exercise that may--but
probably won't--make it into production.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas is riffing about the Razor, and the air is thick with
designspeak--A lines, B pillars, door systems, millennials, authenticity,
credibility, "inventing a new market segment," "creating a new design
language," "igniting enthusiasm for the brand." "Each concept car is its
own movie," he says, warming to a favorite theme. "Each one has its own
cast of characters and its own script. The Willys2 is a movie about
adventure. The Razor is a movie about youth."</TE>
<TE>   It's not hard to imagine Thomas as a screenwriter at a pitch meeting.
Although he wears the button-down uniform required of all DaimlerChrysler
executives in Auburn Hills, he's dressed down for his monthly visit to
Pacifica in a black polo shirt, faded blue jeans, silver-tipped belt,
black Armani eyeglasses and trendy Kenneth Cole bowling shoes. Behind
him, several Pacifica designers--"Freeman's all-stars," one of them
jokes--form a silent chorus. "Come on," he pleads, eager to share the
spotlight. "You guys can jump in here any time."</TE>
<TE>   Later, while he munches on a sandwich in a conference room, Thomas
acknowledges that he's a manager these days, not a wide-eyed kid with a
portfolio bursting with wild ideas. He likens himself to a coach, a
general, an editor who pares ideas down to their essence. He's less
concerned now with the radius of a voluptuous fender than he is with
visualizing so-called segment-busters that redefine the minivan or the
station wagon or the sports car. But he still sketches constantly. He
travels everywhere with a notebook filled with graph paper, and he cranks
out elaborate renderings in 15 minutes with a purple Pilot and a gray
marker. The TT concept was sold to Audi execs on the basis of a purple
sketch he tossed off on a 5-by-4-inch piece of scrap paper. "I still get
down in the trenches," he insists.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a single car in there that I haven't worked on myself."
He pulls a notebook out of his briefcase and opens it to a purple sketch
detailing his own thoughts on the Razor. Nevertheless, the days when one
of his drawings could make it to the concept stage, much less to the
assembly line, are probably gone forever. "I'd be taking an opportunity
away from one of my designers," he explains. "I want them to be the
heroes."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the sketches, his notebook also contains his musings on
subjects ranging from potential car names to the signature qualities of
the three marquees that compose the Chrysler Group. "Chrysler is East
Coast," he says. "It's the American who goes to Europe and knows all the
good restaurants. It's Steve McQueen in 'The Thomas Crown Affair.' It's
the intellectual American. Dodge is the All-American. It's Midwest and
West Coast. It's about Route 66. It's about the drive-in movie. The Jeep
is the vehicle that crosses the Rubicon. It pulls people out of holes. It
was born on the mountain and it came down to the city. It's the pure
American."</TE>
<TE>   To make sure the company's next generation of products reflects these
distinct personae, Thomas has at his disposal 20 of Chrysler's lean cadre
of 55 designers. (Ford and GM have about 300 each.) Most of their ideas
never get beyond the proverbial gleam in the eye. Others grow into scale
models before they're abandoned. The survivors are nurtured into
full-scale models for in-house consumption. Even if they never get public
scrutiny, they help refine the styling cues for the vehicles that make it
into showrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The best and brightest of Thomas' ideas eventually become concept
cars. These one-of-a-kind dream machines, typically built at the
Gaffoglio Family Metalcrafters shop in Fountain Valley, then make the
rounds of the auto-show circuit. If the response is positive enough, and
if the numbers make financial sense, a concept car can be modified for
production. (The Dodge Viper and 2004 Dodge Crossfire are two examples.)
If not, well then, back to the drawing board.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas' trio of 2002 concept cars played exceptionally well at the
Detroit show. Still, he says, don't expect vehicles derived primarily
from the work of his team to reach showrooms until 2004 at the earliest.
But when they do, he promises, they won't be hard to recognize. "We're
going to catch the competition by surprise," he says. "We're not going to
do the cookie-cutter vehicles that everybody else does. Even a mainstream
vehicle like the next minivan is going to be a segment-buster. That's why
having really clever designers is so important. Marketers can talk about
creating segment-busters. But only designers can see them."</TE>
<TE>   Asked to describe what the final designs look like, Thomas falls
uncharacteristically silent. Then he shuts his notebook and carefully
slips it into his briefcase. After all, he wouldn't want his crystal ball
to fall into the wrong hands.</TE>

<HD>Taking a Life</HD>
<DH>Joseph Luna Was Convicted 17 Years Ago of Killing a Fellow
Prisoner. Now a State Corrections  Official Has Stepped Forward to Say
Luna Acted in Self-Defense and Should Be Set Free.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED DICKEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is what the record shows: On June 24, 1984, Joseph Hernandez
Luna murdered Clifford Flores. The two Los Angeles men were fighting in
the exercise yard of Soledad State Prison when Luna jabbed a pointed
stick into Flores' throat, severing his carotid artery. Flores bled to
death. On April 25, 1985, Luna--an armed robber with about a year left on
his term--was convicted of second-degree murder in Monterey County and
sentenced to 17 years to life. The record was then closed and Luna
disappeared deeper into prison, perhaps there to die, certainly to be
forgotten.</LD>
<LD>   But there was another record, one that remained unknown for almost 18
years.</LD>
<LD>   I never knew Joe Luna existed until his name was blurted out to me one
day late last year by John L. Jackson, a 21-year veteran of the
California Department of Corrections and now a supervisor of academic
instruction for the department at its Sacramento headquarters. We were
finishing a telephone interview on another topic and had almost reached
goodbye when Jackson said, "You know, there's something that happened
almost 20 years ago that's been bothering me. There was a guy at Soledad
named Joe Luna who was getting out of ad-seg [administrative
segregation], and he came before a classification committee that I was
on."</LD>
<TE>   Administrative segregation is a term for the separation of inmates
from the general prison population--generally because they need
protection or are accused of a prison infraction, sometimes by other
inmates. Before being returned to the "mainline" population, they appear
before the committee, which determines where they should be housed next.
Jackson explained that he often sat on the panel as a representative of
the education department. "Luna said to us that he couldn't go back on
the mainline. He said, 'If you send me back out there, I'm gonna get
killed, or I'm gonna have to kill someone.' Or words like that. The guy
in charge, George Smith, asked him, 'Who's trying to kill you?' Luna said
he couldn't tell him. So Smith sent him back to the mainline."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson paused. I waited. "A couple of days later, Luna killed a man
in the yard, just like he told us might happen."</TE>
<TE>   "So what are you saying, John?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm saying Luna had a legal right to be protected, and Smith knew
that. He also knew that Luna couldn't give him names. That would have
made him a snitch, and if or when word got out, that would have been
Luna's death warrant for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson paused again. "That man [Luna] acted in self-defense. He
shouldn't be in prison. I think he's an innocent man."</TE>
<TE>   The name George Smith was familiar to me. He had ended his career as
warden at Corcoran State Prison from 1992 to 1996, a period of so much
staff violence against inmates that the state and the FBI investigated.
Smith was accused of lax management. He invoked the 5th Amendment before
a grand jury and the California Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   I started to question Jackson. Did he know Luna?</TE>
<TE>   "Never saw him before or since."</TE>
<TE>   Why didn't Jackson or the two others on the committee speak up?</TE>
<TE>   "You didn't cross George Smith. He dominated people."</TE>
<TE>   What should have been done?</TE>
<TE>   "When an inmate says he's in danger and asks for protection, you have
to give it to him. That's regulations."</TE>
<TE>   Why didn't Jackson tell this story before?</TE>
<TE>   This answer came more slowly. "I was pretty new there, so I just
pushed it out of my mind . . . intimidated. I wasn't called to testify at
the trial, and then it was over. I guess I wanted to get ahead and not
make waves."</TE>
<TE>   Why now? "More and more, I've been thinking about it. It's
embarrassing, but I know it needs to be made right. I'm a Christian man .
. . ."</TE>
<TE>   We said our goodbyes. I transcribed Jackson's statement and sent it to
the corrections department for a reaction. Then I placed a call.
Spokeswoman Terry Thornton said, "I don't know what you want. The only
thing I can do is confirm who was on the committee. I don't know what
your interest is in this. None of his [Luna's] fears about being returned
to the mainline are documented, as far as I can see."</TE>
<TE>   The official record shows that on june 20, 1984, joe luna was summoned
before the classification committee on which Jackson was one of four
members. Luna had about a year remaining on a five-year sentence for
armed robbery. The decision of that committee, put in a memo called a
"chrono," was signed by program administrator Smith and a counselor, Don
DeBelle. The committee sent Luna back to the mainline the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, according to Luna's trial testimony and interviews I
conducted with Luna, he was approached by Flores, whom Luna knew to be a
tough guy in the Mexican Mafia prison gang. Flores, serving a life term
for murder, said what Luna already knew: He was suspected of being a
snitch to the administration because he had been in and out of ad-seg
several times for reasons unknown to the inmates--something that arouses
suspicion among prisoners who suspect it's a means by which information
can be passed from a snitch to guards. Luna says he also had refused to
join the Mexican Mafia and wouldn't pay tribute to Flores.</TE>
<TE>   At his trial, Luna said that Flores told him, "I want you to prove to
me that you're all right by moving on [killing] another inmate," someone
nicknamed "Shorty Blue." Luna said he refused, which made Flores angry.
"I told him, 'Man, I'm going home in nine months, man.' "</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, at about 9:30, Luna said he was doing pull-ups in
the prison yard when Flores and two other men approached. All were
wearing shirts or jackets in the Salinas Valley heat, a telltale sign
that they were prepared for combat. He said Flores took a swing at him
with a foot-long handmade knife, which he eluded. He then moved away,
toward the opposite part of the yard. Flores' two friends followed, as
did Flores a few minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Luna retreated next to the yard entrance gate, which he said was
locked, and then to the area of the baseball diamond. Along the way, he
picked up a sweatshirt, a shirt and a jacket that he found lying around
and put them on as protective gear. He also found a jagged piece of wood
from a tennis racket that he could use as a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, Flores approached. Luna stood waiting near the canteen
in the midst of other inmates, his wooden weapon hidden in his jacket. He
didn't run, he testified at trial. "I wanted to tell him that I didn't
want no trouble with him, to stay away from me, that I wasn't an
informant." Luna said Flores blustered, swore at him and told him that it
was a small world and he knew where Luna's family lived.</TE>
<TE>   Luna said Flores and his two friends pulled knives, and Flores lunged
at him. Luna pulled out his own weapon and grabbed Flores' arm. Using
Flores as a shield from the other two, Luna then grabbed at Flores'
collar. They wrestled to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, I just went crazy with fear. I remember jabbing at him with my
stick. I remember hitting him in the neck, and the blood just spurted out
like a fountain." Then it was over. A guard in a tower some 700 feet away
fired a blank shotgun round and inmates dropped or scattered.</TE>
<TE>   Luna said that he walked away rapidly as Flores bled to death. When
guards grabbed him, Luna had shed his extra clothes and his weapon and
was trying to wipe Flores' blood off of his body.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 18 years after the killing, I sit alone at a steel table in the
visitors' area of maximum-security Calipatria State Prison, waiting for
Luna. I'm leery of being used. Anyone familiar with prisons knows that
they house the world's craftiest con men. Those who want out always smile
and say please. This one grew up without a father, became a juvenile
delinquent at 14, turned to heroin and then to robbery to support his
habit. But then I remember that this story did not start with Luna but
with a respected professional in the corrections department.</TE>
<TE>   Luna enters and walks to the table with a sheaf of papers in his hand.
For several years he has been held in protective custody here because he
remains a possible target of the Mexican Mafia. He is in good shape for
his 48 years, with brown skin and graying hair. His clothes are neatly
pressed. He is almost 6 feet tall and about 200 pounds. A Mexican
American, he talks with a soft Spanish accent that ties him to his youth
in the barrio; sometimes he pauses to search for unfamiliar English
words. His arms and chest are heavily tattooed with ornate scrolls and
the names of neighborhoods with which he once identified. The images are
showing age, just as he is.</TE>
<TE>   He is less certain of me than I am of him because he knows how
powerless his position is. He, too, is wary of being used. His main
concern, which he puts on the table immediately, is that I not use his
wife's name or reveal where she lives because he fears retribution by the
Mexican Mafia. She was a sweetheart when both were teenagers. They
married five years ago, after conjugal visits for lifers stopped, so
their life together has consisted of collect phone calls and weekend
hours in the visitors' room. He has three children from a previous
marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, my family keeps me going," he says. "But it hurts so much that
I'm in here and I can't do for them what I want--what I will do for them
. . . when I get out of here." The last phrase is hesitant and soft
because he knows that getting parole in the present tough-on-crime
climate is difficult. He knows that when he appears before the parole
board on March 5, his chances will be slim. Or, as one parole lawyer
says: "Zero, zilch. I don't know anything about his case, but they're not
letting murderers out these days."</TE>
<TE>   Luna asks me to thank Jackson for coming forward. "I remember a black
dude who looked a little nervous, didn't say nothing. I guess that was
him. I call him Action Jackson now. God bless him. He is in here," he
says while patting his heart.</TE>
<TE>   Before the visit, I had called Luna and, without telling him Jackson's
version, asked him to tell me all he could about the committee meeting.
The stories meshed. I ask him to repeat it now, and he does.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you refuse to tell them who was threatening you?"</TE>
<TE>   "I do that, I might as well cut my own throat, man. There ain't no
secrets in prison. When I ran into Flores back in the yard just a couple
of days later, he said, 'I understand you didn't want to come back out
here.' Now, how'd he know that?"</TE>
<TE>   In prison, chronos are the fuel that makes bureaucratic fires burn.
Luna's file contains a fistful of them, but the only one of interest
today bears the date June 20, 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Once past the jargon, that memo says, "Subject [Luna] acknowledges
that he has been in and out of [administrative segregation] several times
on various charges which he claims have been dismissed. Subject feels
that he is unwanted on the mainline--He denies dealing in smut
information [slang for snitching] or being gang affiliated. Subject
expresses profound exasperation with continually being implicated by, in
his opinion, other inmates as to being involved in activities which he
denies involvement in . . . ." The report concludes by recommending a
transfer to another prison--but in the meantime, he is ordered back to
the mainline.</TE>
<TE>   Of the four members of the committee, only John Jackson says he
remembers the hearing. Counselor Patricia Womer says that she has no
recollection of it or of Luna. Counselor Don DeBelle, now retired, says,
"You've got to remember these things lasted five or 10 minutes, and I did
a thousand a year." When told he also testified at Luna's trial, DeBelle
says, "I did?"</TE>
<TE>   The fourth member, George Smith, says it is unfair to ask him to
comment on something "that happened 18 years ago without having any
factual data in front of me. This guy, I don't remember him, and the
murder, I don't remember it at all. I can't believe John Jackson
remembers something that happened 18 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   A chrono is a technical instrument with inherent hidden meanings, so I
seek clarification. Richard Gile, who retired two years ago as chief
deputy warden at Centinela State Prison, says after reviewing the June 20
chrono: "If whoever wrote that truly believed what he said, then he did
not take appropriate action," which would have been retention in
protected housing. "The safety of the inmate has to come first."</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Mineau, retired captain at Corcoran State Prison, says: "You see
where the chrono reads that Luna 'claims' the charges that sent him to
ad-seg were dismissed? Well, Smith would've had Luna's file in front of
him. He'd have known the truth. So the fact that Luna's statement was
unchallenged can be taken as confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   "However, the main thing that's irregular is that the committee
recommended he be transferred, but at the same time they put him back on
the mainline. They're recognizing that he has a serious problem and may
be in danger, but they still send him back. That should not have been
done."</TE>
<TE>   William Steven Rigg, retired lieutenant at Corcoran and now a
statewide consultant on correctional institutions, is more blunt. "This
man should have been given protection, absolutely," he says. "You don't
jeopardize the safety of an inmate just because he's afraid to talk."
Rigg also is troubled by the wording, "feels unwanted," in the chrono.
"Strange language. What's that mean? It's like the word is begging for an
explanation." Rigg and Mineau, unlike Gile, have a history with Smith.
They were whistle-blowers on incidents that occurred while he was warden
at Corcoran. When I mention their names, Smith says, "They're both
liars."</TE>
<TE>   I tell Smith what Jackson and Luna have said. He disputes them
entirely. "I'm not a dummy. If someone said, 'I'm gonna go out and kill
somebody or they're gonna kill me, I would never let that man on the
[main]line. Period."</TE>
<TE>   He says that he would have been suspicious of Luna's motives. "Lots of
people want to get transferred closer to home, wherever the hell they
want to get transferred to, and they tell you they got a problem. We had
a pretty amenable bunch of [inmates], and this guy says he can't get
along . . . ."</TE>
<TE>   When asked about Luna's fears of being labeled a snitch, Smith says,
"I don't think so. I don't think so . . . that's ridiculous." He says
that the Mexican Mafia was "almost nonexistent" at Soledad at the time,
its members having been locked up and transferred out. (Gile does not
agree. "The Mexican Mafia has always had members at Soledad," he says.
"That's never changed.")</TE>
<TE>   When told that Luna allegedly had not threatened to kill someone but
predicted the possibility that it would happen in self-defense, Smith
says, "Do you really believe that? My God, man, don't you know there are
evil people in the world? There are evil people in the world and they are
in prison--we hope. Some of them are not in prison yet, but they will
be."</TE>
<TE>   At Luna's 11-day trial in 1985, defense attorney Brian Gill used the
June 20 chrono to explain Luna's fear about returning to the mainline,
drawing especially on the term "unwanted." When told recently that
Jackson said Luna's language before the committee had been much stronger
than "unwanted," that he had said he thought he would be killed or have
to kill someone in self-defense, Gill is aghast. "If I'd have known that,
I'd have gone to the wall with it, any lawyer worth his salt would."</TE>
<TE>   Luna says that he probably didn't tell Gill about his words to the
committee because, "I was a confused idiot back then. I didn't know how
to talk or what to say." At the trial, Luna even picked up the word
"unwanted" and repeated it on the stand.</TE>
<TE>   Gill called eight inmates to the stand who said they saw the fight, or
parts of it. One, Jose Montes, who testified that he was right next to
Luna, said Flores was the aggressor and had been armed with a knife. Five
inmates said they saw Flores throw the knife to two inmates right after
he was stabbed and after the shotgun blast. Another inmate, Randy
Charrette, said that he saw Flores drinking "pruno" (prison liquor) the
day before, and Flores showed him a knife and said that he was going to
kill Luna. Of the members of the committee, only counselor DeBelle
testified, and he confirmed that Luna felt "unwanted" on the mainline.</TE>
<TE>   Monterey County prosecutor William Curtis used testimony from guards
to attack Luna's account, although none of them saw the stabbing. He also
sought to undermine Luna's witnesses by disclosing their criminal
records, telling jurors, "Let's consider the defense inmate witnesses, a
really fine collection of fellows."</TE>
<TE>   Mainly he drummed home that Luna tried to escape the killing scene and
had no serious wounds himself. He said that Flores was unarmed because no
weapon was found in the yard, even after inmates were searched and a
metal detector was used to scour the yard the next day.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor also disclosed that Luna didn't seek help from guards
who were in or near the yard.</TE>
<TE>   I ask Luna about that in my interview. He says that based on his
treatment by the classification committee, he assumed the prison staff
would not come to his defense. "I already asked them for help, and they
didn't give it to me. Where was I supposed to run to if they didn't
listen again?"</TE>
<TE>   Rigg says that if Luna had run to the guards, it "would have labeled
him an informant. And since staff had already refused to protect him, he
obviously felt he had no alternative but to do what he did."</TE>
<TE>   joe luna dreams of a late-life shot at freedom and admits to
occasional bitterness. "I get depressed. I get emotional. Man, it hurts.
Years ago, I blamed those people for putting me in this situation, but I
never blamed anyone else for the things I did."</TE>
<TE>   His eyes become red and he blinks hard. Luna has taken
anger-management classes, faithfully attended Narcotics Anonymous,
learned trades and says he has had no discipline write-ups for more than
a decade. However, he knows of many other convicts who have taken all of
the classes, accumulated the good-behavior points, kept their noses clean
and ultimately, all for naught: parole denied.</TE>
<TE>   Luna's wife, who works for a utility company and goes to college at
night to complete her degree, says, "He's served more than enough time
for the crimes he did commit. Now it's time for justice to be done. He
deserves to be with his family."</TE>
<TE>   One incident that should weigh in his favor is a report written by a
prison captain dated April 21, 2000, which praises Luna for breaking up a
fight between a black and a Latino inmate and restoring calm to what
could have ignited a racial incident. The official wrote, "Based on
inmate Luna's actions, and his apparent concern for positive programming
of himself--[he] should be commended for his actions."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Joe Luna will stand before the parole board at Calipatria
and ask to rejoin society. On that day, both he and the board will be put
to the test.</TE>

<HD>A Classic Uncovered</HD>
<DH>Architects Leo Marmol and Ron Radziner Restore a Neglected Neutra
Home</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL WEBB</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Production executive Stokely Chaffin doesn't need a garage door
opener. When she returns to her home in the hills above West Hollywood,
she drives under the burlap curtain that hangs across the double carport
as if she's driving through a carwash.</LD>
<LD>   Burlap is just one of the touches that makes Chaffin's residence
unique. Built by architect Richard Neutra in the late 1950s, the
2,000-square-foot two-story home sits on the edge of a canyon. A  carport
and its jutting roof dominate the structure's facade, and the
light-filled interiors are surrounded by broad cantilevered decks that
project over the rear garden at the foot of the slope.</LD>
<LD>   "I found it by accident while dating a guy who lived around the
corner. I walked in and exclaimed 'Goodness, this is my house!' " Chaffin
recalls. "I looked at 40 more and kept coming back to this one, even
though it wasn't so pretty at that time and I couldn't afford to buy it."
Growing up in Alabama with two sisters in an old house she describes as
"always upside down," she was intrigued by the prospect of living by
herself in a crisp, angular space. When the Neutra house dropped out of
escrow and the price came down, she jumped at the opportunity.</LD>
<TE>   Chaffin selected architects Leo Marmol and Ron Radziner of Marmol
Radziner + Associates to restore her home after seeing pictures of their
work at Neutra's Kaufmann house in Palm Springs. "At one point I wanted
concrete floors, illuminated counters and splashes of red," she says.
"Leo smiled and nodded, but was smart enough to realize I didn't really
want to live in a nightclub." Marmol, who supervised the yearlong
upgrade, remembers that "the house was dingy--we had to wake it up. She
gave us a 12-page wish list and we had to prioritize that to achieve the
greatest impact on a tight budget."</TE>
<TE>   The team installed white oak floors in the upstairs living area, guest
bedroom and downstairs master suite. Next they stained the oak floors and
surrounding redwood decks and paneled one of the living room walls in
birch to create a sense of unity between indoors and outdoors. Yet the
room retains an airiness with its white plaster walls, silver window
frames and a narrow chrome support column, which stands in the home's
center.</TE>
<TE>   Neutra's original design called for floor-to-ceiling glass for two of
the carport walls, which afforded passersby a view of the home's
interior. Later owners covered these windows with chip board and wood
siding for privacy and to shut out traffic noise. Marmol and Radziner
reinstalled the glass but also added a low wall around the staircase
opening, which partially obscures the interior from public view.
Chaffin's burlap curtain provides an additional layer of privacy, and
when the wall went in, Chaffin said she felt even less exposed.</TE>
<TE>   The architects unblocked a side window in the guest room, rebuilt the
kitchen with dark cabinets and installed a geometric fireplace in the
downstairs bedroom. These improvements enhanced the basic character of
the house as an indoors-outdoors space with its stunning view of the
canyon and the distant towers of downtown. The deck, protected from sun
and rain by the projecting roof, wraps around two sides of the living
room. Exterior steps lead from the deck off of the master bedroom to the
garden, and two towering palms provide a visual anchor.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a house that doesn't need a lot of stuff," says Chaffin.
"Like Michelle Pfeiffer, it looks beautiful without makeup. It gives me a
feeling of happiness from the time I get up in the morning, and it
improves my attitude toward the world."</TE>

<DH>An American Snack Staple Is Beating Its Bad Rap</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL BARBER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm listening to my stovetop.</LD>
<LD>   I have carefully poured enough cooking oil to coat the bottom of a
10-inch saute pan and, after heating it over a medium-high flame, have
dumped in the requisite 1/3 cup of popcorn kernels. The aroma of the
warming oil is enough to inspire all sorts of Rockwellian feelings. But
what really sets the mood is the staccato rhythm produced by those
exploding kernels as they ricochet insanely off the lid. It's like an
organic Morse code, and it's telling me, "Dependable snack on the way.
Locate salt. Cue 'The Big Lebowski.' "</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to Jiffy Pop, Orville Redenbacher and the chemical sublimity of
the microwave edition, popcorn has acquired an image of jet-age
convenience. The kernel of truth is that, of the six basic varieties of
maize, popcorn probably was the first to be cultivated--as long ago as
8,000 years.</LD>
<TE>   Early European explorers found popped or parched corn virtually
everywhere they marched in the Americas. According to the Popcorn
Promotion Board, pre-Incan clay poppers have been found in coastal Peru,
and a 1,700-year-old Zapotec funeral urn unearthed in Mexico depicts the
god of maize with popcorn in his headdress. When Columbus landed in the
West Indies, the board tells us, the residents tried to sell him popcorn.</TE>
<TE>   Most intriguing was an archeological find in 1948. Working in a New
Mexico site known as Bat Cave, students from Harvard and the University
of New Mexico discovered unpopped kernels that dated to before the time
of Christ. Like any good college students, their reaction was, "Dude,
let's cook 'em!" They did, and the corn popped like hatching dinosaurs.
Popcorn shot into the modern age in 1893, when Charles Cretors unveiled
his mobile steam-powered popcorn popper at the Columbian Exposition in
Chicago. It wasn't long before the snack became a staple. Today America's
annual per-capita consumption is 68 quarts of popped popcorn.</TE>
<TE>   Other types of corn, and even other grains, can be popped. What makes
popcorn ideal for the task is its outer shell, which is hard enough to
seal moisture inside. When the water content and heat are just right
(roughly 14% and 480 degrees, respectively), the liquid expands, cooking
the soft inner starch and eventually bursting through the hull. The
kernel turns inside out, blossoming into a crisp white or yellow flower.
The water is released as steam, which you should allow to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Popcorn got a bad rap in 1994, when those old maids at the Center for
Science in the Public Interest revealed that cinema popcorn cooked in
coconut oil contained as much as 80 grams of fat per tub, sans butter.</TE>
<TE>   But you don't have to cook your corn in coconut oil, and many theaters
now agree. Canola oil works just fine. And while buttered popcorn is
indeed a delicacy, so are many less-clogging versions. Cayenne pepper,
lime, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder--all of them can dress up a simple
bowl of popcorn. Feel free to experiment--but never omit the salt. At
least that's what my saute pan tells me.</TE>
<TE>Cajun Corn</TE>
<TE>   8 cups popped popcorn</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons butter</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon paprika</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce</TE>
<TE>   Salt to taste</TE>
<TE>   Place the popcorn in a large bowl. Melt  the butter in a small pan
over low heat, then remove. Stir in the remaining ingredients (except for
the salt), drizzle a bit over the popcorn, and mix with a large spoon.
Repeat until all of the spice mixture has been used. Salt liberally.</TE>

<HD>Five Centuries of Fusion</HD>
<DH>Dishes at Nonya Draw Upon a Rich Tradition</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the recent novel "The Glass Palace," author Amitav Ghosh
describes dinner at a home in Malaya--fish cooked with pink ginger buds,
prawns roasted in pandanus leaves, and chicken with blue flowers. "With
every morsel their mouths were filled with new tastes, flavors that were
as unfamiliar as they were delicious," he writes. The visitor says she's
never eaten anything so wonderful and asks where it is from. It's Nonya
cooking from Malacca and Penang, the host tells her, "one of the world's
last great secrets."</LD>
<LD>   I had been reading this novel of Burma, India and Malaya when I
learned about a new restaurant in Pasadena called Nonya. Of course I
wanted to taste this unique blending of Malaysian and Chinese ingredients
and techniques that goes back as far as the 16th century, when Chinese
laborers and traders married Malaysian women from the straits of Penang.
It's basically Chinese cooking embellished with the spices and flavors of
Malaysia--Chinese with a dash of coconut milk and sour tropical fruits.</LD>
<LD>   London restaurateur Simon Tong chose Old Pasadena for his first U.S.
venture and found a location on the same block as Yujean Kang's and
Xiomara. That's a good thing in one way, but not so ideal in another. For
some unfathomable reason, the crowds that throng Colorado Boulevard seem
to be under some sort of evil enchantment that keeps their feet glued to
that street, while a block off the boulevard, excellent restaurants
struggle.</LD>
<TE>   Those who do take the trouble to walk around the corner will find a
handsome Asian setting in a historic corner storefront. At the entrance,
a low ceramic fountain planted with reeds lends a soothing murmur to the
room. Dark lacquered Chinese chairs and tables signal a casual chic.
There's a large brick-walled bar, separated from the main dining room by
a row of Ali Baba-sized jars stuffed with twisting branches. The crowd is
a mix of young Asian Americans and locals who have serendipitously
discovered the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Tong brought with him Tony Pat from Tong's Ho Ho restaurant to cook,
and from the first, Pat's experienced hand gave the food a vivid taste
and consistent execution. The surprise is that none of the flavors are
too unfamiliar. It's a kind of fusion cooking that comes built into the
cuisine. And it works, especially given a peculiarly California focus on
salad greens that puts roughage on almost every plate.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to go wrong with any of the appetizers. If you've ever
wondered about the term "grazing," this is it. Come with friends and
order up a slew of appetizers. They'll arrive in no particular order.</TE>
<TE>   Beef satay is a surprise. The strips of marinated beef threaded onto
bamboo skewers are tender and moist, but it's the peanut sauce that
stands out. Instead of the sweet peanut butter-based sauce most Southeast
Asian restaurants serve, this one is thoughtfully made and complexly
spiced. Slender shrimp rolls enclose a single shrimp in a thin,
deep-fried wrapper but leave the tail sticking out. The pleasant
sweet-hot dipping sauce is flecked with chile. Al dente green beans are
bundled and wrapped in supple eggplant slices and are paired with
asparagus for an appetizer salad.</TE>
<TE>   An icy raw beef salad is decorated with dabs of rip-snorting mustard.
There's also a delightful salad of grilled halibut with fresh, juicy
mango and thin slices of sweet red onion in a lively lemon grass and lime
vinaigrette. Other discoveries are bean curd stuffed with peppers and
onions, swathed in a spinach puree, and a graceful seafood broth laced
with coconut milk and brimming with shrimp, bean sprouts, noodles and
fish cake. At large convivial tables of youths, all with spiky hair, cell
phones chirp and burble and heavy watches are consulted as their owners
share dish after dish.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to main courses, I've enjoyed the intricate embroidery
of spices in the curries. They aren't the most visually appealing dishes,
but I found myself scooping spoonful after spoonful of the chicken
curry's brown gravy onto my rice. The spices taste as if they're freshly
ground.</TE>
<TE>   A favorite is lembu curry, which is beef and eggplant in a reddish
brown curry. The eggplant is almost crunchy, and the dish comes with fat
little scallion pancakes. They're good, if heavy, although you begin to
notice how oily they are as they cool. Another compelling dish is the
charbroiled lamb drizzled with a pungent chile sauce perfumed with garlic
and lemon grass.</TE>
<TE>   I also like the sambal shrimp in a bright-tasting red sauce lit up
with chiles--though not as many, I suspect, as would be used in a
Malaysian kitchen. Most of this food is tame by Southeast Asian
standards. Still, it must be too spicy for some tastes, since the waiters
are eager to steer you toward the milder dishes, whether or not you've
asked. It's an indication of how difficult it is to sell exotic cooking
in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody--that is everybody who doesn't mind the work of eating
it--will enjoy the whole crab cooked with handfuls of black peppercorns.
It comes already cracked, but to help wrest every morsel from the claws
and legs, the appropriate utensils are provided.</TE>
<TE>   A few of the dishes lose focus. I don't know if they're deliberately
less intense or the result of an uneven kitchen, but the flavors could be
stronger. The red snapper grilled in banana leaves isn't very appealing,
mostly because it's overcooked and too sweet the night I try it. The
diced pickled vegetables that accompany it, however, are an interesting
taste.</TE>
<TE>   If you love fried rice, try Nonya's special rice, stir fried with
small shrimp and flakes of delicious Chinese ham. My friend Ellen's
3-year-old was entranced with the miniature shrimp, and she had her
chopsticks dancing across the plate, searching out each pink morsel.</TE>
<TE>   Service, from a young staff that doesn't seem to know much about the
food, could use an infusion of energy. Almost any question about the menu
sends the waiter to the kitchen for an answer, which can make ordering
tortuous. What's lacking, too, is a sense that someone is in charge.</TE>
<TE>   By now you probably won't have room for dessert, which is a good
thing. Pretty little sesame crepes, with canned-tasting litchi nuts and
sliced kiwi and arranged in a pinwheel on the plate, are disappointing.
Coconut creme brulee would be better without the garnish of kiwi and
out-of-season strawberries. It's fun to share an ice gajat, though, a
fanciful creation of vanilla ice cream, squares of green "herbal" jello,
fat red beans and coconut milk in a tall glass. When we ordered it, our
waiter brought us four long bamboo spoons. When so many new Southern
California restaurants are French or Italian or sushi or Mediterranean,
this fusion of Malaysian and Chinese cuisines offers a welcome
alternative. While Nonya is careful not to offer anything too exotic or
challenging, the menu is different enough to make this newcomer
interesting.</TE>

<HD>Dallas Mayor Faces Texas-Size Challenge</HD>
<DH>Politics: Enemies made during her stint as a reporter will have to
be handled carefully.</DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DALLAS
</DL>
<LD>Laura Miller had a reporter's notebook in her hand at the City
Council briefing last week.</LD>
<LD>   But she wasn't using it to write one of her famously scathing
critiques. The former journalist was taking notes in her new role as
mayor of Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   After 15 years of digging dirt as a reporter and nearly two terms as a
City Council member, Miller has made an amazing transformation from
muckraker to mayor.</LD>
<TE>   This woman, after all, once demanded access to elected officials' cell
phone bills for a story on wasteful spending.</TE>
<TE>   She has called former Mayor Ron Kirk a "soap salesman" and written
that council members were "dupes . . . controlled by arrogant
bureaucrats." She described one councilman as a "pompous ignoramus."</TE>
<TE>   Her mission, she once wrote in a column, was to print "the truth about
the sleazy, stupid things that people in power do in Dallas."</TE>
<TE>   Now that Miller's in power, she says she's ready to clean up City
Hall, literally and figuratively.</TE>
<TE>   Less than 24 hours before she was sworn in as mayor Feb. 20, Miller
was moving into her office, juggling interviews and preparing to pick up
garbage and dead animals in one of the city's most neglected
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "I am obsessed with cleaning up the city," said Miller, 43, a slim
woman in a tailored navy-blue pantsuit and pearl necklace. "I want
everything clean and tidy."</TE>
<TE>   Her campaign for mayor was anything but clean, as she and her runoff
opponent, business establishment candidate Tom Dunning, traded
allegations of endorsement-buying and vote fraud. Although she won
support from 55% of the voters, only one council member endorsed her--a
testament to her frosty relations with her colleagues during her 3 1/2
years as a councilwoman.</TE>
<TE>   Some voters said Miller's fervor will serve her well in the mayor's
seat, where she hopes to push through a back-to-basics platform of
repairing streets, improving parks and reforming the city's code
enforcement and animal control operations. But although the mayor has the
power to set agenda items, she casts just one of 15 votes in Dallas'
weak-mayor form of government.</TE>
<TE>   She must work to make amends with council members, said Julie Lyons,
editor of the Dallas Observer, the alternative news weekly where Miller
was an award-winning columnist.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're an investigative reporter, your instinct is kill, kill,
kill," Lyons said. "That's not conducive to building a consensus. She's
going to have to change that."</TE>
<TE>   Right away, Miller got some criticism. Her order to clean up the trash
in a poor section of the city irritated the councilman for that district
because he wasn't told beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to see it on the television," said Councilman James Fantroy.
"That's not a good way for her to start her relationship with me and my
community."</TE>
<TE>   Fantroy said the new mayor may find it tough getting majority support
for her agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "She has to have eight votes," he said. "She can't do that
disrespecting council members."</TE>
<TE>   But Miller says she's confident of council cooperation, especially
with the departure of her predecessor. Kirk quit the mayor's office with
14 months left in his four-year term to run for the U.S. Senate.</TE>
<TE>Miller Opposed Predecessor's Projects</TE>
<TE>   Miller publicly opposed some of his projects, including tax breaks for
downtown developers, a city subsidy for the millionaire owners of the
city's new arena called the American Airlines Center, and the now-failed
bid for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   In return, Miller said, Kirk shut her out of key committee
chairmanships and interrupted her during meetings when her time to speak
had expired.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated, Miller sometimes would start shouting.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal as mayor is to make sure none of the council members feel
like that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Her persevering nature" will make her effective, said Donna Blumer, a
former councilwoman who was often one of Miller's only allies.</TE>
<TE>   Her hardest challenge will be to satisfy the various constituents who
supported her candidacy, Blumer said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, although Miller found surprisingly strong support in some
conservative neighborhoods, Blumer said she may lose ground there with
her recent promise to push for an anti-discrimination statute protecting
gays and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's upbringing was not among the poor and disenfranchised she's
pledged to help. The daughter of retailing executive Philip Miller, she
grew up in Concord, Mass., and Stamford, Conn., before moving to Dallas
as a teenager when her father took the helm of Neiman Marcus.</TE>
<TE>   After majoring in journalism at the University of Wisconsin, she
became a writer at both the Dallas Morning News and the now-defunct
Dallas Times Herald. Frustration over city support of a costly new arena
spurred Miller to trade her job and six-figure salary with the Dallas
Observer for a run at a City Council seat in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after winning her first two-year term, she began battling
breast cancer. In a very public way, she overcame chemotherapy, hair
loss, radiation and emotional upheaval. Her cancer is in remission.</TE>
<TE>   At her swearing-in ceremony, Miller promised to "shine a bright light
in every nook and cranny of City Hall."</TE>
<TE>Details of Botched Drug Arrests Sought</TE>
<TE>   Among the first to step into the spotlight will be the city manager
and police chief. She has asked both men to explain publicly to the
council details of a series of botched drug arrests. The FBI has launched
a public corruption investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Council members, who were never briefed on the matter, should not have
had to get information from the evening news, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "I want accountability," she said. "It is in my blood and my marrow
that we are open and responsive."</TE>
<TE>   Miller also has pledged a pay raise for police and firefighters, even
as sagging sales taxes have siphoned millions of dollars from the city
budget. It's an ambitious platform to carry out in 14 months.</TE>
<TE>   "As mayor, she has to have an agenda for all the issues facing the
city of Dallas," said Southern Methodist University political science
professor Cal Jillson. "Her style has been to pick an issue, study it in
depth and stick with it until she's satisfied. That's sort of the terrier
chasing the car. Now she's caught the car."</TE>

<HD>Family Searches for Key to Unlock Son's Autism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY SCHWARTZ</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WESTFIELD, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>Alex wasn't like his brother, Willy. When Willy was 2, he was
talking, and talking a lot; when Alex was 2, he . . . wasn't.</LD>
<LD>   And Alex would watch the same videos, over and over. "It's hard to
explain, but he sort of disappeared when he was watching videos," says
his mother, Elaine Masket. "He was just kind of overly focused, and he
lost awareness of his surroundings."</LD>
<LD>   When they moved to a new house, the last thing they moved was the
television. While the movers carried boxes and furniture around him,
11-month-old Alex watched TV.</LD>
<TE>   "You could have sworn that he didn't notice we were moving," Elaine
says.</TE>
<TE>   So the Maskets went to see a neurologist, who delivered a rather
abrupt verdict: "He's autistic. I knew it the minute I walked in the
room."</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years later, Elaine chuckles bitterly. At the time, it seemed
like a death sentence, harsh and without mercy. But so much has happened
since then.</TE>
<TE>   They have built a life around their autistic son. He has grown, and so
have they.</TE>
<TE>   And they have decided to help find a cure for autism, launching a
homespun effort to raise money and awareness--an effort that has been far
more successful than they had ever dared to hope.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine remembers a moment 10 years ago, when 6-year-old Willy asked
why autism had to come to their family. Well, she said, in some ways
theirs was a perfect family for someone like Alex--they had plenty of
love and money and education, so they were equipped to deal with the
challenge. Still, she said, it was a big problem.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's a big problem," Willy told her. "It's a lot of
little problems, and I think that's good, because little problems have
little solutions."</TE>
<TE>   She grins. "He's just always been more mature than I am. I hate it."</TE>
<TE>   Alex, with huge brown eyes and a charming smile, is a "sparkly kid,"
in his mother's words. He is an artist, of sorts--he uses Legos or vinyl
stickers to make extraordinarily intricate patterns that cover the floor
and walls of his bedroom. But his vocabulary consists of fewer than 50
words, and his voice has the timbre of the mentally handicapped.</TE>
<TE>   As an undergraduate psychology major--before she went on to Columbia
Law School, where she met Steve Masket--Elaine worked at a school for
autistic kids. So she knew a little about this peculiar and heartbreaking
condition.</TE>
<TE>   Autism is generally diagnosed before age 3. Estimates of the number of
autistic children have been as high as 1 in 500, and there are
indications that the incidence is increasing.</TE>
<TE>   Autistic children seem unresponsive; often, they seem to be repelled
by any physical contact. Words come hard.</TE>
<TE>   Their senses sometimes seem overstimulated (Alex found the pulsing of
fluorescent fixtures unbearable, and a busy supermarket would make him
scream with pain) and sometimes understimulated (he loves amusement-park
rides and sitting under crashing waves at the beach, and Steve would
sometimes calm him during a tantrum by picking him up and twirling him
around).</TE>
<TE>   Although there are treatments for autism, there is no cure. Steve and
Elaine knew that, but when they put Alex in a special school, they
declined an offer to meet the older kids.</TE>
<TE>   "We said, 'No, he's going to be in and out of here in a year,' "
Elaine says.</TE>
<TE>   Was it denial? Optimism?</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bit of both," Steve says.</TE>
<TE>   But the Maskets are savvy people--Steve is the general counsel for
Maidenform Inc., and Elaine retired from law to become a homemaker when
Willy was born. They quickly ensured that Alex got the schooling and
therapies he needed.</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, there have been men and women who have helped.
Marnell Jester, a former classroom aide and now a special-education
teacher, comes regularly and takes Alex on outings to Newark Airport to
ride the monorail or to Greenwich Village to eat in a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a better life than we do," Elaine says.</TE>
<TE>   But thanks to Jester and others, the Maskets had a life. They might
change vacation plans to accommodate Alex, but they never missed one of
Willy's bowling matches or a school play.</TE>
<TE>   When Willy was little, they took care not to make him the family's
"third adult," another caretaker for Alex. "I did not want to build up
any resentments. I didn't want him to feel burdened," Elaine says.</TE>
<TE>   And Willy, now a 16-year-old high school junior, says he never did.
Although "it's not like we have heart-to-hearts," Willy says, "We really
care about each other, about how the other is doing, protecting each
other."</TE>
<TE>   He and his 14-year-old brother have brotherly battles over who wields
the remote. And before Willy moved into his own room a couple of years
ago, the Legos that covered the floor were problematic.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, I was able to put my toes in just the right place--two
steps, right in bed." Other times, he says, "it was an
adventure--especially in the morning when you'd wake up, you're groggy,
you get out of the room and get all the Legos out of your feet."</TE>
<TE>   As he's gotten older, his parents have begun to involve him in his
brother's care. They are just 48 years old, but they know that
eventually, Alex will be Willy's responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Willy volunteers at a YMCA program for autistic kids. When Steve and
Elaine went to Alex's school for a conference, they brought Willy along.</TE>
<TE>   "It's scary to think about having two aging parents and a brother like
this. He better have very broad shoulders, this kid," Elaine says.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine had been feeling guilty because a friend had offered a
million-dollar challenge grant to Cure Autism Now, a Los Angeles-based
organization that promotes research. The Maskets didn't have that kind of
money, but they wanted to do something.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps a dinner-dance and auction? No--too scary, too much pressure
from adults spending big money and bringing big expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Then it hit her. Willy's band!</TE>
<TE>   Willy started playing the guitar in eighth grade, and it is his great
love. "The old music is where it's at," he says. Beatles and Jimi Hendrix
posters decorate his basement bedroom. When he was in ninth grade, he
joined Passed History, a band that mostly plays classic covers.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine's idea: Willy would run a benefit concert for autism, and
Passed History would be the featured performers. Ticket prices would be
kept low--$10 or $15--to encourage Willy's high school peers to attend
and learn about autism.</TE>
<TE>   The real money would come from donations. Willy sent out 500 letters
to just about everyone the Maskets know, asking them to serve as
sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a junior in Westfield High School and I have a 14-year-old
brother who is a really cool kid. But he has a big problem: He has
autism," the letter began. "As of now, my brother can only speak a few
words, and it's clear that unless major medical advances are made, he
will never live an independent life. I want something better for him."</TE>
<TE>   The goal, he wrote, was to raise more than $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Willy took on a co-chairman--his best friend and bandmate, Josh
Lerner. Together, they spent Saturday afternoons seeking contributions
from merchants in this New York City suburb. Josh's mother, Pam, ran the
food operation for the benefit, which was to be held at Temple Emanu-El,
the Maskets' synagogue. The temple's youth group volunteered to sell
refreshments.</TE>
<TE>   For Passed History, this was a major gig. Until now, they had
performed at a high school coffeehouse and at graduation and Sweet 16
parties. So they practiced for hours at drummer Charlie Hely's house.</TE>
<TE>   Willy's parents invited autistic kids and their caregivers to attend
the benefit. They kept tabs on the donations as they arrived, produced
programs, arranged for decorations (kids at Alex's school made the
centerpieces).</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 1 proved an eclectic evening. A crowd of 350 people heard
Westfield sophomore Jason Mesches play jazz piano. (Later, he did his
Elvis impression, prompted by his classmates, who donated $100.)</TE>
<TE>   The audience heard the gospel sounds of the Inspirational Choir of
Newark's New Hope Baptist Church. Alex's caregiver, Marnell Jester, is a
choir member and wanted to take part in the benefit.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there was Passed History. Four guitars and a set of drums
wailed through Chuck Berry's "Roll Over Beethoven," the Rolling Stones'
"Get Off My Cloud," the Beatles' "I've Got a Feeling" and other tunes.
The kids were up and dancing.</TE>
<TE>   The inspiration for all of this, Alex Masket, made a brief appearance.
He went in and out of the room, pilfering black-and-white cookies before
they could be sold.</TE>
<TE>   For the Maskets, it was a joyous evening amid days of apprehension.</TE>
<TE>   With puberty's arrival, Alex has shown signs of anxiety. At times, he
has walked with an exaggerated gait, stepping forward and backward again
and again before he leaves a room. He used to say "Cheerios" when he
wanted a special weekend breakfast; now he just says "Cheer," and Elaine
worries that he is losing his hard-won vocabulary.</TE>
<TE>   She knows that Alex's future depends on a cure for autism, and that
this benefit was a step forward. The Maskets did not raise their publicly
stated goal: $10,000. They did not raise the goal they had secretly
harbored: $30,000.</TE>
<TE>   They raised $57,000.</TE>
<TE>   There is strong evidence that the origins of autism are genetic. Cure
Autism Now sponsors genetic testing, so that families with autistic
children can be profiled, and cell lines can be established for
continuing research.</TE>
<TE>   Profiling each family costs about $5,000; the money raised by the
Maskets will enter 11 families in the gene bank. Elaine is certain that
these families are going to be the ones who solve the puzzle and free her
"sparkly kid" from the shackles of autism.</TE>
<TE>   "Because why not?" she asks. And she cannot think of a single reason.</TE>

<HD>Peru Ruins May Be Civilization's Cradle in the Americas</HD>
<DH>History: Site could date from time of Egypt's pyramids. The find
could revolutionize estimate of hemisphere's earliest settlements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRAIG MAURO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CARAL, Peru
</DL>
<LD>In a barren landscape that now looks like the moon, a mysterious
culture built pyramids here nearly 5,000 years ago. Until recently, few
archeologists would have believed that.</LD>
<LD>   The pyramids, apparently temples, loomed over sunken plazas and an
amphitheater. Neighborhoods were scattered among them, split into rich
and poor. An irrigated river nourished fields of cotton and squash that
were traded with faraway cultures.</LD>
<LD>   In short, a city thrived here, something that was not thought to have
happened in this hemisphere until 1,500 years later.</LD>
<TE>   "The evidence of Caral puts into question what had been accepted until
now," said Ruth Shady, a Peruvian archeologist from Lima's San Marcos
University who has led excavation of the site.</TE>
<TE>   "The splendor of Caral--2,600 years before Christ--is contemporary to
the splendor of the Egyptian pyramids, the pyramids at Giza and the
cities in Mesopotamia."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994, Shady and a team of archeologists have sifted through
dune-like mounds on this desert plateau overlooking the Supe River valley
90 miles northwest of Lima, in what could be the cradle of civilization
in the Americas.</TE>
<TE>   The archeologists knew early on that they were unearthing a city. But
they could not find ceramics or pottery, suggesting that it was built
when ancient Americans were still thought to live in decentralized rural
societies.</TE>
<TE>   Shady proposed that Caral predated Mayan settlements in Mexico and
Central America by centuries, a claim she said her colleagues greeted
with disbelief until last April.</TE>
<TE>   That was when she and two American researchers published hard proof in
the journal Science. The Americans--Jonathan Haas of Chicago's Field
Museum and Winifred Creamer of Northern Illinois University--had
carbon-dated material from Caral's main pyramid to as far back as 2627
B.C. Shady said people began settling the city around 2900 B.C. and it
was continuously inhabited for 1,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   During Caral's heyday, many of its 3,000 residents most likely filled
the 100-foot-diameter amphitheater for religious ceremonies led by high
priests playing flutes made of pelican and condor bones.</TE>
<TE>   The pyramids gleamed yellow, white or brick red in the setting sun as
the inhabitants feasted on fish caught in the Pacific Ocean or on
vizcacha, a rodent that was hunted in nearby shrub lands.</TE>
<TE>   When the day was done, the townspeople retired to home: the priests
and their servants to stone-block complexes near the pyramids, the
commoners to smaller mud-thatch huts outside the town center.</TE>
<TE>   Shady believes that Caral was a sacred city and administrative center
for a civilization that built 17 other sites, most still buried in the
Supe Valley and on the nearby Pacific coast. She chose to excavate Caral
first because its layout appeared the most sophisticated.</TE>
<TE>   Six pyramids dominated its skyline, covered for centuries after the
city's abandonment by wind-whipped sand and blending in with the rocky
hills that ring the site.</TE>
<TE>   The largest stood about 60 feet high, rising in terraced platforms
from a base about the size of four football fields. A circular stone
plaza sat at the foot, fronted by porticoes made of boulders as large as
refrigerators. The pyramid is the largest found yet in Peru, Shady said.</TE>
<TE>   Archeologists believe that the large rocks were dragged from nearby
quarries with ropes woven from reeds. Net sacks were used to lug groups
of smaller rocks and later dumped, bag and all, to fill foundations.</TE>
<TE>   Shady's team has found evidence that the entire city, including the
paved plaza floors, was painted one color with natural dyes. The color
changed over time, though it is unclear why. Traces of red paint are
still visible on the main pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Caral inhabitants did not mold pottery or fire
ceramics--or develop writing--they apparently composed music.</TE>
<TE>   The site's showcase artifacts are 32 flutes made from animal bones and
engraved with figures of birds and monkeys, a sign that the makers may
have ventured over the Andes mountains and into the Amazon jungle. The
instruments were found near a fire altar attached to the amphitheater,
suggesting that public ceremonies were carried out there.</TE>
<TE>   Caral subsisted on crops and small game hunted in surrounding
vegetation, which grew in a climate that was more humid than today's
desert weather. Remains of seeds, fish bones and seashells suggest Caral
traded with fishermen on the coast 12 miles to the west and with people
from as far away as Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is easy to imagine life at Caral with the guidance of
archeologists, the site itself is still only crudely reconstructed,
appearing mostly as piles of rocks and rubble.</TE>
<TE>   Shady has begun the task of persuading Peru and the world to help
conserve what has been called the most important archeological find here
since Machu Picchu, the Incan citadel discovered in 1911.</TE>
<TE>   That meticulously restored Incan citadel, discovered in a
jungle-shrouded valley in southern Cuzco province, has become Peru's main
tourist attraction and a national symbol.</TE>
<TE>   Caral is a long way off from such status. Erosion, neglect and looting
threaten the site, Shady said. It is still difficult to reach, connected
to the main coastal highway by a rutted dirt road. Peru's cash-strapped
government has allotted San Marcos University some $500,000 for
preservation, but Shady hopes to raise much more from foreign donors.</TE>
<TE>   "Caral's architecture needs to be conserved so it can be shown to Peru
and to the world," she said.</TE>

<HD>Music Soothes the Gypsy in Czech Singer's Soul</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREL JANICEK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PRAGUE, Czech Republic
</DL>
<LD>She's a big personality from a country where gypsies are persona
non grata.</LD>
<LD>   Vera Bila belts out her trademark fusion of gypsy music laced with
Latin, jazz and pop influences to sellout crowds in 20 countries. She's
got a new album that's been released across Europe and in Israel, and is
to debut soon in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   But Bila, 47, can't catch a break in her homeland, where gypsies are
an embattled minority. She gives about 100 concerts a year abroad, yet
only about five gigs back in the Czech Republic.</LD>
<TE>   "People should be proud of what she achieved, but they just ignore
her," said Jiri Smetana, a producer who helped discover Bila for
international audiences. "Radio stations here don't want to play gypsy
music. Who knows why?"</TE>
<TE>   Bila says she is used to Czech coolness, and the plight of her
people--who are also known as Roma--inspires much of her music.</TE>
<TE>   "I sing what I feel. It's my life in the songs," she said. "When you
open your heart, people can understand."</TE>
<TE>   Born into a musical family in 1954, Bila started singing at the age of
7. Under her father's strict guidance, she played piano, violin and
cimbalom. She said she taught herself the guitar secretly since it didn't
fit with her father's traditional tastes.</TE>
<TE>   "He destroyed my radio to prevent me from listening to anything other
than traditional gypsy songs," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't work. Still, Bila and her band Kale ("Blacks" in English) go
heavy on gypsy themes on their latest album, "Rovana" ("I Will Cry"), and
the music has unmistakably Roma roots.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Bila played the World of Music and Dance festival in Seattle
and was joined onstage by Bonnie Raitt. Riding an emotional high, Bila
and her band returned to their hometown of Rokycany, 55 miles southwest
of Prague, only to have the staff at a local restaurant refuse to serve
them.</TE>
<TE>   A new song, "Tekerel" ("What to Do?"), captures her anguish: "What are
they supposed to do now, if they can't go anywhere? When they come back
home, they have tears in their eyes."</TE>
<TE>   The French have dubbed Bila, who sings in Roma, the Ella Fitzgerald of
gypsy music; she's known in Germany as the Queen of Romany for an
influential 1999 album. In November, during a sold-out tour of Israel,
the mayor of Tel Aviv invited Bila to lunch and presented her with
pearl-studded gold earrings.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bila isn't accustomed to such treatment in the Czech Republic, home to
250,000 gypsies, many of whom complain of discrimination, face ethnically
motivated attacks and struggle to make ends meet amid 70% joblessness.</TE>
<TE>   But Bila is reluctant to criticize her homeland, preferring to let her
music speak for itself. "I don't want to stain the country's reputation,"
she said. "It is my country. I was born here and that's where I belong."</TE>

<HD>Anti-Terror Training OKd for Yemen Troops</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT BURNS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush has agreed to Yemen's request to provide U.S. troops
to train its military in combating terrorists, officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The plan represents another step by the Bush administration to extend
the war on terror beyond Afghanistan, where about 5,000 American troops,
helped by an array of surveillance aircraft, are still hunting Osama bin
Laden and other leaders of the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   Washington has been pushing Yemen--birthplace of Bin Laden's
father--for greater cooperation against terrorism since 17 American
sailors were killed in an October 2000 attack on the destroyer USS Cole
in the Yemeni port of Aden. U.S. officials believe that some Al Qaeda
fighters have found refuge in Yemen.</LD>
<TE>   An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Friday that Bush had given the go-ahead to dispatch U.S. troops to train
Yemen's military to combat terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   A senior defense official, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the White House's National Security Council empowered Gen. Tommy
Franks, who is responsible for U.S. military operations in that part of
the world, to work out details with Yemen. The official said U.S. Army
Special Forces troops would get the duty.</TE>
<TE>   The official said small amounts of military equipment--most likely
radios for field communication--probably would be provided along with the
training.</TE>
<TE>   In Yemen, a government official said Friday that as many as 100 U.S.
troops, including security experts and intelligence officers, will be
sent to the country soon. He did not say when troops would arrive, but
said forces will enter Yemen at different times in groups of 20 to 30
people, who will stay for 15 to 20 days.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon, another senior official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the U.S. assistance would go beyond anti-terror training
to include equipment and advice.</TE>
<TE>   During a visit to Iowa on Friday, Bush commented on the prospect of
helping Yemen, but offered no specifics. He said he made it clear to
Yemeni leaders that "we expect results" against terrorists there.</TE>
<TE>   "And the Yemeni government is responding," Bush said. "I'm not going
to talk about ongoing operations, but I will tell you wherever we find an
Al Qaeda presence, we will work with the government to root them out. In
other words, this war against terror is far broader than Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Air Force Brig. Gen. John Rosa, deputy director of operations for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Al Qaeda terrorists may be in Yemen. He
called it a likely refuge for those who fled Afghanistan under U.S.
attack.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 11 in Yemen, Franks said the United States did not expect to
deploy combat troops to Yemen but probably would train Yemen's military
in counter-terror tactics.</TE>

<HD>Fears Take Bite Out of the Sale of Beef</HD>
<DH>Japan: Specter of mad-cow disease has companies scrambling to do
damage control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENJI HALL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHIBA, Japan
</DL>
<LD>In a refrigerated room on the outskirts of Tokyo, three men tear
open a cardboard box to expose the building block of a hamburger empire:
A frozen slab of beef.</LD>
<LD>   Workers at this McDonald's plant operate the massive grinding machines
that turn the slabs into hamburger patties, making it a vital link in the
company's domestic web of suppliers.</LD>
<LD>   But since Japan's first case of mad-cow disease was confirmed in
September, anything involving beef has become suspect in the minds of
many consumers. Despite the fact that the beef here is imported from mad
cow disease-free Australia and certified as safe, the scare continues to
spread.</LD>
<TE>   "The plant's sales are down--our entire restaurant chain's sales are
down--because the image of beef here has gone sour," said McDonald's
spokesman Kenji Kaniya.</TE>
<TE>   The first case of the deadly disease was confirmed on a farm just
outside Tokyo. In November, health officials confirmed two more cases. In
December, preliminary tests at a meat-processing center in western Japan
revealed a suspected fourth diseased Holstein.</TE>
<TE>   Mad cow disease, known formally as bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
or BSE, is believed to be caused by proteins gone awry. Called prions,
the proteins bore holes into the brain.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists aren't sure how the disease is contracted, but suspect feed
made of recycled cow parts. Japanese media have speculated that the cause
lies in milk supplements or other cattle food imported from Europe, where
most of the 180,000 cases worldwide have been recorded.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan--the only country in Asia with mad cow--the outbreak still
appears to be limited.</TE>
<TE>   But officials have bungled efforts to put the public at ease. After
offering assurances about home-grown beef, health officials found more
diseased cows.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be surprised. There is still more to come," Tsutomu Takebe said
days after the third case was confirmed Nov. 30.</TE>
<TE>   The illness, which has ravaged Europe's cattle industry, is thought to
cause the fatal variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans who eat
infected meat, though experts still aren't certain there is a link. It
has killed more than 100 people, nearly all of them in Britain. None here
has CJD.</TE>
<TE>   Promising drastic measures, Japan's agriculture ministry has said it
will slaughter 5,129 cattle that may have eaten infected feed, destroy
14,300 tons of beef kept in storage nationwide, and tighten screening of
animals headed to the marketplace. The plan to kill the animals would be
the first time for the ministry to eliminate some of the nation's 4.5
million cows.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's beef industry already faces billions of yen--or tens of
millions of dollars--in losses.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic farms produced $3.58 billion worth of beef in 2000, some of
it for export. Japanese consumers ate nearly 1.1 million tons of beef in
1999, with about a third coming from domestic farms and nearly all of the
remaining two-thirds coming from Australia and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But this year's figures may fall far short.</TE>
<TE>   "The public is panicking. At this point, it's difficult to estimate
the damage. But with prices so low, industry profits are obviously way
down, for some by as much as 80%," said Japan Cattle Industry Cooperative
spokesman Tokuhiro Miwa.</TE>
<TE>   The agriculture ministry has pledged $1.23 billion in assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, restaurant chain Yoshinoya D&amp;C, known for its cheap rice
and teriyaki beef meals, has taken out ads to stress its beef comes
primarily from the United States. Others, including Korean barbecue
shops, are following suit.</TE>
<TE>   For McDonald's, the last couple of months have been painful.</TE>
<TE>   Until the mad cow cases surfaced, the company had enjoyed rising sales
and captured 65% of Japan's fast-food burger market with a
recession-busting menu of half-price hamburgers and cheeseburgers on
weekdays.</TE>
<TE>   Despite ads featuring its Australian beef patties, the burger chain
saw sales on a same-store basis--those open at least a year--fall 17.6%
in October, from the same month a year earlier, and 17.2% in November,
said spokesman Kaniya.</TE>
<TE>   Total sales, including those from newly launched restaurants, were
down 12.1% in October and 12.0% in November, he said.</TE>
<TE>   To Kaniya, those numbers aren't that bad--even a bit comforting.
Domestic producers are probably suffering more, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our figures seem to indicate a slight rebound. We hope this is a sign
that the worst has passed," he said.</TE>

<HD>Mastodon Tooth Gives Researchers Hope of Rare Find</HD>
<DH>Science: Remains of bogged-down beasts are almost always male, but
researchers say they may have a female on their hands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN DOBBIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NORTH JAVA, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>The tooth lay on the ground. It was big enough to trip over.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Moffett had retreated into western New York's hilly uplands after
a harrowing tour in Vietnam. In 1999, he finally picked out the perfect
spot on his 60 acres of abandoned farmland to erect a log house: a wooded
knoll overlooking a bog he's converting into a trout pond.</LD>
<LD>   As bulldozers carved a 16-foot-deep hole in the bog that slowly filled
with underground springs, Moffett stumbled on a "one-in-a-million rock"
next to a mound of muck. The more he studied it, the more he realized it
had once belonged in an ancient animal's mouth.</LD>
<TE>   "I kept hold of the thing almost for a whole year," said the
54-year-old letter carrier, confessing to his early fears about "what to
do without being overrun by society."</TE>
<TE>   The monstrous molar--6 inches long from front to back, 5 inches high
and 3 inches wide with a distinct gum line, roots and a conical-shaped
enamel top--came from a mastodon.</TE>
<TE>Last Days of the Mastodon</TE>
<TE>   The squat, elephant-like beasts covered with coarse, reddish-brown
hair averaged 6 to 10 feet tall at the shoulder and 15 feet from tusk to
tail. They survived until the waning days of the last Ice Age some 10,000
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Various theories are posited for their extinction: a violent shift in
climate, diseases such as tuberculosis, an influx of human hunters or a
blend of calamitous forces that also wiped out mammoths, sloths, camels
and other heavyweight mammals across North America.</TE>
<TE>   In the fossil record, mastodons are not scarce. Vestiges of at least
1,500 of them, ranging from tusk tips to virtually whole skeletons,
nestle in museums across the United States. Most have been discovered in
kettle ponds and marshes in the Great Lakes region.</TE>
<TE>   One unusual aspect of the mastodon dug up near this crossroads hamlet
40 miles southeast of Buffalo could be its sex.</TE>
<TE>   An excavation team recovered 20% of the animal, notably an ivory tusk,
neck vertebrae, toe, ankle and wrist bones, skull fragments and a femur.
Although they're still not certain--the pelvis is
missing--paleontologists suspect it's a female.</TE>
<TE>   Standing 8 feet tall with 4-inch-diameter tusks, it's about
three-quarters the size of a big male. And judging by its ossified growth
plates, it appears to be an adult.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably no more than a quarter of mastodon specimens seem to be
females," said Dan Fisher, curator of paleontology at the University of
Michigan in Ann Arbor. "I'm trying to be as cautious as I can, not
overstating the case for this disparity. Obviously there's more careful
work that could be done to quantify this."</TE>
<TE>   More assuredly, Fisher said, an even smaller proportion of skeletons
complete enough to be reassembled and exhibited are thought to be female.</TE>
<TE>   The sex bias throws up a tantalizing question: Were young-adult males,
forced out of a matriarchal herd to fend for themselves, more vulnerable
to accidents and attacks, more liable to end up mired in watery graves
and thereby more likely to remain preserved?</TE>
<TE>   Fisher thinks hunting pressure from humans swarming into North America
from Asia some 12,000 years ago might have been intense enough to explain
the extinction of big mammals.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line, I think, is it was easier to sort of sneak up on and
do in a solitary male mastodon," he said. "Are you going to go after one
individual in the countryside or 10 that are here for their mutual
defense?"</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the spoils could have been carved up in waterside
habitats. Or butchered meat, stored in ponds in winter to prevent
spoiling, might have floated away. "I think many sites we encounter are
animals that were dealt with in some way by humans," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   S. David Webb, curator of fossil vertebrates at the University of
Florida in Gainesville, theorized that female mastodons "basically stay
out of trouble" by sticking together.</TE>
<TE>   "But as is well-known certainly in living elephants, mature males hit
a sort of hormonal fever pitch that drives them to do insane things and
charge about," he said, adding that ancient ivory artwork suggests males
were singled out for their bigger tusks.</TE>
<TE>   Each Great Lakes state has located upward of 100 mastodon remains, led
by Michigan with some 250 sites, and Ohio and New York with close to 200
apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "The mastodon is big and lumbering and awesome--we sort of like to
think of it as New York's answer to dinosaurs," said Norton Miller, a
paleobotanist at the New York State Museum in Albany, where a 273-bone
mastodon skeleton dug up in 1866 looms in the lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Possibly the richest mastodon tomb in New York was unearthed in
Genesee County 40 miles from here. Since 1983, 11 partial skeletons have
been found, three of them suspected females, said Richard Laub of the
Buffalo Museum of Science.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike grass-grazing mammoths, mastodons probably chewed jack pines,
white spruce and possibly fish. Because their teeth resemble those of
humans, some early finders thought they'd stumbled upon the graves of
giants.</TE>
<TE>   "The woolly mammoth has a strictly typical elephant tooth--it's
probably just an elephant with long hair," said Cornell University
paleontologist John Chiment, who is supervising the dig here along with
the Ithaca-based Paleontological Research Institution.</TE>
<TE>   "The mastodon is a distant cousin with the same teeth found in pigs,
bears or humans. Over the course of their life, they have 40 teeth but
just four, six or eight at a time. And when they wear out their last
tooth they die of starvation."</TE>
<TE>   Foot joints and vertebrae are being assessed for signs of tuberculosis
or other diseases that might have affected fertility in females.</TE>
<TE>   "If the animals were already in decline [and] not even replacing the
normal death rate, then just a few hunters could have a tremendous
impact," Chiment said. "But if it's a robust population, 100 people
wandering through are not going to destroy a whole species."</TE>
<TE>Images of a Bygone Era</TE>
<TE>   He pictures mastodon herds dawdling in forested uplands, far from
beaches or lakes where fossils survive.</TE>
<TE>   Moffett, meantime, is still planning to hire Oneida Indians to build
his dream house amid a stand of maple, cherry and ash.</TE>
<TE>   An outdoors enthusiast, he takes pride in a federally designated
wetland on his property that's been commandeered by beaver. The mastodon
discovery, he said, "gives this piece of property a lot of significance,
makes me realize we're just a grain of sand here."</TE>
<TE>   On a wintry day, he'll sit on his hilltop, with its distant view of
Buffalo, and imagine spying on a lone mastodon sipping from a glacial
pond some 12,000 years ago.</TE>

<HD>Undue Influence Alleged in Energy Meetings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE YOST</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A top Energy Department official working on revision of power plant
pollution standards met with 64 industry representatives and a single
member of an environmental group, a Democratic congressman said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The lopsided numbers--seven meetings with business groups and one with
one member of the Natural Resources Defense Council--suggest "undue
industry influence" on the administration's deliberations, Rep. Henry
Waxman wrote President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Dates of the meetings and the participants were detailed in a letter
to Waxman from Frank Blake, the deputy energy secretary, who held the
meetings. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) released Blake's letter.</LD>
<TE>   Lobbyist and current Republican national chairman Marc Racicot was
representing the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council, an industry
group, at a July 23 meeting with Blake. There were 15 participants,
including executives from Southern Co. and Duke Power.</TE>
<TE>   The industry representatives at the meetings and the corporations they
represent gave $6.4 million to Bush's presidential campaign and other
Republicans and $2 million to Democrats, Waxman said.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion that there is anything improper about an Energy Department
official meeting with energy experts is absurd," said Energy Department
spokeswoman Jeanne Lopatto. "He had eight meetings with energy experts,
including an environmental group, and that was over a four-month period.
That's his job."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is studying overhauling a regulation that
requires power plants, as well as refineries and industrial sources, to
install new pollution controls when they make significant improvements or
expansions that result in additional chemical releases.</TE>
<TE>   During the Clinton administration, the Environmental Protection Agency
began aggressively to use those rules in enforcement actions against a
dozen electric utilities, mainly those using older, much dirtier,
coal-fired plants.</TE>
<TE>   In a resignation letter last week, the EPA's enforcement chief, Eric
Schaeffer, said two companies that had tentatively agreed to settle
lawsuits have refused to sign a final agreement, hoping that the rules
will be weakened.</TE>

<HD>States Mandate a School Motto: 'In God We Trust'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRENDAN FARRINGTON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>In a movement that gained momentum with the post-Sept. 11 surge in
patriotism, several states have passed or are considering legislation to
post the motto "In God We Trust" in schools.</LD>
<LD>   "With things that are facing us today, like terrorism, I think we need
a pulling-together of this country," said Clay County School Supt. David
Owens, who is already putting up the motto in schools near Jacksonville
without waiting for Florida to pass a law. "If putting these mottoes in
the schools can help build patriotism, it has served its purpose."</LD>
<LD>   The motto was first placed on coins by the U.S. Treasury in 1864,
during the Civil War. In 1955, Congress passed a bill to have the motto
placed on paper currency, and it first appeared on bills two years later.</LD>
<TE>   In 1956, Congress passed a resolution declaring "In God We Trust" the
national motto.</TE>
<TE>   The use of the phrase has since withstood at least three federal court
challenges, including one that led to a 1996 ruling by the 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
hear the case.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been tested for its constitutionality in federal court," said
Michigan state Rep. Stephen Ehardt, a Republican. "It is secular. It's
not a religious statement and it's something we should be proud of--it's
our national motto."</TE>
<TE>   The movement began with a push in Mississippi by the American Family
Assn., a fundamentalist Christian group in Tupelo. The state passed a law
about a year ago, well before Sept. 11, requiring the motto to be placed
in every classroom.</TE>
<TE>   The organization has since asked its 200,000 members from all 50
states to contact lawmakers and push for similar laws.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan passed a law in December that makes it clear that the motto
can be hung in schools. Florida, Utah, Arizona, Virginia, Louisiana and
New Jersey are considering similar legislation, while an "In God We
Trust" bill in Indiana died in committee in February.</TE>
<TE>   "America has a rich Christian, and really religious, heritage," said
Tim Wildmon, the American Family Assn.'s vice president. "If the
president of the United States can be sworn in by placing his hand on the
Holy Bible, certainly kids can know what the national motto is."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents complain that lawmakers are using patriotism in a veiled
attempt to bring religion into schools.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of other things that are much less divisive that we
suggest they could use," said Emily Whitfield, a spokeswoman for the
American Civil Liberties Union in New York. "George Bush said in our
State of the Union address that our national motto should be 'Let's
roll.' Maybe we should put that up there."</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU has spoken against the measure in several states, though it
has admitted that it probably would not win a court challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Stern, legal director for the Washington-based American Jewish
Conference, said he is concerned that the classroom requirement "will
serve as a launching pad for further intrusion."</TE>
<TE>   "If people are taking advantage of Sept. 11 to begin to re-fight the
battle over whether the schools ought to be an institution charged with
religious instruction, then that's a most unfortunate exploitation of the
tragedies," said Stern, whose organization is not fighting the bills.</TE>
<TE>   Utah state Rep. Richard Siddoway, a Republican who wants to require
every school to post "In God We Trust," said: "If you're going to have to
get rid of any mention of God and religion, you're going to have to get
rid of the Declaration of Independence and you're going to have to get
rid of the national anthem and, of course, the Pledge of Allegiance."</TE>

<HD>Irish Suicide Raises New Issues for Minister</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER BUNDY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BECKLEY, W.Va.
</DL>
<LD>He was once a radio church reviewer in Pittsburgh, offering on-air
critiques of houses of worship--their music, their architecture, even
their pastors' sermons.</LD>
<LD>   Before that, he started a ruckus over unsafe sex at South Carolina
highway rest areas. He wanted the state to install condom machines.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Rev. George Exoo, who leads two Unitarian Universalist
congregations in West Virginia, is making news for being present when a
49-year-old woman took her life in an apartment in Ireland.</LD>
<TE>   Exoo said Rosemary Toole Gilhooley's Jan. 26 death in Dublin was one
of more than 100 he's been involved with since 1995. It's part of his
work with a group he founded and calls Compassionate Chaplaincy.</TE>
<TE>   Ireland's national police force is investigating Exoo, who sat at
Gilhooley's side as she took sleep-inducing drugs, smoked a last
cigarette, then pulled a helium-filled bag over her head.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation, which began when Gilhooley's father took her
suicide note to police, also involves the FBI, an Irish police spokesman
said. The FBI would not confirm an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Exoo said he conformed his actions to American law. It is not illegal
in the United States to sit with people while they kill themselves as
long as they procured and administered their own means of death,
according to the Hemlock Society, the nation's oldest and largest
right-to-die group. The American Bar Assn.'s Commission on Legal Problems
of the Elderly agrees.</TE>
<TE>   Exoo said he does nothing more than sit by a person's side and give
comfort. He acknowledged, however, that if he held a person's hand--as he
said he did Gilhooley's--while reading a Psalm aloud, it would be more
difficult for that person to pull a bag off her head.</TE>
<TE>   Exoo was drawn into the right-to-die movement through the 1983 illness
and death of a member of his former congregation in Charleston, S.C. That
man's wife later persuaded him to join the Hemlock Society.</TE>
<TE>   Exoo said he does not seek publicity and he's "not interested in being
a Jack Kevorkian"--the retired pathologist whose public crusade for
physician-assisted suicide ultimately landed him in prison on a
second-degree murder conviction.</TE>
<TE>   His efforts have put him at odds with the Hemlock Society and his own
church's governing association.</TE>
<TE>   The Hemlock Society referred some people to Exoo until a year ago, but
now does not want him using its name, said Ryan Ross, a society
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "He does what George Exoo thinks is right. We have our standards and
policies and they are not in sync," Ross said. The Hemlock Society, for
example, requires clients to prove they are mentally sound and have a
terminal illness or irreversible disability.</TE>
<TE>   Exoo, 59, who has no medical or psychological training, says that
before he counsels people planning suicide, he must be convinced they are
suffering from an incurable illness or disability.</TE>
<TE>   Exoo has said Gilhooley convinced him she had an incurable brain
dysfunction. Irish newspapers have reported she suffered only from
depression.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1998, the Unitarian Universalist Assn. has supported a
terminally ill person's right to commit suicide. The association parted
ways with Exoo in November, although he can still serve his congregations
in Beckley and Lewisburg.</TE>
<TE>   Association spokesman John Hurley would not discuss Exoo's situation.</TE>
<TE>   Exoo explained, "They did not like the design of Compassionate
Chaplaincy, and I was not pleased with what they wanted me to do."</TE>
<TE>   Some advocates for the disabled also criticize Exoo's work.</TE>
<TE>   "We see it not as compassion, but as contempt for our lives," said
Diane Coleman, who uses a wheelchair because of a neuromuscular disorder
and is president of the advocacy group Not Dead Yet in Forest Park, Ill.
"Why is suicide a bad thing for everybody else except us?"</TE>
<TE>   Exoo was born and raised a Methodist in suburban Cleveland. After
graduating from Boston's Emerson College in 1964, he earned a graduate
degree from Harvard Divinity School and studied toward his doctorate in
music history at UC Berkeley. He taught sociology at several colleges
until he was ordained into the Unitarian Universalist ministry in 1973.
He led congregations in Charleston and Myrtle Beach, S.C., among others,
and has led the new River Fellowship in Beckley part-time since 1997. He
also gathered a congregation in Lewisburg.</TE>
<TE>   His work as an AIDS activist in Charleston drew fire and in part led
to his resignation from the church he served for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Exoo got a grant to study how Interstate 26 rest areas were used for
homosexual sex and publicized his findings, hoping it would lead to a
safe-sex initiative. He should have anticipated the police crackdown that
followed instead, Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   From South Carolina, Exoo went to West Virginia to help establish a
hospice house at a Hare Krishna community. There he met Thomas McGurrin,
a Krishna monk; the two have been companions ever since.</TE>
<TE>   They moved to Pittsburgh, where Exoo supported himself caring for a
disabled man and being "The Church Man" on WQED-FM, reviewing churches,
synagogues, mosques and meetinghouses.</TE>
<TE>   While in Pittsburgh in 1995, Exoo said, he assisted in his first
suicide. George Koss, who had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou
Gehrig's disease, and his wife, Josephine, contacted Exoo through the
Hemlock Society.</TE>
<TE>   After George Koss' death, Exoo and Josephine Koss formed Compassionate
Chaplaincy, which he said helps those whom the Hemlock Society and other
groups turn away.</TE>
<TE>   Exoo and McGurrin said they have counseled and helped many people who
don't kill themselves, buying medication for some and taking others to
doctors.</TE>
<TE>   One such person, a woman who has put off her plan to commit suicide
since befriending Exoo, said, "He has never pushed anybody into anything
they don't want."</TE>
<TE>   Exoo gets support for his assisted suicide work among the 24 members
of his congregation in Beckley, a city of about 17,000 in southern West
Virginia's coal fields.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel he is performing a very necessary . . . service for people,"
church member Ed Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the most compassionate, selfless people we've ever
known," said another, Beverly Kinraide.</TE>
<TE>   His main source of income is the $375 a month he receives from the
Beckley congregation. He asks for money from those who seek his help with
suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Exoo said he has no intention of stopping his work.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go as long as I can go; as long as God gives me the strength to
do it, I'll do it."</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, "I'll never go back to Ireland."</TE>

<HD>Launch Is Marred by Cooling System Worries</HD>
<DH>Space: Mission managers decide for now to allow Columbia to
continue its journey to overhaul and upgrade the Hubble telescope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>The veteran shuttle Columbia rocketed into orbit Friday and set off
after the Hubble Space Telescope for a five-spacewalk overhaul and
upgrade, the most complex orbital service call ever attempted.</LD>
<LD>   But Columbia's picture-perfect launch was clouded by a potentially
serious problem with the ship's cooling system that could, in a
worst-case scenario, force NASA to forego the long-planned Hubble repairs
and instead bring the shuttle back to Earth ahead of schedule.</LD>
<LD>   After studying telemetry from the shuttle in more detail, however,
mission managers decided late Friday to continue the flight as planned,
pending the results of additional overnight analysis. Engineers expect
those results to clear Columbia for a full-duration mission.</LD>
<TE>   "Our initial looks at the system show it to be stable, even with the
degradation, and we believe we are safe to continue on orbit for the next
24 hours while we continue to look at further information and to refine
our analysis," program manager Ronald Dittemore said.</TE>
<TE>   "This analysis, we firmly believe, will conclude we are safe to
continue the mission for the full duration. We just need the time to make
sure we dot all the i's and cross all the t's to be positive about that."</TE>
<TE>   Fresh from a 2 1/2-year, $100-million overhaul, NASA's oldest shuttle
roared to life at 6:22 a.m., putting on a spectacular predawn light show
as it knifed through a low deck of clouds and arced away over the
Atlantic Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Aboard were Cmdr. Scott Altman, rookie pilot Duane Carey, flight
engineer Nancy Currie and spacewalkers John Grunsfeld, Richard Linnehan,
James Newman and Michael Massimino, another first-time flier.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well, Altman will guide Columbia to a rendezvous with the
24,000-pound space observatory early Sunday. The first of five
back-to-back spacewalks to upgrade and overhaul the $2-billion
observatory will begin around 1:30 a.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The primary goal of the mission is to refurbish Hubble's aging
electrical system by installing two new solar arrays and a new power
control unit, a 160-pound "black box" that routes electricity from the
solar panels to the telescope's instruments and subsystems.</TE>
<TE>   While Columbia's ascent Friday was virtually flawless, the coolant
system problem prompted a scare in NASA's flight control team.</TE>
<TE>   The shuttle is equipped with two Freon-21 coolant loops to dissipate
the heat generated by the ship's myriad computers, avionics systems and
other electrically powered equipment.</TE>
<TE>   During launch and reentry, Freon in the two coolant loops sheds that
heat in devices that cause water or ammonia to boil, depending on the
shuttle's altitude. During orbital operations, cooling is provided by
radiators mounted on the inner surface of each payload bay door.</TE>
<TE>   Just after Columbia reached orbit Friday--before the cargo doors were
opened and the radiators were deployed--flight controllers noticed
reduced flow in one of the coolant loops, apparently the result of some
sort of blockage in a line.</TE>
<TE>   The flow returned to normal once the cargo bay doors were opened and
the radiators were deployed. But the reduced flow rate in coolant loop
No. 1 presumably will show up again once the cargo bay doors are closed
for reentry and the radiators are bypassed.</TE>
<TE>   NASA flight rules require a minimum flow rate of 211 pounds of
Freon-21 per hour to prevent critical systems from getting too hot.
Should one loop be declared out of limits, the shuttle would be one
failure away from potentially catastrophic overheating.</TE>
<TE>   NASA's conservative flight rules require a shuttle crew to break out
of orbit and return to Earth at the first opportunity to reach a U.S.
landing site if one of the coolant loops is declared inoperable.</TE>
<TE>   But initial telemetry showed coolant loop No. 1, although close to the
flight-rule redline, was within allowable limits and it was not getting
worse. Mission managers are hopeful Columbia's crew will be able to press
ahead with a full-duration flight.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all hoping that we can rendezvous with the Hubble [on Sunday as
planned] and fix it," astronaut Steve MacLean radioed Columbia's crew
from mission control in Houston.</TE>

<HD>Effect of Gymnastics on Girls' Growth Debated</HD>
<DH>Health: Studies conflict on whether the sport's strenuous training
keeps children from reaching their full height.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRA DREYFUSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Girls' growth is not stunted by the tough exercise and diet
restrictions required to be the best in gymnastics, researchers say. But
some scientists say some of the young gymnasts nonetheless never will
grow to their full potential height.</LD>
<LD>   Two reports in sports medicine journals reviewed studies on the elite
athletes. The researchers agree there is no proof that the training
regimens keep the girls from growing as tall as they should.</LD>
<LD>   But while one study concludes the girls eventually will grow as tall
as nature intended, another warns that some may wind up shorter than they
should be, for reasons that are not yet clear.</LD>
<TE>   "They will reach their potential adult height, not being compromised
by training," said researcher Adam Baxter-Jones of the University of
Saskatchewan.</TE>
<TE>   "We both agree there is no evidence of cause-and-effect between
training and reduced growth," said researcher Dennis Caine of Western
Washington University. "But in some kids, growth may be retarded, and you
should follow up with those kids."</TE>
<TE>   At issue are training schedules that keep the girls exercising from 10
hours to 25 or more hours a week for events in which thinness is
virtually a requirement.</TE>
<TE>   The strenuous exercise burns calories, and researchers say many girls
do not eat enough to replace them. The combination of many calories out
and fewer calories in can disrupt hormonal cycles, delaying puberty. Some
earlier research had indicated that the delay would retard the growth
spurt that comes with adolescence.</TE>
<TE>   The latest reports conclude that the gymnasts tend to be small because
small girls can do better at their events' quick, precise movements than
can larger girls, who wind up dropping out of the sport--a process called
self-selection.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter-Jones and his colleague, Nicola Maffulli of Keele University
School of Medicine in England, published their review in the British
Journal of Sports Medicine. Caine and his four colleagues published
theirs in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   The shortness of the female athletes may simply result from genetics,
Baxter-Jones said. Girls in gymnastics tend to have parents who also are
smaller than average, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The girls tend to run late on getting their first periods, and their
mothers tended to have done the same, Baxter-Jones said. The delay in
sexual development lets an athlete retain the more lithe figure of
childhood, with smaller breasts and narrower hips.</TE>
<TE>   The girls catch up later, with sexual maturity and growth that comes
later than girls in other sports, or later than girls who are not
involved in a sport, Baxter-Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   However, while Baxter-Jones' article concluded that "training does not
appear to affect growth and maturation," the Caine article came to a
somewhat different conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   "Elite level or those gymnasts involved in heavy training regimens may
be at risk for adverse effects on growth and maturation," Caine and his
colleagues said. "This effect is often but not necessarily always
reversed after retirement."</TE>
<TE>   The Baxter-Jones article, with 18 citations of previous works, did not
include some of the 94 studies cited in the Caine article, Caine said.</TE>
<TE>   The two reviews agree diet and exercise probably don't cause growth
retardation. Both find the girls catch up later in their growth. But the
Caine article reports some girls do not seem to catch up, for reasons
that are unclear. And those who are shorter than 95% of girls their age
should be taken to doctors for examinations, the article said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if exercise and diet don't cause growth restrictions, something
else may, and the problem should not be ignored on the theory that the
girl will grow out of it, Caine said.</TE>
<TE>   "The catch-up growth observed during reduced training schedules or the
months following retirement provides evidence that growth is affected in
some instances," the article said. "Although catch-up growth does occur,
the evidence is inconclusive whether normal height is achieved."</TE>

<HD>Shipwreck a Prize for Archeologists</HD>
<DH>History: Pieces of a Spanish frigate built 300 years ago in Mexico
are being painstakingly recovered off the Florida coast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL KACZOR</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PENSACOLA, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>The wreck of a 50-gun Spanish frigate in Pensacola Bay is giving
marine archeologists a rare look at a ship built in the New World three
centuries ago.</LD>
<LD>   Most vessels they have been able to examine from that era are of
European origin. The Nuestra Senora del Rosario, however, was built in
Mexico only about five years before it sank during a storm in 1705.</LD>
<LD>   The ship seems to have been privately built and then purchased by the
Spanish government, said John Bratten, who is overseeing excavation work
on the wreck for the University of West Florida Archeology Institute.</LD>
<TE>   During each of the last four summers, archeologists and students have
uncovered bits of the ship in shallow water near Civil War-era Ft.
Pickens on Santa Rosa Island. The vessel is estimated to be about 120
feet long.</TE>
<TE>   State archeologists located the Rosario in 1992 under tons of silt.
For six years, however, it took a back seat to an older wreck of a
Spanish galleon in another part of the bay.</TE>
<TE>   Known as the Emanuel Point wreck, the galleon sank in 1559, when
Pensacola was first settled by Europeans, making it the oldest shipwreck
found in Florida waters. The galleon, part of an expedition led by
Tristan de Luna, was partly excavated and artifacts, including a huge
iron anchor, were removed before it was reburied in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Luna colony lasted two years before being abandoned. The Spanish
returned in 1698 to establish a military outpost known as Presidio Santa
Maria de Galve.</TE>
<TE>   The Rosario brought payroll and supplies to the presidio from Mexico
and Cuba but sank before loading a cargo of lumber for Mexico. It would
have been one of first such shipments from Pensacola, a forerunner of a
booming timber industry in the Florida Panhandle.</TE>
<TE>   The crew tried to save the storm-tossed ship by putting out five
anchors and cutting off a mast, but it ran aground and broke up,
according to historic documents.</TE>
<TE>   The Rosario is made from types of mahogany and Spanish cedar that grow
only around the coastal state of Veracruz.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see this in a European ship," Bratten said. "We're not sure
what to call this."</TE>
<TE>   On a European ship, the same section would have been made of many
parts instead of a single, massive piece of wood.</TE>
<TE>   "In Europe, they harvested so much timber from the forest that the
large trees were gone," Bratten said. Here, he said, they use the large
pieces of timber to mold into use on various parts of the ship.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish salvaged much of the Rosario's equipment, including its
cannons, but hundreds of artifacts remained for archeologists to find
nearly 300 years later.</TE>
<TE>   Among them: wooden pulleys, a box filled with iron nails, an unarmed
hand grenade, a cannonball, a brass ring, glass bottles, pipe stems,
weights and floats for fishing nets, animal bones and a variety of
ceramic objects such as olive jars.</TE>
<TE>   The Emanuel Point wreck was used as a summer field school for nautical
archeology students. When that work was done, the researchers relocated
the Rosario and put it to the same use.</TE>
<TE>   The university last year obtained a $300,000 grant from the Department
of State's Division of Historic Preservation to continue the Rosario
excavation. The university also was getting help from the Navy until the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's Coastal Systems Station at Panama City Beach had loaned the
university a 46-foot pontoon boat, normally used for mine-detection work.
Researchers, however, were denied access to Pensacola Naval Air Station,
where the boat was docked, in the days immediately after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "This fall we got a little work done, but not what we wanted to do,"
Bratten said.</TE>
<TE>   Excavation was put on hold until an old barge used for the Emanuel
Point wreck was refurbished and then moored at the Rosario site.</TE>
<TE>   Archeologists initially planned to suspend work for the year after
Thanksgiving, but they continued into December, as the weather remained
mild, to make up for some of the lost time. The excavation will resume
with another field school this summer.</TE>

<HD>Archeology, Economics Conflict in Virgin Islands</HD>
<DH>Development: Botany Bay is targeted for a resort that would bring
jobs but threaten ruins, environment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM DAY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands
</DL>
<LD>It stands apart from the sprawl of T-shirt stands, souvenir shops
and pastel-colored hotels, a swath of untouched land that is home to
1,400-year-old Indian ruins.</LD>
<LD>   The 360 acres surrounding Botany Bay on the western end of St. Thomas
island have long been a refuge from the clamor of Charlotte Amalie, one
of the busiest cruise ports in the region.</LD>
<LD>   But the spot could become the home to a resort complex with 125 hotel
rooms, 80 time-share apartments and 55 condominiums.</LD>
<TE>   That prospect has stirred up environmentalists, pitting them against
the cash-strapped government of the U.S. Virgin Islands. "Save Botany
Bay" bumper stickers can be seen across the island.</TE>
<TE>   "We keep putting economics first," said Caroline Brown of the
Environmental Assn. of St. Thomas. "We must take a more active role, or
we're going to find ourselves living in a concrete jungle."</TE>
<TE>   Botany Bay Partners, the group that wants to develop the land, says
the project would bring jobs to the island, which, like others in the
Caribbean, has suffered economically since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
dampened vacation travel.</TE>
<TE>   The developers are promising to maintain the archeological sites as an
educational center, and say they will take measures to mitigate erosion,
sewage discharge and pollution caused by any structures built.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a tremendous amount of jobs that will be created on an ongoing
basis," said Alain Longatte, president and chief executive of Botany Bay
Partners. "It's going to have a great impact on the economy."</TE>
<TE>   If the developers get the zoning approved, the hotel could open by
2003. Other parts of the complex would be finished in 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Charles Turnbull's economic advisors point to the $169-million
project as a sign of better economic times ahead for the U.S. territory,
whose local government is $1 billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   Construction alone would pump $62 million in wages into the Virgin
Islands, and $42 million would be spent on materials on the island,
according to documents from the developers.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists worry about what could be lost.</TE>
<TE>   Botany Bay contains petroglyphs from the Ostionoid Indians, who
inhabited the area 1,400 years ago, and there is a ceremonial site that
was used by Taino Indians in pre-Columbian days. The property also holds
a relatively intact abandoned sugar plantation, including a sugar mill
and slave quarters, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly no other property on the island of St. Thomas contains such
a diverse area and has been less affected by development in the past 50
years," said Eleanor Gibney, a botanist.</TE>
<TE>   The area is a refuge for deer and a nesting ground for sea turtles. It
also has some of the healthiest coral reefs around St. Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   The land was owned for decades as a family retreat for the heirs of
the Corning kitchenware empire, but Botany Bay Partners bought it last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The Corning heirs thought the resort project would be much smaller,
family attorney Edith Bornn told a recent public hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "The buyers informed us that their intentions were to develop a very
limited number of luxury homes, on large lots, keeping traffic to a
minimum. It now appears the new owners were misleading us all through the
negotiations," said a letter Bornn read from Paul Corning, grandson of
industrialist Warren Corning.</TE>
<TE>   Local Sen. Adlah Donastorg has appealed to the U.S. Department of the
Interior to help preserve the land. "In the long term, preserving this
area in its natural splendor will provide greater social and economic
benefits than a resort development ever could," Donastorg wrote to the
department.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the Senate rezoned the property from residential to
commercial use, a first step that allowed developers to apply for
building permits. A committee of the Virgin Islands' Department of
Planning and Natural Resources now must consider whether to grant permits
for the project.</TE>

<HD>Hide Fanciers Enjoy Alaska's Bear Market</HD>
<DH>Outdoors: Annual auction offers collectors a chance to come away
with skins that are banned in the Lower 48.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL D'ORO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE
</DL>
<LD>Bill Slavin wanted something out of the ordinary to hang inside his
new cabin in Alabama. An Alaska grizzly bear would be ideal, he decided;
it would exude the mystique of the wild far north.</LD>
<LD>   Grizzly hides are virtually impossible to buy in the Lower 48, where
threatened species are aggressively protected. They're generally not for
sale in Alaska either, Slavin was disappointed to learn during a business
trip to Anchorage last year.</LD>
<LD>   Then he heard about Alaska's annual hide, horn and antler auction--one
of only two exceptions to a state law that prohibits the sale of bear
hides. The Anchorage event was held outdoors last month under a steady
snowfall. The auction is a highlight of the city's yearly Fur Rendezvous,
a 10-day winter celebration.</LD>
<TE>   Slavin successfully bid $775 for a six-foot grizzly with the head and
paws attached, and $250 for a black bear hide. For another $1,500, a
taxidermist will tan the skins, stuff the heads and turn the hides into
bear rugs for Slavin's walls.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kicking myself for not buying another grizzly," he said. "It's a
real Alaska bear, and that's a major attraction. We sure don't see
anything like this in Alabama."</TE>
<TE>   The Alaska Department of Fish and Game sponsors the sale, as well as a
smaller auction in Fairbanks in March, under a law that allows the state
to sell skins and trophies as surplus goods. The bears were killed in
self-defense, by natural causes, by poachers, by vehicles and by wildlife
officials responding to nuisance-bear calls.</TE>
<TE>   "These animals died needlessly in some cases," said Michael McDonald,
Fish and Game's assistant wildlife-management coordinator. "The biggest
good that comes out of this is that the hides can be used. They don't
have to be destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   Alaska law allows the killing of brown bears--as grizzlies are known
in parts of Alaska--and black bears by people who are properly licensed
to hunt during specific seasons. In Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, hunting
of grizzlies is prohibited because those populations are designated as
threatened. Wyoming and Idaho allow hunters to sell hides of the more
plentiful black bears, if they are legally taken.</TE>
<TE>   British Columbia allows hunters to sell hides of grizzlies lawfully
killed, according to Alex Dabrowski, spokesman for the provincial
Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection. The agency also sells surplus
grizzly and other wildlife hides at public auctions.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska prohibits hunters from selling any bear parts, despite the
state's plentiful bear numbers. The state grants special permits to
taxidermists for the sale of bear hides when customers don't pick up
their orders. The permits also are granted to bankruptcy trustees to pay
off debts, to estate executors to unload unwanted heirlooms and to the
state Department of Fish and Game to get rid of excess property.</TE>
<TE>   The agency must first make the skins available for educational
purposes, donating the hides to museums and schools that want them,
McDonald said.</TE>
<TE>   The rest are available to the highest bidders.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people just want an Alaska theme," auctioneer Ron Alleva
said. "It's far less expensive than going on a bear hunt, which can cost
up to $16,000. And for a lot of people, it's better to say, 'I didn't
shoot the bear; I recycled it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Most of the proceeds supplement Fish and Game programs and reimburse
the agency for preserving the hides.</TE>
<TE>   Idaho fishing guide Ken Burkholder was among the 250 people attending
the Anchorage auction, held in a downtown parking lot. The Boise resident
wanted some grizzly hides for his pet project: tying trout flies with the
brown hair.</TE>
<TE>   Burkholder, who usually relies on taxidermists for bear scraps, bought
five hides. Altogether, dozens of brown bear and three black bear hides
were auctioned off, along with the skins of musk oxen, sheep, fox and
otter. Everything was piled high on tables and on the ground, unprotected
from the falling snow. Dozens of moose antlers and caribou racks lined
the shelves of an open trailer.</TE>
<TE>   "It was about the strangest thing I've ever been involved in,"
Burkholder said. "There were all these Jeremiah Johnson types milling
around, wearing lynx faces on their heads, wolf faces, beaver hats. It
was a weird juxtaposition against the backdrop of a modern city."</TE>
<TE>   Burkholder is getting the hides tanned by taxidermist Tim VandenToorn,
who has processed dozens of auction bears since 1990. Because most of the
hides have the face and paws attached, they can even be made into
life-size models--an exhaustive job that runs between $4,000 and $6,000
for grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think you can't find a decent hide there, but they're
wrong," VandenToorn said. "I've tanned a lot of those bears over the
years and have seen some excellent hides."</TE>
<TE>   Most winning bids for brown bears ranged between $400 and $2,700,
slightly higher than in previous sales. But bidders were competing for
just 41 hides--an unusually low number. Most years yield 80 to 100 brown
bears, McDonald said.</TE>

<HD>Tourists' Impact Weighed Where the Buffalo Roam</HD>
<DH>Nature: Bison at Yellowstone and Grand Teton may be getting too
used to snowmobiles. And the compacted trails may be helping the weak to
survive the winter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BECKY BOHRER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo.
</DL>
<LD>On a groomed, snowy trail in the middle of winter, men on
snowmobiles pass almost within arm's reach of a herd of swaggering bison.
The beasts do not so much as flinch when the noisy machines slowly pass.</LD>
<LD>   It seems a peaceful coexistence: resident and traveler enveloped by
the snow-draped majesty deep inside America's first national park,
sharing the same narrow path without conflict.</LD>
<LD>   But for some researchers, this scene that is repeated almost daily
during winter months masks a complex problem that raises questions about
the road ahead for the bison of Yellowstone.</LD>
<TE>   Some who study the animals believe that making the park accessible to
people in winter by maintaining groomed trails used by snowmobiles has
contributed to a change in the bison's natural migration. Maybe more
important, they say, the policy may have disrupted the best natural
population control of the lumbering beasts--winter.</TE>
<TE>   "Winter used to keep the lid on" the bison, says Mary Meagher, a
retired ecologist who studied the animals in Yellowstone during nearly 40
years with the National Park Service.</TE>
<TE>   That agency, now considering banning snowmobiles from Yellowstone and
nearby Grand Teton national parks, has been in conflict with the state of
Montana over how to manage the animals.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the proposed ban usually cite air and noise pollution
from snowmobiles, and concerns about the occasional rider who harasses or
chases wildlife. But Meagher believes that's only one aspect of a greater
problem.</TE>
<TE>   The hard, compacted trails allow bison to move with greater ease
during winter, she says. Instead of trudging through deep powder, the
animals take the path of least resistance, expending less energy so that
fewer die off naturally over the harsh winter.</TE>
<TE>   The increased bison populations and the changed travel patterns may
help explain why, beginning some years ago, more of the animals started
leaving the park in search of food, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Many enter Montana, where ranchers and state agriculture officials
fear that the bison will infect cattle herds with brucellosis, a disease
that causes cows to abort their calves and can cause undulant fever in
humans. Hundreds of bison outside the park have been killed.</TE>
<TE>   Meagher suggests possibly designating trails and viewing areas for
winter tourists but closing other areas to force bison to "relearn"
historic travel patterns. She acknowledges that no clear cause-effect
link has emerged from her data collected over 27 years; other
shorter-term work has contradicted her assertion.</TE>
<TE>   But she says: "Nothing I'm seeing will change my belief that something
is happening with the bison population. I do know where it's going, I
just don't know how far down."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Olliff, branch chief of natural resources at Yellowstone, says
additional research is needed before any direct link can be made between
the use of groomed trails in the park and bison. "The jury is still out,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   But the park has taken steps to minimize the effects of snowmobile
noise and pollution concerns, he says. Yellowstone attracts about 62,000
snowmobilers a year.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, you can detect the effects of recreation on an
individual animal. You can see behavior changes, a response from the
bison. You can detect stress," he says. "What's difficult to do is link
it to a population."</TE>
<TE>   Once dwindling in numbers, bison in the West have come back in recent
decades.</TE>
<TE>   They have long been a touchy subject around Yellowstone.</TE>
<TE>   In the winter of 1996-97, the population in the park was estimated at
3,400. During that same season, nearly 1,100 bison were killed by state
and federal management officials when they left the park and entered
Montana. They were slaughtered under a plan that angered conservationists
and animal-rights groups.</TE>
<TE>   After years of work, Montana, the Park Service and other agencies
agreed in December 2000 on a management plan that is intended to maintain
a population of up to 3,000 bison, and allows the animals to seek winter
range outside the park.</TE>
<TE>   If too many leave during winter, state and park monitors use
helicopters and snowmobiles to try to haze them back inside Yellowstone's
borders. If that doesn't work, the animals are captured and tested for
brucellosis.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 34 bison captured this year after hazing efforts failed, 23
tested positive for brucellosis and were slaughtered, according to
Montana's Department of Livestock.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists and animal-rights groups say hazing is stressful for
wild animals and unnecessary; they say there has never been a confirmed
case of cattle contracting brucellosis from bison in the wild. But
scientists and management officials say a risk exists and are seeking
ways to mitigate it.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Gogan, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, has
studied Yellowstone's bison and says it is natural that the animals have
expanded their range as their numbers have grown in the last 20 years.
But whether that growth is caused by groomed trails or a combination of
factors, including climate and the social tendencies of bison, remains
unclear, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration, citing pollution concerns, proposed
phasing out all recreational snowmobile use in the park by winter
2003-2004.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure, the Bush administration backed away from that plan and
agreed to have the Park Service conduct another environmental study,
which is scheduled to be available for public comment by March 29.</TE>
<TE>   The new study's four options are:</TE>
<TE>   * Keeping Clinton's plan.</TE>
<TE>   * Keeping Clinton's rules but delaying their effect.</TE>
<TE>   * Permitting unguided snowmobiling if the machines are quieter and
less polluting.</TE>
<TE>   * Permitting only guided snowmobile tours, and only if those machines
meet stricter noise and pollution standards. The number of snowmobiles
allowed to enter the parks would be limited.</TE>
<TE>   A final decision is expected by November.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Yellowstone officials continue trying to balance their
mandate of protecting the park's wildlife while maintaining the public's
right to visit.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost every question becomes a controversy," said John Sacklin, the
park's chief of planning and compliance. "There are no simple answers and
they're not easily resolved."</TE>

<HD>New Cigarette Tax Sends Smokers Packing</HD>
<DH>Lifestyles: Large tariff increase has sent people in border areas
to neighboring states in search of lower prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>STATE LINE, Idaho
</DL>
<LD>On a cold, wet Friday morning, the parking lot at the A to Z State
Line Smoke Shop was packed with vehicles with Washington license plates.</LD>
<LD>   After Jan. 1, when Washington raised its cigarette tax to $1.42 per
pack, making it the highest in the nation, many smokers in border areas
made resolutions to travel to Idaho or Oregon for cheaper smokes.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, the drop in Washington cigarette sales is far higher than
expected, Washington state officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "We've talked with some of the retailers on the Washington side of the
border and they said they've been cut almost in half," said Carter
Mitchell of the Washington Liquor Control Board, which is charged with
blocking the import of untaxed cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   "On the Oregon side, they say sales have almost doubled," said
Mitchell, tax enforcement officer for the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Smokers have plenty of incentive to rush across the border.</TE>
<TE>   The state tax on a carton of cigarettes in Washington is $14.25. It's
just $2.80 in Idaho and $6.80 in Oregon, Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, a carton of Marlboros that costs $30.99 in State Line
costs $48.99 at the Albertson's in nearby Liberty Lake, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   A carton of Camels that costs $23.99 in State Line was also $48.99 at
the Albertson's.</TE>
<TE>   It's illegal to bring unlicensed cigarettes into Washington, so no one
at State Line was much interested in discussing why they were buying
cigarettes at the three smoke shops near Interstate 90.</TE>
<TE>   Employees of the shops were also reluctant to talk about their new
customers, fearing publicity would bring increased law enforcement and
scare off the windfall business.</TE>
<TE>   "We respect the privacy of our customers," said a woman who worked at
the A to Z. "People fear the sting. If they get caught with them, it's up
to a $5,000 fine."</TE>
<TE>   Washington cigarette shop owners were less reticent.</TE>
<TE>   "January has always been my busiest month of the year because of
snow," said Brian Mealey, owner of the Tobacco Station in Spokane. "This
January was one of the slowest months I ever had. It definitely affected
us."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell said it is unclear if the flurry of out-of-state sales will
continue or taper off.</TE>
<TE>   The new tax increase was passed as Initiative 773 in November with 66%
of the vote. It raised the tobacco tax by 60 cents a pack, with the money
slated for health care for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   About 24% of Washington adults smoke, and the new tax was expected to
cost a pack-a-day smoker $220 a year. It was expected to raise $120
million a year in new revenue, but that is unsure because of the drop in
sales.</TE>
<TE>   There's nothing new about people in border areas traveling for a good
deal. Many in Washington, where the sales tax is more than 8%, shop
across the border in Oregon, which doesn't have a sales tax.</TE>
<TE>   Washington residents have also long been able to get cheaper
cigarettes on Indian reservations and military bases, which do not charge
the state tax.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the tax was raised, one of every three packs of cigarettes
in Washington was not taxed by the state, said Mike Gowrylow of the
Department of Revenue. Two-thirds of those cigarettes were bought on
Indian reservations or military bases. One-third were smuggled in from
other states.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators expected a certain amount of lost sales with the increased
tax.</TE>
<TE>   Washington regulators have widely publicized that they are patrolling
border areas, looking for contraband smokes. But the reality is they are
not.</TE>
<TE>   State agents have not made a single stop on cigarette violations since
the higher tax went into effect, Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   Enforcing such a law is labor-intensive. Officers would have to
witness someone buying cigarettes, follow them across the border, and
then pull them over, issue a ticket and take the smokes as evidence,
Mitchell said. The crime is a gross misdemeanor, and violators can be
charged a minimum of $250 or $10 a pack, whichever is higher.</TE>

<HD>Remote FAA Techs Get by on Wing and Prayer</HD>
<DH>Alaska: Keeping various systems operational in a harsh climate
tests the mettle of a special group of workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAUREEN CLARK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MIDDLETON ISLAND, Alaska
</DL>
<LD>When a winter snowstorm blanketed the runway on this lonely,
wind-swept island in the Gulf of Alaska in January, Jim Simpkins and Rich
Edwards couldn't get to work.</LD>
<LD>   Simpkins and Edwards take care of the Federal Aviation
Administration's radar, communications and navigation systems on
Middleton Island as well as the runway, the buildings that house the
equipment and the power plant that keeps it all running.</LD>
<LD>   Their chartered plane couldn't land in the snow and there was no one
on the tiny island, 170 miles southeast of Anchorage, to operate the
runway snowplow. So the two returned to their base in Kenai and quickly
made arrangements to fly back to the island--this time in a helicopter.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't believe in taking chances. We like to play it on the safe
side," said Simpkins, who has worked as an FAA technician in Alaska for
more than 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   For the 240 FAA technicians who travel around the state installing,
repairing and maintaining the equipment that supports the aviation
system, getting to the job site is sometimes the toughest part of the
job.</TE>
<TE>   It can mean hiking up steep slopes and slogging through swampy tundra,
fighting off mosquitoes, and keeping watch for grizzly and polar bears.</TE>
<TE>   More than once, grizzly bears have used the approach lights at the
Cold Bay airport as back-scratchers and knocked the lights out, said Vern
Jensen, now an FAA supervisor who worked as a technician for many years
in southwest Alaska. Techs sent out to repair the damage are armed and
travel in pairs.</TE>
<TE>   The work can require travel by boat, snowmobile, helicopter and
all-terrain vehicle. And when the weather turns bad, the techs can find
themselves stuck in remote areas for days at a time. One technician was
stuck on Atka Island in the Aleutians for 19 days last year when weather
socked in the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be a bit of an adventurer and be flexible. You can't
expect to drive to your site and be home every evening," said Fred Jack,
a manager with the FAA's Airway Facilities Division.</TE>
<TE>   Although their work is usually invisible to the flying public, FAA
technicians play a critical role in keeping the state's air
transportation system working. And in a state with few roads, where
planes carry everything from food to fuel to schoolchildren, the loss of
a navigation aid can quickly affect daily life.</TE>
<TE>   "When you live in a village, you realize how much you count on planes.
You feel the impact of every missed flight," Jensen said</TE>
<TE>   But there are risks. FAA technicians are routinely required to fly
into small airports where navigation or communication systems may not be
working. And flying in small planes in remote areas of Alaska, where the
terrain is rugged and weather can change quickly, has its own hazards.</TE>
<TE>   Plane crashes have been the leading cause of occupational fatalities
in Alaska in recent years. The National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health says Alaska averages about one aviation fatality every 10
days. Of those deaths, roughly half are classified as occupational, with
pilots making up about half of those.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 18, FAA technicians Joyce Tucker and Ronald Frizell were
killed along with Era Aviation pilot Bob Larson when their helicopter
crashed into the chilly waters of Cook Inlet. Co-workers Steven Durand
and William Dick survived and are recovering.</TE>
<TE>   The crew had been making repairs and doing routine maintenance on
navigation aids on Fire Island, an uninhabited isle five miles west of
the Anchorage airport. The chopper went down in a snowstorm as the crew
was making the short trip home to Anchorage.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA takes steps to minimize the risks to technicians. All receive
survival training, including a course in how to survive a plane crash.
They are allowed to decide whether they want to fly without fear of
getting fired, said Denny Powell, the FAA's manager of airway facilities
in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   But efforts to improve aviation safety in Alaska have led to the
installation of equipment in ever more remote areas, Powell said. Two
dozen video cameras installed around the state enable pilots to check
weather conditions with a quick look at an FAA Web site. Those cameras
can be a challenge to maintain.</TE>
<TE>   "We're installing more facilities in inhospitable locations. People
want more and more of this, but it does put our folks in peril," Powell
said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the importance of the facilities on Middleton, the FAA
sends technicians to the island to monitor and maintain the systems there
on a regular basis. In addition to navigation aids, Middleton is home to
the FAA's long-range radar system, which tracks planes flying to and from
Anchorage.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very critical site. It's what brings aircraft in from the
Lower 48," said Jack McAlister, the FAA's manager of technical support
for southern Alaska. "This radar goes down and everybody flips.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have family that flies, you can thank these guys for keeping
them alive."</TE>
<TE>   Simpkins is the electronics and radar technician for Middleton.
Edwards is the environmental systems technician, taking care of
everything from the power generator to the plumbing.</TE>
<TE>   The two work eight-day shifts on the island and return home for a
six-day break between each shift. It's an unusual schedule and there is
little to distract them from their work.</TE>
<TE>   Middleton Island is a narrow spit of sand just a couple miles long.
The only year-round inhabitants are hundreds of rabbits and a variety of
seabirds. The techs must bring food and drinking water with them. Their
living quarters are in a corrugated metal building that also houses radar
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Both men often work alone for hours at a time and say they like the
problem-solving aspect of their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "And it helps if you like to fly," Simpkins said.</TE>

<LD>When Usha Venkatesh arrived in Phoenix from India six years ago,
after her marriage was arranged with a local software engineer, she had
few friends and no family to turn to here.</LD>
<LD>   Already homesick, her loneliness was compounded by the fact that there
were no Hindu places of worship in Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   "There was a void in my heart," she said. "I used to go to the temple
every Saturday morning when I was back home. And here, I couldn't go even
on special occasions."</LD>
<TE>   These days, Venkatesh can take her pick.</TE>
<TE>   The last few years have seen the culmination of years of efforts by
the local Indian community to establish Hindu pockets of worship in
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   There are now four Hindu temples and an International Society for
Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) center in the Phoenix area, another ISKCON
center in Tucson and a Hindu temple in Yuma, along the Arizona-California
line.</TE>
<TE>   "The Indian community wanted to have a common gathering ground where
people could meet and pray," said Krishnan Bala, a local dentist and vice
president of the Maha Ganapati temple in Maricopa, south of Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   When Bala moved to Phoenix 22 years ago, there were only about 500
Indian families in the metro area, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The population has swelled considerably, said Bala, as corporations
like Intel, Motorola and Honeywell have attracted software engineers and
other high-tech professionals from India to the region.</TE>
<TE>   The temples fulfill a need for Hindu families to congregate and pray
and teach their U.S.-born children about their cultural heritage.</TE>
<TE>   When the ISKCON society, commonly known as the Hare Krishna movement,
opened its doors in 1996 to Phoenix residents, it received an
overwhelming response from the Hindu community.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no room to stand during the arathi [services]," said Bhakta
Raj Das, director of the center in Chandler, a suburb southeast of
Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Located on a half-acre plot that once housed a martial arts school,
the temple attracts Hindus from as far away as Flagstaff in northern
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The meditation hall at the center is packed every Sunday evening with
close to 200 devotees chanting hymns and swaying to music.</TE>
<TE>   The smell of Indian spices wafts through the hallway, while the sound
of drums and the harmonium filters through the walls.</TE>
<TE>   The hall is crammed with a diverse crowd including both Indians and
Americans, some dressed in jeans, others in saris or saffron robes.</TE>
<TE>   Clapping to the beat and moving to the rhythm, the crowd sings the
praises of Lord Krishna before lining up to receive the weekly feast that
a family has sponsored that evening.</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with their philosophy, all Hare Krishna temples serve only
lacto-vegetarian food, prepared by devotees in the kitchen on the
premises.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody can help in the kitchen, or with decorating and cleaning the
temple," said Bhakta Raj Das, who oversees the daily operations of the
center assisted by a staff of 12 full-time disciples who live there.</TE>
<TE>   The temple has a library, a gift shop and a Sunday school where about
30 children gather weekly to learn about Indian culture, recite prayers
from the ancient scriptures and learn Hindi.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more like a spiritual education to help the children retain
their heritage," said Bhakta Raj Das.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to teach our children about our culture," added Shiva
Ramachandran, who is on the board of directors at the Maha Ganapati
temple in Maricopa.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Sunday morning, his 6-year-old daughter, Akila, dressed in
bright Indian clothes, boldly recited prayers before a gathering of about
50 people while her 2-year-old sister napped in her father's lap.</TE>
<TE>   A regular visitor to the temple along with his wife and children,
Shiva continues his children's spiritual education at home when the
family gathers for prayers every morning and evening.</TE>
<TE>   Beenu Govindrao also tries to retain her daughters' Indian heritage as
much as possible by taking them to a second Hindu temple in Chandler
every week. Her younger daughter, Kavya, 11, learns the veena, a stringed
Indian musical instrument, from a teacher there, while her older
daughter, Sneha, 13, listens.</TE>
<TE>   "They love going to the temple," Beenu said. "I want them to be
exposed to the temple culture as much as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Planning is now under way to build a traditional Hindu temple at the
current Maricopa site, spread on 15 acres of land donated by Bala.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to serve the community by building an open temple for
everybody to come and worship," said Bala.</TE>
<TE>   Similar sentiments drove efforts to establish the Hindu Temple of
Arizona in Scottsdale, which opened in a former church last June.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to form a temple that would serve the whole Indian
community," said Hara Misra, president of the Scottsdale temple. "We are
very pleased with the response from the Indian community."</TE>

<DL>EL CAJON, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>Laura Davis said she felt drawn to the quiet patch of shade under
an oak tree where searchers last week found the body of 7-year-old
Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   "The memory of her soul compelled me to come down here and say a last
goodbye," 26-year-old Davis said Friday, cradling her 7-month-old
daughter and wiping away tears. "To actually see the place where her
innocent sweetness was lying under a tree."</LD>
<LD>   Davis added white flowers to a growing memorial of messages, bouquets,
a pink teddy bear and stuffed blue bunny that marks the place where
authorities believe a neighbor dumped Danielle's body.</LD>
<TE>   Dental records confirmed Thursday that remains found by a rural
roadside 25 miles east of San Diego were those of the girl, who vanished
from her bedroom Feb. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of death could not immediately be determined--and may never
be--because of the body's state of decomposition, said Police Chief David
Bejarano. Further tests were under way.</TE>
<TE>   Danielle's parents, Brenda and Damon van Dam, said the unflagging
efforts of more than 2,500 volunteers who searched a vast area stretching
from the ocean to the desert left them with "an overwhelming sense of
gratitude and closure."</TE>
<TE>   "With love for an innocent child and for one another, the community
has brought her back to us, and for that gift we offer our most sincere
and heartfelt thanks," the van Dams said in a statement. "Even though the
final outcome is horrible, we could not have imagined the rest of our
lives without this closure."</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is expected later this month.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor David Westerfield, 50, was charged Tuesday with murder,
kidnapping and possession of child pornography. He has pleaded innocent
and is being held without bond.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they found traces of Danielle's blood in
Westerfield's motor home and on an article of his clothing.</TE>
<TE>   The self-employed engineer spent the weekend of Danielle's
disappearance traveling in his motor home, stopping in the desert east of
the city, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   A hunch led volunteers to the area--the remote road was one
Westerfield might have taken the weekend Danielle disappeared, said Bill
Garcia, a private detective.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby residents said they were unsettled by the discovery of
Danielle's body so close to home.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of sickens us," said Charles O'Neill, 28, who lives about a
mile away. "We've been driving by every day . . . and knowing she's that
close is something we never would have imagined."</TE>

<HD>Science Could Help to Crack Anthrax Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Federal investigators, stymied for months in their pursuit of the
anthrax killer, said they are laying the groundwork for a science-based
prosecution and are watching closely a small number of individuals
believed capable of launching the bioterrorist attack-by-mail that left
five people dead last fall.</LD>
<LD>   FBI agents here and abroad have interviewed hundreds of people,
executed dozens of search warrants, searched for the machine used to copy
the letters and reviewed thousands of documents and records in connection
with the case, according to those familiar with the investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Still, officials said that they do not have a "prime suspect" in the
case and that most of their progress has come in eliminating false leads.
They believe their best chance at narrowing the list of potential
suspects might lie in a scientific breakthrough that allows researchers
to distinguish between stocks of the same strain of anthrax.</LD>
<TE>   The FBI moved forward on that track last week, delivering subpoenas to
U.S. laboratories known to have the same virulent Ames strain of anthrax
used to kill five people and sicken at least 13 others.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers who received the subpoenas--believed to have gone to 12 to
20 laboratories--said they have been asked to follow strict guidelines
and then ship samples to Army researchers at Ft. Detrick in Maryland by
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Hugh-Jones, an anthrax expert at Louisiana State University
whose laboratory received a subpoena, estimated it would then take
scientists working with the FBI "three weeks to a month" to determine if
any of those anthrax samples match the stock used in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   But those who have conducted anthrax research point out that the list
of samples the FBI is trying to acquire may not be exhaustive because, in
the past, researchers traded samples somewhat freely. The government has
regulated such exchanges of hazardous materials since 1996. FBI Director
Robert Mueller said Friday that the demand for samples--long expected
within the scientific community--comes now because the agency first
wanted to establish investigative standards that they could explain to a
jury and that would hold up in court.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have had to move carefully to establish "scientific
procedures that were utilized to make that match, the same way we would
have to with fingerprints and DNA and the like," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller noted that the undertaking is "not a simple matter."</TE>
<TE>   "Down the road, we hope to be in a position to prosecute somebody,"
Mueller said. "And when we are in a position to prosecute the individual
responsible for this, we are going to have to come into court and explain
to the jury exactly the process we went through to identify this
individual."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have worked aggressively to better understand anthrax since
the bioterrorist attack began. Significant progress has been made since
mid-November, when an anthrax-laden letter sent to Sen. Patrick J. Leahy
(D-Vt.) was found in barrels of quarantined government mail. The Leahy
letter, which investigators opened only after considerable planning so
that they could retain as much of the substance as possible, gave
researchers enough material to conduct extensive testing on the lethal
spores. Those tests are ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   Last month at a conference in Las Vegas, Dr. Paul Keim, a Northern
Arizona University researcher who is working closely with the FBI,
announced that he had found a way to distinguish between stocks of the
Ames strain--opening the possibility that the source of the attack spores
could be definitively determined.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, labs led by Paul Jackson at Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico and Claire M. Fraser of the private Institute
for Genomic Research in Rockville, Md., are working on how to determine a
genetic fingerprint for the spores contained in the letters sent to
Capitol Hill and to the media.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI recently appealed again to the small community of anthrax
researchers, asking them to consider whether anyone they know fits the
profile of the likely suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Songer, an anthrax researcher at the University of Arizona, said
he doubted the plea would yield much useful information.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this is the sort of thing that would be done by a
person so out of the ordinary--out of the normal--that he or she would
stand out," Songer said. "If you were intelligent enough, informed enough
to do this sort of thing, you would be intelligent enough to keep it a
secret." But another researcher recently alleged that FBI officials
already suspected a specific person but that they had been slow to take
action because that person had for many years worked on sensitive
government projects.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller last week dismissed those allegations, as well as grumblings
that the FBI had failed to consult enough anthrax experts.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody has indicated that we have a suspect and that we have been
dragging our feet because . . . that person was somehow employed by the
federal government at some point," Mueller said. "That is totally
inaccurate. We have moved as fast as I think could be expected under the
circumstances in all avenues of the investigation."</TE>
<TE>   A federal law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said there is no prime suspect in the case but an evolving
list of people that numbers "more than a handful."</TE>
<TE>   "A suspect suggests someone that you have information on or that we're
moving toward" in a criminal prosecution, the official said. "We're not
there yet."</TE>
<TE>   The anthrax attacks have left investigators baffled at many turns
since early October, when Robert Stevens, 63, a tabloid photo editor in
Florida, became the first person to die of inhalation anthrax in the U.S.
since 1976.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Stevens' illness at first was called "isolated" by Health and
Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, who suggested he had
contracted the bacteria while drinking from a stream.</TE>
<TE>   But a week after Stevens' death, evidence of a bioterrorist attack
began to emerge. A case of skin anthrax was confirmed in an assistant to
NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw.</TE>
<TE>   In all, four anthrax-laced letters--to Brokaw, Leahy, Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and the New York Post--were recovered.
Investigators believe others were sent but not recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Public health officials were slow to recognize the danger to those who
worked in the postal facilities where the tainted letters were processed,
and two Washington-area mail workers--Joseph P. Curseen Jr., 47, and
Thomas L. Morris Jr., 55--died.</TE>
<TE>   Still unexplained is how two women--one in New York City and the other
in rural Connecticut--came in contact with the same deadly bacteria.
Public health officials and law enforcement agents could find no trace of
anthrax at any place the women were known to have been.</TE>
<TE>   Because their cases fell so far from the known path of the anthrax
letters, investigators at first thought the women's deaths might provide
clues that would lead them to the sender of the letters.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy T. Nguyen, 61, lived in the Bronx and worked at a hospital in
Manhattan. She rode the subway regularly but had few close friends. By
the time investigators determined she was ill from inhalation anthrax,
she was on a ventilator.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most puzzling is the death of Ottilie W. Lundgren, 94, who
never left her Connecticut home without assistance and kept a very
limited schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Lundgren's death on Nov. 21, the FBI had released a
profile of the likely perpetrator, describing a "lone wolf" without
terrorist links, an adult male with scientific knowledge who was familiar
with the Trenton, N.J., area where the letters were mailed.</TE>
<TE>   Still Mueller, whose comments last week were his most extensive on the
anthrax case in some time, said the investigation was proceeding in a
"number of directions" and that he could not rule out a tie-in between
the sender and a terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not focusing on just one facility or even a series of
facilities. We are open to any possibilities," he said. "I would be
reluctant to specify where we think ultimately we will find the
individual."</TE>

<HD>Jockeying for Parade Starts With 'Theme Draft' Picks</HD>
<DH>Planning: At February meeting, float builders learn if they'll be
creating dragons or giraffes.</DH>
<SE>First in an occasional series on the 2003 Tournament of Roses
</SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"No more dragons, please," Joe Delgatto says wearily into the
microphone. "For the last time, we have too many dragons."</LD>
<LD>   The words of this Sierra Madre dry cleaner spread over the Rose Room
like a pesticide. About 40 people, nearly all of them men hunched at
circular tables, groan. Rifling through briefcases and file folders, they
begin to discard line drawings of floral parade floats--floats with
dancing dragons, dragons swimming in the ocean, dragons riding in fire
engines.</LD>
<LD>   One man, instead of trashing his dragon float drawing, takes a pink
pen, draws an X through the dragon and in block letters writes in:
"GIRAFFE."</LD>
<TE>   This is the Theme Draft, the odd and unofficial kickoff of next year's
Tournament of Roses parade. The planning of parade floats is now a
year-round, multimillion-dollar enterprise. The draft, a
behind-closed-doors event, serves to prevent the chaos of too many eagles
or eggshells, dolls or dogs, polo players or potbellied pigs.</TE>
<TE>   The float builders--five cities, one university and four small
companies that make their living constructing Rose Parade floats for
corporate sponsors and nonprofits--must reserve each theme they intend to
use.</TE>
<TE>   It will take them about four hours, with builders taking turns
claiming themes over 20 rounds the way pro basketball teams pick prized
rookies. The process offers a rear window on a Southern California
tradition, like a glimpse inside Wolfgang Puck's kitchen. It blends the
feel of a carnival rehearsal with the formality of international
diplomacy, the tension of a family reunion, the obsessiveness of Martha
Stewart and the strategy of a silent auction. In all, more than 150
themes will be reserved on this Wednesday in February for a parade that
will ultimately have fewer than 55 floats.</TE>
<TE>   The builders arrive shortly before 8:30 a.m., a starting time that,
like everything about the Theme Draft, is set down in a handbook that
runs 42 pages. They sit at circular tables that must be 54 inches in
diameter and eat a continental breakfast with coffee that must be brewed
in a pot with the Tournament of Roses logo.</TE>
<TE>   The coffee is appreciated. The builders have spent the weeks between
the Jan. 1 parade and the draft compiling black-and-white drawings of
possible floats on 8 1/2-by-11-inch sheets of paper. The floats must have
some connection to the parade's overall theme--2003's will be "Children's
Dreams, Wishes and Imagination"--but there are few other limits on
design.</TE>
<TE>   The presidents of the two largest building companies, Phoenix
Decorating Co. and Fiesta Parade Floats, have brought more than 100
drawings of prospective floats. Both companies conducted mock drafts in
the days beforehand, creating a priority list of their drawings like the
Green Bay Packers rate collegiate prospects.</TE>
<TE>   As the draft starts, the builders must remain seated at the round
tables. Direct communication between the builders and the parade
volunteers who administer the draft is forbidden. Lower-level parade
volunteers serve as "runners," bringing the submitted designs from the
circular tables where the builders sit to the panel of rectangular
tables, where the judges pore over them.</TE>
<TE>   Mike McFatridge, 31, construction chairman for South Pasadena's
citizen-built entry, reaches into a glass bowl and selects a piece of
paper with the number 1. He'll have the very first pick of themes.</TE>
<TE>   "Excellent!" he says. "We've got our circus train locked up!"</TE>
<TE>   South Pasadena's good luck only adds to the anxiety at other tables.
The four float-building firms want desperately to snap up float concepts
favored by companies and nonprofits that have long sponsored floats;
Phoenix has already pre-sold four or five float concepts. But if a city
with a high draft pick snaps up that concept, the building company won't
have it to sell.</TE>
<TE>   "The first two rounds are the toughest," says Larry Crane, who owns
Charisma Floats, which had four floats in the 2002 parade. "I submit
things that I really want to have, and then I hold my breath."</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the tension, the cities of Downey and La Canada Flintridge
have drawn the second and third choices. Phoenix President Bill
Lofthouse, who has the fourth pick, is anxiously grumbling about "the
silliness of this" process.</TE>
<TE>   The draft is as secretive as it is strange. The builders all have deep
personal and family connections to the parade and each other. In just one
example, the father of Fiesta's president worked with the presidents of
two of his son's competitors. The companies have varying reputations;
Phoenix is known for its size and animation prowess, and Fiesta for its
innovation in decorations (last year's big advance: dehydrated carrots).
But in truth, the designers think remarkably alike. At the draft, the
builders sit apart and rarely talk, conscious of theme theft.</TE>
<TE>   "We play our floats extremely close to the vest," says Fiesta
President Tim Estes.</TE>
<TE>   For all the anxiety and complaints of the four builders, the draft in
many ways is structured to preserve those companies' stranglehold on the
parade. Only the builders who had floats in last year's parade can draft
in the first 10 rounds. Two prospective new builders, unable to reserve a
theme before round 11, failed to even show up at this year's draft.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a rule grants four draft picks to each builder for every
float in the previous year's parade. Phoenix, which built 25 of the 53
floats in 2002, thus gets 100 draft picks in the Theme Draft--in other
words, an average of five per round. In this year's first round alone,
Phoenix will reserve sailboat, firemen, Spanish arch, steamboat and candy
themes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to break into this parade as a new builder," says
Crane of Charisma Floats, who explains that the process must be fair to
companies, like his, that are dedicated entirely to the Rose Parade. "And
it isn't easy to grow."</TE>
<TE>   Once all the first-round draft picks have been submitted, Joe Delgatto
and his team of judges go to work. They, too, are a bit tense. Like all
Tournament volunteers, they are graded each year on the quality of their
demeanor and work; advancement in the Tournament's hierarchy depends on
those grades.</TE>
<TE>   This is the 30th year that Delgatto, a Wisconsin native who moved to
Southern California in his teens, has been a Tournament volunteer, but
it's his first overseeing the draft. Judging the proposed themes with him
are chairmen of three other Tournament committees, including his younger
brother John, an independent music producer and publisher who oversees
the parade's float construction effort.</TE>
<TE>   The Delgattos and their fellow judges--an accountant, a Los Angeles
firefighter and a retired hospital marketing executive--now study the
submitted first-round drawings. Do the renderings have some reference to
children and dreams, the overall theme? And are they repetitive? The
judges also flag floats that could provide potential logistical problems.
Looking over La Canada's first pick, called "Firehouse Fun," Joe Delgatto
raises an eyebrow and says: "I hope that doesn't mean real water."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Thomas, the red-jacketed Tournament president who picked the
overall theme, peers over judges' shoulders and steps in to guide the
discussion. At one point, Thomas orders all the judges into the
Tournament library for a reminder to speed up--and to watch their
comments in the presence of a reporter Delgatto invited.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the judging table, repetition of elements in different floats
becomes the major concern.</TE>
<TE>   Fiesta, with the sixth pick, reserves a dragon theme. So Festival,
with the eighth pick, is forced to alter its dragon theme. A dog becomes
a cat in another design. Phoenix must revise its candy-theme float
because a design submitted by the Cal Poly University campuses in Pomona
and San Luis Obispo, whose students build a float every year, also has
candy elements. Delgatto is uncomfortable with the decision--he thinks
the Phoenix design should be thrown out--but Thomas overrules him.</TE>
<TE>   "We can split [the floats] up" in the parade, Thomas says.</TE>
<TE>   As the rounds progress, repetition becomes so great that Delgatto
rules out entire classes of floats entirely. "Boats and ships" are
disqualified after the seventh round. By the 13th round, Delgatto is
declaring: "No more fire engines or flying horses."</TE>
<TE>   The mood becomes lighter as the draft goes on. Despite the
disqualifications, the builders have succeeded in reserving their most
desired themes. The judges amuse themselves by guessing which company
will sponsor the design. Of an airplane-themed float, Thomas quips:
"That's got Boeing written all over it." They also note the recycling of
pieces from earlier parades ("I see the AT&amp;T clock is back").</TE>
<TE>   Looking at a Festival Arts design for a float with two parachutists on
bungee cords, Joe Delgatto points and needles Thomas: "President and vice
president."</TE>
<TE>   "No," the president counters. "The flying brothers Delgatto."</TE>
<TE>   After 20 rounds, the draft ends, but the Delgattos' high-wire act is
not over. Volunteers will spend the following weeks reviewing the draft
for any unnoticed repetition. Sponsors will have to commit.</TE>
<TE>   Builders will have until May 1 to sell the float designs they reserved
to sponsors. If a design doesn't sell by then, the builder forfeits his
rights to it. And even those designs that do sell are subject to
extensive review from the Tournament's Design Variance Committee, of
which the Delgatto brothers are both members.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think the Theme Draft is crazy," says Joe Delgatto, "you ought
to see us meet in committee."</TE>

<DH>Investigation: Islamic militants in Philippines and Indonesia use
bombings, robberies to wage holy war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia
</DL>
<LD>Terror suspects connected to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network
organized and financed a wave of deadly bombings in Indonesia and the
Philippines over the last 14 months to advance a holy war aimed at
carving out an Islamic state in Southeast Asia.</LD>
<LD>   Evidence pieced together from the accounts of admitted bombing
participants, official documents and interviews with authorities shows
that the Jemaah Islamiah terror ring has orchestrated a campaign of
violence against Christians in the region.</LD>
<LD>   The clandestine group's activities have included bombing at least 18
churches and other civilian targets, robbing banks to raise funds for
holy war, assassinating a Christian politician in Malaysia and mobilizing
militant Muslims to fight in remote islands of Indonesia. Acts of
violence masterminded by the group have killed at least 35 people and
injured more than 230, according to police accounts.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities determined late last year that the group was preparing to
set off seven truck bombs simultaneously in Singapore to destroy targets
that included the U.S. Embassy and prominent American businesses. Police
in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines have arrested more than 40
people allegedly connected to the network. On Friday, the Singaporean
government released excerpts of surveillance videos, made by Jemaah
Islamiah members, of the embassy and other bombing targets.</TE>
<TE>   But the group had a far broader reach and more ambitious plans than
previously thought.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Bakar Bashir, an Indonesian cleric identified by authorities in
Singapore and Malaysia as the ideological leader of Jemaah Islamiah, says
Muslims are waging a holy war to establish an Islamic state. The focus of
the fighting has been a triangular area that includes the province of
Mindanao in the southern Philippines and Sulawesi and the Molucca Islands
in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir denies any part in terrorism but says the suffering of Muslims
justifies the bombing of targets outside the combat zone, including
churches that support Christians in the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "Where there are Muslims being oppressed, there is jihad," he said in
an interview. "If a Muslim is being oppressed, it is compulsory for other
Muslims to defend him."</TE>
<TE>   Two figures have emerged as the architects of the terror campaign,
according to official accounts:Riduan Isamuddin, an Indonesian cleric
better known as Hambali; and Faiz bin Abu Bakar Bafana, a naturalized
Malaysian who has been arrested in his native Singapore. Indonesia has
issued an arrest warrant for Hambali, who is on the run. He is wanted by
both Malaysia and Singapore. Authorities say both Hambali and Bafana are
top leaders of Jemaah Islamiah and have clear links to Al Qaeda. Police
and witnesses say both were personally involved in planning bombings that
killed dozens of people.</TE>
<TE>Jakarta Mall Bomber Came From Malaysia</TE>
<TE>   When Taufik Abdul Halim blew off his lower right leg at a Jakarta
shopping mall Aug. 1, police say it was Indonesia's first known attack by
an international terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia had been plagued since 2000 by a series of bombings, many of
them targeting crowded churches. Some blasts were blamed on separatists
from the province of Aceh, others on disaffected members of the military.</TE>
<TE>   But until the mall explosion, which occurred six weeks before Sept.
11, police had not connected the attacks to international terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Halim, 27, placed a bomb in a cardboard Dunkin' Donuts box
and was carrying it into the Atrium mall when it exploded prematurely,
injuring him and six others. After his arrest, investigators discovered
he was a Malaysian citizen and belonged to the Malaysian Moujahedeen
Group, a terrorist organization now understood to be closely connected to
Jemaah Islamiah.</TE>
<TE>   Halim said in an interview with The Times at the central Jakarta
courthouse that he entered Indonesia illegally in 2000 and went to Ambon,
the provincial capital of the Moluccas, to support the 3-year-old jihad
against Christians. Several months later, he traveled to Jakarta, the
national capital, where authorities say he took part in at least one
church bombing before the Atrium blast.</TE>
<TE>   Halim's arrest led police to Dedi Setiono, better known as Abbas, an
Indonesian who has acknowledged receiving military training in
Afghanistan. Abbas admitted driving Halim and the bomb to the mall in the
hope of killing Christians.</TE>
<TE>   "They wanted to blow up the Atrium because they thought there was an
office of a Christian group upstairs that financed the Christians in
Ambon," said Muchtar Luthfi, Abbas' lawyer. "He believed that this was a
continuation of the war from Ambon to Jakarta."</TE>
<TE>Christians to Blame in Moluccas, Militant Says</TE>
<TE>   In a courthouse interview, Abbas said the fighting in the Moluccas is
a religious war against Christians. "The conflict in the Moluccas is
actually about faith," he said. "They started first, and we are just
defending ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Abbas, 40, proved to be a key link to Hambali, the Jemaah Islamiah's
alleged operations leader. He said he first met Hambali in 1987, when
they were both aiding anti-Soviet fighters in Afghanistan. They later met
again in Ambon, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Abbas confessed to police that he attended a meeting with Hambali in
Jakarta in late 2000 to plot seven church bombings on Christmas Eve.
Abbas said that Hambali was the main organizer and financier of the plot
and that he was assisted by another Indonesian cleric named Imam Samudra.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Hambali appointed Abbas field commander of the Jakarta
church bombings.</TE>
<TE>   Some investigators believe that Hambali is Al Qaeda's point man in
Southeast Asia. Members of Jemaah Islamiah arrested in Malaysia told
police that he boasted of meeting several times with Osama bin Laden, and
Malaysian officials believe that he knew of plans for the Sept. 11
attacks in the United States before they occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Hambali has been involved in terrorist plots tied to
Al Qaeda in at least four countries. In the Philippines, they say,
Hambali helped finance a 1995 plan to bomb 12 airliners and kill Pope
John Paul II. In Malaysia, officials say, he hosted two of the Sept. 11
hijackers and a suspect in the Yemen bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole
in October 2000. In Singapore, authorities say, he sent Jemaah Islamiah
recruits to train at Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan and helped plan the
foiled embassy bomb plot.</TE>
<TE>   Hambali, along with other Jemaah Islamiah leaders, based his
operations in Malaysia, where he used prayer groups to attract recruits.
In late 2000, authorities say, he returned to his native Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   "We have information that Hambali told his friends in Malaysia that he
would come to Indonesia and would have a small party," said Brig. Gen.
Saleh Saaf, Indonesian police spokesman. "The small party turned out to
be bombings."</TE>
<TE>   On the evening of Dec. 24, 2000, bombs exploded at 24 churches across
Indonesia, many of them while Christmas services were being held.
Nineteen people were killed, and more than 100 were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The bombs all had the same kinds of explosives and detonators, and
most went off minutes apart, police said.</TE>
<TE>   More bombings followed. So far, police have tied Hambali and Samudra
to 13 of them, including two church blasts in July just 10 days before
the Atrium mall bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "In all those cases, Hambali was the puppeteer behind the screen,"
Saaf said. "He was not directly involved, but he led the meeting, made
the strategy, decided who does what, assigned the task."</TE>
<TE>   Abbas' account of Hambali's role in planning the Christmas Eve
bombings fit well with the confessions of other Islamic militants
arrested in the city of Bandung after two attempted bombings there went
awry just before Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, four people were killed in the explosion of a bomb they
were making. Another would-be bomber died when a bomb he was carrying on
the back of a motorcycle went off.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors of the blasts told police that Hambali organized and paid
for their efforts. He made contact with the Bandung militants through a
prayer group and paid them $6,000, they said. Hambali said the money was
donated by a Malaysian woman concerned about the suffering of Muslims in
Indonesia, they told police.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the Atrium attack was the last bombing Hambali carried out
in Indonesia. Samudra gave explosives and detonators for the attack to
Abbas, who passed them on to Halim for assembly, police say.</TE>
<TE>   Abbas and Halim went to the mall twice on Aug. 1, apparently first to
survey the scene and then to deliver the bomb. Police say Halim was
carrying the bomb when it exploded, injuring his right leg and damaging
his hearing. His shattered leg was later amputated below the knee.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian authorities say they are searching for Hambali and are
continuing to investigate his activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Is Hambali really a member of the Al Qaeda network?" Saaf asked. "We
have to prove that. But about Hambali operating in Indonesia, that is
correct. And the victims of his work are many."</TE>
<TE>U.S. Deploys Troops in Southern Philippines</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the U.S. military has gained a foothold in the
turbulent jihad triangle in the first expansion of the global anti-terror
war outside Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has deployed 660 troops in Mindanao to train and assist
the Philippine army in combating the Abu Sayyaf kidnapping gang, an
Islamic rebel group with historical ties to Bin Laden. The campaign is
billed as a six-month exercise. The first casualties occurred last month
when a U.S. military helicopter plunged into the sea, killing all 10
soldiers aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Although Indonesia and the Philippines have treated the conflicts as
separate, Islamic militants view them as integral parts of one holy war.</TE>
<TE>   The three conflict zones--Mindanao, the Moluccas and Sulawesi--are
within a few hundred miles of one another. The lack of border controls
makes the movement of combatants, weapons and explosives a simple matter.</TE>
<TE>   In Mindanao, militant Islamic groups have battled Philippine
government troops for years. The Abu Sayyaf gang has kidnapped foreigners
and villagers for ransom and beheaded dozens of victims, including
tourist Guillermo Sobero of Corona, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Islamic fighters, including some foreigners, also have
been trained by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, one of the largest
militant groups with an estimated force of 15,000. The Pentagon says it
has no plans to target the group despite its alleged links to terrorism,
but Moro commanders have threatened to shoot American soldiers who enter
their territory.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few hundred miles to the south, in the Moluccas, Muslims and
Christians have attacked and burned one another's villages in a war that
has claimed at least 6,000 lives and displaced 500,000 people. Hundreds
of Christians have been captured, forced to convert to Islam and required
to undergo circumcision or female genital excision.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim and Christian leaders from the Moluccas recently signed a peace
accord, but its effectiveness is in doubt because some Islamic militants,
including the 3,000-strong Laskar Jihad, were not part of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the religious fighting has spread to the neighboring
island of Sulawesi, where hundreds of homes have been burned. Authorities
believe that Islamic militants linked to Al Qaeda once operated a camp
near the combat zone where foreign fighters came for military training.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir, the reputed leader of Jemaah Islamiah, says holy war is a
religious duty for Muslims in Sulawesi and the Moluccas. "Jihad in the
southern Philippines is also compulsory because the Muslims there are
oppressed and the Christians started the fight," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For the militants, the region has functioned like a mini-Afghanistan,
where extremists can receive training and combat experience and then fan
out to perpetrate mayhem elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   One Western security expert said that more than 400 Indonesians
received training at a Moro Islamic Liberation Front camp in 1998 and
then went to the Moluccas shortly before the outbreak of fighting there.</TE>
<TE>   Militants dispatched from the region also carried out bombings in
Manila and Jakarta. In at least one case, police say, operatives brought
explosives 1,500 miles from the Moluccas to Jakarta to blow up churches.</TE>
<TE>   Now, authorities fear the lawless region's 1,600 islands could provide
a haven for Islamic extremists on the run, including Al Qaeda fighters
fleeing Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Jemaah Islamiah appears to have served as an intermediary between Al
Qaeda and local Islamic militants, hooking up with established groups
such as the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Mindanao and the Malaysian
Moujahedeen Group. It also recruited extremists for its own terror cells.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Malaysia is said to have been the main base of
operations for the radical clerics who led the group. There, Bashir,
Hambali and others allegedly exhorted their followers to go to the
Moluccas and fight in the holy war.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysian officials say militants linked to the group staged bank
robberies to raise money for the jihad and killed Joe Fernandez, a
Christian politician, because he was allegedly proselytizing and
converting Muslims to Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   One alleged terrorist, Musa Abdul Hir, illustrates the international
nature of Jemaah Islamiah's activities. Known as Zulkifli in Malaysia, he
is the brother-in-law of Halim, the would-be Jakarta mall bomber.
Malaysian police believe that he is a leader of the Malaysian Moujahedeen
Group and took part in the slaying of Fernandez. In Indonesia, police say
he attended the meeting to plan the Christmas Eve bombings. Authorities
in both countries say his whereabouts are unknown.</TE>
<TE>Indonesian Trained at Afghan Mullah's Camp</TE>
<TE>   While Hambali was spreading Jemaah Islamiah's influence to Indonesia,
another Indonesian, Fathur Rohman Al-Ghozi, was doing the same in the
Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Arrested in January in Manila on a tip from Singaporean authorities,
he gave police a detailed confession that reveals the overlapping nature
of the region's militant groups.</TE>
<TE>   A onetime student in an Islamic school in Indonesia founded by Bashir,
he went to Pakistan in 1990. He was recruited there by Jemaah Islamiah
and received military training at a camp run by an Afghan mullah on the
Pakistani-Afghan border, police say.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, he went to Malaysia and met Bafana, identified by Singaporean
authorities as a top Jemaah Islamiah boss who had direct contact with Al
Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan. Al-Ghozi said in a signed confession that
Bafana directed him to go to the Philippines and participate "in the Holy
War in Mindanao."</TE>
<TE>   He appears to have been a successful operative. By the end of 1996, he
was receiving weapons training from the Moro Islamic Liberation Front,
and at the time of his arrest in January, police identified him as an
explosives expert for the group.</TE>
<TE>   By late 2000, when it was about to launch its bombing campaign in
Indonesia, Jemaah Islamiah was ready to stage bombings in Manila as well.
Al-Ghozi said he organized a series of blasts to be carried out by
members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. He paid them $6,000 to buy
150 pounds of explosives and plant the bombs. In a phone conversation,
Bafana approved the plot to further the holy war, Al-Ghozi said.</TE>
<TE>   In early December, Al-Ghozi said, Bafana and Hambali flew to Manila to
go over the plans for the bombings. They discussed possible targets and
toured the city.</TE>
<TE>   The bombs went off on Dec. 30, 2000, at five locations, including a
crowded transit station, killing 22 people and injuring more than 100.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators speculate that the simultaneous bombings in the
Philippines and Indonesia just six days apart were practice runs for an
attack on Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   The Singapore plot called for seven truck bombs, each packed with 3
tons of the explosive fertilizer ammonium nitrate. Al-Ghozi, calling
himself Mike, and an alleged Al Qaeda operative using the name Sammy
arrived in Singapore last October and began planning the attack,
authorities say. Bafana helped orchestrate the operation, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy, identified as a Canadian of Kuwaiti descent, Al-Ghozi and
Jemaah Islamiah cell members surveyed and videotaped potential targets,
including the U.S., Israeli, British and Australian embassies. They also
videotaped the Sembawang wharf where U.S. Navy vessels dock, the Changi
naval base and warships in the area.</TE>
<TE>   One of the videos shows Jemaah Islamiah member Mohammed Nazir bin
Mohammed Uthman in the foreground and the U.S. Embassy in the background.
The footage was shot by Al-Ghozi, the Singaporean government said, and
was found at the office of Bafana's brother, Fathi Abu Bakar Bafana, who
has been identified as the leader of the cell. The video was stored with
the title "Visiting Singapore Sightseeing."</TE>
<TE>   "The group was expected to continue to conduct several rounds of
surveillance, observation and video recordings before a final
confirmation of the specific targets would be made by the foreign
terrorists," the government said.</TE>
<TE>   After a cell member placed a purchase order for 17 tons of ammonium
nitrate in early December, Singaporean authorities moved in and arrested
13 members of the group, including the Bafana brothers and Uthman, and
tipped off Philippine authorities that Al-Ghozi was in Manila. Sammy is
still at large.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, Al-Ghozi told investigators where they could find a
ton of explosives he had hidden in Mindanao and planned to take to
Singapore via Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Singaporean authorities say they fear that Jemaah Islamiah leaders who
have taken refuge in Indonesia are plotting another attack.</TE>
<TE>   "These JI cells in Singapore have been disrupted, but the masterminds
are still at large in Indonesia," said Singaporean Senior Minister Lee
Kuan Yew in a recent speech. "The danger will go away only when these
nests of Al Qaeda-trained operatives around us are broken up."</TE>

</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowded
ultra-Orthodox neighborhood here as the Jewish Sabbath ended Saturday
night, killing nine Israelis, including five children. Hours later,
Palestinian gunmen early today ambushed an Israeli checkpoint in the West
Bank, shooting dead at least seven soldiers and Jewish settlers.</LD>
<LD>   The toll of 16 dead in barely 12 hours shocked a nation already
traumatized by nearly a year and a half of bloodshed, warfare and revenge
that only worsens. The latest attacks follow Israel's military assault on
two Palestinian refugee camps.</LD>
<LD>   In the Saturday night attack, the dead included an 18-month-old girl
and four other children. More than 50 people were wounded in the suicide
bombing, which occurred as families were emerging from Sabbath prayers or
bar mitzvah celebrations.</LD>
<TE>   The attacker approached a group of women with baby strollers before
detonating the large nail-packed explosive device on his body, police and
witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the deadliest suicide bombing in Israel in three months.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of the powerful blast, which rocked downtown Jerusalem, a
militia linked to Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah
movement claimed responsibility and said the bombing was in revenge for
Israel's military assaults on the two refugee camps. The assailant was
identified as a 19-year-old from the Dahaisha refugee camp near
Bethlehem, where hundreds of Palestinians late Saturday rallied in his
honor and rejoiced at hearing the news.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, Israeli helicopter gunships unleashed a barrage of
missiles at Palestinian security targets in Bethlehem. No casualties were
reported in the retaliatory strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Militant Palestinian groups had threatened new attacks on Israelis
after the Israeli army stormed the two West Bank refugee camps last week.
Israeli forces have pulled out of the two camps after raiding hundreds of
homes. More than 20 Palestinians--gunmen, police and civilians--were
killed in the incursions, which started Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem, the bomb blast in the religious Beit Israel neighborhood
torched cars, shattered their windshields and scattered human body parts
for yards. It occurred just after nightfall outside the Mahane Israel
seminary, synagogue and guest house, which specializes in Sabbath family
gatherings. Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews were pouring into the
streets of the neighborhood, returning from evening prayers.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Fuchs, a 25-year-old resident, ran to the site as soon as he
heard the explosion. He found an empty baby carriage and several
children, burned, lying on the ground. The bomber had picked one of the
busiest times possible to attack, said Fuchs, dressed still in his
Sabbath finery of long black coat and round fur hat.</TE>
<TE>   Hours afterward, religious burial society volunteers joined emergency
workers, removing the remains for proper interment and wiping away blood.
The force of the blast was such that blood splattered three stories high
on the beige stone facade of the Mahane Israel guest house.</TE>
<TE>   The red shoe of a child and a diaper sat in the debris left by the
explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, groups of ultra-Orthodox burst into the chants that always
follow terrorist bombings.</TE>
<TE>   "Death to the Arabs!" they shouted. "No Arabs, no terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Hazan family had spent the weekend at the guest house
attending the bar mitzvah of their young relative, Naveh.</TE>
<TE>   "I was taking things out to the car, and suddenly I found myself right
by the explosion," Shirley Biton, one relative, said from her hospital
bed. "The next thing I remember, my brother was covered in blood and
everyone was running and all sorts of things were flying all over the
place."</TE>
<TE>   Biton was hit in the thigh by metal pieces packed into the bomb for
maximum lethal effect. Her brother also survived.</TE>
<TE>   Zion Alcobi, 39, and his 7-year-old son, Yaacov, had also just left
Naveh Hazan's bar mitzvah and were standing on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   "We had just celebrated havdala," Yaacov said, referring to the
ceremony marking the Sabbath's end Saturday night and the transition to a
new week. At first, he thought that he heard firecrackers set off by
pranksters marking last week's festive Purim holiday.</TE>
<TE>   "But then I saw the fire and I saw the car falling to pieces and I
understood it was a terrorist attack," the boy said from the hospital bed
he was sharing with his father. "I fell to the ground. Then I ran." The
boy suffered minor scratches.</TE>
<TE>   Aviva Nahmani, Naveh's mother, ran into the street "like a crazy
woman" frantically searching for her three children after the bomb turned
the nighttime scene into bloody chaos. Eventually, she found her two
daughters and Naveh.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an event that I so waited for, that my boy would go up to the
Torah," Nahmani said, referring to the culmination of his bar mitzvah.
"But this is not what we hoped for. It's too bad that we don't have
security in this country, that even here, in this holy city, we have to
fear."</TE>
<TE>   Nahmani, at one hospital, was using her cellular phone to call
emergency rooms across the city to make inquiries about guests at the bar
mitzvah.</TE>
<TE>   A few feet away from her, relatives of the dead baby were sequestered
in a side room. An aunt identified the body. The mother was inconsolable,
her body racked by anguished screams until she collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   "Where is she?" she wailed. "I want to see her!"</TE>
<TE>   Israeli television and radio reported that the assailant might have
disguised himself as a religious Jew by donning a large yarmulke. He
aroused suspicion because he asked for directions in the tight-knit
community, where outsiders are noticed, and because he was smoking before
the Sabbath had ended, in violation of strict religious custom, the
reports said. The police declined to confirm the reports.</TE>
<TE>   The bomber's suicide mission succeeded despite enormous security
measures, including tough checkpoints that had created long lines into
Jerusalem on Saturday afternoon as police and soldiers checked IDs and
searched vehicles. Israeli forces were on maximum alert.</TE>
<TE>   After the bombing, paramilitary border police were out in force on
Jerusalem streets, pulling cars over pell-mell in search of suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The Beit Israel neighborhood sits in West Jerusalem just across a
major roadway from Palestinian neighborhoods. It was the site of a car
bombing last year that did not kill anyone. Saturday night, a banner left
over from that incident still fluttered from one building: "A miracle
happened here."</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, a militia affiliated with Fatah, claimed
responsibility for the bombing and for the killing of an Israeli
policeman, also Saturday, at the Maale Adumim settlement east of
Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Israel blamed Arafat for failing to curtail violence. Arafat's
government condemned the bombing but blamed Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon for escalating bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   Retaliation came swiftly. Early today, Israeli tanks and armored
personnel carriers moved into position just west of Bethlehem and north
of the Dahaisha camp, and helicopter gunships began bombarding
Palestinian security targets just before dawn. A main police headquarters
and a building that the Israeli army said was used to make weapons were
damaged by the missile strikes, residents said.</TE>
<TE>   "The state of Israel knows how to defend its people and will do so,"
Sharon advisor Dore Gold said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon has not stopped raging violence in nearly a year in office.
Instead, the hate-filled pattern of attack and revenge has only
intensified, and Sharon is paying a political price. Polls last week
showed his once-high approval rating sinking to a new low.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian militants had vowed revenge for the Israeli incursions
into the two teeming refugee camps in the West Bank. The Israeli army
pulled back Saturday from one of the camps, near the town of Jenin, but
continued searching homes in the other, the Balata camp in Nablus. Early
today, troops left Balata.</TE>
<TE>   The two top commanders of the raids said Saturday that their forces
had killed or captured numerous "terrorists" and seized ample weaponry
and bomb-making equipment.</TE>
<TE>   But they said they had no illusions about having wiped out militant
Palestinian resistance.</TE>
<TE>   "In this kind of war, there's no wiping out anything," said Col. Moshe
Tamir, commander of the Golani infantry brigade, which fought pitched
battles in the Jenin camp Friday before pulling out Saturday. "For the
time being, it will make things more difficult for terrorists in the
area."</TE>
<TE>   The incursions into the densely populated refugee camps were condemned
by the United Nations, Europe and human rights organizations because of
the harm inflicted on civilians.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Joins Forces With Afghans in Major Assault</HD>
<DH>Military: At least one American is killed, authorities say, as
bombing targets an Al Qaeda site in the east.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>At least one American and five Afghan government fighters were
killed in a major new offensive launched Saturday against an Al Qaeda
stronghold in the remote mountains of eastern Afghanistan, according to
U.S. and Afghan officials.</LD>
<LD>   Heavy U.S. bombing began just before daybreak in the province of
Paktia and appeared to be continuing this morning as American jets
attempted to flush soldiers in the Al Qaeda terrorist network from their
mountain redoubt.</LD>
<LD>   An Afghan commander in the region, Wazir Khan, said he believed that
one American and five Afghans had been killed in the previous 24 hours.
In addition, he said, at least four Americans and 23 Afghans had been
injured by early this morning.</LD>
<TE>   The bombing was so intense that Afghan government ground troops and
the American Special Forces accompanying them could not yet enter the
area.</TE>
<TE>   "The area is very well fortified and is high in the mountains," said
Khan, who spoke by satellite phone from the front lines.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a more labyrinthine cave complex even than Tora Bora," Khan
said, referring to the area in eastern Afghanistan that the U.S. had
bombed heavily in December. "I can't say how long this operation will
take."</TE>
<TE>   Khan said that Al Qaeda members were using antiaircraft guns to fire
at the American aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the ongoing combat, officials at the U.S. Central Command in
Tampa, Fla., said Saturday that they were not at liberty to discuss
details of the fighting or circumstances surrounding the casualties. The
U.S. officials said in a prepared statement that "initial reports are
that one U.S. service member and two Afghan forces have been killed. An
unspecified number of U.S. and Afghan forces have been injured."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday marked the first major U.S. bombing in Afghanistan since a
January attack on the Al Qaeda cave complex at Zhawar Kili, which is also
in Paktia but much closer to the Pakistani border. Pakistan was reported
to have sealed its border with Paktia province Saturday to prevent escape
by Al Qaeda members.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time Saturday, U.S. forces used a recently developed
weapon, the 2,000-pound BLU-118B, a thermobaric bomb, said Navy Cmdr.
Dave Culler, a spokesman for the Central Command.</TE>
<TE>   A Navy fighter plane dropped the bomb, which can penetrate caves
without causing much external damage, on a cave complex in the region.
Because the bomb creates a blast of high pressure inside a cave, it is
believed to be a particularly effective weapon in places where chemical
or biological agents might be stored. A thermobaric bomb is designed to
incinerate such agents rather than disperse them into the atmosphere,
Culler said.</TE>
<TE>   Culler declined to comment on whether U.S. military forces believed
that chemical or biological weapons were stored in the cave complex. B-52
bombers also were being used in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The area under siege is a rugged, mountainous and desolate region
about a six-hour drive south of Kabul, the Afghan capital. The besieged
territory lies between the cities of Gardez in central Paktia and Khowst
to the southeast.</TE>
<TE>   The area was known to be heavily populated by Arabs, who make up most
of Al Qaeda, before the fall of Kabul to Northern Alliance troops in
mid-November. After that, many more Arabs came through the region as they
fled south.</TE>
<TE>   It has long been suspected that a number of these Al Qaeda members, as
well as some Taliban, stayed in the southeastern border provinces,
creating pockets of resistance to both the American military campaign and
the new Afghan interim government. The environment has been relatively
sympathetic, because the Arabs and Taliban had ties to the local
population and were familiar with the difficult mountainous terrain.</TE>
<TE>   In their prepared statement Saturday, U.S. military officials said
that about 6:30 a.m. in Afghanistan, "Afghan and coalition forces began
fighting Al Qaeda terrorists and non-Afghan Taliban south of Gardez."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking from Tampa, Navy Cmdr. Culler said officials would not
discuss details of the fighting because of concern that such disclosures
could further jeopardize American and Afghan forces.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not giving any insight whatsoever to the hardware [or]
resources that are being used, because they [Al Qaeda and Taliban] use
that as good intel," Culler said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. John W. Rosa Jr. told reporters Friday that
"hundreds" of Al Qaeda and Taliban had been located in or around Paktia
province. Rosa also said that eliminating the pockets of Al Qaeda and
Taliban trying to regroup remained a primary mission of the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   The neighboring province of Paktika, which also is suspected of being
an Al Qaeda hide-out, shares a border with Pakistan as well, and it is
easy for people to slip back and forth across the border using smuggling
routes usually traveled by horses and camels.</TE>
<TE>   The border area is also the home of Jalaladin Haqqani, the Taliban
commander who had close ties to Al Qaeda and is a near-legendary figure
in the region because of his victory over the Soviets when they attempted
to control it. The U.S. has been trying to apprehend Haqqani since early
in the war, but he and his followers are thought to have escaped to
Pakistan and perhaps to be inciting opposition to the American military
operation and the interim government, according to Afghan sources.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been going directly to the mosques and saying to people,
'Let's wage jihad against Americans.' They are saying that Bacha Khan is
not a Muslim now because he is helping Americans so 'Let's jihad against
Bacha Khan too,' " said Wazir Khan, referring to his brother, who is the
leader in the Khowst region and an ally of the Americans in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Wazir Khan said that 600 of his soldiers along with 50 American
Special Forces troops began Saturday's operation about 3 a.m. when they
advanced on the Al Qaeda stronghold in the district of Shahi Kot as part
of a carefully coordinated plan in which the Al Qaeda forces were being
attacked from two directions. A second force was moving into Shahi Kot
from the city of Gardez in central Paktia province, he said.</TE>
<TE>   After closing the roads that lead to the Shahi Kot vicinity, according
to Wazir Khan, Afghans and Americans began their advance but kept clear
of the target area while jets bombed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have surrounded the area and are ready to advance as soon as we
get the command," Khan said.</TE>
<TE>   Residents in Gardez reported hearing an unusual number of planes
flying overhead, although they were too far away to hear any bombing.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Special Forces recently began training at least one and possibly
two 500-member contingents of Afghans to press a new hunt for Taliban and
Al Qaeda in Paktia's villages and mountainsides, said several Afghan
commanders in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Special Forces troops have entrenched themselves in the area over the
last two months, setting up bases in Gardez and Khowst. In order to limit
the U.S. exposure to danger on the ground, they have recruited hundreds
of Afghan soldiers to work with them to hunt Al Qaeda. In recent weeks,
however, the effort has been hampered by fighting between rival warlords
attempting to control the territory.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a nice big office waiting for Dick Cook.</LD>
<LD>   It has high ceilings with recessed lighting, terra-cotta floors and a
private white-tiled bathroom with a shower. The boss is right down the
hall.</LD>
<LD>   But Dick Cook won't be moving onto the top floor of the Team Disney
building with CEO Michael Eisner. The newly named chairman of Walt Disney
Studios thinks his office four levels down is just fine. He doesn't even
mind the view--a parking lot.</LD>
<TE>   "This is so much more convenient," says the 51-year-old movie chief,
who wants to stay near the folks he knows can help him get the new job
done.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight, Cook has become one of the most powerful figures in
Hollywood. But you wouldn't know it. He looks square, the kind of guy who
still thinks suspenders are cool. He isn't known for schmoozing at the
Grill with Hollywood's top agents, hot stars and famous filmmakers. He
lives with his family in La Canada Flintridge, not Brentwood or the
Pacific Palisades. He says "gosh" a lot.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, he's perfectly cast for a company seeking less flash
and more stability as it tries to regain its dominance in family
entertainment. In an industry notorious for its hopscotching studio
executives, Cook's resume includes many jobs but just one employer:
Disney. He began 31 years ago as a ride operator at Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   "Would I be the right guy for any studio? Probably not," said Cook,
whose expertise is in distributing and marketing films, not in choosing
which ones get made.</TE>
<TE>   "But growing up in this culture, I think this is where I am best
suited, because I understand what makes Disney the unique company and
product it is. More than understand it, I embrace it and believe it--the
whole Disney culture."</TE>
<TE>   Eisner is hoping that Cook's ascension, announced Feb. 15, will bring
an end to the recent upheaval in the movie studio's leadership ranks and
cool simmering criticisms of his stewardship at the company. Cook's
predecessor, Peter Schneider, abruptly resigned last summer after a
difficult 18-month run. He admittedly never felt comfortable in the
Hollywood culture and now is a Broadway producer.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner has been under increasing pressure from Wall Street and Disney
shareholders to improve the company's earnings and bump up a sagging
stock price. Over the last year, Disney has slashed 4,000 jobs
companywide, laid off hundreds more in its bedrock animation division and
struggled in many of its key business units, including ABC television.</TE>
<TE>   Although Disney's movie operation represents less than 20% of the
company's overall revenues, it is the engine that powers almost
everything else in the empire, from theme parks to retail sales.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is now working for his fourth studio head
at Disney, where he made such big-budget films as "Armageddon," "The
Rock" and "Pearl Harbor." He applauds the conservative selection of Cook.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great for Disney because there's continuity," Bruckheimer said.
"Dick will be there after Eisner leaves."</TE>
<TE>   As for Eisner, Cook must seem like a soothing cup of warm milk after
the caffeinated personalities of his last three studio chairmen:
Schneider, Joe Roth and Jeffrey Katzenberg.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick and I have never had a fight," Eisner said. "People dismiss him
because he's not in 'the club.' He is the new club."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in past years, Eisner will be more directly involved in
creative decisions at the movie studio. Since Schneider's departure eight
months ago, Eisner--enhancing his reputation as a micro-manager--has been
attending story meetings and giving advice on scripts. Under Cook's
leadership, he will continue to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick welcomes it. There's no such thing as autonomy," Eisner said,
when it comes to green-lighting productions on which studios have
hundreds of millions of dollars riding.</TE>
<TE>   There are those who privately question whether Cook can lift the
studio to new heights without the breadth of relationships other studio
chiefs have in the creative community. Of course, all the Hollywood power
brokers who sent him lavish flower arrangements and expensive wines just
hours after his promotion hope that's about to change.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, studio heads do not come from the nuts-and-bolts
marketing and distribution side of the business, as Cook does. For the
most part, they have backgrounds in content and production. As a result,
they theoretically can spot a great movie in a script, book or writer's
pitch. Somehow, they supposedly can divine whether a fledgling actor or
first-time director shows promise.</TE>
<TE>   But the reality is that those traits don't always translate into box
office gems.</TE>
<TE>   "The success quotient of those who have more creative qualities and
skills isn't necessarily better than someone who doesn't," says Jeffrey
Logsdon, an entertainment analyst with Gerard Klauer. "It's not like
these guys are batting .700 or .800."</TE>
<TE>   Logsdon also noted that Disney may not need a conventional studio
boss. "Disney's culture is much more traditional and corporate. Create a
plan, stick with the plan. Create a budget, stick to the budget."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Cook is not the first to rise from the distribution
ranks. Former Paramount Pictures veteran Frank Mancuso, for example,
headed the studio when it produced the blockbusters "Top Gun" and
"Beverly Hills Cop." Ex-Warner Bros. co-chairman Terry Semel oversaw
scores of hits, including the "Lethal Weapon" and "Batman" movies.</TE>
<TE>   Cook's mild manner and perpetually jolly demeanor have led some
Hollywood insiders to wonder how he'll handle the often cutthroat
dealings of the movie business.</TE>
<TE>   But Cook, a major sports fan who played second base for USC, said he
knows how to compete. "Whether it's on the golf course or in business, I
love to win."</TE>
<TE>   For doubters, a history lesson:</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Cook took on two of the country's most powerful theater
chains: United Artists and Cineplex Odeon.</TE>
<TE>   To increase Disney's percentage of box office receipts, Cook said he
abandoned the customary practice of negotiating "the split" with
exhibitors across the country. He told them they had to bid against each
other to show Disney films.</TE>
<TE>   UA and Cineplex, feeling squeezed, retaliated. They refused to screen
Disney movies in any of their theaters, including those in 20 cities
where one or the other had a lock on the market.</TE>
<TE>   But Cook struck back. In those cities where Disney was shut out, he
made deals to play the company's new releases in high school auditoriums,
community halls, churches and at Rotary Clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "In a couple of towns, we exhibited films on bedsheets," Cook said. In
Baton Rouge, La., he rented the civic auditorium for an entire summer.
"We never did more business in that city, before or since."</TE>
<TE>   According to Cook, the battle continued for about a year, until UA and
Cineplex relented. Two years later, Cook said, Disney returned to direct
negotiations with theaters as the studio's output mushroomed and the
bidding became "too cumbersome."</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who's quiet on the outside is not someone you want to mess
with," says Disney's former international distribution chief Bill
Mechanic, who worked alongside Cook for nine years.</TE>
<TE>   By the time of the theater uproar, Cook already was well schooled in
Disney's hardball culture. Although not yet 40, he had been with the
company nearly two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, born and raised in Bakersfield, began working at Disneyland in
1970 on weekends and holidays and during summers. He drove the Monorail
and the Santa Fe &amp; Disney Railroad. A couple of years later he met
another ride operator, Bonnie. They've been married 27 years and have two
daughters, ages 19 and 11.</TE>
<TE>   Cook had planned to go to law school after graduating from USC in
1972, but his bank account said otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "I needed to make some money," Cook said. Besides, he was getting
hooked. "I just loved it. The atmosphere, the culture, the people."</TE>
<TE>   And the feeling was mutual.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Disney World's opening in Orlando, Fla., in the early
1970s, he was sent there for three months to help with the launch. "It
was a magical time. It afforded you a lot of opportunities at a
relatively young age."</TE>
<TE>   It was also in those early years that Cook showed the brass that he
had management potential. As a junior sales representative making $150 a
week, he was given the job of organizing "grad night" for as many as
20,000 high school students at a time. To get them to come, he trekked
from one high school to another, selling the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "You learned all the rudiments of marketing," Cook said. "You had to
know and understand the product--Disneyland--better than anyone."</TE>
<TE>   His people skills and marketing savvy caught the eye of Disney's
then-CEO Card Walker, who invited Cook to lunch and suggested he join the
movie studio. In 1977, Cook became the manager of Disney's pay TV and
nontheatrical sales operations.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a bright young man and had a nice presentation," recalled
Walker, now 86 and retired.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Cook was promoted again, entering the world of
distribution for the first time. In 1988, he was named president of the
division. Eventually, he was given responsibility for marketing and, soon
after that, a loftier title: chairman of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures
Group.</TE>
<TE>   Among his most visible contributions was the invention of the studio's
grand-style premieres.</TE>
<TE>   He staged the world debut of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" at the
Superdome in New Orleans. For the Sean Connery action picture "The Rock,"
he took over Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay.</TE>
<TE>   He talked New York City authorities into shutting down Fifth Avenue
and 42nd Street for the "Hercules" electrical light parade. And he
convinced NASA to let Disney stage a premiere party and screening of
"Armageddon" at Kennedy Space Center.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he persuaded the head of the Navy's Pacific Fleet to
provide the John C. Stennis aircraft carrier for the worldwide premiere
of "Pearl Harbor."</TE>
<TE>   Former Disney studio head Roth says he'll never forget arriving in New
York at 11 o'clock the night before Disney's premiere of "Pocahontas."
Cook, wearing a headset and baseball jacket, was standing in Central
Park, drilling hundreds of Disney staffers.</TE>
<TE>   "He was like a general conducting the troops," Roth said. "This is a
guy who could organize the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   The premiere drew 110,000 people to Central Park.</TE>
<TE>   When Roth left Disney, Cook wanted his job but knew better than to get
his hopes up. Twice before he had been disappointed. He once had wanted
to run the theme park division but was passed over. And when Disney
acquired the Anaheim Angels baseball franchise in 1996, he had dreams of
managing the sports division.</TE>
<TE>   Cook saw another opening after Roth's replacement, Schneider, abruptly
left. He didn't lobby for the job, nor was it offered by Eisner, who said
he wanted to take his time in naming a successor. He did not want to make
another miscalculation, which would reflect poorly on his judgment.</TE>
<TE>   But Eisner did promise Cook one thing: He wouldn't bring in an
outsider. And he didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, the consummate insider, now is responsible for the production,
marketing and distribution of the 18 or so live-action movies made by
Disney's studio arms. He also has the job of overseeing the promotion and
release of movies from Disney's venerable animation division.</TE>
<TE>   In all this, Cook's biggest challenge will be to restore Disney's
reputation as the leader in family movies amid heightened competition.</TE>
<TE>   It is not Disney's name that appears above the titles of such hits as
"How the Grinch Stole Christmas," "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
and "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."</TE>
<TE>   Cook is determined to win, and he knows the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the studio's upcoming family movies will be based on
Disneyland rides: "Pirates of the Caribbean," "The Haunted Mansion" and
"The Country Bears," inspired by the attraction Cook's wife once
operated.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most daunting prospect of his new job, Cook said, is "not
whether I can get someone on the phone--that will all come with time--but
living up to the rich heritage of making great movies that stand the test
of time. That's what keeps me up at night."</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: Frankel's 5-year-old darts past the leaders
in stretch to win Santa Anita Handicap by four lengths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The no-name Santa Anita Handicap now has a name. It is Milwaukee
Brew, who hadn't won a race in more than 19 months before the Frankel
Factor kicked in Saturday. Bobby Frankel, saddling Milwaukee Brew for
only the second time, watched his 5-year-old find a hole in the
stretch as he swept to a four-length win over 13 other horses in
search of a reputation.</LD>
<LD>   For a Grade I, $1-million race, this was a field that was hardly
distinguished. For one thing, none of them had ever won a Grade I
race. It was entirely in the spirit of things that the winner should
be the lesser half of the Frankel-trained, Frank Stronach-owned
entry. Their other horse, Euchre, who had a string of consistent
efforts, finished next to last.</LD>
<LD>   Milwaukee Brew, running 11/4 miles in 2:01 before a crowd of
30,411, paid $11.40 as the entry went off second, behind Futural, in
the betting. Milwaukee Brew would have been a longshot had he run
uncoupled, as Frankel noted after the race.</LD>
<TE>   "He would have been about 30 or 40 to 1," Frankel said. "The more
I think about it, I should have scratched the other horse and bet on
him."</TE>
<TE>   From coast to coast, Frankel cranked out stakes winners last year,
winning 49 top races, totaling $14.7 million in purses and winning
his second consecutive Eclipse Award. But like his first Breeders'
Cup win, which didn't come until last year, he had been blanked in
the Santa Anita Handicap before Saturday, saddling 10 starters in the
race with only two finishing in the money.</TE>
<TE>   This year is setting out to be another Frankel refrain. A
half-hour before the Big 'Cap, he saddled Decarchy for another
shocker, an upset of Val Royal, the Breeders' Cup Mile winner, in the
$300,000 Jimmy Kilroe Mile.</TE>
<TE>   Before he was rubbed by the Frankel touch, Milwaukee Brew had been
trained by Joe Orseno, Stronach's main conditioner on the East Coast,
and by Tino Attard in Canada. The son of Wild Again and Ask Anita had
lost eight consecutive races, his last win coming in July of 2000 in
the Ohio Derby. The Big 'Cap was only the fifth win in 15 starts for
the horse, who was picked out by Andy Stronach, the owner's son, who
also named him after a $300,000 purchase at a yearling auction.</TE>
<TE>   Stronach, whose Magna Entertainment owns Santa Anita, wanted to
expand his racing interests in the West and sent Milwaukee Brew to
Frankel about three months ago. In his first race in seven months, he
ran sixth three weeks ago in the Whirlaway Handicap at the Fair
Grounds in New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel was going to send Milwaukee Brew back to the Fair Grounds,
to run in today's New Orleans Handicap, but when Mizzen Mast, who
would have been the Big 'Cap favorite, suffered a cracked hoof last
weekend, the trainer kept the Stronach runner in California. Going
into Saturday, Frankel thought Milwaukee Brew, not Euchre, gave him
his best chance.</TE>
<TE>   "He never really ran a jump at the Fair Grounds, and he still only
got beat by four lengths," Frankel said.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Mizzen Mast's regular rider, Kent Desormeaux, who won
his first Big 'Cap with Best Pal in 1992, Milwaukee Brew carried 115
pounds. The 118-pound high weights, Euchre and Futural, who finished
12th, were the lowest for the race in 43 years.</TE>
<TE>   Western Pride, at 19-1 with Pat Valenzuela, led most of the way
before Milwaukee Brew overtook him with a sixteenth of a mile left.
Western Pride held on for second, a neck better than Kudos, and Giant
Gentleman was fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the luck of being with the Frankel barn," said
Desormeaux, who had ridden Milwaukee Brew for the first time in New
Orleans. "He's got a barn of champions and his second string would be
the first string for a lot of stables."</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Brew was only the second horse, out of 29 starters, to
win the Big 'Cap from the No. 13 post. His break was clean, with the
only horse outside him, Western Pride, angling over to contest the
lead. Desormeaux kept his mount to the outside, and after six
furlongs they were ahead of only two horses.</TE>
<TE>   With a quarter-mile left, the winner was in eighth place, with six
lengths to make up.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to pick a spot to run," Desormeaux said, "and ended
up getting fanned, caught up in a slingshot with a horse that was
half-length in front of me. But when we turned for home, there seemed
to be a pocket, and when I split horses, he just barreled through
there with such a powerful run."</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela got a chance to ride Western Pride after Garrett Gomez
stuck with Euchre. Seventh in the Strub but a winner the race before
in the San Fernando, Western Pride was second.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I could pull a Spend A Buck [in 1985 a rare
wire-to-wire Kentucky Derby winner] on them, but I couldn't do it,"
Valenzuela said. "I tried to get everyone behind me tired, but Bobby
Frankel's always got a rocket in there. But he still ran a great
race. He was game for second and that's worth $200,000."</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee Brew earned $600,000. Going in, for 14 races, he had
earned slightly less than that. Now he has the name to go with the
bankroll.</TE>

<LD>GolfWeek magazine reports that some past Masters champions had
grumbled about Tiger Woods' menu choices--cheeseburgers and milk
shakes--at the first Champions' Dinner he hosted in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   "Woods, admitting his culinary tastes have 'advanced' since then
[when he was only 22], said the entrees for this year's dinner would
be steak and chicken."</LD>

<TE>   Trivia time: Other than UCLA, which Pacific 10 Conference men's
team has won the most games in the NCAA basketball tournament?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Are you ready for him? Skip Bayless of the San Jose Mercury News
on John Madden becoming an analyst for "Monday Night Football" on
ABC: "Finally, the longest-running [sports] show on television has an
analyst/entertainer who can measure up to its stage.</TE>
<TE>   "Boom! John Madden will come through your screen the way he once
smashed through a wall in the beer commercial that transformed him
from a chain-smoking, Maalox-popping John Candy of an ex-Raiders'
coach into a TV star."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Counterpoint: Phil Mushnick in the New York Post:</TE>
<TE>   "ABC now embraces Madden at a time when its 'MNF' showcase has
become a study in desperate experiments, the latest being Dennis
Miller.</TE>
<TE>   "Madden arrives at a time when his 'boom!' and 'bang!' bit has
worn thin, at a time when he's increasingly perceived as an overly
commercialized caricature who will endorse anything."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More MNF: Keith Olbermann of ABC radio on Madden joining Al
Michaels:</TE>
<TE>   "Even with just the two of them that could still be a pretty
crowded booth."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He said what? Miami Heat forward Brian Grant, when asked by the
Miami Herald to assess his team's playoff chances: "Once we're able
to creep up those old steps, and go through grandma's door, we're in
the kitchen, then we can make the dinner. But now we're still ...
gathering wood."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turnabout: Agent Bob LaMonte, who represents Jon Gruden, recently
hired by the Glazer family as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' head coach:
"I didn't know Joel and Bryan [Glazer], but I knew what I read about
them--'Dumb and Dumber.' I hung up the phone thinking, 'Smart and
Smarter.'"</TE>
<TE>   Good old sport: Mike Bianchi in the Orlando Sentinel: "What do you

<TE>   "Answer: Billybobsledding."</TE>

<TE>   Just some guy: Olympic gold medal figure skater Sarah Hughes, 16,
after being asked who had phoned her with congratulations: "I think
it was a senator or something."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Arizona, which has a 32-19 record in the NCAA
tournament. UCLA is 83-30, USC 9-13.</TE>

<TE>   And finally: Greg Cote in the Miami Herald: "Sergio Garcia remains
most notable in golf for his pre-swing ritual.</TE>
<TE>   "He is 22, but will be 23 by the time he strikes the ball, after
the most laborious pre-shot address in history.</TE>

<LD>Pittsburgh couldn't ask for a better ending to its remarkably good
season, except for a return trip home for the NCAA tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Julius Page scored 23 points as the No. 10 Panthers closed their
half-century-old arena--and the best regular season in school
history--with a 92-65 victory over rival West Virginia on Saturday
night.</LD>
<LD>   With more than 130 former players lining the sidelines in the
final game at Fitzgerald Field House, Pittsburgh--25-4 overall and
13-3 in the Big East--fell behind by eight points early, quickly
caught up, then pulled away 74% shooting and 58 points in the second
half.</LD>
<TE>   "We were fired up with all of the old players there," Page said.
"I had to calm down, because I was getting too fired up."</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh will take a seven-game winning streak into the Big East
quarterfinals Thursday. Last year, the Panthers scored three
consecutive upsets to reach the Big East championship game for the
first time before losing to Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   This season, the Panthers matched the school record for victories
and was a school-best 15-1 at Fitzgerald, which opened in 1951. The
6,798-seat arena still will be used for other sports, but the
basketball team will move into a $68-million arena where Pitt Stadium
once stood.</TE>
<TE>   "Not many people thought we could have the season we've had, so I
think it was special," said guard Brandin Knight, who had 15 points
and 14 assists. "It's good for us to be going into the tournament
with some confidence. We need to approach the games the same way we
did last year--everyone should stay loose, play ball and have fun."</TE>
<TE>   If the Panthers are among the top three seeded teams in their
region when the NCAA pairings are announced March 10, they may be
assigned to the subregional at Pittsburgh's Mellon Arena on March
15-17. They likely will get such a seeding unless they lose their
first Big East game.</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia (8-20, 1-15) lost 20 games for the first time in
school history.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Clippers' Hustle Beats Warriors' Muscle</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Golden State dominates inside, but Miles'
aggressive play at key moment lifts L.A. to third consecutive win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The loose basketball seemed to hang in the air forever, spinning
above the sideline in the fourth quarter Saturday night. Clipper
forward Darius Miles suddenly barged past Antawn Jamison of the
Golden State Warriors to save it.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff McInnis, Miles' teammate, shouldered his way past Jamison at
midcourt, collected the ball and dribbled toward the basket. In a
flash, McInnis flipped a pass to Miles, who by now had collected
himself along the sideline and sprinted ahead of a bewildered
Jamison.</LD>
<LD>   Miles then delivered a thunderous dunk that enlivened what had
been a tedious game, propelling the Clippers at long last toward
their third consecutive victory.</LD>
<TE>   There was still much of the fourth quarter to be played, but soon
this game would become a 109-95 Clipper victory before a crowd of
18,964, a franchise-record 15th sellout this season and the sixth in
a row at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The victory kept the ninth-place Clippers within striking distance
in the Western Conference playoff race, moving them within 21/2 games
of the eighth-place Seattle SuperSonics. Plus, it was the Clippers'
30th victory in their 60th game, one short of their total for all of
last season.</TE>
<TE>   To bolster their roster for the season's final 22 games, the
Clippers are expected to announce they have signed former NBA guard
Doug Overton to a 10-day contract. Overton has been playing in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, the Clippers sputtered, coughed and wheezed their way to
a 93-84 lead against the worst team in the Pacific Division. But
Miles' steal and dunk sparked them to a 12-6 run and a commanding
105-90 lead with 2:01 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Miles would score 18 points, but none were as significant as his
dunk midway through the fourth quarter. McInnis had 20 points and 13
assists and Elton Brand had 20 points and 12 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a layup, but I gave to Darius because he worked so hard to
get the ball," McInnis said. "I gave to Darius and he finished it. It
turned the game around for us. When we make athletic plays and get
out and run, that's when we're at our best."</TE>
<TE>   For most of the game, the Clippers' only one at Staples during a
stretch of nine of 10 on the road, there was very little athleticism
on display. The Warriors gave the Clippers fits at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   "They hang around and they hang around," Clipper Coach Alvin
Gentry said of Golden State (16-41). "They have trouble finishing,
though.... For us, every win is a good win."</TE>
<TE>   When someone dared suggest to Gentry before the game that
Portland, Utah and Seattle had secured the final three playoff spots
in the West with their recent strong play, he was incredulous.</TE>
<TE>   "Not over," he said. "It's not over. There are too many games
left."</TE>
<TE>   If only the Clippers showed that sort of defiance to start
Saturday's game. A few swift shots to the last-place Warriors' soft
underbelly and this game could have been a laugher.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Clippers snoozed their way to a 54-48 lead by
halftime, failing to take advantage of injuries to Golden State's
starting backcourt.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Richardson didn't make the trip from Oakland after suffering
a sprained left ankle Friday against the Sacramento Kings. Larry
Hughes sprained his left ankle with 1:27 remaining in the first
quarter Saturday, falling to the court on his own. He missed the rest
of the first half, but returned with his ankle heavily taped in the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers played sluggishly at both ends to start, but were
especially flat-footed around the basket. The Warriors took 23
first-half rebounds, to only 19 for the Clippers. What's more, Golden
State scored 32 of its 48 first-half points in the paint. The
Clippers had only 18 of their 54 from close range.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the Clippers' inability to slow Bob Sura, a
Warrior substitute who played extended minutes because of the
injuries to Richardson and Hughes. Sura torched the Clippers for 13
points and four assists in 16 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Sura scored again and again, mainly because nobody seemed to be
guarding him.</TE>
<TE>   It was the sort of defensive assignment Gentry would have given to
Corey Maggette, but Maggette is likely lost for the rest of the
regular season because of two dislocated bones in his right hand.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry also could have turned to Lamar Odom, but Odom is out for
about another month because of a sprained right wrist and ankle.</TE>

<LD>If the pressure of leading the suddenly banged-up Clippers is getting
to power forward Elton Brand, it certainly hasn't showed. In fact, he
seems to be relishing the challenge.</LD>
<LD>   Brand, who turns 23 next week, was among the injured until
recently. But the stretched tendon in his right ring finger has
significantly improved in the last few days and he no longer has it
heavily taped as protection.</LD>
<LD>   "It's feeling better," he said of his finger, which was injured
Feb. 7 against the Detroit Pistons. "I'm getting ready for this
playoff run. It definitely starts down there in the post. With this
rash of injuries we've had, it's going to be up to me to get our team
right there [into a playoff spot]."</LD>
<TE>   Brand had averaged 23.8 points and 18.5 rebounds in the four games
before the Clippers faced the Golden State Warriors on Saturday at
Staples Center. He scored 27 points and took a career-best 23
rebounds in the Clippers' victory Feb. 25 against the Memphis
Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if his play last week coincided with his finger's improved
condition, Brand held out the digit for inspection.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks bad," he said. "But it's not as swollen as it was. It's
a basketball injury. It's definitely something you can play with."</TE>
<TE>   With the Clippers three games out of a playoff spot going into
Saturday's game, it was going to take something more serious than a
sore finger to keep Brand off the court. After all, this is his first
playoff race after spending his first two NBA seasons with the
woebegone Chicago Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I have something to play for," he said. "My first two years,
basically, we were just playing for pride at this point. No one here,
except Sean Rooks, has ever been in the playoffs. We're definitely
pumped up. We're definitely playing for something more than pride."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Michael Olowokandi started, as expected, after sitting out
Tuesday's 94-84 victory over the Houston Rockets because of a
slightly sprained left knee. An MRI exam performed Thursday was
negative and he was cleared to play against the Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry started seldom-used backup Obinna Ekezie
against Houston and played Rooks more than usual.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors were without Jason Richardson, who sprained his left
ankle in Friday's loss against Sacramento and did not make the trip.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The score was so astounding in such difficult conditions that it
appeared Ernie Els was playing a different game than everyone else in
the Genuity Championship at Miami.</LD>
<LD>   He made eight birdies Saturday, when gusts were over 30 mph. His
six-under 66 was three strokes better than anyone else.</LD>
<LD>   Els made a mockery of the Blue Monster at Doral and had an
eight-stroke lead over Tiger Woods and Peter Lonard of Australia
after three rounds.</LD>
<TE>   "I enjoy competing out here and especially against the best," Els
said. "[Woods is] definitely the best out there, so hopefully I will
be ready this year for him."</TE>
<TE>   Woods and Lonard each shot 70, but Lonard finished before Woods
and will be paired with Els today.</TE>
<TE>   Els was at 199 and had the largest 54-hole lead on tour since
Woods led by nine strokes in the NEC Invitational at Firestone two
years ago, when he won by 11.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden's Annika Sorenstam birdied the first hole of a playoff with
Canada's Lorie Kane to win the Takefuji Classic at Waikoloa, Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam closed with a four-under 66 to match Kane, the 2000

<HD>Murray Is Dealt a Setback</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Kings lose to Columbus, 2-0, as coach reveals
rehabilitation may take several weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coach Andy Murray indicated for the first time Saturday that it could
be several more weeks before he is well enough to rejoin the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   "They tell you it can take anywhere from four weeks to six weeks
to get back to feeling normal again," Murray said from his home in
Faribault, Minn., where he is 16 days into his recuperation from
injuries suffered in a single-vehicle accident. "Obviously, I'm
hoping it's a lot shorter than that."</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the Kings carry on without their coach, losing, 2-0,
Saturday to the Columbus Blue Jackets in front of a sellout crowd of
18,118 at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Falling to 2-1 under interim Coach Dave Tippett, the Kings lost to
the NHL's worst team, failing to complete a four-game season series
sweep, despite giving up only 13 shots, three fewer than they'd given
up against any other opponent this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jackets, outscored by the Kings, 15-4, in three previous
games, took a 1-0 lead on a goal by Mike Sillinger midway through the
first period and went into a shell the rest of the way to preserve
their lead.</TE>
<TE>   Grant Marshall scored into an empty net with 43 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   In between, the Kings fired 30 shots that were stopped by Ron
Tugnutt and were shut out for the sixth time, the first since Jan. 10
at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   "They just played a solid road game," King center Jason Allison
said of the Blue Jackets, who were burned for a season-high four
points by Allison in a 5-1 loss Tuesday night at Columbus, Ohio.
"They got that goal and they just sat back. We just couldn't find a
way to get a puck in the net....</TE>
<TE>   "That shouldn't happen this time of the year when you're playing a
game you should win. We're going to have to make up for that now."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings had converted eight of 13 power-play opportunities
against the Blue Jackets, two of four Tuesday night, but they were 0
for 5 on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Also, a first-period goal by Steve Heinze was disallowed because
the King winger knocked the puck into the net with his stick above
the crossbar, and a second-period shot by defenseman Mathieu
Schneider banged off the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   "You're trying to find a goal somewhere," Tippett said, "and it's
like the hockey gods are against you that night."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't as if the Kings weren't trying to exploit a team that
had won only two of its previous 14 games, forward Ian Laperriere
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We played them with respect," Laperriere said. "It's not like we
were sitting back and saying, 'It's going to be an easy one.' We knew
they were going to come hard and we showed them a lot of respect by
working hard too.</TE>
<TE>   "But we didn't get the result we were looking for at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Back in Minnesota, Murray also was hoping for better results in
his recovery from what doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., told him last week was a severe concussion. But it has been a
slow process.</TE>
<TE>   Murray has experienced severe headaches and vomiting over the last
two weeks, symptoms of post-concussion syndrome, and said he is
unable to focus on even the simplest of tasks, such as watching a
game from beginning to end.</TE>
<TE>   The coach also suffered a broken and separated left shoulder, four
broken ribs and numerous cuts and scrapes Feb. 15 when the pickup
truck he was driving skidded off an icy patch of Interstate 90
outside Sparta, Wis., and rolled several times down an embankment.</TE>
<TE>   But it's the concussion that has caused him the most problems.
Like most sufferers of post-concussion syndrome, Murray said he
sometimes feels OK for a short time, but then his symptoms return.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, for instance, he felt great when he phoned Tippett
and said he'd be at practice today.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, feeling ill again, he was back at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "I've just got to get back to feeling good for a couple of days,
rather than a couple of hours," he said. "I haven't had that yet. The
problem is just being able to focus--to keep your thoughts straight
on one thing."</TE>

<HD>After Friday Fight, a Saturday Off</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Some eyebrows were raised when the Lakers, coming off a long and
successful trip, were required to practice Thursday, their first day
back home.</LD>
<LD>   A team that wins four of five games, as did the Lakers, normally
gets rewarded. A team that travels to five cities in eight days, as
did the Lakers, normally gets a break.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers got neither.</LD>
<TE>   Their coach, Phil Jackson, had informed them he doesn't feel they
are ready for the playoffs. And until he thinks they are, they won't
get a day off.</TE>
<TE>   Asked before Friday night's game against the Indiana Pacers if he
had changed his mind, Jackson said, "I don't see that focus yet."</TE>
<TE>   After the game, however, Jackson had a change of heart. He gave
his players Saturday off.</TE>
<TE>   Was it because the Lakers had suddenly found focus in their 96-84
victory over the Pacers?</TE>
<TE>   No, it was because they had found trouble. Kobe Bryant's postgame
punch thrown at Reggie Miller resulted in players from both teams
flailing away while trying to intervene.</TE>
<TE>   A Laker practice Saturday would have resulted in a media mob
surging around the players, trying to get the inside story. Hardly
the atmosphere for honing team focus.</TE>
<TE>   So the Lakers can thank Bryant for getting them that long-desired
day off. The price, however, was steep since it will cost Bryant a
game off, if not more.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Be assured there would have been practice if not for Bryant.
Despite hanging on for the victory, the Lakers again showed the
lapses and shortcomings that are concerning Jackson. The team had 20
turnovers and was outrebounded, 50-42.</TE>
<TE>   But the most glaring deficiency was on the offensive boards. The
Lakers had one offensive rebound, pulled down by Robert Horry.</TE>
<TE>   That's not a misprint. One offensive rebound in the entire game.</TE>
<TE>   "That is why Samaki [Walker, out because of a hyperextended right
elbow] needs to hurry up and get back," Horry said, "so we can get
some rebounds."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Houston, 6:30</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Site--Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 40-17, Rockets 21-36.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Rockets--3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Lakers have won four consecutive against the Rockets
at Staples Center. If, as expected, Bryant is suspended, Jackson can
start Derek Fisher in the backcourt alongside Lindsey Hunter. If he
wants to continue to utilize Fisher's offensive boost off the bench,
Jackson can start Brian Shaw or Mitch Richmond.</TE>

<HD>Bryant Fight Remains a No Decision</HD>
<DH>Lakers: NBA continues its investigation as teammates defend
him. He will sit out at least tonight's game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The other shoe didn't drop Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   League officials spent the day conducting an investigation of the
Kobe Bryant-Reggie Miller fight after Friday night's Laker-Indiana
Pacer game at Staples Center, but they weren't ready to reach any
conclusions on disciplinary action.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant, who struck Miller after the final buzzer had sounded,
faces an automatic one-game suspension for throwing the punch,
meaning he will not play in tonight's game against the Houston
Rockets at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   But officials could assess Bryant additional games since the punch
initiated a wild scene that resulted in referee Ted Bernhardt being
knocked down and players from both teams streaming onto the court as
Bryant and Miller wrestled onto the scorer's table.</TE>
<TE>   A longer suspension would deny the Lakers of Bryant's services
against the New Jersey Nets, owners of the best record in the Eastern
Conference, in a game Tuesday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Ostensibly, the players came out to restore order, but Indiana
forward Austin Croshere suffered worse than either combatant. In the
midst of a pile of players, Croshere emerged with scratches from the
back of his neck down to his lower back. And the top of his uniform
looked as if it had been in a shredder.</TE>
<TE>   Some Lakers and Pacers could be suspended for leaving the bench to
join in a fight, but such a ruling would get into a gray area since
the game had already ended, allowing them to leave the bench area.</TE>
<TE>   This is Bryant's second fight in as many weeks. On a team bus in
Cleveland on Feb. 21, Bryant began teasing teammate Samaki Walker
about money Bryant was owed from a competitive bet. At least others
around them thought it was teasing.</TE>
<TE>   But Bryant, who was seated behind Walker, reached around and
punched the power forward under the right eye.</TE>
<TE>   While Bryant's sudden streak of violence may concern some, his
teammates have come to his defense in the latest incident, choosing
to circle the wagons rather than point fingers.</TE>
<TE>   "Teams have been coming at us quite a bit," said guard Derek
Fisher. "Basically every night, teams are going to raise their game
to another level and try to ... prove a point to us. There really
isn't a point to prove. We are the best team in the league, and a lot
of teams ... think that in one game, or on one play, they can take
that away from us.</TE>
<TE>   "I think sometimes we get fed up. Shaq [O'Neal] has had a
situation this year [when he threw a punch at center Brad Miller,
resulting in a three-game suspension] and now Kobe. Guys need to
defend themselves and do whatever they feel they need to do to make
sure teams don't feel that they can do whatever they want. We have to
make sure that we force them to respect us."</TE>
<TE>   Force has apparently become an acceptable option for a team
obviously feeling the pressure of trying to win its third consecutive
NBA title.</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Rick Fox felt Reggie Miller triggered the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "They let us play physical," Fox said of the officials. "There are
going to be cheap shots. Eventually, by the third quarter, guys are
going to be grabbing and holding.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw a lot of that down the stretch between Reggie and whoever
he was being guarded by. But that is Reggie's game, and that is
nothing new."</TE>
<TE>   There was a different view by the Pacers. While Miller also faces
disciplinary action, his coach, Isiah Thomas, doesn't think he
deserves it.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really see him throw a punch," Thomas said, "and if he
didn't swing, then you're allowed to grab the guy that's swinging at
you. You've got to protect yourself and defend yourself out on the
floor."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A controversial call might have shaken the Portland Trail Blazers
earlier this season.</LD>
<LD>   Not anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Damon Stoudamire made a three-point basket with two-tenths of a
second left in overtime and the Trail Blazers extended their winning
streak to a season-high nine games with a 104-103 victory over the
Bucks on Saturday night at Milwaukee.</LD>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers believed they had a 95-94 lead with 6.3 seconds
left in regulation after Scottie Pippen made an apparent
three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   But as Portland celebrated, replays showed Pippen's right foot was
on the three-point line. The officials changed the shot to a
two-point basket, leaving the score tied, 94-94, and the Trail
Blazers angry--at first.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty upsetting," Pippen said. "But the guys stayed
poised. They knew what this game is about. Even though we were
trailing most of the game, we had confidence that guys were going to
step up and make big shots."</TE>
<TE>   Sam Cassell, who finished with 20 points, converted a four-point
play that gave Milwaukee a 103-101 lead with 3.4 seconds to go.</TE>
<TE>   Stoudamire, who had 24 points, then made the game winner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami 109, Dallas 95--Alonzo Mourning scored 10 of his 23 points
during Miami's decisive 24-5 run to start the third quarter at
Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   The Heat won for the fourth time in five games and continued its
climb into the Eastern Conference playoff race after a 5-23 start.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas, which had won six of seven, got 25 points from Michael
Finley.</TE>
<TE>   Maverick Coach Don Nelson was ejected with 6:18 to play after
receiving a technical foul, his second, for drop-kicking the ball
into the stands during a stoppage in play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston 104, Phoenix 97--Walt Williams, activated by Houston from
the injured list hours before the game, had 13 of his 16 points in
the fourth quarter at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 84, Cleveland 81--Toni Kukoc scored 23 points and the
Hawks rallied after trailing by 15 points after the first quarter at
Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Kukoc made a three-point basket with 3:22 remaining to put the
Hawks ahead to stay, 79-77.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 116, Utah 105--Kevin Garnett had 26 points and 11
rebounds, and Minnesota's reserves produced 56 points at Salt Lake
City.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Malone and Bryon Russell each scored 25 points for the Jazz.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Actually, it was just like old times. He came, he saw, we lost it.</LD>
<LD>   How did Michael Jordan's comeback go? Let's just say it fell
somewhere between tainting all he had done, as many had predicted,
and saving America, which was also mentioned as a possibility.</LD>
<LD>   In real life, we didn't have to wait until he had knee surgery to
find out if his season would end early.</LD>
<TE>   It was always going to end early.</TE>
<TE>   The only question was if it would be late April, if the Washington
Wizards didn't make the playoffs, or early May if they lost in the
first round.</TE>
<TE>   The playoffs last until late June, but everyone knew Jordan's
season would be over by then, although that was the only thing
everyone agreed on.</TE>
<TE>   The trail looks as if it has already run out, unless the young
Wizards can make it worth Jordan's while to return this season,
rather than next. Inconveniently, they've lost six games in a row and
face a schedule crunch.</TE>
<TE>   From start to presumed finish, it was an eye-of-the-beholder trip,
in which everyone had to have an opinion and all the opinions seemed
to line up according to one's interests or personal hobgoblins.</TE>
<TE>   The most memorable thing about Jordan has always been, not
artistry or success, which were real enough, but the attendant
hysteria, which has always been surreal.</TE>
<TE>   Like Chance the gardener, in the movie "Being There," Jordan's
real significance, as opposed to his basketball/entertainment value,
lies in what he shows us about ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Chance was an innocent whose serenity so impressed powerful,
doubt-ridden men, they didn't notice he was stuck in childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan was a living legend, so everything he did was deemed to be
important. In modern society, if nothing momentous is happening,
saturation coverage will make whatever comes up seem momentous.</TE>
<TE>   So the babble poured forth again....</TE>
<TE>   Chicago reporters ripping the Bulls' management said Jordan
shouldn't have left and should have come back there.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago reporters defending the Bulls (a distinct minority) said
it was Jordan's choice, noting his vows never to play anywhere else
or for anyone but Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   New York writers thought it was an ego trip and, worst of all, one
they couldn't get behind. Had Jordan returned as a Knick, they would
have greeted him like Charles Lindbergh.</TE>
<TE>   Ric Bucher, ESPN magazine's crack NBA writer, vowed not to cover
the story, which he considered a sad addendum. Of course, ESPN
magazine, where the motto is, "Who says we can't put Kobe on the
cover again?" is focused on its demographics, or in other words,
teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   However, Jordan was of keen interest to Sports Illustrated, which
is bigger in the merchandising end and yearns to do commercials with
him. Coincidentally or not, former NBA writer Jack McCallum, who's on
good terms with Jordan, was back on the beat, Jordan having refused
to sit down with all other SI writers since the magazine mocked his
baseball dream ... eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   (Jordan, being Jordan, told McCallum he was sorry, a boycott's a
boycott.)</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere, columnists lined up to weigh the moral aspects of it
all.</TE>
<TE>   Some (really) said the story would pull America out of its
post-Sept. 11 gloom.</TE>
<TE>   Some said it would taint Jordan's career, as if it were theirs,
not his.</TE>
<TE>   Guys went after other guys. The New York Daily News' Mike Lupica
kept railing at media lackeys who seemed to resemble ESPN's Stuart
Scott.</TE>
<TE>   In my personal opinion--as usual--all my colleagues are morons. If
Jordan wanted to play basketball again, what was the big deal?</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't the same Jordan, but he was great, playing on his
tiptoes and wiles. It didn't merit the networks' game-a-week pace but
it was remarkable, like watching Larry Bird hold back the clock.</TE>
<TE>   What it wasn't, however, was momentous, even for the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Seasons are about superstars and championships. Jordan was now
down the line, in also-random.</TE>
<TE>   His All-Star return was nice, especially his appearance with an
openly admiring Allen Iverson, but now Jordan was an elder statesman,
not a threat. Acknowledging his new station--happily--Jordan said he
knew he couldn't take over this game, adding he'd warned Kobe Bryant,
"If you make this personal, I'm going to foul out in the first
quarter."</TE>
<TE>   Peers called Jordan an MVP candidate. It was true but the
operative word was "candidate."</TE>
<TE>   The sentimental favorite as most valuable player, Jason Kidd, is a
lock. The real MVP in any season, even this one, is Shaquille O'Neal.
Several others--Bryant, Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Tracy
McGrady--have passed Jordan by.</TE>
<TE>   Just when it seemed--and Jordan thought--he was in the groove, his
right knee began swelling, which can happen to even a remarkable
39-year-old, especially one who had been retired for three years.</TE>
<TE>   Clinging to their interlude, the Wizards managed to spin his
surgery so positively, the Baltimore Sun reported: "Wizards get good
news on Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   If there's any good news for them, it's only that Coach Doug
Collins, who has talked to Jordan, insists Mike will return, if not
this season, next.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he really wants to finish this season and then he'll make
an evaluation for next year," Collins said Friday in Chicago. "...
What we do over the next 15 games will tell a lot about what Michael
will do."</TE>
<TE>   Oops. The Wizards, once promising, then lost to the Bulls, once
dismal, by nine.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of the Wizards' next 13 games are on the road, after which
only four weeks will remain.</TE>
<TE>   So, if it's a while before we see Your Not Quite as Highness,
thanks for the additional memory.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't like your wave-bye-bye shot in Salt Lake in '98, but it
was fine. It says here.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   The Soft Parade: With the Sacramento Kings struggling, hard-nosed
guard Bobby Jackson went off on teammates: "You've got to foul ...
somebody. When guys are making shots, you've got to get up on them
and let them know that, 'No, you're not doing this to me tonight.'
Sometimes I wonder if we've got that. I know some guys have got it
and some guys don't." ... Postscript on the
Chris-Webber-and-Tyra-Banks- want-to-be-alone story: The Sacramento
Bee ran a letter that read: "I will grant no further interviews to
the Sacramento Bee. What Elle MacPherson and I do in private is our
business. (Signed) Stan Taylor, Sacramento." ... Then there were the
San Antonio Spurs, still awaiting their second-half run. They routed
the Kings in a ballyhooed test, then lost at home by 24 to Minnesota,
whereupon Coach Gregg Popovich suggested--for the fourth time this
season--they were soft. Then they lost at home to the Phoenix Suns
and Pop went for No. 5. "We have to be realistic about ourselves,"
David Robinson said. "We're not a championship-caliber team right
now." ... Milwaukee Buck Coach George Karl had carte blanche before
talking owner Herb Kohl into giving Anthony Mason a four-year,
$18-million deal. Now Kohl doesn't want any more personnel
suggestions from Karl. This is lucky, because the exasperated Karl
wanted to go after Raef LaFrentz and Nick Van Exel, offering Sam
Cassell, Glenn Robinson and/or Tim Thomas....  Mason remains his old
sunny self, with the usual answer for their woes--throw the ball to
him more. "They attacked the basket," he said after the loss to the
Lakers, "and we attacked the air, taking jump shots." ... What game
is he watching? Swollen well above his old 250 pounds, Mason can't
get off the ground and poses a minor threat in the post or out with
his comical flat shot. Opponents barely guard him, much less
double-team him.</TE>
<TE>   After the Suns lost at Chicago, Penny Hardaway, who sees a Toronto
knee specialist, decided to drop in on him, since he was in the
neighborhood, more or less. However, Hardaway forgot his passport,
which had to be sent from home, requiring him to miss the next game,
but then he rejoined the team. Noted a Sun insider: "The tragic news
for the Suns: Hardaway comes back to America." The Suns now start Joe
Johnson ahead of Hardaway and want to move Penny, but his contract
has four years at $30 million left. He says he won't help by, say,
opting out in '03 to promote a trade to his hometown, Memphis.... You
won't believe this, but now Penny's offended: "There's a whole lot of
pressure on me being an injured guy who wasn't supposed to play
again. Every mistake I make, the fans are getting on me. Everybody is
down on me. Everybody has given up on me."</TE>
<TE>   Wherever you go, there you are: Charlotte's Elden Campbell was
ripped by Coach Paul Silas for lackadaisical play, benched in the
fourth quarter of the next game, then argued with Silas in the game
after that and was banished to the dressing room. In the next game, a
home loss to the New Jersey Nets, Campbell got an offensive rebound
in the closing seconds with the Hornets behind by two points.
Unfortunately, he thought they trailed by three, passed up the
game-tying layup and threw the ball out to Baron Davis, who missed a
desperation three-point shot.... Charles Barkley on the Winter
Olympics: "Curling is not a sport. I called my grandmother and told
her she could win a gold medal because they have dusting in the
Olympics now."</TE>

<HD>Arizona Sweeps Cal With 99-53 Rout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In perhaps its biggest Pacific 10 Conference game ever, California
came away with the second-worst loss in the school's history.</LD>
<LD>   Rick Anderson had 17 points to lead six Arizona scorers in double
figures as the No. 14 Wildcats routed No. 21 California, 99-53, on
Saturday at Tucson.</LD>
<LD>   It was California's worst loss since a 101-50 rout at Stanford two
years ago. The Bears could have earned a share of the Pac-10 title
with a victory and an Oregon loss to UCLA. Cal hasn't won a
conference championship in 42 years.</LD>
<TE>   Oregon later defeated UCLA and secured the championship outright.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Coach Ben Braun and his players seemed as perplexed as anyone
by the team's uninspired effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't remember many times our team didn't step up and meet
the challenge," Braun said. "It's hard to explain."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona (19-9, 12-6 in the Pac-10) finished tied for second and
will be seeded No. 2 in the Pac-10 tournament because the Wildcats
won all possible tiebreakers.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats held a players-only meeting before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about either being the second seed or the sixth seed.
That was a lot of motivation," guard Jason Gardner said. "There were
a lot of people saying we were going to finish fourth or fifth in the
Pac-10. We wanted to prove everything wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The Bears (21-7, 12-6), swept by Arizona this season, fell behind
14-3, trailed by 19 points at halftime, then were buried by Wildcats
with a 30-4 burst to start the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we don't understand at this point," Cal's Brian
Wethers said. "We knew how important of a game this was and to come
out and give this effort is real frustrating."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, who missed Arizona's practice Friday because of a virus,
played only 20 minutes and had nine rebounds. He made three of five
from three-point range as the Wildcats made 14 of 32 from beyond the
arc and outrebounded the Bears, 48-27.</TE>
<TE>   "Ricky was still really under the weather and had been since early
in the week," Coach Lute Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   California, which beat Arizona State on Thursday night, has not
swept the Arizona schools on the road since they joined the Pac-10 in
1978-79.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 17 Stanford 81, Arizona State 76--Casey Jacobsen scored 19 of
his 29 points in the second half at Tempe, Ariz., as the Cardinal
completed a road sweep through Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Borchardt had 19 points and 17 rebounds, leading Stanford
to a 49-31 rebounding edge.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal (19-8, 12-6) won their second in a row and sixth in
eight. Stanford ended a two-game skid Thursday night by defeating No.
14 Arizona, 76-71, and then defeated the Sun Devils (14-13, 7-11) for
the ninth consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an easy place to play and get a win," Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery said. "ASU is real quick and they overplay
everything. Our guys kept together. Casey was real good and
understood this."</TE>
<TE>   Chad Prewitt had 14 of his 18 points in the second half for
Arizona State (14-13, 7-11), which completed a stretch of playing
five ranked teams in a row, the most in school history. The Sun
Devils were 1-4 during the stretch, defeating only UCLA on Feb. 16.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington State 102, Centenary 80--J Locklier scored a
career-high 40 points and had 11 rebounds as the Cougars (6-21)
finished their season with a victory at Pullman, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Andrew Wisniewski had 40 points for the Gentlemen (14-13).</TE>

<HD>USC Rallies but Can't Quite Get Past Oregon State</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>USC looked forward to the Pacific 10 tournament to get another chance
at Stanford, which went through the conference regular season
undefeated.</LD>
<LD>   But the fourth-seeded Trojans had to get past fifth-seeded Oregon
State for a third time this season.</LD>
<LD>   No such luck.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, before 5,232 at McArthur Court, the Beavers scratched
out a 69-68 victory.</TE>
<TE>   With four seconds left and the score tied, 67-67, Ebony Hoffman,
who was fouled after an offensive rebound, made one of two free
throws to put the Trojans in front.</TE>
<TE>   After a timeout, Oregon State's Felicia Ragland was fouled by
Karmen Krause on the inbounds play with three seconds remaining.
Ragland, who led all scorers with 29 points, made both free throws to
keep the Beavers' season alive.</TE>
<TE>   So Oregon State (16-13) heads to a tournament semifinal game today
against the top-seeded Cardinal. USC fell to 15-13 and must wait for
the NCAA or NIT to call.</TE>
<TE>   Aisha Hollans led USC with 22 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans appeared to be in trouble early, falling behind, 17-4,
in the first eight minutes. They still trailed by nine, 31-22 at the
3:51 mark before closing the gap to 35-33 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   USC tied the score four times in the second half, and took the
lead, 67-65, on Jessica Cheek's 12-foot jumper with 51 seconds to
play. Ragland tied the score again with 39 seconds left on a pair of
free throws, setting up the final, frantic finish.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stanford 96, UCLA 61--For 31/2 minutes of the first half the
Bruins could dare to dream. After all, the top-seeded and
second-ranked Cardinal had missed its first four shots and was
scoreless.</TE>
<TE>   The problem? So was UCLA, which missed its first five shots. The
Bruins would miss six more attempts before getting a basket. By that
time Stanford had run off eight consecutive points, and was rolling
to its 21st consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Despite missing leading scorer Lindsey Yamasaki, who underwent
surgery this week for appendicitis, Stanford (29-1) had little
trouble with UCLA thanks to five players in double figures, led by
Azella Perryman with 17.</TE>
<TE>   Gennifer Arranaga had 16 points to lead the Bruins in scoring for
the fourth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   But she could not keep UCLA's season from ending at 9-20.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State 66, Arizona 58--The third-seeded Sun Devils (22-8),
who trailed 36-26 at halftime, never led until guard Amanda Levens
made a 16-footer with 2:05 left to play. It was her first basket of
the game after missing her first 10 attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State locked up Arizona defensively in the second half;
the Wildcats (14-14) made only four of 23 shots in the last 20
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oregon 78, Washington 64--The tournament will move to San Jose
next season, and no one can be happier than the second-seeded Huskies
(17-11), who lost their 10th consecutive game here. The
seventh-seeded Ducks (17-12) were led by guard Shaquala Williams, who
poured in 26 points. Giuliana Mendiola had 18 for Washington.</TE>

<DH>College basketball: Despite 20 turnovers and 38.5%
shooting, Pepperdine advances with 77-64 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Sometimes you just have to be grateful for a win.</LD>
<LD>   That was Paul Westphal's attitude Saturday after the Pepperdine
coach watched his team sputter like a misfiring engine for much of
its first-round game in the West Coast Conference tournament.</LD>
<LD>   The top-seeded Waves fell behind by seven in the first half, shot
only 38.5% from the field and had 20 turnovers.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, instead of dwelling on negatives, Westphal was counting his
blessings after Pepperdine persevered for a 77-64 victory against
eighth-seeded Portland before 4,360 at Jenny Craig Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad to get away with a win," he said. "We turned the ball
over way too much, didn't shoot well. It's nice to advance."</TE>
<TE>   Junior guard Devin Montgomery led four Waves in double figures
with 17 points as Pepperdine (21-7) advanced to the semifinals
against sixth-seeded St. Mary's (9-19) at approximately 8:45 tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery acknowledged that part of the battle was staying
motivated against a team Pepperdine had beaten by 21 and six points
in two regular-season meetings, but he said that was no excuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now it shouldn't be tough because we're trying to get in
the [NCAA] tournament," Montgomery said. "We have to play hard every
game, no matter who it's against."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine's postseason got off to a rocky start after Portland
(6-24) opened a 28-21 lead on Adam Quick's three-point basket with
7:30 left in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   From that point, though, the Waves seemed to wake up. A layup by
backup center Will Kimble started a 20-3 run that resulted in a 41-31
halftime lead, and Pepperdine led by at least five throughout the
second half on the way to its 16th victory in 17 games.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Mike Westphal, the coach's son, came off the bench to make a
three-point basket and cap the Waves' first-half run with a jump shot
at the buzzer, falling on his backside and helping save the old man's
in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Westphal also contributed with his defense, helping
Pepperdine harass Portland into 26 turnovers and 33.9% shooting from
the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought our defense was pretty good," the elder Westphal said.
"That's why we won the game."</TE>
<TE>   Addressing Portland's turnovers, first-year Coach Michael Holton
said, "That took away any opportunity we had to compete. At the end
of the day, [Pepperdine] had more energy and more aggressiveness."</TE>
<TE>   The Pilots managed to stay in the game by making nine of 25
three-point attempts, including six of 11 by guard Casey Frandsen,
who led all scorers with 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Portland, after falling behind by as many as 15 in the second
half, mounted one last challenge. Free throws by guard Patrick Galos
and forward Coky Rochin pulled the Pilots within 66-61 with 5:05 to
play.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine responded with an 8-0 run, getting a three-point basket
from freshman guard Terrance Johnson and a three-point play by Kimble
on successive possessions. Kimble finished with 10 points, five
rebounds and three blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Jimmy Miggins, the Waves' leading scorer, wasn't a factor
until the second half after being benched because of three fouls in
the first half. He scored 11 of his 14 points in the second half,
including two dunks.</TE>

<LD>On South Fairfax Avenue, in a two-block area, there is a gathering of
Ethiopian restaurants and food stores. Near the Miracle Mile and not
so far from Hancock Park, where the first silent film stars built
their fancy cottages, is Little Ethiopia.</LD>
<LD>   Here is the Messob Ethiopian Restaurant. Brothers Getahun and
Berhanu Asfaw own the restaurant and on the wall they have photos of
celebrities, American and Ethiopian. On the wall are photos of two
runners, a man and a woman, who ran for their lives and for their
country. Abebe Bikila won two Olympic marathon gold medals (in 1960
and 1964); Fatuma Roba won Olympic gold in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   It is with awe that Getahun Asfaw points to the photos. "Heroes,
great heroes," Asfaw says. "In Ethiopia we run to live, we live to
run and because of that we are honored to have the runners pass our
restaurant [today]. Our welcome will be warm."</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Marathon route will carry runners past the front
door of the Messob Ethiopian Restaurant today. This will be near Mile
18 and when they reach the Messob, runners may not notice the spicy
smells or see the Ethiopian flag and American flag, or the balloons
or the cheering brothers, who will be shouting their good wishes. But
all that will be there.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a great thing to see the diversity of this city," Berhanu
Asfaw says, "and with the marathon you can do that."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike any other sporting event, a marathon belongs deep in the
heart of its city. Run the Boston Marathon, you know you aren't in
New York. Run the New York Marathon, you know you aren't in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   A marathon is a celebration of great athletic achievement, but it
couldn't happen without thousands of volunteers who come out to offer
water, put up portable toilets, hand out bib numbers and cold towels,
clean up the after-effects, the dirt and worn-out shoes, to stand at
the finish line hours after the leaders have finished to welcome the
80-year-old great-grandfather or the 15-year-old rookie.</TE>
<TE>   Running the Los Angeles Marathon introduces the athlete to the
smells of the city, to the hint of wasabi in the air as he passes the
New Otani hotel, to the scent of old popcorn and wondrous triumphs as
she passes the Coliseum, to the sniff of bulgogi in Koreatown.</TE>
<TE>   Running the Los Angeles Marathon is a treat to the ears and eyes
of runners and of fans. At 29th and Crenshaw there will be the John
Muir Alumni Drummers pounding out a beat of perseverance.</TE>
<TE>   At 6th and Wilton the Latin Band will encourage somebody to dance
a little salsa.</TE>
<TE>   Pastor Marco Rojas and his Set Free Ministries of Carson will bus
in the Set Free All-Stars to do a little break-dancing and help pass
out water. The Set Free Choir, as Pastor Rojas says, will "sing out a
little sanctified holy rock and roll," at the corner of Olympic and
Vermont, right around Mile 24 when the runners need a little push
from above.</TE>
<TE>   As the runners pass through Hancock Park, the local citizens will
sit in lawn chairs and shout encouragement and the children will
offer cups of water and lemonade. On the corner of Pico and Fairfax,
the runners' mouths will water when they see the Mo Better Meatty
Meat Burgers restaurant and their eyes will widen when they turn the
corner at Pico onto Fairfax and see in the distance the Hollywood
sign.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they will smile as they pass the original Automobile Club of
Southern California building, marvel at the beautiful architecture,
chuckle at the homage Californians paid almost immediately to the
automobile. Running past AAA. Oh, the irony!</TE>
<TE>   The course passes Staples Center, our new athletic palace, at the
three-mile mark, and then our old athletic palace, the Coliseum, less
than two miles farther.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Connolly, once a Los Angeles police sergeant, now retired, and
a 62-year-old coach of the Los Angeles Roadrunners, will lead a group
of 2,000 of his racers from the Wilshire Grand Hotel to the start
line at 2nd and Grand this morning.</TE>
<TE>   He knows this course, has driven it dozens of times, can point out
every pothole and mile marker. He can still smell the freshness of
the bread that used to be delivered from the Helms Bakery on Venice.
"Helms Olympic Bread--Daily at Your Door," says the sign. "Citius,
Altius, Fortius."</TE>
<TE>   "They put up that sign around the 1932 Olympics," Connolly says.
"Everybody in town used to get their bread from Helms." Now the
rehabilitated building is a small shopping center. But the sign
remains and marathoners will pass.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Hamilton High School," Connolly says as he passes the
school on Robertson. "They've filmed a lot of movies there."</TE>
<TE>   Connolly's tour is an overview of all that is good about Los
Angeles. The runners must make a U-turn at Pico and Robertson, to
make sure it is a complete marathon, 26 miles, 385 yards. At the
U-turn corner is Pico Kosher and the B'Nai David Judea temple. In one
block on Pico the athletes will pass Alef Market, Twin Dragon
Shanghai and Zafar Market--Middle Eastern, Chinese, Middle Eastern.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are out and pounding the pavement," says Terry Jones,
"you see the faces of the people in the community and each face tells
you a story. You are really getting up close. When you look at the
faces in Los Angeles, the story is of diversity and of a great, great
spirit. I wish everybody could get out and run the course of the Los
Angeles Marathon."</TE>
<TE>   Jones has run in previous L.A. Marathons and he has also been a
volunteer worker. He now lives in Atlanta but still comes back the
week before the marathon to be, as he says, "a go-fer and then to
run."</TE>
<TE>   Nawania Lyles works at KALI (900), a Christian radio station. She
hosts a gospel radio show on the weekends and is an administrative
assistant during the week. At marathon time, Lyles coordinates the
placement of several gospel singing groups around Exposition and
Martin Luther King boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll have people running from our local churches and people
singing," Lyles says. "We'll have people who come up to us and say
they were on their very last breath and heard our music and were able
to go on. We have people come up to our singers and say how happy
they are to run through a part of the city they would otherwise never
see."</TE>

<HD>Wind Can't Blow Him Off Course</HD>
<DH>Golf: Watson takes lead with a 69 in blustery conditions at
Valencia senior tour event; only four are under par.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the seniors opened their golf season on the Big Island of Hawaii
in January, they expected wind and they got it.</LD>
<LD>   When they came to Southern California this week for the
$1.45-million SBC Senior Classic at Valencia County Club, they
weren't expecting wind. But for the second day of the three-day
tournament, uncommonly strong winds for the Santa Clarita Valley
played havoc with the scores.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Watson, Tom Kite and Doug Johnson, who had to qualify for the
tournament on Monday, handled the conditions better than the rest of
the field Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Watson shot a three-under-par 69 for a two-round total of 141 to
take a two-stroke lead over Kite, Johnson and Gil Morgan going into
today's final round.</TE>
<TE>   Kite also shot a 69, Johnson had a 70, and Morgan, who was one
shot back after the first round, shot a 72.</TE>
<TE>   No other golfers in the field of 78 were under par after two
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   First-round leader Tom Purtzer shot 72 Saturday and is at even-par
144.</TE>
<TE>   "Gosh, it's calm in here," said Kite when he came into the
clubhouse after his round.</TE>
<TE>   Watson had a similar reaction after coming off the course.</TE>
<TE>   "Bet you guys are glad you're not playing out there," he said.
"It's a struggle out there."</TE>
<TE>   Not helping matters was the 6,905-yard, par-72 layout.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the toughest course on our tour," Watson said. "And the
wind just makes it tougher.</TE>
<TE>   "I never felt comfortable out there. It felt like I put my round
together with baling wire and duct tape."</TE>
<TE>   Watson said there wasn't much difference between the wind on
Friday and the wind Saturday. It was gusting at 20-30 mph both days.</TE>
<TE>   "It was coming from the same direction, and it was swirling,"
Watson said.</TE>
<TE>   Watson bogeyed the tough, 190-yard par-three third hole to go one
over for the round.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a bad club selection there," he said. "I hit a six-iron
that flew the green."</TE>
<TE>   Watson had four birdies and one bogey the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   He hit his shot of the day on the 470-yard, par-four 10th. After
his tee shot landed in the right rough, he sliced a three-wood 220
yards to within 15 feet and made the putt.</TE>
<TE>   "It sliced about 50 yards," he said. "It was a thing of beauty."</TE>
<TE>   Both Watson and Kite think playing in windy conditions gives them
an advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "I love playing in the wind," Kite said. "I think I'm a better
wind player than most of the guys."</TE>
<TE>   Said Watson: "I enjoy the wind. It's the unknown factor, the most
challenging factor. It's like a chess game. There's a lot of guess
work. That's where the short game comes into play, where you're
having to get up and down. And that's my forte."</TE>
<TE>   More strong winds are forecast today.</TE>
<TE>   Gibby Gilbert, 61, won the Georgia Pacific Super Seniors, earning
the $39,000 first prize. Gilbert birdied the final hole of the
two-day competition played within the SBC Senior Classic to break a
tie with George Archer, 62, who earned $29,000 for second place.
Gilbert, who shot a 71 Saturday, is at 145. Archer, with a 71, is at
146. It was Gilbert's first Super Seniors victory.</TE>

<HD>At Least Amy, Tonya Are in Lavin's Corner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So who gets knocked out first? Tonya Harding, Amy Fisher or UCLA?</LD>
<LD>   Trick question--UCLA won't open the NCAA tournament until a day or
two after Harding and Fisher meet in a March 13 three-round boxing
match for Fox.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   AS EVERYONE knows, Coach Steve Lavin is at his very best with his
white shirt pressed to the wall, and if he doesn't get a win in the
first round of the Pacific 10 Conference tournament this week, the
Bruins can still win their 20th game of the season in the first round
of the NCAA tournament. Or, the NIT.</TE>
<TE>   It's all about redemption, as Harding and Fisher can tell you, and
Lavin has two huge chances to solidify his reputation either
way--albeit as the coach who has the Bruins playing their best when
it counts, or the coach forever in over his head.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIS BULLETIN JUST IN FROM PAULEY!</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's fine crop of freshmen and sophomores dazzled the crowd and
befuddled Pac-10 Conference champion Oregon with their frenzied play
for one glorious stretch Saturday, prompting Lavin to say, just
picture how good they'll be after he works with them for the next few
years.</TE>
<TE>   Please, ladies and gentlemen, no screaming or cursing while
running out of Pauley Pavilion.... Players have been known to improve
on their own, you know.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MAYBE IT wasn't such a good idea putting all those youngsters into
the game at the same time--and on Seniors Day. I wonder, did the
older, slower, departing group sitting on the bench look as promising
four years ago as the speedy kids who were throwing a scare into
Oregon?</TE>
<TE>   Some people might take heart in the Bruins' ability to stay close
to Oregon--making it real tough for the Ducks to win for the first
time in Pauley Pavilion since 1984. Maybe that's considered a step
forward these days for UCLA basketball.</TE>
<TE>   In Lavin's postgame news conference, no one asked him why he
didn't use one of his remaining timeouts with 13 seconds to play and
trailing Oregon by three points. Instead, the reporters dwelled on
the positive play of the youngsters, the media apparently already
moving on to next year and no longer interested in chronicling
Lavin's last-minute frazzled thinking.</TE>
<TE>   After eight consecutive weekends of split decisions, the Pac-10
tournament is a life preserver for Lavin &amp; Co., providing the Bruins
an additional chance to build momentum. There's no reason to believe
the Bruins won't make it into the Pac-10 title game at Staples
Center, of course, and then ride that wave into another Sweet 16 NCAA
finish, because that's the Lavin way until proven otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   If proven otherwise, Harding and Fisher just might have their
cornerman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN FOX announced the Harding-Fisher bout, which will have
Partridge Family bully Danny Bonaduce taking on the
older-than-he-looks Barry Williams from the Brady Bunch, the network
declined to say who would be fighting it out in the third match of
the night.</TE>
<TE>   When Kobe Bryant treated Samaki Walker like a sparring partner, I
should have guessed, but it wasn't until after he popped Reggie
Miller and I took a look at the Laker schedule and noticed the team
isn't playing March 13 that I figured it out.</TE>
<TE>   What do you think? Kobe and Shaquille O'Neal in a tag-team
wrestling match with the Miller boys, Reggie and Brad? Talk about a
night of tried-and-true Fox entertainment beginning with Tonya and
Amy, and maybe the winner guaranteed a shot at Darva Conger. And
after Danny and Barry go toe-to-toe, Fox's own Lisa Guerrero could
make an appearance as ring girl for the NBA smackdown. Tell me that
wouldn't be must-see TV in your house--if your wife would let you.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE MADE-for-TV movie, "A Season on the Brink" with Brian Dennehy
playing Bobby Knight, will be simulcast on ESPN and ESPN2 at the same
time, one with cursing and one with the cursing deleted. No
indication what ESPN2 will run when its version of "A Season on the
Brink" runs an hour shorter than the cussing version.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW HERE'S what you like to hear from one of the new Dodgers,
pitcher Omar Daal: "I don't feel I have to prove anything to
anybody," after giving up five runs in 12/3 innings of work.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I SEE in the paper that USC Coach Henry Bibby attributes four
close defeats--including three conference losses--to a lack of
leadership from his players. Good thing Bibby isn't coaching at UCLA,
or those losses would be blamed on the coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TROJANS have a go-to big-game winner in Sam Clancy; UCLA's
Jason Kapono took two shots in the second half against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BEFORE SATURDAY'S game, Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry said it will
probably take 45 wins to make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   After beating the Warriors, the Clippers have 22 games remaining,
which means they'll have to go 15-7 without Corey Maggette and Lamar
Odom. Turn out the lights, the party's over.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MOST PEOPLE thought Dennis Miller talked over the heads of the
"Monday Night Football" audience, and now they've got a guy in John
Madden who has made a career of dumbing down football to everyone and
treating the audience as if it's a convention of cavemen who just
love it when he yells, "boom," and draws a circle around the big
belly of an offensive lineman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Mitchell Kim:</TE>
<TE>   "How dare you talk about those players like that. You have some
nerve to pick on them. That was totally biased, unfair and uncalled
for."</TE>
<TE>   I don't know which players you're referring to, but I'm sure
you're correct.</TE>

<LD>From the empty red chair to the subdued public address introduction
for his replacement, former coach Nolan Richardson was much in
evidence when Arkansas beat Vanderbilt, 81-67, at Bud Walton Arena in
Fayetteville, Ark.</LD>
<LD>   The last six years of Richardson's contract were bought out by the
school Friday after a tumultuous week in which the coach made
comments concerning fans, the media and his treatment as the only
black head coach at Arkansas.</LD>
<LD>   After 17 seasons as Arkansas coach that included three Final Four
appearances and a national championship in 1994, Richardson was
replaced by Mike Anderson for the Razorbacks' final regular-season
game.</LD>
<TE>   For 21 years, Anderson has been a part of Richardson-coached
teams--first as a player, then as a volunteer assistant, recruiting
coordinator and in recent seasons assistant head coach the past
couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   On the sideline Saturday, in the middle of the players on the
bench, was an empty red chair. Draped over the chair was a red towel,
with Richardson's name in white. The towel was a gift after he
recorded his 500th Division I victory in December.</TE>
<TE>   When junior guard Charles Tatum was benched during the game, he
sat down, put his arm around the empty chair and began talking to the
towel.</TE>
<TE>   When it came time for pregame introductions, announcer Johnny
George ran through the starting five with some pizazz and then, in a
low-key voice introduced "Assistant coach Mike Anderson."</TE>
<TE>   For years, George has made quite a show of introducing the head
coach with a growling drawn out, "No-lan Rrriiicchhhhaardson."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson wore black loafers; a far cry from the flashy boots that
set off Richardson's ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the players had written "NR" or "Nolan Richardson" on
their shoes. Most of them were wearing white armbands with "NR" on
them.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing suits, three non-players from the Razorback entourage
sported big red ribbons with white polka dots on their coats. Before
Richardson arrived at Arkansas, he coached five seasons at Tulsa,
where polka dot shirts became his trademark.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas, 14-14 overall and 6-10 in the Southeastern Conference,
pulled away from Vanderbilt (16-13, 6-10) with a 13-0 run early in
the second half. Teddy Gipson, one of four Razorback seniors playing
their final game at Walton Arena, led Arkansas with 19 points. The
other seniors--Brandon Dean, Jannero Pargo and T.J. Cleveland--also
scored in double figures.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, students held up several signs thanking Richardson
and noting his 389 victories with the Razorbacks. "Thanks for the
memories," one said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A senior moment: Before Georgetown's game against Rutgers, point
guard Kevin Braswell--the Hoyas' only senior-- gathered his teammates
in a huddle and told them: "It's my last game at the MCI Center for
Georgetown, and I don't want to go out a loser."</TE>
<TE>   He certainly didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Braswell was in control throughout an 88-69 victory, scoring 18
points and handing out a school-record 16 assists to become
Georgetown's all-time leader in that category (677). He had assists
on the first three baskets of the second half, including the career
record-setter on a feed to Mike Sweetney for a layup.</TE>
<TE>   "It couldn't be any better. Everybody came through today,"
Braswell said. "I was just so happy that we won. I was just pushing
the guys, telling them that we can't win this game by five or six
points. When we played at Rutgers we lost in overtime by two. We want
to show the selection committee that we're a good team and we're
playing our best ball."</TE>
<TE>   Georgetown (18-10) won its third in a row in an attempt to earn an
at-large berth to the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the day: Elvin Mims scored a career-high 35 points
in his final collegiate game as Southern Mississippi dealt South
Florida's NCAA tournament hopes a serious blow in a 92-75 victory at
Hattiesburg, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Mims made 15 of 21 shots and also had 14 rebounds, four steals and
two blocked shots. Southern Mississippi (10-17) didn't qualify for
the Conference USA tournament, which South Florida (18-11) will have
to win to reach the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Performance of the weak: Southeastern Louisiana in a 61-39 loss to
Nicholls State, which had won only one of its previous 26 games.</TE>

<DH>UCLA: A 65-62 loss to Oregon gives Bruins their eighth
consecutive 1-1 week and sends them stumbling into conference
tournament as sixth-place team.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Drained, dissatisfied and, by day's end, deep-sixed.</LD>
<LD>   As in a sixth-place Pacific 10 Conference finish, deepest in UCLA
history.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan Walcott's three-point try bounced off the rim, the horn
sounded, and the Bruins left Pauley Pavilion for the last time this
season 65-62 losers to Oregon on Saturday before 11,680 who came to
cheer seniors yet were roused only by underclassmen.</LD>
<TE>   The outcome was at once extraordinary and expected. It was
Oregon's first victory at UCLA in 18 years and the eighth week in a
row the Bruins have gone 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   The long stretch of mediocrity has left UCLA (19-10, 11-7 in the
Pac 10) unranked and unconvincing. Three victories in a row will be
needed to win the conference tournament, which begins Thursday at
Staples Center, with the Bruins playing California at 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that is the NCAA tournament, and 1-1 won't get UCLA very
far in that, either.</TE>
<TE>   "I firmly believe we can do it," forward Jason Kapono said of the
Pac-10 tournament. "But we can say all the good words we want. We
have to go out and prove it."</TE>
<TE>   Good deeds are something the No. 13 Ducks (22-7, 14-4) have
learned to accomplish. They came to the Southland seeking their first
Pac-10 title, and first outright title in any conference in 63 years,
and swept USC and UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot more to do," said Oregon forward Fredrick Jones,
who scored 22 points two days after hitting the winning shot against
USC. "It feels good to win two on the road. We'll come back next week
feeling even better."</TE>
<TE>   After Jones' layin extended a one-point lead to three with 12
seconds left, the Bruins hurried down the floor and initiated a
pick-and-roll at the top of the key with Kapono cutting around Matt
Barnes.</TE>
<TE>   As was the case the entire game, Kapono couldn't get open and
Barnes passed to Walcott, who ducked under Jones and missed the shot.
Kapono, UCLA's leading scorer, had seven points and took only two
shots in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Walcott, a sparingly used redshirt freshman point guard, was on
the floor the last 5:48 instead of freshman Cedric Bozeman because he
provided quickness covering Oregon's Luke Ridnour.</TE>
<TE>   Walcott did not play in the first half but committed only one
turnover in 16 second-half minutes and held Ridnour to three points
after he had scored 11 in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "I was glad to see Ryan have the confidence and courage to take
that last shot," Coach Steve Lavin said. "He's going to have a great
career ahead of him and he played his heart out."</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman was coming off several strong efforts, but his development
hit a snag. He had four turnovers and made one of four shots, a
three-pointer during a seven-minute surge that temporarily
transformed senior day into romper room.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin inserted sophomore T.J. Cummings and freshmen Walcott,
Bozeman, Dijon Thompson and Andre Patterson with Oregon leading,
45-40. The Ducks still led, 54-51, when Kapono and seniors Dan
Gadzuric, Billy Knight, Matt Barnes and Rico Hines checked back in
with 6:16 to play, but the youngsters' time was marked by a
high-flying tempo and exuberant defense.</TE>
<TE>   They held Oregon to one basket and one free throw in a stretch of
10 possessions, forcing three turnovers. The crowd roared its
approval when Walcott's three-pointer gave UCLA its first lead since
the first five minutes, 49-48, with 7:52 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a bright spot and a sneak preview, a glimpse into the
future," Lavin said. "Those guys really sparked us."</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric was a factor throughout the game, scoring 22 points and
grabbing 11 rebounds in 30 minutes. However, he missed four free
throws, including one with 42.9 seconds left that could have tied the
score. That meant after Jones scored, UCLA had to take a three-point
shot on the last possession.</TE>
<TE>   None of the other seniors turned in a memorable performance.
Knight scored four points, Barnes scored 10 on three-for-11 shooting
and Hines made his only attempt and had two steals in 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have any legs and it took a lot to get going," Barnes
said. "Only Dan played great."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA trailed, 37-31, at halftime and did not begin the second half
well. On the Bruins' first possession, Gadzuric had no one to pass to
for 10 seconds, Knight couldn't find anybody either, and Barnes
tossed up an air ball trying to beat the shot clock.</TE>
<TE>   The disorganized display begged the question: What was said in the
locker room during halftime?</TE>
<TE>   With the regular season in the books, much remains puzzling about
the Bruins.</TE>

<DH>USC: Denied a chance at Pac-10 title because of Thursday's
last-second loss to Oregon, Trojans take out frustration on Oregon
State, 79-45.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anetta Harris was breathless and in a near sprint as she bounded to
the USC bench.</LD>
<LD>   Sam Clancy's mother, who had arrived from Cleveland two days
earlier, was unfamiliar with Los Angeles traffic patterns. She was so
late to the Sports Arena Saturday that she nearly missed taking the
walk to midcourt with her son, who was being recognized as one of
USC's four fourth-year players during pregame senior day festivities.</LD>
<LD>   But with the crowd of 7,012, standing and chanting "MVP, MVP, MVP"
at her son, a sense of calm and pride came over Harris, who was
diagnosed with breast cancer in the fall and was about to see her
oldest son play in person for the first time in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   She had a great view as Clancy and two young party-crashers,
freshman Errick Craven and sophomore Desmon Farmer, led the
19th-ranked Trojans to a 79-45 demolition of hapless Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   USC (20-8 overall, 12-6 in the Pacific 10), which lost a shot at
the conference title when it lost to Oregon on Thursday night,
finished in a four-way tie for second place with Arizona, California
and Stanford and will be seeded fourth in the Pac-10 tournament. The
Trojans will meet fifth-seeded Stanford Thursday at 3:30 p.m. at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans have won at least 20 games in consecutive seasons for
the first time since 1938-39 and 1939-40. And their 44 victories the
past two seasons are the most they've ever had over a two-year
period, eclipsing their 43 victories in 1990-91 (19) and 1991-92
(24).</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, Craven and Farmer made it happen on a day when USC Coach
Henry Bibby emptied his bench and got 15 players into the game.</TE>
<TE>   "To get everybody involved keeps everybody in harmony," Bibby
said. "That's good for the team."</TE>
<TE>   Especially with the way USC has lost games this year.</TE>
<TE>   A slew of last-second defeats--the Trojans lost four games on
buzzer-beating shots, three of them in conference play--cost USC a
shot at its first league title in 17 years. The heartbreakers, the
latest of which was the 67-65 loss to first-place Oregon, hurt the
team mentally as well as statistically.</TE>
<TE>   Things were different Saturday, though, as the Trojans were
yucking it up on the sidelines, cheering, waving towels and hugging
as the final seconds ticked away.</TE>
<TE>   While Craven started with seniors Clancy, David Bluthenthal,
Gennaro Busterna and Brandon Granville, Farmer came off the bench
against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't point fingers or anything like that, but there was a
lot of negative energy in the locker room after Thursday," said
Craven, who had 20 points with eight rebounds and a career-high seven
steals against the Beavers.</TE>
<TE>   "After today, it's all positive. ... This game brought us
together."</TE>
<TE>   The 45 points the newly happy Trojans allowed the ninth-place
Beavers (12-17, 4-14) tied the lowest scoring output allowed in a
Pac-10 game this season.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer emerged from a slump by getting 17 points, six rebounds and
three steals in 20 minutes. In his previous seven games he had scored
a combined 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, who posted their most conference victories since the
1996-97 season, had 18 steals and limited the Beavers to 29.8%
shooting. USC also grabbed a season-high 54 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Clancy had 20 points, nine rebounds, three steals and two blocks
to cement his status as a leading candidate for Pac-10
player-of-the-year honors.</TE>
<TE>   Harris, who was late because she had to pick up her daughter from
the airport, was impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "I have three children, but this is the most proud I've been,"
said Harris, who is scheduled to undergo her fifth chemotherapy
treatment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It meant a lot to see them out there," said Clancy. "Just to see
them there ... meant everything."</TE>
<TE>   Clancy, whose grade-point average dipped below 2.0 after the fall
semester, dropping him from Wooden Award consideration, acknowledged
this week that news of his mother's illness was a factor in his
grades slipping.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was in a state of shock that his mother may have been
leaving him," Harris said. "But I don't want to leave. I don't want
to miss a beat. He's my hero."</TE>

<LD>Temeka Johnson made a free throw with 4.5 seconds remaining to help
Louisiana State upset No. 3 Tennessee, 81-80, in the semifinals of
the Southeastern Conference tournament Saturday at Nashville.</LD>
<LD>   Kara Lawson, who had 27 points, scored the last 13 for Tennessee
but her jumper bounced off the rim as time expired for the top-seeded
Lady Vols (25-4). It was Tennessee's first loss to an unranked team
since it lost to Auburn in the semifinals of the SEC tournament on
March 2, 1997.</LD>
<LD>   Making the upset more shocking was that Louisiana State played
only six players and had only seven available. Coach Sue Gunter has
lost three players to torn knee ligaments during the season and a
fourth player sat out the season to heal from various injuries.</LD>
<TE>   "We had to make up our minds just about the time the conference
started, 'Are we going to chunk this year in because we've got an
All-SEC center down and we've got two other starters down? Or are we
going to suck it up and be competitors?'" Gunter said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawson tied it, 80-80, with 51.1 seconds left with three free
throws, after being fouled on a three-pointer. But she committed a
turnover when Tennessee regained possession, and Johnson went to the
line on the resulting foul.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-seeded Tigers (16-10) advanced to their first title
game since 1991, when they won. LSU will play Vanderbilt.</TE>
<TE>   LSU made 25 of 29 free throws; Tennessee made 17 of 18.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who made 12 of 15 free throws, finished with 18 points
and Roneeka Hodges led the Tigers with 23 points.</TE>

<TE>   No. 6 Vanderbilt 81, Arkansas 78--Zuzi Klimesova scored 21 points,

was Vanderbilt Coach Jim Foster's 500th career victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 9 Louisiana Tech 95, Nevada 65--Ayana Walker had 19 points to

Ruston, La.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 North Carolina 78, Maryland 53--Nikki Teasley scored 25
points and Coretta Brown had 23 as the second-seeded Tar Heels (23-7)
won in the quarterfinals of the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament
at Greensboro, N.C. North Carolina advanced to play North Carolina
State in today's semifinals.</TE>

<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>No longer are the Angels all happy campers. The team unilaterally
renewed the contracts of its three prized young starting pitchers
Saturday, a decision that left budding ace Jarrod Washburn
"disappointed" and Ramon Ortiz calling the Angels "cheap."</LD>
<LD>   The team has touted Washburn, Ortiz and Scott Schoeneweis as the
potential foundation of a rotation for years to come. But, since they
have less than three years of major league service, the team can
dictate their salaries if a contract agreement cannot be reached. The
Angels did that with all three Saturday, a disillusioning day for
pitchers whose performance is critical to the success of this year's
team.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not good," Washburn said. "We've talked a lot about this the
last few days, and I think we're all disappointed."</LD>
<TE>   The Angels signed Washburn for $350,000, Schoeneweis for $325,000
and Ortiz for $270,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels offered a three-year contract to Washburn and a
four-year contract to Ortiz, but at salaries far below what the
pitchers and their agents considered reasonable in exchange for
giving up the right to salary arbitration. Schoeneweis was not
offered a long-term deal.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the pitchers nor team officials would disclose the amount
of the offers, but Washburn said the Angels were inflexible.</TE>
<TE>   "They came in with an offer. They didn't negotiate. That's not
conducive to getting something done," he said. "They basically said,
either we get you at a bargain or you get nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz, noting that General Manager Bill Stoneman had signed third
baseman Troy Glaus and catcher Bengie Molina to four-year contracts,
called his offer "very cheap" and wondered why the team would not
treat him as it had Glaus and Molina. Ortiz, 28, pitched 209 innings
last season, won 13 games and posted a 4.36 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   "The Angels are not liking me for the future," Ortiz said. "They
gave me a cheap contract.... I need a good contract. I need to take
care of my family. I'm not happy."</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman acknowledged that contract renewals are "not a fun thing
to do." He said he would "keep the door open" to reviving talks on
those long-term deals and said the team continues to think highly of
all three pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   "Contract negotiation is part of the business," he said.
"Unfortunately, sometimes a player can take it personally."</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels hired Stoneman away from the Montreal Expos' front
office, he brought with him a salary scale for players not yet
eligible for arbitration. Typically, front-line players get the
$200,000 minimum wage as rookies, under $300,000 as second-year
players and under $400,000 as third-year players.</TE>
<TE>   Not all teams employ such a scale. The Detroit Tigers paid Jeff
Weaver $425,000 last year after his second season, in which he
pitched 200 innings, won 11 games and posted a 4.32 ERA. In his
second season last year, Washburn, 27, pitched 193 innings and won 11
games with a 3.77 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels offered $375,000 and, after he said no, renewed him
at $350,000. The Angels offered Ortiz $450,000 this year as part of
that four-year offer and, after he said no, renewed him at $270,000.</TE>
<TE>   In his second season last year, Schoeneweis, 28, pitched 205
innings, won 10 games and posted a 5.08 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Boras, the agent for Washburn and Schoeneweis, said he
understood the variances between teams but wondered why the Angels
would not offer his clients more than the $375,000 the team paid to
Jason Dickson in 1999. In the previous season, Dickson pitched 122
innings, won 10 games and posted a 6.05 ERA. That contract, however,
was negotiated by Stoneman's predecessor, Bill Bavasi.</TE>
<TE>   "With players you want to have in your organization long-term, you
have to have consistency in how the organization treats those
players," Boras said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz struck out four in two innings in the Angels' 7-4 Cactus
League victory over the Oakland Athletics on Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Kent Breaks Wrist Washing His Truck</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Francisco second baseman Jeff Kent broke a bone in his left wrist
while washing his truck and will be sidelined at least four weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Kent, the 2000 National League most valuable player, revealed the
injury to Giant trainer Stan Conte on Saturday morning after swelling
and soreness set in overnight.</LD>
<LD>   Kent, who owns a white pickup with four-inch lifts, was at a
self-serve car wash in Scottsdale when he hurt himself Friday
evening. He slipped and broke the wrist when he tried to break his
fall.</LD>
<TE>   "I was straddling the back of my truck when I slipped and fell,"
Kent said. "I didn't think much of it at the time and finished
washing my truck. It started swelling up during the night and got
really sore."</TE>
<TE>   Kent, who had X-rays done on the wrist, might return to San
Francisco for further tests, which could reveal ligament damage. He
will be put in a cast for the next month.</TE>
<TE>   "The fracture is at the end of the bone, so we really caught a
break," Conte said. "He was pretty depressed when he came in this
morning. I guarantee you he'll never wash his car again as long as
he's a Giant."</TE>
<TE>   Giant Manager Dusty Baker said he's still expecting Kent to start
the regular season as the second baseman and clean-up hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in miracles," said Baker. "I want Jeff back as early as
possible. Luckily it's March 2 and not April 2.</TE>
<TE>   "We're counting on starting Jeff. If he can't go, we'll go to plan
B, plan C or plan D."</TE>
<TE>   Kent said: "I came to camp in shape and I can still run and throw.
I can also take one-arm swings. It's not a major issue."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Giambi needed only a few swings to prove what the New York
Yankees already knew: He's a perfect fit in pinstripes.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi got off to a smashing debut for his new team, hitting a
two-run homer in his very first at-bat and later launching a solo
shot Saturday in a 6-3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays at Tampa,
Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "I set my expectation level a little high today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The star first baseman exited after five innings to high-fives
from his teammates and a standing ovation from the crowd of 10,205 at
Legends Field.</TE>
<TE>   "That's certainly a statement, even if it is just spring
training," owner George Steinbrenner gushed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chan Ho Park gave up three hits and two runs in his Texas debut as
the Rangers beat the Cincinnati Reds, 4-3, at Port Charlotte, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Park, who signed a five-year, $65-million contract as a free agent
after six years with the Dodgers, surrendered a run-scoring double to
Todd Walker and an RBI single to Adam Dunn in the third inning. Park
walked two and struck out three in the 51-pitch outing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most pitches I've thrown in my first game," Park said.
"I would like to throw 100 pitches before the end of spring
training."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Milwaukee Brewers signed left-handed setup specialist Ray King
to a two-year contract with a club option for a third season.
Financial terms weren't available.</TE>

<HD>Came Home Aces First Test at a Longer Distance</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: In his initial race around two turns,
3-year-old easily wins the $200,000 San Rafael Stakes by three
lengths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Came Home passed his first important 3-year-old exam Saturday at
Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   Making his initial start around two turns, the son of Gone West
and 3-5 favorite took advantage of a good trip, winning by three
lengths over 11-1 longshot Easy Grades and five others in the
$200,000 San Rafael Stakes. He completed the mile in 1:36 1/5.</LD>
<LD>   Still ahead, however, are more significant--and longer--tests. The
question with Came Home has never been ability, but rather how far he
would run. His pedigree suggests distance limitations and many have
questioned whether he is truly a mile and a quarter horse, the
distance of the Kentucky Derby.</LD>
<TE>   After the colt's fifth victory in six starts, jockey Chris
McCarron and John Toffan, who owns Came Home with Trudy McCaffery,
Bill Farish and John Goodman, were confident about the immediate
future.</TE>
<TE>   That would be the $750,000 Santa Anita Derby on April 6. In that
Grade I, Came Home will stretch out another furlong to 11/8 miles.
Then, presumably, if all goes well, it will be on to Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   "I never had a problem about [distance]," Toffan said. "One of the
writers had a problem with it. He can do a little more than sprint.
It didn't look like he was going to stop for a while today."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, other recent San Rafael winners have been found wanting
when tried beyond a mile. Horses like Crafty C.T., who was impressive
winning his comeback sprint earlier on the card, Orville N Wilbur's,
Funontherun and Honour And Glory come to mind.</TE>
<TE>   Content to sit second while eventual third-place finisher Werblin
set a leisurely pace (232/5 and 472/5 for the half-mile), Came Home
took over the lead nearing the stretch and wasn't fully extended en
route to his second stakes win of the meet.</TE>
<TE>   A month earlier, in his first race since he checked in seventh in
the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last Oct. 27, he had won the seven-furlong
San Vicente by four lengths.</TE>
<TE>   "I was more than pleased, I was ecstatic after the race," said
McCarron, who won his fourth San Rafael, but his first since Dinard
in 1991. "Obviously, he looked like the best horse on paper, but the
way he finished was very promising.</TE>
<TE>   "He settled better last time than he did today. He was a little
keener for this one. I'm going to take a shot in the dark and think
that, sometimes, a horse can be a little more aggressive in their
second race back.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have any qualms about his ability to get a mile going
into this race, but now he showed me he will go a mile and an eighth.
The next eighth of a mile after that, who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before Bobby Frankel won his first Santa Anita Handicap with
Milwaukee Brew, the hall of fame trainer had another stakes first of
sorts Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Decarchy, one of three horses he saddled in the $300,000 Jimmy
Kilroe Mile, outnodded 15-1 longshot Sarafan to give Frankel his
first win in the race re-named two years ago in honor of Santa
Anita's late longtime director of racing. Frankel had won the Grade
II with Tychonic in 1996 when it was called the Arcadia Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   Like Milwaukee Brew, Decarchy, a 5-year-old son of Distant View
and an 8-1 outsider, was ridden by Kent Desormeaux as he won by a
neck in 1:34 over the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Sarafan, one of two horses sent out by trainer Neil Drysdale--the
other, Irish Prize, finished seventh--wound up a head in front of
Designed For Luck, who beat Val Royal, the 6-5 favorite, by a neck
for third.</TE>
<TE>   "We really got a fortunate trip," Desormeaux said. "Everything set
up nicely. It was a very, very game win."</TE>
<TE>   Especially considering he was hit in the face by the whip of
jockey Victor Espinoza, who was riding Designed For Luck, three times
in the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Making his first start since winning the Breeders' Cup Mile, Val
Royal had no visible excuses, but the plan is to take him to Dubai
for the $2-million Duty Free on March 23.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Fernando Valenzuela was to undergo surgery on a broken left
arm Saturday night. He was unseated when his 11th-race mount,
Ceelinctive, jumped a shadow on the backstretch.</TE>
<TE>   Valenzuela's agent, Eddie Garcia, said that Valenzuela already had
a plate in the arm, the result of an earlier spill.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia estimated Valenzuela would be sidelined five months.</TE>

<HD>Northridge Wins, 62-54</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Cal State Northridge used its pressure defense to swarm Utah State in
the first half, then relied on some grit in the closing moments to
pull out a 62-54 Big West Conference victory before 1,513 at
Northridge on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Northridge (12-15, 11-7) won its fourth in a row and denied Utah
State the conference title outright. The Aggies (21-6, 13-5) will
share the regular-season championship with UC Irvine, but will be the
top seed when the tournament begins Thursday at the Anaheim
Convention Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Matadors will finish in a tie for third.</LD>
<TE>   Northridge took a 25-5 lead with a disarming full-court trap that
confused Utah State. The Aggies had 20 turnovers in the first
half--eight in the first six minutes--and finished with a season-high
25.</TE>
<TE>   Utah State pulled within one on Ronnie Ross' three-pointer with
5:37 remaining. But the Matadors got a key basket from Ian Boylan for
a 56-50 lead, and they made six of eight free throws in the final
1:17 to close out one of their biggest victories of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Boylan had a game-high 16 points and Markus Carr had 14 points and
seven assists.</TE>

<HD>White's Big Shot Lifts Redondo</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With time running out and Redondo Union trailing Riverside King by
two points, Sea Hawk swingman Wendell White spun away from two
defenders and took an off-balance three-pointer that seemingly made
time stand still.</LD>
<LD>   "My heart dropped," Redondo forward Adam Zahn said. "I knew if he
missed, we wouldn't have another chance."</LD>
<LD>   Somehow, the ball banked off the backboard and dropped into the
basket, giving third-seeded Redondo Union a 71-70 victory over
top-seeded King in the Southern Section Division II-A championship
Saturday at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like my soul left my body as soon as [White] hit that shot,"
King forward Leon Rosborough said.</TE>
<TE>   King (27-4) rallied from a 10-point third-quarter deficit behind
the spirited play of Rosborough (29 points) and Marvin Lea (22),
taking a 68-64 lead with less than two minutes to play in the game on
a pull-up jumper by Matthew Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo (23-6) tied the score on a baseline jumper from White and
two Keith Ellison free throws before Lea drove the lane and hit the
shot that put the Wolves ahead, 70-68</TE>
<TE>   The three-pointer was White's second consecutive game-winning
basket. He hit a three-pointer to lift Redondo past second-seeded
Santa Margarita in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the presence of mind to take that shot," Redondo Coach Tom
Maier said. "A lot of kids in that position wouldn't under that
duress."</TE>
<TE>   Ellison led the Sea Hawks with 22 points, Wendell added 20 and
Zahn had 14 points, 12 rebounds and three blocked shots.</TE>

<TE>   Long Beach Poly 64, Rialto Eisenhower 53--In winning their third
Division I-AA title in six years and first since 2000, the
second-seeded Jackrabbits knocked off the top-seeded team and avenged
one of their three losses this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Jackrabbits (28-3) had four players in double figures: Reggie
Butler and Bobby Jones each had 15 points and Carlos Rivers and
Marcedes Lewis each added 12. Eisenhower (27-3) got a game-high 21
points from junior forward Sean Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Dermody</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Loyola 61, Thousand Oaks 58--It took a hanging, acrobatic
six-foot baseline shot by Omar Wilkes with 11 seconds left to give
Loyola (27-3) the Division I-A championship, its first title since
1953.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkes' basket was the eighth lead change of the fourth quarter.
He added two free throws with 5.2 seconds left and finished with 26
points.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the king of weird shots," the 6-foot-4 junior guard said.
"That was creativity. That was not planned."</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks (27-4) led by nine points in the second quarter and
held the lead until Wilkes went airborne for his game-winning shot.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably the best [shot] I've seen in my whole life," said
Loyola center Chris Rucker, who had 15 points,15 rebounds and four
blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   Kasey Myers scored 19 points for the Lancers. He missed on a
three-point attempt in the final second that would have tied the
score.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkes made 10 of 16 shots and was three of six from three-point
range. He scored 17 points in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "Once a player gets his groove, especially a shooter like
[Wilkes], then it doesn't matter who's on him," Thousand Oaks Coach
Richard Endres said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   La Puente Bishop Amat 47, Palm Desert 35--A 14-0 surge late in the
fourth quarter propelled the Lancers (25-6) to the Division III-AA
championship, their first in school history.</TE>
<TE>   For 28 minutes, Palm Desert (25-5) had followed its game plan to
perfection, slowing the tempo to neutralize Bishop Amat's quickness.</TE>
<TE>   After Josh Zazulia scored with 3:30 remaining, Palm Desert
trailed, 33-32. But the Aztecs didn't score again until there were 21
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Amat used its pressure man-to-man defense to create
fast-break opportunities. John Haywood's free throw with 29 seconds
remaining gave the Lancers a 47-32 lead. Haywood finished with 15
points and Paul Porter had 14.</TE>

<LD>Torrance Bishop Montgomery defeated Compton Centennial in a Southern
Section boys' basketball final for the third consecutive year,
upending the previously unbeaten Apaches, 57-55, in the Division
III-A championship game Saturday at the Arrowhead Pond.</LD>
<LD>   Trailing top-seeded Centennial, 42-32, with four minutes left in
the third quarter, Bishop Montgomery (24-6) went on a 16-5 run to
take a 48-47 advantage early in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Centennial reclaimed the lead with three consecutive baskets, but
Bishop Montgomery followed with four free throws over the next five
minutes to trail by one.</LD>
<TE>   After Centennial forward Darius Sanders' layup increased the lead
to 55-52, Howard Ryan tied the score with a three-point basket with
40 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   Fouled twice in the final 20 seconds, junior forward Jason Estrada
made two free throws to give the Knights a 57-55 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Centennial (28-1) had two chances to tie. Arron Affalo broke loose
for an apparent layin, but the ball circled the rim before falling
away, and Michael Gordon's short-range jumper was partially blocked
as time expired.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't have a lot of time to make a decision on the final
play," Bishop Montgomery Coach Doug Mitchell said. "And we didn't do
anything exotic either, just played good defense."</TE>
<TE>   Junior forward Fred Washington led Bishop Montgomery with 21
points and 10 rebounds but committed nine of the Knights' 20
turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders had 20 points and nine rebounds, Sterling Byrd had 13
points and Gabriel Pruitt finished with 12 for Centennial.</TE>

<HD>Victory for Los Alamitos</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a goal worthy of a boys' soccer game between the No. 3- and
No. 6-ranked teams in the nation. It came in the final seconds of the
first half and proved to be the difference in Los Alamitos' 1-0
victory over Irvine Woodbridge in the Southern Section Division II
championship game Saturday night at La Mirada High.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan Gay, a slightly built sophomore who played in only three
games at the varsity level during the regular season, hooked a
right-footed shot into the left corner of the goal from 30 yards out
to help top-seeded Los Alamitos (27-1-1) win its second section title
and first since winning the 2-A championship in 1992.</LD>
<LD>   "I saw it in the air and it dropped," said Gay, who entered the
game as a substitute with about 15 minutes left in the first half.
"Once it did that, I said, 'It's going in the goal.' That was the
happiest moment of my life."</LD>
<TE>   It was the third goal of the season for Gay, who did not play in
the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Woodbridge (25-3), the second-seeded team in the division and No.
6-ranked team in the nation by Student Sports magazine, appeared to
tie the score on a goal by Eric Ebert with about nine minutes left in
the second half, but it was disallowed because of the an offsides
call.</TE>
<TE>   Woodbridge, which had not been shut out this season until
Saturday, nearly scored in the final minute of play, but a shot by
Beckham Thomas was knocked away inches from the goal line by
goalkeeper Geremy Uhl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quartz Hill 0, Lawndale Leuzinger 0-- The scoreless tie gave both
teams a share of their first Division I title, but each side would
have preferred that the game at La Mirada be decided in overtime or
by penalty kicks instead of being called after two 40-minute halves.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably later it will feel better," said Kiel McClung of
second-seeded Quartz Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Leuzinger (17-4-2), which upset top-seeded Alta Loma, 1-0, in the
semifinals, had two great scoring opportunities in the first half,
but was unable to convert them.</TE>
<TE>   Quartz Hill (28-0-2), the No. 12-ranked team in the nation by
Student Sports magazine, controlled the pace of the game for most of
the second half but failed to score.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Placentia El Dorado 2, Santa Ana Mater Dei 1--The Golden Hawks
scored twice in the second half to win the program's first section
title in the Division III game at La Mirada.</TE>
<TE>   El Dorado (18-6-3), second to La Palma Kennedy in Empire League
play during the regular season, trailed, 1-0, at halftime. But the
Golden Hawks tied the score two minutes into the second half when
sophomore Vince Case scored off a crossing pass from Ryan Reott.</TE>
<TE>   El Dorado scored the game-winning goal 16 minutes later when
Brandon Taylor took a crossing pass from Greg Reese and beat Mater
Dei goalkeeper Nathan Pena with a left-footed shot into the left
corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei (22-3-5), which won the Division II title last year
after sharing it with Huntington Beach Edison in 2000, took a 1-0
lead late in the first half on a goal by sophomore Scott Corbin.</TE>
<TE>   John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Northwood 2, La Verne Bonita 1--Benny Feilhaber scored in
the 18th minute and Tim Tidwell in the 62nd as the unseeded
Timberwolves won the Division IV final at Gahr High, giving Northwood
its first Southern Section team championship in its third year of
existence and second of varsity competition.</TE>
<TE>   Travis Page scored for the top-seeded Bearcats (23-3-2) 21 seconds
after Tidwell's goal.</TE>
<TE>   Feilhaber scored off Garret McClelland's assist. Robert Garcia
began the scoring sequence on Tidwell's goal by sending a corner kick
to Gabe Schneider, who headed the ball to Tidwell's feet.</TE>
<TE>   The Timberwolves (17-4-5) led 19-11 in shots, with both teams
taking seven shots on goal. Bonita goalkeeper Billy Medlock made six
saves, while Northwood goalkeeper Mike Giese made five.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach 2, Fillmore 1--Sophomore forward Pablo Hernandez
scored off Ryan Wolfe's assist in the 63rd minute as the Artists won
the Division V final at Gahr High.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Lara headed in Fabian Elias' free kick in the 51st minute
for the Flashes (14-5-5), who were playing in their first Southern
Section final.</TE>
<TE>   Austen Ezzell headed in Scott Youngstead's throw-in for a
15th-minute goal for Laguna Beach (14-9-3). The Artists defeated
three league champions, including top-seeded Pasadena Poly, to reach
the final.</TE>

<HD>Westchester Lives Up to Expectations, 57-50</HD>
<DH>Boys' basketball: Top-seeded Comets beat Fairfax for the
third time this season to win the City Championship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pressure had been building for months, bulging and burgeoning
since the day Westchester High was selected the preseason No. 1 boys'
basketball team in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   The burden hasn't entirely been lifted, and the Comets feel they
still have a few more days of reckoning in the near future, but they
were able to smile Saturday at the Forum, winning their third
consecutive City Championship with a 57-50 victory over Fairfax.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody really expected any other teams to contend for the title
than these Western League rivals, who were playing each other for the
fourth time this season, with Westchester coming out on top for the
third time.</LD>
<TE>   It wasn't like the 32-point blowout Westchester scored at Fairfax
on Jan. 8, nor was it similar to the four-point victory secured by
Fairfax on Jan. 25. This game was somewhere in between, perhaps
closer to the two-point victory the Comets secured in an early-season
tournament game against Fairfax.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester started the second half with a 13-6 run to take a
37-26 lead and wasn't seriously threatened until the final minutes of
the game, when Fairfax closed to within 51-47 on two free throws by
Jahsha Bluntt with 1:45 to play.</TE>
<TE>   But Trevor Ariza made two free throws and Arizona-bound guard
Hassan Adams made a thunderous dunk off a steal with 13 seconds left
to put the game away.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working for this," said Adams, who finished with 10
points. "This is just the beginning. It's going to feel even better
when we win state."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams qualified for the state Division I playoffs, which
begin Wednesday. Westchester (28-2), currently ranked No. 5 in the
nation, is expected to be seeded No. 1 in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax (29-4), trying to win its first City title since 1987,
simply didn't have enough options on offense.</TE>
<TE>   Evan Burns, who has committed to UCLA, scored a game-high 20
points and Bluntt had 12, but no other Fairfax player scored more
than five.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions short-circuited in the final two minutes, getting called
for an offensive foul, missing the front end of a one-and-one and
missing a short jumper on a fast break.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a chance and a few opportunities," Fairfax Coach Harvey
Kitani said. "It all goes with the game."</TE>
<TE>   Not that Westchester was burning up the nets.</TE>
<TE>   The Comets were sluggish at first, taking a slim 24-20 halftime
lead. Adams scored only one point in the first half, missing all four
of his shots.</TE>
<TE>   But the Comets rallied in the third quarter, with Ashanti Cook
scoring seven of his 11 points to spark Westchester's run.</TE>
<TE>   "Ashanti has been so steady all season long," Westchester Coach Ed
Azzam said. "He showed so much composure [Saturday]."</TE>
<TE>   Adams pitched in with six fourth-quarter points, including the
dunk that allowed the Comets to check off the first of their two main
goals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the Invitational final:</TE>
<TE>   L.A. University 87, Reseda 77--Aaron Brown had 26 points and 19
rebounds and Ruben Boykin had 23 points and 18 rebounds to lead
University (20-11). Sergie Lepiashinski, a senior, had 30 points for
Reseda.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Another trophy for the Harbor City Narbonne girls' basketball team,
one of many collected the last few years and perhaps not the final
one this season.</LD>
<LD>   The latest piece of hardware, the City Championship trophy,
officially became the Gauchos' property after they defeated
Chatsworth, 64-39, Saturday at the Forum for their third consecutive
City title.</LD>
<LD>   The Gauchos started slowly but cranked up their defense early in
the second quarter, turning an 11-10 edge into a rout with a 14-0 run
fueled by several fast breaks.</LD>
<TE>   Narbonne (25-3), which beat its three previous playoff opponents
by a combined 230-110 score, was never threatened.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we adjusted to the surroundings and got our breathing
techniques under control, we put them away," said Connecticut-bound
forward Willnett Crockett, who scored nine points.</TE>
<TE>   The Gauchos have another goal to attain, their second consecutive
state Division I championship.</TE>
<TE>   Britney Hamilton and Summer Johnson each had nine points for
Chatsworth (22-8).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington 43, King-Drew 37--Johnisha Rice scored 11 points and

<LD>Lauren Moss scored the game-winning goal off a corner kick by
Giuliana Facio in the 51st minute to give Woodland Hills El Camino
Real its second consecutive City Section girls' soccer championship,
a 2-1 victory over San Pedro on Saturday at UCLA's Drake Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   El Camino Real took a 1-0 lead 10 minutes into the game when Moss
passed to Samantha Spencer, who fired a shot underneath San Pedro
junior goalkeeper Stephanie Shaw for her 19th goal of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Top-seeded San Pedro (22-4-2) tied it five minutes later when
Jennifer Ramos' shot was blocked by El Camino Real goalkeeper Miko
Penn and Terry Manqueros kicked in the rebound.</LD>
<TE>   San Pedro outshot El Camino Real, 13-7, but the Pirates' leading
scorer, Cailtin Ursini (18 goals), was held to one shot.</TE>
<TE>   The second-seeded Conquistadores (18-3-1) were playing without
sophomore Kandice McLaughlin, a 30-goal scorer, who was assessed two
yellow cards in the semifinals and had to sit out the final.</TE>
<TE>   In the girls' Invitational championship, Vanessa Jesperson scored
both goals for Los Angeles CES (15-1-3), which defeated Wilson, 2-0,
to become the first Magnet school to win a City title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the City Section boys' final:</TE>
<TE>   El Camino Real 2, Roosevelt 0--Jason Lara scored in the seventh
minute and added the clinching goal in the 65th minute as the
top-seeded Conquistadores (25-3-3) won their second consecutive title
and third in the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning back to back is a big accomplishment," said Lara, a
senior forward who finished the season with 30 goals.</TE>
<TE>   El Camino Real dominated play in the first half, outshooting
Roosevelt, 8-6, but the 15th-seeded Roughriders (17-6-3) had numerous
chances to tie the game on set plays early in the second half.
However, El Camino Real goalkeeper Raul Calderon made several diving
saves to keep his team ahead.</TE>
<TE>   After a shanked punt by Roosevelt goaltender Paulo Jiminez, Lara
gained possession at midfield and passed to Gianni Facio on the left
wing. Facio sent a high pass across the goal mouth, which Lara lofted
just under the crossbar with 15 minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the third-place game, South Gate beat Fremont, 5-4, on penalty
kicks. The game was tied, 1-1, after regulation.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Tries to Tap Powerful Potential</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Dodger outfielder Brian Jordan has a .287 career batting average in
10 big league seasons, and he averaged 22 home runs and 95 runs
batted in for the last four years. Imagine what kind of numbers he
could have posted had he understood some of the finer intricacies of
hitting.</LD>
<LD>   "I never learned how to hit the right way," said Jordan, who was
acquired with pitcher Odalis Perez from the Atlanta Braves for Gary
Sheffield in January. "I just used raw talent. I never really used my
legs. I couldn't tell the difference between a sinker and a cut
fastball. To me, the ball comes in, I hit it. I'm a football player
playing baseball. That's why I feel I haven't reached my full
potential."</LD>
<LD>   Jordan, a former two-sport star at the University of Richmond,
spent three seasons (1989-91) as an NFL defensive back for the
Atlanta Falcons, a commitment that limited him to 406 minor league
at-bats in his first four professional baseball seasons (1988-91).
Most minor league regulars get more than 500 at-bats in one season.</LD>
<TE>   By the time Jordan gave up football to concentrate on baseball in
1992, he was playing outfield for the St. Louis Cardinals, the
beginning of a big league career that included seven years in St.
Louis and three in Atlanta. But when Jordan took batting practice in
Dodgertown for the first time, Manager Jim Tracy and hitting coach
Jack Clark immediately noticed flaws in his swing.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, I'm Jack's project," Jordan, 35, said. "I hit 25 home runs
last year just using my upper body, so now Jack is teaching me how to
incorporate my legs in my swing. I can see the difference already.
When I use my legs, I can see how the ball takes off. There's going
to be a big difference once it becomes natural."</TE>
<TE>   Some veterans with 10 years of big-league experience might not be
as open to new ideas or change, but Clark has been impressed with
Jordan's willingness to learn. Jordan is usually in the cages by 7:30
a.m., taking 30-45 minutes of extra batting practice a day.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like a young kid, a sponge, he's just absorbing it little by
little," Clark said. "As we take this a little further, he'll get
more aggressive. I had to see him for a number of days before I
jumped in, and you have to make sure a guy is open to it, but he was.
We're just trying to tweak a few things to pull his athleticism out
of there."</TE>
<TE>   More specifically, the Dodgers want to pull more strength out of
Jordan's legs. Jordan is chiseled at 6-foot-1 and 205 pounds, but if
he incorporated more of that body into his swing, he would probably
hit for more power.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want this to sound like a negative, but I think he can
use his lower body better than he has in the past," Tracy said.
"There are some adjustments he can make to make the process work, and
if he does, those are awfully strong legs that can make a difference
for him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers committed five errors, including two wild throws by
third baseman Hiram Bocachica in the fifth inning and a dropped fly
ball in the fourth by Marquis Grissom, in an ugly 10-6 exhibition
loss Saturday to the Baltimore Orioles at Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Hiatt and Mike Kinkade homered for the Dodgers, who had 16
hits. Shawn Green, who has been unable to play right field because of
a sore throwing shoulder, struck out twice in four at-bats as a
designated hitter but impressed Tracy with his hustle by turning a
seventh-inning hit up the middle into a double.</TE>
<TE>   "He sent a good message to the team," Tracy said. "He understands
what kind of players we need around here to take the next step from
where we were a year ago."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A member of the Japanese media in town to cover the Dodgers was
killed in an automobile accident early Saturday morning. According to
the Vero Beach Police Dept., Masaaki Ono, a 27-year-old audio
operator for the Los Angeles-based Fuji Television Network, died when
he failed to yield at a Vero Beach intersection and was struck on the
passenger side by a 1993 Volvo driven by 19-year-old Richard Connelly
of Concorde, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Ono's 2002 Chevy van overturned, and he was pronounced dead at the
scene. Connelly and two passengers were treated and released at the
scene. The investigation continues, and no charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A precautionary MRI on Mark Grudzielanek's sore right hamstring
showed no major abnormalities, but the second baseman, who was slowed
by the same hamstring for much of last season, will be held out of
exhibition games until the Dodgers are confident he will not run the
risk of serious damage. Grudzielanek is taking batting practice and
participating in drills that don't require him to run at full
speed.... The Dodgers agreed to terms with pitchers Matt Herges
($370,000), Eric Gagne ($300,000), Giovanni Carrara and outfielder
McKay Christensen ($230,000) on one-year contracts.</TE>

<LD>A gold medal isn't the only thing Mighty Duck captain Paul Kariya
brought back from the Olympics. A few ideas to improve the quality of
games in the NHL came with him.</LD>
<LD>   Kariya would like to see the NHL adopt some of the international
rules that were used during the Olympics, including the elimination
of the red line and enforcing a five-second rule on faceoffs.</LD>
<LD>   "I would love to see the no red line, some way of opening up our
neutral zone," Kariya said. "There is so much more room there [in the
Olympics] to operate and create offense. The speed of the game is
something everyone enjoyed there. The games lasted less than two
hours sometimes."</LD>
<TE>   Kariya, citing the drop in goals around the league, has long been
a proponent of moving the goal lines back. "You create offense where
there's room," he said.</TE>

<HD>Pluimer Paces San Clemente</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Southern Section Division I-A championship gamed served as a
coronation for San Clemente sophomore Lindsey Pluimer on Saturday,
giving the 6-foot-3 center two section titles in two seasons.</LD>
<LD>   The victory also reaffirmed that unheralded senior Kim Buffum as
one of the section's top clutch players.</LD>
<LD>   Pluimer scored 26 points and Buffum finished with 15--nine in the
fourth quarter--as the top-seeded Tritons defeated third-seeded
Newhall Hart, 67-60, at the Pyramid in Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Hart (25-5) had no answer for Pluimer's inside game, and when the
Indians pulled to within 45-42 in the opening minute of the fourth
quarter, Hart had no answer for Buffum. She started and ended a 10-1
run with three-point baskets to provide a 55-43 lead for San Clemente
(27-3).</TE>
<TE>   Buffum's 15 points, all on three-point baskets, and the Tritons'
12-point lead were too much for Hart to overcome, getting no closer
than 65-60 in the final minute.</TE>
<TE>   Pluimer, 12 of 16 from the field, had 14 rebounds and five
assists. Buffum had four assists, and junior Sara Brown had 15
points. Seniors Brandi Kimble and Amy Malbon each scored 18 for Hart,
and freshman Ashlee Trebilcock had 14.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lakewood Artesia 55, Apple Valley 37--Artesia won its second title
in a row, winning the Division III-AA championship at the Pyramid
behind a balanced effort and a couple of big runs.</TE>
<TE>   The top-seeded Pioneers (24-5) trailed in the first quarter, 8-4,
when they went on a 16-2 run in which Brittany Imaku scored seven of
her 13 points and Lindsay Thomas scored five of her 15. It helped
Artesia take a 29-24 lead at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Pioneers seized command of the game with a 9-1 run to start
the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "We were quicker, and we were able to penetrate the middle and
pull up for short jumpers," Artesia Coach Scott Roczey said. "We're
playing as one, as a unit."</TE>
<TE>   Brittney Thomas added 14 for Artesia, which played most of the
first half without 6-foot-2 junior Cacie Pope, putting the Pioneers
at a severe height disadvantage. They had no other starter taller
than 5-7, and Apple Valley had only one shorter than 5-9.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Apple Valley (24-5), playing in its first championship game,
was its own worst enemy, committing 20 turnovers, and Katie McElree
was the only Sun Devil in double figures with 16 points. Allison
Martin scored nine, and Stephanie Phenecie had eight with 12
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Montebello Cantwell-Sacred Heart 77, Montclair Prep 66--The
unseeded Cardinals (23-5) made their first trip to a title game
notable and won the school's first championship since 1947.</TE>
<TE>   To win the Division IV-A title at the Pyramid, Cantwell-Sacred
Heart not only beat the third-seeded Mounties (20-6), but previously
defeated teams ranked Nos. 1, 4, 8 and 10 in its division by the
Southern Section.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals led at halftime, 33-31, and were tied at 33-33
before they scored nine in a row as part of a 17-5 run. Critical to
the run was the shooting of sophomore Kathy Suria, who had made only
one of eight shots in the first half. She finished with 17 points and
made three of her five three-point baskets in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Maritza Villalta scored 31 and had five assists and
three steals, and sophomore Jackie Vizcaino made eight of nine from
the field and scored 19.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Eshaya Murphy had 41 points and 22 rebounds for Montclair
Prep.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Playa del Rey St. Bernard 41, Santa Fe Springs St. Paul 30--The
top-seeded Vikings won their third consecutive section title and
seventh in 11 seasons, but this Division IV-AA championship at the
Pyramid might have been costly.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia-bound guard Alexis Kendrick left the game late in the
third quarter with what was believed to be a concussion, and her
status for the state playoffs is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Kendrick led St. Bernard (21-7) with 10 points in the
lowest-scoring girls' final since 1996. Sloppy throughout, the Del
Rey League rivals combined for 49 turnovers. Each team made only 11
of 46 shots (23.9%) from the field. St. Bernard made 20 of 38 free
throws (52.6%), while St. Paul was nine for 20 (45%) from the line.</TE>
<TE>   St. Paul (24-8), which had lost in the semifinals the four
previous seasons, set a school record for victories and reached its
first section final, only to lose its 36th consecutive game to its
longtime nemesis.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rolling Hills Prep 58, Granada Hills Hillcrest Christian 46--A
23-9 run in the second quarter at the Pyramid was the difference for
top-seeded Rolling Hills Prep (22-6), which avenged a 68-64 nonleague
loss to Hillcrest Christian on Jan. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State-bound guard Charmaine Jones had 25 points, seven
rebounds and five steals for Rolling Hills, which claimed its first
girls' championship in any sport. The Huskies lost to Pilgrim last
season in the Division V-A final.</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded Hillcrest Christian (16-10), making its first
appearance in a final, committed 28 turnovers. Freshman Kayla
Rutherford made three three-pointers and finished with 16 points.</TE>

<HD>O'Brien's 33 Help Ventura Conquer Troy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE DESMOND</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Katy O'Brien has rarely enjoyed the spotlight. She normally yields to
others, content to bask in the glow of being the point guard of a
winning team.</LD>
<LD>   She got both Saturday night in Ventura High's surprisingly easy
61-43 rout of top-seeded Fullerton Troy in the Southern Section
Division II-AA girls' basketball championship game at the Pyramid in
Long Beach.</LD>
<LD>   With top scorer Jenni Dooley in foul trouble, O'Brien took it upon
herself to score. Once she found a groove, she didn't let up and
finished with a career-high 33 points.</LD>
<TE>   "This is definitely a high point in my career," said the 5-foot-6
O'Brien, who made four three-point baskets and had five assists and
three steals.</TE>
<TE>   With no starter taller than 5-9 and making its first final
appearance since 1993, second-seeded Ventura (28-2) was an unlikely
conqueror of Troy (27-3), the defending Division I-A champion.</TE>
<TE>   But the Cougars did what they do best--shoot long-range jumpers
and wreak havoc on defense. They forced 19 turnovers, including three
during a quick spurt in the third quarter when they turned a 29-29
tie into a 39-29 lead.</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien played a key role there, too, scoring eight during the
10-0 run. The Cougars, who won their first title since 1976, made six
three-pointers to give them a section-record 264.</TE>
<TE>   Dooley finished with 10 points and Meggie Wagner added nine for
Ventura, which took 51 shots to Troy's 44.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Livingston, on crutches Friday because of a sprained ankle,
had 17 points and 14 rebounds for Troy. Pepperdine-bound guard Alicia
Komaki added 13 points. But the Warriors had no answer for O'Brien,
who in four seasons has guided her team to a 97-15 record.</TE>
<TE>   "She's tough and so underappreciated for what she does," Coach An
Larson said of O'Brien. "She wins games--just look at tonight."</TE>

<LD>Patricia Gialamas held her arms high in celebration after scoring the
second goal for the San Clemente girls' soccer team.</LD>
<LD>   And about all Capistrano Valley's players could do was throw their
arms up in despair after losing to the Tritons for the third time
this season, 2-1, in the Southern Section Division I championship
game Saturday at La Mirada High.</LD>
<LD>   Gialamas' goal, which came on a rebound after Capistrano Valley
goalkeeper Staci Sinkway punched away a throw-in by Makenzie Beahm in
the 60th minute, would give the Tritons (21-3-3) their first title.</LD>
<TE>   Capistrano Valley (17-4-2) trailed, 2-0, after Gialamas' goal and
a comeback came up short, though the Cougars outshot San Clemente,
11-3, in the second half and 14-5 in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was bombarded with balls," San Clemente goalkeeper Aly Berger
said. "The sun was really bad. Every time the ball was up, I couldn't
see it at all and had to wait for it to bounce or something."</TE>
<TE>   The ball bounced San Clemente's way often enough. Blake Zerboni's
sixth goal of the season also followed a throw-in by Beahm in the
17th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Sapp scored Capistrano Valley's goal in the 73rd minute on
a rebound off the right goal post after a throw-in by Jen Horn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita 2, Santa Ana Mater Dei 0--Santa Margarita and
Mater Dei had tied twice during Serra League play, but the Eagles
scored two second-half goals to win the Division III title at La
Mirada.</TE>
<TE>   The championship was the second in a row and third in four seasons
in Division III for the Eagles (19-1-4). Santa Margarita also won
Division II titles in 1997 and '98.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita freshman forward Amy Rodriguez scored her 10th
goal of the season in the 56th minute with an assist from Stephanie
De Almeida.</TE>
<TE>   Junior midfielder Brittany Perkowski scored in the 74th minute off
an assist from Shannon Foley.</TE>
<TE>   The scores came once Santa Margarita began to dominate possession
of the ball after an even first half in which each team took six
shots. Mater Dei (17-5-6) was outshot, 12-8.</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach Edison 4, Crescenta Valley 1--Jane Wyche scored
twice to lead the Chargers to the Division II title at Cerritos Gahr
High. Wyche scored off a rebound following a free kick in the 17th
minute, then gave the top-seeded Chargers a 2-0 lead when she lofted
a shot off the crossbar in the 55th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Crescenta Valley (21-7-3) scored on Jordan Stanley's penalty kick
four minutes later, but Edison reclaimed a two-goal lead when Sascha
Contreras bounced a shot off the post in the 58th minute. Contreras,
who had another goal nullified on a penalty, was involved in the
final goal when her pass bounced off a Crescenta Valley defender and
into the net in the closing minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake 1, LaVerne Bonita
1--Harvard-Westlake won its second consecutive Division IV title and
Bonita its first with the draw at Gahr High.</TE>
<TE>   After a scoreless first half, top-seeded Harvard-Westlake (23-1-2)
took a 1-0 lead in the 45th minute, when Kim LaVere sent her corner
kick into the middle of the box, where UCLA-bound forward Kim Oakes
headed the ball off a defender and into the net.</TE>
<TE>   About two minutes later, Lauren Vosburg tied the score for
second-seeded Bonita (31-1-2) when LaVere and Harvard-Westlake
goalkeeper Marcela Benitez hesitated before pursuing a slow-rolling
soft shot into the box. Vosburg beat Benitez to the ball, lifting it
over her outstretched body.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena La Salle 2, Pasadena Poly 2-- Molly Easterlin knocked in
Molly Quinn's cross in the 66th minute as top-seeded Pasadena Poly
rallied for a tie and a co-championship after allowing two goals in a
71-second span in the Division V final at Gahr.</TE>
<TE>   Erika Miller and Cassie Dombrowski scored in the 54th and 56th
minutes for unseeded La Salle (20-3-4), which won its first girls'
soccer title. Stanford-bound Lindsey Hunt scored off Easterlin's
assist in the 38th minute for the defending-champion Panthers
(22-1-4).</TE>

<HD>Trainer Van Berg Faces Suspension</HD>

<LD>Jack Van Berg, a Hall of Fame trainer who has won more than 6,300
races, including the 1987 Kentucky Derby with Alysheba, was notified
Saturday by the Santa Anita stewards that his license will be
suspended on March 12 because of financial problems.</LD>
<LD>   Ingrid Fermin, one of the stewards, said that Van Berg owes a
veterinarian "quite a bit of money." Fermin wouldn't specify the
amount, but said that it was in the five-figure range.</LD>
<LD>   Van Berg, 65, was given a hearing by the stewards last summer at
Del Mar over the same debt and at one point was ordered to make a
$34,000 partial payment before he could be reinstated. Saturday's
ruling said that Van Berg would be "denied access to all premises"
during the suspension.</LD>
<TE>   Van Berg declined comment about the suspension. His son Tim
saddled two horses that ran Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Van Berg was voted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 1985, 15 years
after his father, Marion, was enshrined. Operating in the Midwest
with a huge stable, Van Berg won 496 races in 1976, still a record.
Alysheba, who won the Preakness and then missed the Triple Crown
sweep when he finished fourth in the Belmont Stakes, came back in
1988 to win the Breeders' Cup Classic and was voted horse of the
year. Van Berg won his first Preakness with Gate Dancer in 1984.
Alysheba earned $6.6 million, once the North American record, but now
he ranks sixth on the money list.</TE>
<TE>   Van Berg won 22 races with 226 starters last year. This season at
Santa Anita he has won four races.</TE>

<HD>Tippett's Career Getting a Boost</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>He played on an NCAA championship team at North Dakota, scored 262
points in 11 seasons in the NHL and was a two-time Olympian, serving
as captain of the Canadian team at Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, in 1984 and
winning a silver medal at Albertville, France, eight years later.</LD>
<LD>   As coach and general manager, he led the Houston Aeros of the
International Hockey League to the 1999 Turner Cup championship. And
as an assistant coach, he helped the Kings reach the playoffs the
last two seasons.</LD>
<LD>   But something was always missing whenever Dave Tippett talked to
NHL teams, most recently the Mighty Ducks last summer, about their
coaching vacancies: He had no experience calling the shots as a head
coach in the NHL.</LD>
<TE>   That's why his current stint as interim coach of the Kings,
filling in while Andy Murray recuperates from last month's auto
accident, could turn out to be a career-altering opportunity for the
40-year-old Tippett.</TE>
<TE>   "Is the experience good for me down the road? Yeah," Tippett said.
"But not having this experience, I still think I would be capable of
doing the job."</TE>
<TE>   King General Manager Dave Taylor does too.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a very high opinion of Dave Tippett," Taylor said, "and
I've said a number of times that it's only a matter of time before
he's a head coach in the NHL."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ken Belanger, who had been sidelined since Jan. 2 because of a
broken left thumb, returned to the lineup Saturday and played 2
minutes 18 seconds, long enough to get into a second-period fight
with Jody Shelley. A roster spot opened for Belanger when rookie Ryan
Flinn was reassigned to the Kings' American Hockey team at
Manchester, N.H.... Rookie Andreas Lilja, loaned to the Manchester
Monarchs for games Friday and Saturday, is scheduled to rejoin the
Kings today.</TE>

<HD>Mater Dei Puts on Final Touch</HD>
<DH>Boys' basketball: Monarchs defeat Pasadena, 65-49, for
Division II-AA title and 20th win in a row.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a team that was 7-4 at Christmas and falling off the radar
screens of boys' basketball gurus everywhere, Santa Ana Mater Dei
High sure has found a way to put itself back on track to national
prominence.</LD>
<LD>   The top-seeded Monarchs routed second-seeded Pasadena, 65-49,
Saturday night at the Arrowhead Pond in the Southern Section Division
II-AA title game to win their 20th consecutive game and fourth
straight section championship.</LD>
<LD>   That's 10 section titles in 11 seasons, for those counting at
home.</LD>
<TE>   It didn't look as if Mater Dei would be adding any championship
hardware to its collection earlier this season, after the Monarchs
dropped three consecutive games for the first time in Coach Gary
McKnight's 20-year tenure.</TE>
<TE>   But Mater Dei responded with poise and determination, going
undefeated in an unusually tough Serra League and defeating Mouth of
Wilson (Va.) Oak Hill Academy, then the No. 1 team in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Mater Dei (27-4) continued its strong play Saturday against
cold-shooting Pasadena, clamping down on usually productive guards
Dino Wilburn and Duwan Rice.</TE>
<TE>   The Monarchs held Rice to eight points on three-of-14 shooting.
Wilburn finished with 22 points, 15 coming in the fourth quarter with
the game firmly in Mater Dei's grasp.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs (26-5) shot 21.4% from the field in the first half
and scored only six points in each of the second and third quarters
as Mater Dei took a 39-23 lead going into the fourth. Pasadena made
only five of 17 three-pointers and 10 of 28 free throws for the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't make our shots because of depth perception," Pasadena
Coach Tim Tucker said. "[We] have never played in this kind of arena
before. I don't think we made two free throws in a row. When we
finally figured it out, the game was over."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Mater Dei shot 52.5% from the field. But with the
exception of freshman point guard Mike Gerrity (eight assists, two
turnovers), the Monarchs had trouble handling the ball, committing 18
turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Wesley Washington had 20 points and 11 rebounds, and Mike
Strawberry had 18 points for the Monarchs.</TE>

<LD>   Lindros scored three goals against his former team, and the New
York Rangers turned in a rare physical performance, holding on for a
6-5 victory over the Flyers on Saturday at Madison Square Garden.</LD>
<LD>   "We got into the physical game, taking the body and digging for
pucks," Lindros said. "We've got to play like that more often, then
we'll be in good shape."</LD>

and pushing. The Flyers also made it a nail-biter, scoring three
times in the third period.</TE>

bring the Flyers within 6-5. But the Rangers held on to take the lead
in the season series, 2-1, with two games to go.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne admitted the Flyers felt out of sorts.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot of frustration. There were a lot of penalties,"
he said. "It's a game we have to expect against the Rangers, but it's
not the way we want to play."</TE>

<LD>The final score was 7-2, it took place on his 19th birthday and on a
day when his wrestling team set a state record with 226.5 team
points, but the only number that mattered to Darrell Vasquez was
four.</LD>
<LD>   Vasquez, a Bakersfield High senior, made history in the state
wrestling championships Saturday night at University of the Pacific,
defeating Jason Williams of Clovis in the 125-pound final for his
fourth consecutive state title.</LD>
<LD>   Vasquez is the first wrestler in the 30-year history of the state
championships to win four state titles.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm stoked," Vasquez said after dropping to his knees in prayer
near the locker room following his victory. "I've been dreaming of
this since I was 11-years-old. It's a weird feeling, it kind of
hasn't sunk in yet."</TE>
<TE>   Vasquez, who won at 103 pounds in 1999, 112 in 2000 and 119 last
year, said he knew he came in this year as a marked man.</TE>
<TE>   Williams nearly put Vasquez on his back early in the match, but
Vasquez quickly reversed and maintained control of the match from
that point on. As time wound down, the sell-out crowd of 7,120 at the
Spanos Center rose to its feet chanting "Dar-rell, Dar-rell" and gave
him a minute-long standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lot of hard work," Vasquez said. "A lot of training, a
lot of cutting back. I haven't been able to have those big hamburgers
at lunch. For four years it's been peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches. I had to give up a lot the last four years, but this was
the goal."</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield had 10 wrestlers qualify for the state meet and seven
advanced to their weight-class finals.</TE>
<TE>   The Drillers, who had four individual champions and squashed the
previous state record of 170 points set last year by Santa Ana
Calvary Chapel, scored a state-record 207.5 points before the finals
started.</TE>
<TE>   To put that in perspective, consider that all of the Southern
Section schools combined had 112 wrestlers entered, got seven
wrestlers to the finals and had four champions. Calvary Chapel, which
had won state titles the last two years, led Southland schools with
62.5 points for a fifth-place finish.</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield finished 125 points ahead of second-place Clovis
Buchanan. In the last 30 years only three teams have scored 125
points or more. Arroyo Grande was sixth with 60 points and Villa Park
was 10th with 46.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Wong of Santa Fe won the 103-pound title, Ricky Turk of Lake
Arrowhead Rim of the World won at 135, Danny Cadwallader won at 140
and Joe Williams won at 171 for Santa Ana Calvary, and Arturo Basulto
of Arroyo Grande was heavyweight champion.</TE>
<TE>   Turk, who rolled through the Southern Section Masters meet last
week, did more of the same at the state meet. He had impressive pins
in 45, 21 and 22 seconds en route to the final, which he won, 17-13,
over David Roberts of Clovis West.</TE>
<TE>   Cadwallader, somewhat of a surprise winner at Masters, reaffirmed
his place atop the 140-pound class with a 4-2 victory over Kirk
Fitzpatrick of Union City James Logan.</TE>

<HD>Mathis, McBride Are Powerful Pair</HD>
<DH>Soccer: They lead U.S. to 4-0 win over Honduras and make
argument they should be World Cup starting forwards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The United States scored a laughably easy 4-0 soccer victory over
Honduras in Seattle on Saturday in a game in which Clint Mathis and
Brian McBride made a powerful claim to being the starting forwards in
this summer's World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Mathis scored twice and might have had a third goal if his 20-yard
free kick in the second half had not banged first off the crossbar
and then off the right post.</LD>
<LD>   McBride didn't add to his 18-goal tally for the U.S., but he did
play a significant role in creating three of the four goals, the
other two coming from an increasingly confident and daring Landon
Donovan.</LD>
<TE>   With only seven more games to play before the team leaves for
South Korea, where it plays Portugal, South Korea and Poland in the
first round of the May 31-June 30 world championship, the U.S.
starting lineup is beginning to take shape.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the return of Mathis and McBride after lengthy injury
layoffs and their obvious comfort at playing together  have put to
rest any doubts about who the two U.S. front-runners should be.</TE>
<TE>   The pair worked so well together and were so well supported by
midfielders Donovan, DaMarcus Beasley and Chris Armas that the U.S.
might have scored six or seven goals had it taken advantage of all
the chances that were created against an admittedly second-rate
Honduran team.</TE>
<TE>   Honduras Coach Ernesto Luzardo elected to start only two of the
players who had beaten the U.S., 3-2, in a World Cup qualifier in
Washington, D.C., on Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he gave the next generation of national team players a
chance to show what they could do.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't much.</TE>
<TE>   Honduras' only scoring chance, in fact, came when Saul Martinez
managed to get behind the U.S. defense in the 28th minute, but
goalkeeper Kasey Keller came alertly off his line to smother
Martinez's shot.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans had taken the lead in the 14th minute when defender
Jeff Agoos floated a long diagonal ball to the far post, where
McBride headed it back across the face of the net to Mathis, whose
downward header  sneaked inside the left post beyond the reach of
Honduran goalkeeper Victor Coello.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. scored again a couple of minutes before halftime when
Armas made a surging run up the middle before threading a perfect
pass for Donovan to run onto, lure Coello out of his net and then
slide the ball past him from a sharp angle.</TE>
<TE>   The second half was largely one-way traffic, to the delight of the
38,534 fans at Safeco Field, as the U.S. continued to run at its
overmatched opponent.</TE>
<TE>   An interchange between Beasley and second-half substitute Eddie
Lewis in the 59th minute resulted in Lewis crossing a ball that
McBride dived low to head, deflecting it into Mathis' path. The
former Galaxy forward stabbed it home to make it 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Five minutes later, Mathis hit the woodwork with his free kick,
but Donovan soon made up for the miss with an excellent goal in the
67th minute.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a pass from McBride, the teenager from Redlands--he turns
20 on Monday--accelerated past two defenders, kept close control of
the ball at high speed and beat Coello with a cool finish.</TE>
<TE>   Like Mathis and McBride, Donovan has inked his name on the 2002
World Cup roster.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has two more games this month: against Ecuador in
Birmingham, Ala., next Sunday and against three-time world champion
Germany in Rostock, Germany, on March 27.</TE>

<HD>This Translates Into Some Great Coverage</HD>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Soccer's agreement with Telemundo that allows the
Spanish-language network to broadcast 10 national team games a year
for the next five years is great news for American fans disheartened
by the amateur coverage all too often provided by ABC, ESPN and
ESPN2.</LD>
<LD>   A viewer does not have to understand a word of Spanish to
recognize that games on Telemundo are better announced, better
photographed, better directed and better produced.</LD>
<LD>   One reason is that Telemundo understands the sport and allows its
announcers, Andres Cantor and Norberto Longo, freedom to praise or
criticize as they see fit. Their criticism, sometimes biting, is what
gives the broadcasts their veracity. Thankfully, they leave the
cheerleading to lesser talents.</LD>
<TE>   "We take a more traditional approach to our coverage," said Jorge
Hidalgo, Telemundo's vice president for sports. "We stay with the
emotion on the field rather than the emotion off the field."</TE>
<TE>   Whenever U.S. games are shown on English-language channels, there
is a dumb-down factor. For some reason, the announcers, most of them
incomparably dull, feel compelled to sell the sport half the time and
explain it the other half.</TE>
<TE>   Producers or directors who couldn't tell Clint Mathis from Johnny
Mathis are the ones at fault. They demand that the announcers
simplify things. As a result, you can hear sets being clicked off all
across America.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the Major League Soccer highlights show, "MLS
ExtraTime," was such a pleasant change on ESPN2 the last couple of
seasons. Rob Stone, Alexi Lalas when he was part of it, and Dave Dir
were opinionated, occasionally funny and always interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, the show will not return this season, having fallen victim
to the widespread cost-cutting at MLS.</TE>
<TE>   With any luck, the league will revive it when times improve.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   McKinney's Mistake</TE>
<TE>   It's too bad that the city of McKinney, Texas, has rejected the
22,000-seat stadium that the City Council earlier had voted
unanimously to build for the Dallas Burn.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said it made more sense from a financial standpoint to
build soccer fields for youngsters than a stadium for professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Lamar Hunt, owner of the Kansas City Wizards and Columbus Crew,
had been spearheading the project for MLS and said he was "shocked at
the inexplicable negative turn of events."</TE>
<TE>   Once McKinney sees the money that rolls into the Anschutz
Entertainment Group's coffers from the new stadium in Carson and
realizes that the city treasury could have been similarly
replenished, it will be city officials who are shocked.</TE>
<TE>   By then, it will be too late. McKinney had its chance and blew it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy Road</TE>
<TE>   Because their 27,000-seat stadium won't be ready in time, the
Galaxy probably will start the 2003 MLS season with two months of
road games.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by the way the team performed in Chile the last two weeks,
that might not be such a bad thing. The Galaxy went 4-0-1 and
outscored its Chilean opposition, 11-3.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Sigi Schmid returned to California pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a very successful trip," he said. "We're very happy
with our goal production and [with] Carlos Ruiz and Chris Albright's
integration into the team. Also, our defending has been very good."</TE>
<TE>   The combination of American forward Albright and Guatemalan
striker Ruiz up front seems to be working well. In five games in
Santiago, Ruiz scored four goals and Albright three.</TE>
<TE>   Local fans will have their first chance to see the pair when the
Galaxy plays Cruz Azul of Mexico at Cal State Fullerton's Titan
Stadium on March 12.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WUSA Comes to Town</TE>
<TE>   Chances are good that when the new stadium in Carson is complete,
it won't be long before there is a Women's United Soccer Assn. team
playing there.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, WUSA will test the local waters on March 17,
when the defending-champion San Jose CyberRays play the San Diego
Spirit at Cal State Fullerton's Titan Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Spirit features world and Olympic champions Julie Foudy of
Mission Viejo and Joy Fawcett of Rancho Santa Margarita, two players
who could well be lured home if L.A. gets a WUSA team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Test of Time</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Kristine Lilly, who stretched her world record for
international games to 233 when she played in the U.S. team's 1-1 tie
with Sweden on Friday, is with Fawcett and Foudy, playing in the
Algarve Cup in Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been over 10 years since Julie and I have roomed together
on a national team trip," she said from Albufeira, "and after
spending six days with her here, I can go another 10."</TE>
<TE>   Lilly, 30, made her U.S. debut at 16 in 1987. Foudy's national
team debut came a year later. "We've been on this team almost as long
as Heather O'Reilly has been alive," Lilly said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Reilly, who made her U.S. debut in the Sweden game, is a
17-year-old junior from East Brunswick High in New Jersey. The
youngest player on the Algarve Cup roster, she had a pivotal role to
fill.</TE>
<TE>   She was called in at the last minute to replace the for injured
Mia Hamm, the world's all-time goal scoring leader.</TE>
<TE>   No pressure there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Horns of a Dilemma</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to snappy comebacks, the line delivered by Juventus
midfielder Enzo Maresca is a classic.</TE>
<TE>   Maresca sparked a furious squabble in Turin when, after scoring an
89th-minute goal to give Juventus a 2-2 tie with cross-town rival
Torino last Sunday, he copied the goal celebration of Torino's Marco
Ferrante by holding his forefingers to his head in imitation of a
bull's horns.</TE>
<TE>   Infuriated Torino players believed he was making fun of Ferrante
and of their team's logo. But Maresca, resplendent in the famous
black and white vertical stripes of Juventus, had an excuse ready.</TE>
<TE>   "I did the horns," he said, "because I didn't know how to do the
zebra."</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes.</TE>

<HD>Dickau Gives Gonzaga a Wake-Up Call, 82-64</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Whatever it was--the noon starting time, an inspired opponent or the
Sports Illustrated jinx--Dan Dickau wasn't going allow things to get
any worse for Gonzaga.</LD>
<LD>   Not after watching Loyola Marymount pull within six points of the
No. 7-ranked Bulldogs midway through the second half.</LD>
<LD>   "We got fed up," Dickau said. "We just said, 'All right, let's
stop that, let's turn it around and play the way we have all year.'"</LD>
<TE>   The senior guard promptly ignited a closing run that squelched the
threat and carried second-seeded Gonzaga to an 82-64 victory in the
first round of the West Coast Conference tournament Saturday at Jenny
Craig Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Dickau, the WCC's player of the year, scored 15 of his 17 points
in the second half, when seventh-seeded Loyola narrowed a 14-point
halftime deficit to 52-46 with 10 minutes to play after consecutive
baskets by freshman forward Andy Osborn.</TE>
<TE>   "When we came within six points, you could tell that [Dickau] was
going to try to take the game over," Loyola Coach Steve Aggers said.
"He did what All-American players do."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Lions (9-20) could walk away with their heads high,
despite ending the season with their 12th consecutive defeat. They
made Gonzaga sweat for a lot longer than anyone could have expected.</TE>
<TE>   "Gonzaga obviously is a great team [but] I felt our team gave them
all they wanted," Aggers said. "Our players played with great heart."</TE>
<TE>   By extending its winning streak to 12 games, Gonzaga (27-3)
advanced to the semifinals at 6:30 tonight against fifth-seeded San
Diego (16-12). The Bulldogs are seeking an unprecedented fourth
consecutive WCC tournament title. They have beaten Loyola 15
consecutive times, a streak dating to the 1996-97 season.</TE>
<TE>   Dickau, the subject of a Sport Illustrated story this week, might
have been thinking about the magazine's so-called jinx after being
limited to two points and no field goals in the first half while
being closely guarded by Eurskine Robinson.</TE>
<TE>   But behind center Cory Violette and forwards Zach Gourde and Alex
Hernandez, Gonzaga had success scoring inside and led at halftime,
37-23.</TE>
<TE>   "The beauty of having [Dickau] is that he goes with the flow for a
while, then he figures out what to do and gets it going," Bulldog
Coach Mark Few said.</TE>
<TE>   "Loyola played us physical and took us out of some things
[offensively]. They made us adjust, but our guys hung in there.... We
take whatever you give us."</TE>
<TE>   When Loyola made its move in the second half, Dickau responded by
driving the lane for a basket. Reserve guard Kyle Bankhead followed
with a three-point basket, Dickau matched his teammate with another
three-point basket and Gonzaga was on its way to a 24-9 run that
built the lead to 76-55 with 1:41 left.</TE>
<TE>   "[Loyola] hit some shots and we didn't play good defense for a few
minutes," Dickau said, explaining the Bulldogs' second-half lapse.</TE>
<TE>   Center Greg Lakey, playing well against Gonzaga's imposing front
line, led Loyola with 18 points and eight rebounds. Guard Kent Dennis
had 10 points. The Lions shot only 37.9% (22 of 58) from the field
and didn't get their first basket from outside the lane until Dennis
made a three-point shot after 11:41 had elapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Violette and Gourde each scored 16 points, and Violette had 10
rebounds to help Gonzaga to a 42-32 rebounding edge. Hernandez and
Bankhead made solid contributions off the bench, each scoring 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Gonzaga has as good a front line as any team on the West Coast,"
Aggers said. "If you don't rebound against them, you're beat."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 69, San Francisco 67--Andre Laws' three-point basket
with 4.4 seconds to play lifted the Toreros before a jubilant home
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Laws, a 6-foot-1 senior guard, had pulled San Diego within 67-66
on a driving, one-handed dunk with 18.9 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco forward Darrell Tucker missed a one-and-one free
throw with 15.7 seconds left, and Laws dribbled into the front court
and launched his winning shot from the left side, a few feet behind
the three-point arc.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco (13-15) rallied from a 60-52 deficit with 8:43 left
to take a 67-64 lead on Shamell Stallworth's three-point basket with
27.3 seconds left. Stallworth led all scorers with 28 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saint Mary's 72, Santa Clara 67--Freshman guard Adam Caporn scored
five of his 15 points in overtime to lead the Gaels to an upset over
the third-seeded Broncos.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara (13-15) forced the overtime when Justin Holbrook made
a three-point basket at the buzzer in regulation to tie the score,
55-55.</TE>
<TE>   Saint Mary's shot only 32.8% (19 of 58) from the field but managed
to erase an eight-point deficit in the final 2:44 of regulation. The
Gaels outscored Santa Clara in overtime, 17-12.</TE>

<HD>Governor Campaign Takes Sharp Right Turn</HD>
<DH>Election: The state Republican primary reverts to a fight over who
is most conservative, to Riordan's detriment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When leading Republicans cast about last year for a gubernatorial
candidate to resuscitate their flagging party, they spoke of finding a
different kind of California Republican.</LD>
<LD>   But now, as the GOP primary winds to a nasty finish, the contest has
reverted to a familiar fight over tax-cutting, Reagan-loving and who can
best shrink the reach of Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   In short, it has become a quarrel over which candidate is the most
traditional Republican.</LD>
<TE>   For all their calculations, it now seems the wise men of the GOP--from
the White House down--ignored one important element of Tuesday's
election: the people who go to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "Republican voters, particularly those who vote in primaries, aren't
in on the grand strategy of trying to do a make-over on the image of the
Republican Party," said Allan Hoffenblum, a veteran GOP strategist who
has long fretted about the party's declining support among women and
minority voters. "That's insiders talking, not your small businessman
living in West Covina . . . He votes for people he tends to believe."</TE>
<TE>   That more than anything else may explain the rocket-ship rise of
businessman Bill Simon Jr., the most conservative candidate in the race,
and the tumble of former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, the favored
candidate of the party establishment.</TE>
<TE>   With two days left, Riordan is in a tight contest with Simon, as the
third major contender, Secretary of State Bill Jones, limps behind.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, the incumbent Democrat, played a crucial role in
boosting Simon by spending an unprecedented $10 million in meddlesome
advertising that savaged Riordan as a flip-flopper lacking core values.
It was only after Davis wounded the front-running Riordan that Simon
began investing the personal millions he needed to run a serious
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   And now, even Riordan strategists concede they miscalculated by
looking past Tuesday's primary to the general election. In the process,
Riordan "ran around sticking his finger in the eyes of conservatives," as
one supporter put it, touting his endorsement of legalized abortion and
gay rights and lecturing GOP activists on their need to be more tolerant.</TE>
<TE>   "By saying to people, 'Change or die,' it's inherently saying to them,
'You're wrong,' and it was too negative an approach," said the Riordan
backer, who helped entice the former mayor into the race and did not wish
to be identified criticizing him.</TE>
<TE>   Strategically, the campaign could have worked to draw more moderates
to the polls Tuesday, but it did little of the specific targeting--with
campaign mailers, candidate appearances or aggressive phone calls--needed
to activate that support.</TE>
<TE>   Even more damaging, Riordan strategists say, were attacks over
Riordan's donations--totaling more than $1 million over the years--to
Democratic campaigns and political causes. That hurt his standing even
with moderate to liberal Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "People in this party tend to wear their partisanship on their
sleeves," said Ken Khachigian, an advisor to Republicans as far back as
President Richard Nixon. "It's like being a good neighbor. They say if
you're not 100%, if you don't like our neighborhood, you should move
across the street."</TE>
<TE>   Campaigning Saturday, Riordan continued the rightward tack he began as
soon as Simon erased his lead in opinion polls.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic thing is, I'm a conservative when it comes to the things
that count: tough fiscal management, education, health care, strong
businesses, quality jobs for everybody," Riordan said. "These are things
that all Californians want. We need a conservative in Sacramento to
implement those."</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, the candidate continued his emphasis on
broadening the appeal of the state GOP, which has failed to elect a
governor, senator or deliver California to a presidential candidate since
1994.</TE>
<TE>   Dialing from a campaign phone bank outside San Francisco, Riordan told
a voter named Karen that he was "a tough conservative fiscally, although
I reach out to women and minorities."</TE>
<TE>   That is precisely the formula that most analysts believe California
Republicans need to start winning top-of-the-ticket elections again. And
it is one of the reasons that Riordan's candidacy was so attractive to
many party leaders, starting with President Bush, who urged him last
spring to run for governor.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick Riordan is the only Republican who has the ability to reach out
effectively to women, Hispanics, Asians, African Americans and other
minority groups," said Republican Rep. David Dreier of San Dimas, one of
dozens of congressional and legislative lawmakers--many far more
conservative than Riordan--who have endorsed the former mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "He is one who very much wants to have a message of inclusion that is
out there," Dreier said. "And I will tell you, there are some within my
party who, unfortunately, want to have a closed shop. That is a vision of
the past."</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all the talk of outreach and broadening the party's appeal,
there is still the matter of Tuesday's Republican primary. And
California's statewide electorate is vastly different from the far
thinner ranks of voters expected to turn out for the GOP contest.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Los Angeles Times poll of registered voters found them
roughly split among self-described liberals, moderates and conservatives,
with each constituting about one-third of the electorate. However, the
survey found that 75% of likely Republican primary voters called
themselves conservative, while 16% were self-described moderates and just
9% identified themselves as liberals.</TE>
<TE>   The differences came through on specific issues as well. While 63% of
registered voters statewide supported legalized abortion, it won the
support of only 47% of likely Republican primary voters--with 49%
believing it should be outlawed.</TE>
<TE>   And while 51% of registered voters favored stricter gun controls, 77%
of likely Republican primary voters believed the state's control of
firearms was just about right, or should even be relaxed.</TE>
<TE>   "Fundamentally, the Republican Party is still a conservative party,"
said Sal Russo, chief strategist for Simon's campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than its stand on issues, such as lower taxation and reduced
regulation, Russo suggested the California Republican Party has a "brand
problem"--its image "is not particularly warm."</TE>
<TE>   That would explain both the perpetual smile on Simon's face and his
downplaying of touchy issues such as immigration, abortion, gun control
and environmental protection. Stands on those issues were central to the
defeat of the party's last gubernatorial nominee, Dan Lungren, who lost
to Davis in a 20-point landslide.</TE>
<TE>   Simon spent Saturday at five brief campaign rallies at airports across
the northern part of the state. As the theme of "Top Gun" blared over
loudspeakers, Simon and his wife, Cindy, descended from a small prop-jet
plane in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he would deal with charges by Riordan and Democrats that he
is too extreme to be elected in November, Simon insisted the election
would be a referendum on ideas rather than ideology.</TE>
<TE>   "What really matters is our California dream," he told reporters.
"What really matters are our schools, roads, water and power."</TE>
<TE>   Jones appeared with former Republican Gov. George Deukmejian in front
of the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach on Saturday afternoon, where
the candidate addressed a crowd of about 50 supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Jones reiterated his criticism of Simon for giving money to the
reelection of San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, a contribution actually
made by a business partner of Simon's investment firm.</TE>
<TE>Jones Pushes On With Confidence</TE>
<TE>   Despite his lowly standing in opinion polls, Jones continued to
express confidence in victory on Tuesday, citing as inspiration
Deukmejian's 1982 upset primary victory over former Lt. Gov. Mike Curb.
He also took a swipe at the free-spending ways of millionaires Riordan
and Simon, suggesting they were "trying to buy the Republican Party."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the Republican Party is for sale," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever wins Tuesday, several Republican strategists said the outcome
would not necessarily represent a repudiation of moderation or efforts to
move the party toward the center. They noted that Bruce McPherson, a
state senator from left-leaning Santa Cruz, will probably emerge as the
party's nominee for lieutenant governor. (That contest, however, has
gotten barely a flicker of attention from voters.)</TE>
<TE>   "If Bill Jones or Bill Simon wins, it doesn't mean they can't be
inclusive and reach out," Khachigian said, citing Reagan, Deukmejian and
former Gov. Pete Wilson as "good examples of people who, in their prime,
had strong conservative Republican principles and yet were able to bring
in all elements of the majority."</TE>
<TE>   As for Riordan and his backers, their endeavor to reconstitute the
state party has been an ambitious one and, politically, was always
something of a gamble. By staking his candidacy on that effort,
Riordan--at the least--has turned an apparent romp into a race he is now
struggling to win.</TE>
<TE>   "Candidates always start out their campaigns by wanting to change
democracy," said Dan Schnur, a Republican consultant who helped Riordan
during the exploratory phase of his candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   "All three of the candidates would agree the party needs to do
something to change its approach," he said. But as an enticement to the
party's true believers, "It's not a particularly motivating way to turn
out your vote."</TE>

<HD>Macedonians Say 7 Terrorists Killed in Clash</HD>
<DH>Balkans: The foreigners were reportedly planning attacks.
Authorities see a link between local ethnic Albanian rebels and the Al
Qaeda network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina
</DL>
<LD>Police in Macedonia killed seven foreign terrorists Saturday who
were planning attacks on embassies and other targets, Macedonian Interior
Minister Ljube Boskovski said. The dead men were apparently Pakistanis,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "They planned attacks on important buildings [and] foreign diplomats,
most probably from the U.S., Germany and the U.K.--those that were
involved in the fight against global terrorism," Boskovski told reporters
in Skopje, the Macedonian capital. Macedonian Interior Ministry officials
portrayed the incident as providing the first clear evidence of ties
between ethnic Albanian guerrillas in Macedonia and the Al Qaeda
terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   An armored personnel carrier and about 15 heavily armed Macedonian
police officers were stationed outside the U.S. Embassy in Skopje on
Saturday. Security had also been beefed up at the German and British
embassies.</LD>
<TE>   The fighters killed in a shootout were believed to have been linked to
four foreign "moujahedeen" arrested in Skopje nearly two weeks ago--two
Jordanians and two Bosnians who had studied in Jordan--a senior Interior
Ministry official told reporters on condition he not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Computer disks seized with that group contained 10,000 pages of
documents, some of which showed evidence of planning for terrorist
attacks in the region, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Five ethnic Albanians arrested last week also were believed to be
linked to those killed Saturday and the four arrested earlier, the senior
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's clash erupted when police near Butel, a suburb of Skopje,
noticed a suspicious vehicle and were fired on when they approached it,
the official said. The police returned fire, and the seven alleged
terrorists were killed as they attempted to flee, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Macedonian state television showed the police vehicle, one of its
windows shattered, riddled with bullet holes. The station also showed the
bodies of the men killed in the shootout, who appeared to be from South
Asia. No police were killed or wounded, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Other footage showed a dirt road between two vineyards, with
bloodstains on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The government in Skopje, which is dominated by ethnic Macedonians,
has been under severe international pressure to make political
concessions to the country's large ethnic Albanian minority. Conflict
between government forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the National
Liberation Army brought Macedonia to the brink of civil war last year.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas claimed to be seeking greater rights for ethnic
Albanians within Macedonia, while the government charged that they were
trying to break off ethnic Albanian parts of the country and attach them
to a "Greater Albania" or "Greater Kosovo," the largely ethnic Albanian
province of neighboring Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   An August peace deal helped calm the situation, but political reforms
called for under that agreement have stalled. There are widespread fears
that splinter rebel groups are planning a renewed insurgency, based
either on genuine anger at the slow pace of reforms or on using the lack
of greater political progress as a pretext to renew a separatist agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's incident was the worst violence in the country since the
guerrillas officially disbanded and turned over about 4,000 weapons to
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization under a disarmament plan that was
part of the peace deal.</TE>
<TE>   Also as part of the peace agreement, police have been cautiously
moving back into villages that had been guerrilla-controlled. However, an
estimated 60 to 80 villages remain without a police presence--in effect,
outside government control.</TE>
<TE>   The Macedonian government charged last year that guerrilla forces had
used Kosovo as a staging area for attacks. Although it is a province of
Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia, Kosovo has been under U.N.
administration and patrolled by a NATO-led peacekeeping force since
mid-1999.</TE>
<TE>   Boskovski, in an apparent effort to strengthen the impression that the
men killed Saturday were linked to ethnic Albanian guerrillas, said that
the men had "arrived from the direction of the northern border," which
would mean Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   "They were headed toward Skopje," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Boskovski said he did not believe that Saturday's incident heralded
the start of a widely feared "spring offensive" by ethnic Albanian
guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   "However, our security forces remain ready to react, if need be, to
any type of challenge," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Seven AK-47 assault rifles, ammunition and several grenades were found
at the site of the shootout, police said in a written statement. Uniforms
with shoulder patches of the officially disbanded guerrilla army also
were found, it said. An Interior Ministry official cited the uniforms as
further evidence of links to ethnic Albanian rebels.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials have charged that the National Liberation Army
has only pretended to disband and disarm and that in reality it is still
ready to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Macedonia has been relatively calm for the last several months. Some
observers have attributed this in part to a pending European
Union-sponsored conference of aid donors, tentatively scheduled for March
12 in Brussels, at which the country hopes to receive pledges of $200
million in aid. Neither side wants to be blamed if pledges are cut or the
conference is postponed because of an upsurge in fighting.</TE>

<HD>Pope Makes a Virtual Visit to Russia</HD>
<DH>Religion: Teleconference in Moscow delights the Roman Catholic
faithful. The Orthodox patriarch, however, denounces the event as 'an
invasion.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>He may never set foot on Russian soil in his lifetime, but Pope
John Paul II visited in spirit and image, at least, in a teleconference
Saturday night that was criticized by the Russian Orthodox patriarch as
"an invasion."</LD>
<LD>   The gothic spires of Moscow's Roman Catholic Cathedral of the
Immaculate Conception loomed against a pearly evening sky as hundreds
flocked to the church to pray with the pope.</LD>
<LD>   Among them were a few Muscovites drawn by curiosity and even some
Orthodox believers who don't share Patriarch Alexi II's apparent
hostility to the Vatican.</LD>
<TE>   The pope, 81 and frail, has made clear his fervent desire to visit
Russia. He was invited by former leaders Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris
N. Yeltsin but was blocked by the Russian Orthodox Church.</TE>
<TE>   President Vladimir V. Putin said in January that he would like to see
the pope visit Russia but that the two churches must resolve their
differences before that can happen.</TE>
<TE>   As the pontiff delivered a brief message in Russian on a large screen
in the Moscow cathedral, joyful cheers and applause rose toward the
vaulted ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   "We remain always united in faith and in the service of the gospel,"
he said, his words almost lost amid the delighted response of
participants.</TE>
<TE>   Given that Roman Catholics form such a small minority in Russia--there
are about 500,000 believers in the nation of 146 million--and given the
fierce Orthodox opposition, there was no Russian TV station interested in
broadcasting the pope's address. The service was beamed to the Moscow
cathedral at the same time it was broadcast in Rome, Athens and Vienna,
as well as in Budapest, Hungary; Strasbourg, France; and Valencia, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Although John Paul has sought unity of the Catholic and Orthodox
churches, which have been divided since 1054, the pope's activities in
recent years have infuriated the Russian Orthodox Church.</TE>
<TE>   His "virtual" visit Saturday was a typical case, exacerbating Orthodox
indignation over a recent Vatican decision to establish four formal
dioceses in Russia. That decision generated small anti-Vatican street
protests, a reproof from the Foreign Ministry and a parliamentary
investigation into Catholic proselytizing on Orthodox territory.</TE>
<TE>   A papal visit to Ukraine last year likewise angered the Moscow
patriarchate, which warned that relations would deteriorate so sharply as
a result that a meeting of the two church leaders would be rendered
almost impossible.</TE>
<TE>   The Moscow patriarchate believes that the Roman Catholic Church has
been poaching its flock in Russia and Ukraine, stealing souls that
rightfully belong to the Orthodox Church.</TE>
<TE>   For Orthodox believers such as Ludmila Yefremova, 65, the
patriarchate's opposition to a papal visit is a source of anguish and
disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Orthodox, but I love the pope. He is a saintly person. I know
that he loves the entire world," Yefremova said Saturday before the
teleconference.</TE>
<TE>   She said she was disappointed that Alexi II would not reach out and
embrace the pope.</TE>
<TE>   "His [the patriarch's] entourage is rigid and unbending. He's having a
hard time. I'm very frustrated by this latest conflict. All my prayers
are about that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Father Innokenty Pavlov, a Russian Orthodox abbot and teacher at St.
Andrew's Theological Institute in Moscow, attended the teleconference and
said he found it inspiring and promising.</TE>
<TE>   "The TV conference signified the appearance of a full-fledged Catholic
Church presence in Russia," said Pavlov, a strong supporter of uniting
the churches. "There's nothing negative about it. There are people in
Russia who needed it, and today they got what they needed."</TE>
<TE>   Pavlov said Russian Orthodox fears of expansion by the Catholic Church
are not simply paranoia: It will expand, he believes.</TE>
<TE>   "Alexi II is afraid that a much more successful parallel church will
emerge in Russia that will not be accountable to Moscow anymore but will
be accountable to the Vatican," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the cathedral, awaiting the pope's appearance, Moscow's Catholic
leader, Archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, said that if Europe could unite
around a single currency, believers should unite around God.</TE>
<TE>   "If people can unite for the sake of economic benefit, why is it that
we Christians, believers in one Savior, still remain divided? It is
nothing but a scandal, and we must try to overcome our difficulties,"
Kondrusiewicz said.</TE>
<TE>   To some Catholics attending the teleconference, Alexi II's reluctance
to accept a papal visit was puzzling.</TE>
<TE>   "He's patriarch of all Russia, yet he doesn't behave like a true
Christian. I don't understand his hostility to the Catholic Church," said
Akop Darbinyan, 37, a builder who has lived in Moscow for 13 years.
"Christians are all Christians. It doesn't matter who you are."</TE>
<TE>   Darbinyan said his dream is that someday the pope will touch his head
in blessing.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Agnes Savitska, 34, a Polish nun in the office of the
archbishop, said there are many spiritually hungry people in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people here who want to believe. There is so much
work to be done here, so much space. People are looking for God, and we
have to be out here to help them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Deacon Andrei Kurayev, a professor of orthodox theology at St.
Tikhon's Institute in Moscow, who was not present at the teleconference,
called it a show that, to Orthodox believers, resembled a "comical
personality cult."</TE>
<TE>   "If the pope wishes so strongly to bring about the unity of all
Christians in the world, let him start with settling some intra-Catholic
conflicts first," Kurayev said. "Once that's done, we will see whether he
should proceed with treating the rift with the Orthodox world."</TE>

<HD>A Roman Rally Against 'Protections' for Premier</HD>
<DH>Italy: Opposition leads a protest against measures aimed at
shielding Silvio Berlusconi's personal and business interests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>More than 100,000 people marched behind Italy's re-energized
center-left opposition leaders Saturday to denounce government measures
aimed at shielding Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi from criminal
prosecution and the loss of his multibillion-dollar business empire.</LD>
<LD>   The festive, peaceful demonstration was the biggest against the
country's richest individual since his center-right coalition swept to
victory last May and bigger than any rally of the election campaign that
preceded it.</LD>
<LD>   Protesters mocked the 65-year-old tycoon, whose effigy floated above
the crowd in a Napoleon outfit. They wore Pinocchio noses and passed
around make-believe bank notes bearing the image of a sneering Berlusconi
and the slogan: "Italy is not for sale. I'm going to keep it all for
myself."</LD>
<TE>   Berlusconi has unsettled many Italians in recent months by using his
coalition's parliamentary majority to push through laws, over loud but
impotent opposition protests, that protect his personal and business
interests.</TE>
<TE>   One law makes it harder for prosecutors to use evidence from foreign
countries in criminal cases in Italy; after that bill passed Parliament,
defense lawyers moved to block Swiss bank evidence that Berlusconi had
bribed a judge to approve a business acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   But the most highly charged move is a government bill to regulate
conflicts of interest in a way that would allow Berlusconi to keep
control of the Fininvest holding company while running the government.
Fininvest owns Italy's major private television networks, a major
publishing house, a film production company, a financial services company
and the AC Milan soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   The tycoon promised after taking office to resolve this evident
conflict of interest. But the bill, which passed the lower house of
Parliament last week and is headed for the Senate, bars only managers of
businesses, not owners such as Berlusconi, from holding public office.</TE>
<TE>   Debate nearly brought rival lawmakers to blows. Rather than stay and
vote against it, Francesco Rutelli, the Olive Tree coalition leader who
lost the election to Berlusconi, led opposition lawmakers out of the
Parliament chamber and took their cause to the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-government protests led by citizens groups have been building for
more than a week, but they have also criticized centrist and leftist
party leaders for fighting more among themselves than against Berlusconi.</TE>
<TE>   Rutelli told a rally at the end of Saturday's march that the protests
were a "wake-up call for me."</TE>
<TE>   "Today, with renewed force, begins a new path forward for all of us,"
he told the crowd in the piazza outside St. John Lateran Basilica. "The
right divides. The Olive coalition wants to unite Italy."</TE>
<TE>   Protest organizers used a powerful symbol to claim that they are just
as patriotic as Berlusconi is. Giovanni Bachelet, whose father was a
prominent judge killed by Red Brigade terrorists more than two decades
ago, brought the Italian flag that had been draped over the casket, and
it was hoisted over the rally.</TE>
<TE>   Many marchers carried large yellow posters in the shape of a fist with
the forefinger and little finger raised--a gesture that, in southern
Europe, means "Your wife is cheating on you." Berlusconi playfully made
that sign over the Spanish foreign minister's head during a photo session
in Spain a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's marching yellow fists read: "An informal salute to the
prime minister."</TE>
<TE>   Berlusconi belittled the rally and said Italians wouldn't be impressed
either. "The Italians know how to distinguish between the good and bad,
between love and hate," he said. "And the majority are for love."</TE>

<DL>HAVANA
</DL>
<LD>Mexican Ambassador Ricardo Pascoe defended the decision to call in
Cuban police to evict 21 men who stormed his embassy last week, saying it
was the best way to decisively resolve the crisis.</LD>
<LD>   "I am absolutely convinced it was necessary to conclude the process as
quickly as possible, whatever the consequences," said Pascoe, who
witnessed the operation as a guarantee against excessive violence.</LD>
<LD>   The men crashed a bus through the embassy's perimeter gate Wednesday
night after false rumors Mexico was offering entry visas to all Cubans
who wanted them. That sparked mayhem and at least 150 arrests outside the
mission.</LD>
<TE>   After the 21 men had holed up for 30 hours and refused Mexican
officials' attempts to talk them out, unarmed agents went in Friday at
Mexico's request to fetch them.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the fate of the men remained unclear. Mexico has said it
would not press charges, but Cuba was expected to try the men for public
order offenses. Relatives of some of the men said they didn't know where
they were being held. Mexican officials said they knew but were not going
to release details.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it is up to the Cuban government" to decide whether that
information should be made public, Pascoe said. However, he had said
earlier that he was "actually very reluctant to accept the idea offhand
that they are going to be tortured, mistreated. I just somehow don't
perceive that as the tone of the Cuban government."</TE>
<TE>   Many fellow diplomats in Havana applauded Mexico's handling of the
situation as likely to help deter similar break-ins of foreign premises.
But some anti-Castro Cuban Americans were furious, saying the men's right
to asylum was violated, while local dissidents were worried they may face
severe reprisals.</TE>

<HD>Death Toll in India's Sectarian Riots Reaches 485</HD>
<DH>Asia: Vigilantes roam the streets. In one village, 28 Muslim farm
hands and their children are burned to death.</DH>

<DL>SARDARPUR, India
</DL>
<LD>Poor Muslim farm workers hiding in a one-room house were a perfect
target for Hindus bent on revenge.</LD>
<LD>   No one is likely to raise a vigilante mob because of the deaths of 28
landless laborers and their children, who were burned to death around
midnight Friday as they cowered in the dark. And survivors from a total
of about 20 burned houses have fled this farming village of roughly 4,000
residents. No one expects them to dare come back.</LD>
<LD>   By this morning, the official death toll after four days of religious
violence here in the western state of Gujarat was 485, including 58
people who died Wednesday when a Muslim mob attacked a train carrying
Hindu nationalists. That attack, near the town of Godhra, sparked the
unrest that police and soldiers claimed Saturday to be bringing under
control with curfews and a policy of shooting looters, arsonists and
other troublemakers on sight.</LD>
<TE>   Police said they had killed 73 people since Wednesday. The remaining
victims died in communal violence, Gujarat's state government said. But
authorities had said the death toll would mount because they were finding
more bodies and attacks were continuing in rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee went on national television
Saturday to call for calm, as thousands of police and army troops
patrolled cities and towns in Gujarat.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the provocation, people should maintain peace and exercise
restraint," Vajpayee said. "The burning alive of people, including women
and children, from Godhra to Ahmadabad and other places, is a blot on the
country's face."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmadabad, Gujarat's largest city, and the rest of the state were
reported mostly quiet Saturday, but in the Panchmahal district, attackers
set a vehicle on fire, killing nine people.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, vigilante groups, both Hindu and Muslim, continued to roam
the dirt tracks that connect Gujarat's villages. Truck drivers said men
at roadblocks made of burned-out vehicles, concrete drainage pipes or
felled trees were checking driver's licenses in search of people with
what they considered the wrong religious beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   At one rural crossroad, about a dozen Hindu men and teenage boys
checked the few cars still moving for Muslims. One of the men was armed
with a handmade sickle of heavy steel, ground to a sharp edge.</TE>
<TE>   The bloodletting in Sardarpur, at least, was probably finished.</TE>
<TE>   "In this village, it's not going to happen again," Subinspector
Bhuralal Purohit of the Gujarat state police said through a translator.
"There's no [Muslim] community left to attack."</TE>
<TE>   But the Sardarpur massacre, whose smallest victim was about 5 years
old, showed how in the Indian countryside, religion need not mark you for
death. Often, the dispossessed live with the greatest risks because they
are considered the most expendable.</TE>
<TE>   The incinerated farm workers--police called them "outsiders" who had
moved to Sardarpur from a nearby village--earned about $1 a day working
in fields of wheat and tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   The Hindu mob that attacked them sometime after 11:30 Friday night
could have gone after more prosperous Muslims among about 350 descendants
of ethnic Pushtun Afghans, called Pathan, who migrated to India
generations ago. But police said those landowners were left alone.</TE>
<TE>   All of Sardarpur's surviving Muslims fled the village, but their Hindu
neighbors will let only the Pathans return, Subinspector Galbahai Paramar
said.</TE>
<TE>   "These people who are laborers have gone and will never come back," he
said. "But the village people have no differences with these Pathans."</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the people killed in Sardarpur were children, whose mothers
and fathers took shelter in the small light blue house at the end of a
dirt lane because, Paramar said, they thought that it was the safest to
place to hide.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers told police that the trouble started when a mob of about 400
Hindus from a neighboring village came to Sardarpur and set fire to a
stall that sold tobacco and betel nut for chewing.</TE>
<TE>   A young Muslim man attacked one of the Hindus with a sword, Paramar
said, the angry mob surged, and the frenzied burning and killing began.
As of late Saturday, no one had been arrested in connection with the
attacks and killings, Purohit said.</TE>
<TE>   Paramar said he was leading a patrol of 11 policemen when he received
a radio call between 12:30 a.m. and 1 a.m. telling him to respond to
unrest in Sardarpur. It took his unit about an hour to reach the village
because his officers had to remove several roadblocks to get through, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Muslim farm laborers' enclave was ablaze when police arrived, the
officer said, and he had to douse fires with a small bucket of water as
he made his way along the dirt lane. Paramar learned that there were
people in the blue house from a survivor living next door.</TE>
<TE>   Thick smoke was pouring from the building's front door, and when
police finished dragging out the partially burned corpses, they counted
seven children, 14 women and seven men.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they thought that the Hindu mob came from the nearby
village of Jantral, which lost two people in Wednesday's train attack.
But residents of Jantral and several other villages around Sardarpur
denied that any of the train victims or Sardarpur's attackers came from
their communities.</TE>
<TE>   Patel Babulal Barshottam, a local leader of the right-wing party
Vishwa Hindu Parishad and a survivor of the train fire, condemned the
Sardarpur killings but said they were understandable after what he called
the premeditated murder at Godhra.</TE>
<TE>   "The fires which are burning now are flames of religious war," said
Barshottam, 49, a farmer and businessman in the village of Kamalpur,
about nine miles from Sardarpur.</TE>
<TE>   Barshottam said a mob of about 1,000 Muslims forced the express train
to stop about half a mile past the Godhra station about 6:30 a.m.
Wednesday. When the crowd attacked with stones, Hindu passengers locked
the doors, and then the train was firebombed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mangu Ben Patel, 55, and her niece Lalita Ben Patel, 38, burned to
death on the train, and relatives could identify their bodies only by the
women's jewelry.</TE>
<TE>   They lived in Jaydevpura, a Hindu farming village of about 1,000
people next to a few state-owned oil wells, about 25 miles west of
Ahmadabad. Lalita taught elementary school in the mainly Muslim village
of Dudhai, said her cousin Hashmuk Patel, 41.</TE>
<TE>   As Patel and other relatives mourned the women Saturday, they also
worried that more attacks were coming. But the unrest seemed likely to
end after a few more days, Patel said. Violent spasms in the age-old
conflict between Hindus and Muslims always subside, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even visions of peace are clouded by prejudice here.</TE>
<TE>   "Hindus forget easily. That's why the riots will come to an end,"
Patel said. "But Muslims do not forget easily. That's why they are still
going on."</TE>

<DL>BHUBANESHWAR, India
</DL>
<LD>Three men were arrested in eastern India in connection with a
January shooting attack at an American cultural center, police said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the three were close associates of the men on motorcycles
who killed five police officers guarding the American Center in the
eastern city of Calcutta on Jan. 22.</LD>
<LD>   The arrested men--Allaudin Khan, Mohammad Tahir and Niyamat
Baig--apparently gave the attackers shelter after the attack, police
said.</LD>
<TE>   They were detained Friday night in Jagatpur, about 25 miles north of
Bhubaneshwar, the capital of Orissa state. They were taken Saturday to
Calcutta, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Indian police last month brought alleged mob leader Aftab Ansari, the
main suspect in the case, back from the United Arab Emirates. Police
allege that Ansari has links to Islamic extremists--including Ahmed Omar
Saeed Sheikh, accused of involvement in the killing of Wall Street
Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.</TE>

<HD>Prince Edward, Wife to Give Up Day Jobs</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Prince Edward and his wife, Sophie Rhys-Jones, who were criticized
for their behavior as private sector executives, announced Saturday that
they will quit their jobs to spend more time fulfilling their royal
responsibilities, including planning the queen's Golden Jubilee
celebrations.</LD>
<LD>   "It is quite obvious that in this year, the Golden Jubilee, we are
required more than ever to support the queen and to help my family
shoulder some of the increasing responsibilities and workload into the
future," said Edward, Queen Elizabeth II's youngest son.</LD>
<LD>   Edward, 37, said running his own television production company had
been "enormous fun, immensely rewarding and full of surprises."</LD>
<TE>   "Yet I always knew in the back of my mind that one day things would
have to change. Well, that day has come, not just for me, but also for my
wife," he said in a speech to a conference in Weston-super-Mare, southern
England.</TE>
<TE>   Both Edward's and Sophie's business interests have drawn criticism in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Edward has been accused of exploiting his royal position for the
benefit of his television company.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, a camera team from his company was caught filming at his
nephew Prince William's university, breaching a media agreement to
respect William's privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Sophie has continued to run a successful public relations firm since
marrying the prince in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In April, she was recorded by a journalist posing as a potential
client suggesting that clients would benefit from her royal connection.</TE>
<TE>   The prince said Saturday that after the couple had fulfilled their
current obligations they would "cease to have any connection with our
companies."</TE>

<HD>2 Mexican Immigration Officers Fired for Deporting Citizens</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>The Mexican government has fired two immigration officials for
deporting seven fellow citizens who could not produce official
citizenship documents. The officials apparently thought the seven were
from Guatemala.</LD>
<LD>   The fired officials could also face criminal charges, Mexico's
Migration Institute said.</LD>
<LD>   The two officials worked at a migration office in the border state of
Sonora, across from Arizona. The four men and three women from Chiapas
apparently were on their way to the United States to find work but lacked
official citizenship documents. After being sent to Guatemala, they
returned to Chiapas.</LD>
<TE>   The incident revealed the government's occasional difficulty in
dealing with Mexico's ethnic diversity. Until the 1800s, Chiapas was part
of Guatemala and continues to resemble that country as much as it does
Mexico. As in Guatemala, most residents are dark-skinned people of Indian
descent. It is not uncommon for impoverished Indians in Chiapas to lack
official documents.</TE>
<TE>   After the deportations were revealed, local media mocked the official
procedure of asking history questions to confirm a person's claim of
Mexican nationality. A government guidebook instructs immigration
officials to ask people about Doroteo Arango--the real name of
revolutionary hero Pancho Villa--among other historical facts.</TE>
<TE>   In an informal survey, many Mexico City residents were stumped by the
questions.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Widening Its Interests in Islamic World, Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Policy: The Arab-Israeli conflict no longer dominates the American
perspective, experts note.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In a gradual but increasingly visible change since Sept. 11, the
United States is shifting its focus and priorities in the Islamic world
away from Arab nations, particularly states caught up in the Arab-Israeli
conflict, to a wider set of interests in Asia, Africa and the Persian
Gulf, according to U.S. officials and regional experts.</LD>
<LD>   The terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon were the initial
impetus, forcing the Bush administration to divert attention to
Afghanistan and Pakistan. But there is also a growing consensus among
experts both in and outside government that the next phase of political
development in the Islamic world may not be determined by what emerges
from the Arab-Israeli peace process, as was once widely assumed.</LD>
<LD>   The unwillingness or inability of Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat to further that process is only a small part of a more
fundamental problem, analysts say.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a strong sense in Washington that the Arab world, including
moderate states, is being left behind. The Arab world appears stubbornly
resistant to the forces of democratization, globalization and market
economics," said Kenneth M. Pollack, a former National Security Council
staffer now at the Council on Foreign Relations.</TE>
<TE>   "As a result, the Arab-Israeli conflict no longer dominates our
perspective in the region. It's only one of several issues in the wider
Islamic world," Pollack said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is instead increasingly focusing on other models for
the 50-plus nations of the Islamic world, the last major bloc of
countries to hold out against the democratic tide that has swept the
globe over the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   At the top of the list is a bold initiative by Pakistan's president,
Pervez Musharraf. In December, he launched a crackdown on religious
extremism and began promoting secularism as the first of several steps to
transforming the strategic South Asian nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Musharraf represents what we hope happens elsewhere in the Islamic
world," said a senior State Department official who asked not to be
named. "His strategic choice to move swiftly down the course of
moderation puts Pakistan on an entirely different track--with
implications for the rest of the region."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Arafat's inability to make a clear choice and carry it
out has made the Palestinian leader "look even worse," this official
added.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is also investing major diplomatic and economic
resources to support Afghanistan's fragile transition from the Islamic
world's most repressive regime to one with some form of representative
government, a process that will play out over the next two years--and
potentially serve as another paradigm.</TE>
<TE>   Playing off the Bush administration's plans to push harder for such
change, Washington is even abuzz with talk of how a post-Saddam Hussein
leadership in Iraq could be another model for a region hungry for new
political direction.</TE>
<TE>   "Arafat is the man of yesterday. Musharraf is the man of today. And
the post-Saddam leader of Iraq is the man of tomorrow," said Henri J.
Barkey, a former State Department policy planning staffer and now
chairman of Lehigh University's international relations department.</TE>
<TE>   The shift reflects one of the most significant if still subtle changes
in U.S. foreign policy to emerge after Sept. 11. For decades, the issues
of oil and Israel's security have led Democratic and Republican
administrations alike to devote the greatest time and energy to the Arab
states that either border Israel or have vast petroleum reserves. The
Middle East peace process, launched in 1993, intensified American
involvement in the region. No leader from the Islamic world--or the wider
world--visited the White House more often during the Clinton
administration than Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, Arafat is persona non grata at the White House, while
Musharraf just concluded a triumphant three-day visit to Washington,
where he was widely sought-after to consult with congressional groups,
speak to think tanks and make media appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Interim Afghan Prime Minister Hamid Karzai, the other regional Asian
leader to be warmly welcomed in Washington, sat next to First Lady Laura
Bush during the president's State of the Union address and received a
standing ovation from the top officials of all three branches of the U.S.
government.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's high-profile visit was a marked contrast to the mood in
Washington just six months ago, when the Pakistani leader was unwelcome
because in 1999 he led a military coup against a democratically elected
government. This year, however, he has pledged to hold parliamentary
elections in October.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to curb religious fanaticism, religious extremism, religious
intolerance, militancy, anger, hatred from our society," Musharraf told
the National Press Club, in what was music to the administration's ears.</TE>
<TE>   More important to the wider Islamic world and America's long-term
interests, however, is the fact that Musharraf is promoting the sweeping
proposition that Islam is compatible with democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Islam is very democratic. I don't think there is any contradiction in
Islam and democracy functioning together in any part of the world," he
said on the PBS television show "NewsHour" recently.</TE>
<TE>   "We are an Islamic state. However, that does not at all mean that it
is a theocratic state," he said. "The misperception in the West probably
is that [an] Islamic state means a theocratic state. There is no room for
theocracy in Islam. Therefore, that is an Islamic state which gives equal
rights and status to minorities and all people in the country."</TE>
<TE>   At an international Islamic conference last month in the Pakistani
capital, Islamabad, Musharraf criticized the Muslim world for being
backward and weak.</TE>
<TE>   "The Muslim umma [community] is one-fourth of humanity, but we are the
poorest, the most illiterate, the most backward, the most unhealthy and
indeed the most deprived and weakest of the human race," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The former Soviet republics of Central Asia, which are overwhelmingly
Muslim, are also garnering an increasing amount of attention from the
United States. Since Sept. 11, the Bush administration has committed to
working with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.</TE>
<TE>   The wider war on terrorism has also turned U.S. attention to countries
such as Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   The growing frustration with the Arab world has even spurred talk in
Washington about reducing dependence on Arab oil, Pollack said, "so that
we can forget about the Mideast, so we don't have to be held hostage to
its problems."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush discussed that need last month.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand it's in the national interests, security interests, of
the United States that we're less dependent on foreign sources of
energy," the president said at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska. "We've
got to find energy in our own country."</TE>

<HD>Former Russian Rainmaker Tries Role of Dissident</HD>
<DH>Politics: Self-exiled tycoon Boris Berezovsky sees himself as a
defender of free speech. But to some, he is the epitome of 'robber
capitalism.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>A few years ago, he was Mr. Inside, one of Russia's most powerful
businessmen and politicians. He was at home in the thick of shadowy
Kremlin deals, helping to make and break prime ministers and presidents.</LD>
<LD>   Today, Boris Abramovich Berezovsky has been shorn of two media
empires, is accused by Russian security services of funding Chechen
terrorists and is sought for questioning by the general prosecutor's
office. The 56-year-old multimillionaire no longer feels safe in his
homeland. President Vladimir V. Putin's Russia, he says, is becoming a
dictatorship whose leader can do anything to his enemies.</LD>
<LD>   What does the consummate insider do when he is on the outside?</LD>
<TE>   From an office on London's stylish Savile Row, Berezovsky has plunged
into a new and unaccustomed role: as a dissident and self-styled defender
of free speech. He would like to offer himself as a rallying point for
the liberal opposition, in what he says is a fight to protect the
democratic values of the 1990s from being subverted by a new generation
of KGB apparatchiks.</TE>
<TE>   Berezovsky's detractors--and there are many--sneer at this white-hat
role. They say he is no icon of liberty but rather a former insider
seeking a route back in. During a recent interview in London, where he
has taken up voluntary exile, Berezovsky agreed that the majority of
people in Russia dislike him, but he claimed that a small and important
segment is starting to listen.</TE>
<TE>   He warned of a creeping climate of fear in his homeland that he says
would have been unimaginable under former President Boris N. Yeltsin.</TE>
<TE>   Berezovsky cited the Kremlin's moves since Putin's ascent two years
ago to bring to heel three privately controlled television networks, put
Kremlin appointees in power over elected governors and prosecute what he
called political enemies of the regime.</TE>
<TE>   "Laws count for zero in Russia today because everything is controlled
from the Kremlin, including the court system," Berezovsky declared.</TE>
<TE>   Berezovsky reiterated his accusation that Putin's meteoric rise came
about through a tawdry conspiracy orchestrated by the Federal Security
Service, or FSB, the domestic successor agency to the Soviet-era KGB.</TE>
<TE>   Berezovsky has alleged that the FSB is responsible for apartment-house
bombings in 1999 that stoked public emotion and provided the reason for
Putin--then prime minister and a veteran of both spy agencies--to launch
a war in the separatist republic of Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   If an FSB role in the bombings can be laid bare, Berezovsky said, the
scandal would dog Putin's presidency and eventually might help pull it
down.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, FSB operatives have fired back, accusing Berezovsky
of backing anti-Russian terrorism in Chechnya and threatening to demand
his extradition to Moscow to face unspecified charges.</TE>
<TE>   Resented by Russians for his money, and notorious for intrigues during
the Yeltsin years, Berezovsky hardly seems the ideal candidate to serve
as the white knight of liberal values.</TE>
<TE>   "Berezovsky is the embodiment of robber capitalism," said Andrei A.
Piontkovsky, director of the Moscow-based Independent Institute for
Strategic Studies. Berezovsky was also part of the establishment at the
time of many alleged misdeeds for which he now blames authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "Such a person, by definition, cannot be the leader of the democratic
opposition," Piontkovsky said.</TE>
<TE>'Healthy Opposition'</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Berezovsky's defenders say he is practically the
only public figure to openly challenge Putin and therefore the battle
could prove important for the country's future.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia needs healthy opposition very badly now. . . . It would be
simplest to say that we don't want to listen to Berezovsky because his
credibility is marred," said newspaper columnist Pavel I. Voshchanov, a
onetime Yeltsin spokesman. "But if we don't have him, we won't have
anything."</TE>
<TE>   The 1999 bombings killed more than 300 people and set off waves of
panic. Chechen terrorists were blamed by the authorities, yet the bombers
were never caught.</TE>
<TE>   To Berezovsky, a strange silence has settled on the case and the
mystery itself is damning to the authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "You know the terrible explosion in Oklahoma City? All America was
involved in trying to find out who did that and to put him in jail, and
then finally to execute him. And at least relatives were sure that that
was the person responsible," Berezovsky said. "In Russia, to the
contrary, relatives still don't know. Those who live in Russia are afraid
to even ask questions."</TE>
<TE>   Berezovsky has told the media that he has launched his own
investigation into the case, the results of which will be released soon.
But in the recent interview, he seemed to step back from promising to
offer proof of FSB involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "I will present the facts, and for me it is proof. But I don't insist
that for everybody it will be proof," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The most troubling thing about the case, he said, is that it "leads to
the question of who controls Russia. And if it turns out that it is the
same people who organized this terrible crime, then that is terrible for
the state and for the nation."</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of problem for myself to understand it and what to do,"
he added. "I think that it happened because the KGB was not destroyed
and, moreover, Putin himself and [FSB chief Nikolai P.] Patrushev, they
are proud that they continue the tradition of the KGB."</TE>
<TE>   Berezovsky said he first began to have his doubts about Putin in 1999,
when the little-known FSB director was promoted by Yeltsin to prime
minister. In Putin's FSB office on Lyubyanka Street, there was a small
bust of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of Cheka, the KGB's predecessor.
Berezovsky said he did not think much about it at the time. But when
Putin moved into the prime minister's office, the bust went with him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first time I felt something was strange," Berezovsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Berezovsky, who was a close advisor to Yeltsin and served as deputy
chairman of the Russian Security Council, said he and Putin had a cordial
relationship until the latter became president.</TE>
<TE>   Berezovsky said he disagreed with legislation appointing
representatives of the president to oversee the work of regional
governors.</TE>
<TE>Chechnya Policy Clash</TE>
<TE>   The two men also clashed on policy in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Berezovsky, who had been highly involved in the Chechen issue under
Yeltsin, said he believed that Moscow should have followed up on its
military operations by holding early negotiations with the separatist
republic's leaders. Putin has rejected talks, even after more than 3,000
Russian soldiers and an uncounted number of Chechen fighters and
civilians have been killed.</TE>
<TE>   Their break, according to Berezovsky, came when Putin complained after
the August 2000 sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk about the coverage
of the disaster on ORT television. The oligarch controlled the network
through his 49% ownership share.</TE>
<TE>   Putin suffered in public opinion when he initially did not cut short
his vacation to take charge of the Kursk rescue effort. Meanwhile, ORT
broadcast enraged statements by the wives and mothers of the doomed crew.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after, Berezovsky said, Putin summoned him, accused him of
ordering deliberately biased coverage and announced that the state would
take control of ORT. Berezovsky said he was told by a presidential aide
to give up his stake in ORT or "follow Gusinsky to jail."</TE>
<TE>   It was a reference to Vladimir A. Gusinsky, another oligarch, who
already had been briefly arrested. Gusinsky's NTV television irritated
the Kremlin, and a court ruling ultimately gave control of the network to
Gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   A third private network, the Berezovsky-owned TV6, was stripped of its
broadcast license in January.</TE>
<TE>   Following the so-called media wars, Berezovsky said he is working with
Gusinsky--who also has gone into exile--to broadcast television news into
Russia via satellite. In addition, Berezovsky is launching a
Russian-language magazine, Kolokol, that he says will be a forum for
independent thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Anything to break the monopoly of power, Berezovsky said, adding that
he has no problem referring to Putin as a dictator.</TE>
<TE>   "What do we mean by dictator? A person who concentrates power in his
hand and who is able to do everything that he wants, in spite of the
law," he said. "I am sure that it is so today in Russia."</TE>
<TE>   Although polls of late have given Putin a popularity rating of between
70% and 75%, Berezovsky predicted that his foe's career as president will
be short.</TE>
<TE>   Popular opinion matters little in Russia, he said; the important thing
is keeping the trust of the elites, of which he named six: regional
governors, mass media, oligarchs, intelligentsia, the military and part
of the security services. All of them, he claimed, are growing
disenchanted with Putin's policies and the growing concentration of
power.</TE>
<TE>   Berezovsky acknowledges that the feud might escalate and that he might
yet face extradition. Nevertheless, he said, he will press on.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it is strange, but I enjoy what I am doing, even in this
difficult position," he said. "I don't feel I am masochist, but I feel
myself strong enough to continue on this way."</TE>

<HD>For Bush, Environment Is Local</HD>
<DH>Policy: The White House would shift authority out of Washington.
But activists fear a raft of self-serving decisions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration, reversing decades of centralizing
environmental regulations in Washington, is seeking to shift
responsibility for pollution control and public land use to local
government and private interests.</LD>
<LD>   In a series of policies proposed in recent weeks on global warming,
power plant pollution, national forests and conservation, the federal
government plays the role of facilitator rather than dictator.</LD>
<LD>   No longer would stiff federal penalties fall on those who failed to
clean their pollution. Business would be in charge of ensuring clean air
and water.</LD>
<TE>   No longer would government control federal land use. Local
organizations, businesses and individuals would make those
determinations.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the administration believes the environment would be
protected--without such frequent recourse to costly court battles--even
as energy production is increased and greater use is made of federal
lands.</TE>
<TE>   "The president's philosophy is that not all wisdom lies in Washington,
and to the extent that we can build partnerships with states and
corporations and local communities, we'll get much more accomplished,"
said Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman.
"That's something both of us learned as governors."</TE>
<TE>   Many environmental activists, however, fear that the administration's
principles hide an intention to turn environmental policy over to
business. They cite recent Interior Department steps toward allowing
snowmobiles to roam Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks if they
abide by some limits on noise and gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason federal environmental laws were cast in the first place
was because the state governments, state legislatures and local
governments were so dominated by local industries that the environment
wasn't being protected," said Philip Clapp, president of National
Environmental Trust.</TE>
<TE>   (Many of President Bush's goals--new ways of enforcing clean air
standards, for example, and drilling for oil in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge--require legislation. Others do not; snowmobiles are
already allowed in Yellowstone and Grand Teton.)</TE>
<TE>   For climate change policy, Bush's "new environmentalism" means
businesses are asked to come up with ways to limit the increase of
greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, that contribute to global
warming. They are not required to meet any federally mandated targets.</TE>
<TE>   To clean up power plants, a system of tradable "pollution rights"
gives utilities financial incentives to reduce emissions of toxic
mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Government leaves it to
industry to decide how to meet nationwide emission caps.</TE>
<TE>   To improve management of national forests, some would be taken over by
local trustees--perhaps loggers, hikers, business executives and
scientists who live nearby. Wildlife and wilderness would be cared for in
lands adjacent to federal property with a new $100-million program that
would give money to states and individuals willing to donate their time
or money to conservation projects.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's environmental team--led by Whitman and Interior Secretary Gale
A. Norton--argues that citizens and the businesses they run should be
trusted to care for their environment. Unwieldy bureaucracies, they say,
are not the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that most Americans, especially those who depend on the
land for their livelihood, are ready and willing to step up to the
challenge," Norton said in a recent speech.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence may be found in the government's successful acid rain
program. Bush's power plant proposal is modeled on the program, which has
cut sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants faster than required and
at 80% less cost to industry than predicted a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The acid rain program sets overall standards for air quality and
relies on market forces to compel utility companies either to pollute
less or to pay other, cleaner utilities for the right to pollute more.
The government tightens air quality standards by reducing the total
amount of allowable pollution, making pollution rights more expensive and
the incentives to clean more compelling.</TE>
<TE>   Public health advocates and environmentalists applaud the program but
say it works best in tandem with other programs that set health-based air
quality standards. The advocates fear that the Bush administration wants
to scrap some of these standards.</TE>
<TE>   "The existing Clean Air Act is a remarkable success story," said Paul
Billings, an assistant vice president of the American Lung Assn. "We've
had significant and consistent progress in cleaning the air. But the
battle is not over. We still do not have clean air."</TE>
<TE>   Whitman said the administration is considering scrapping at least one
provision of the Clean Air Act, which requires power plants to install
state-of-the-art pollution controls during major renovations.</TE>
<TE>   Under Bush's separate proposal for power plants, the federal
government would set nationwide emission caps for utility plants.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't try to micromanage the utilities' ways of getting
there," Whitman said. "We give them time to meet the goals and do it in a
way that keeps them economically competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Such programs are only as tough as the caps, and many environmental
activists worry that the Bush administration would not make them tough
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our fear that this proposal will mean more pollution than under
the [current] Clean Air Act," Billings said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration says its vision for less Washington in
environmental policy is consistent with its goal of significantly
increasing the production of energy on federal land.</TE>
<TE>   "New environmentalism is about meeting our nation's need for a vibrant
economy and energy security--while at the same time protecting the
environment," Norton said. "Some people say it can't be done. I know it
can."</TE>
<TE>   The philosophy accepts uses for public land that make many
conservationists cringe, including logging, mining and recreation, such
as off-road vehicles in fragile deserts and snowmobiling in national
parks.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal for national forests is seeing whether we can produce more of
everything--except controversy," said Mark Rey, undersecretary of the
Agriculture Department for natural resources and environment. He
specified that his list includes logging, mineral extraction, recreation
and the safeguarding of wildlife and wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists contend that when the Bush administration must
choose between energy production and local control, energy always wins.
For instance, the politicians and people of California and Florida oppose
offshore oil drilling, but the administration nonetheless has pursued
more oil development off their coasts.</TE>
<TE>   One clear goal of the administration's policy is to diminish the
courts' role in environmental skirmishes among the federal government,
environmentalists and businesses that pollute or earn money on federal
lands.</TE>
<TE>   When announcing his power plant proposal last week, Bush said: "It
will replace a confusing, ineffective maze of regulations for power
plants that has created an endless cycle of litigation."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have had great success using the courts to protect
endangered species, limit the size of timber sales in national forests
and uphold tough air and water pollution laws. "What the president has
done is say, 'Let's have a . . . system so nobody can tell any particular
company to clean up,' " Clapp said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials counter that litigation also has hurt
the environment by slowing the adoption of regulations to protect it.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most creative examples of the administration's philosophy
is the notion of charter forests, which it proposed last month. Modeled
in part on charter schools, charter forests would be partially under the
control of local trustees.</TE>
<TE>   The local boards, while freed of many of the bureaucratic requirements
set by Washington, still would be required to abide by environmental
protections.</TE>
<TE>   "We're interested in collaborative approaches that come from the
ground up as opposed to Washington, D.C.-based proposals that come from
the top down," said Rey, who oversees the 153 national forests.</TE>
<TE>   No longer would competing interests--from bird watchers to timber
companies--each appeal to Washington bureaucrats to decide the fate of
the land. These groups would sit down at one table and negotiate with the
power to make decisions themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Rey dismisses environmentalists' concerns that passing authority to
local groups will result in exploitation of resources belonging to all
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   As evidence that charter forests are possible, advocates point to an
accommodation reached in 1993 between environmentalists and farmers over
Henry's Fork Basin in Idaho and Wyoming. The two sides stopped fighting
and agreed to protect fish habitats and let farmers irrigate and
livestock graze.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe most Westerners really do have a deep sense of care for
landscapes that surround them, and they also have a deep sense of care
for the ways of life that have grown up on them," said Dan Kemmis, former
Democratic mayor of Missoula, Mont., and director of the Center for the
Rocky Mountain West at the University of Montana. "Through collaborative
efforts they've developed the capacity to protect both economic and
environmental interests."</TE>

<LD>This land of sunshine and pineapples has some of the lowest speed
limits in the nation, and Hawaiian drivers have long felt free to violate
them without fear of getting caught.</LD>
<LD>   That changed dramatically in January, when the state began issuing
speeding tickets through the mail, based on pictures taken of the alleged
violators by digital cameras hidden in unmarked vans.</LD>
<LD>   The program has provoked a political backlash that's loud, angry and
very un-Hawaiian.</LD>
<TE>   Dubbed "tele-vans" by angry motorists, a play on "Taliban," the vans
and their cameras are seen as a dastardly breach of the aloha spirit of
tolerance and reasonableness.</TE>
<TE>   "Being sneaky and fining people for doing something that isn't hurting
anybody is not aloha," fumes George Chai, a chef at a Waikiki restaurant
whose wife was tagged for speeding.</TE>
<TE>   Use of cameras to enforce traffic laws is controversial in numerous
Mainland cities, but the flap here has a Hawaiian flavor borne of the
islands' unique history.</TE>
<TE>   The low speed limits on Honolulu streets and highways are a holdover
from the days before statehood, when many roads were but meandering paths
through pineapple fields.</TE>
<TE>   With an infusion of federal funds, the roads have been greatly
expanded and modernized, but the go-slow concept of speed limits is
unchanged since the mid-1930s. Only a few miles of highway have a limit
as high as 55 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Where else but in Hawaii would a six-lane thoroughfare--the
Kalaniana'ole Highway--have a posted limit of 35 mph?</TE>
<TE>   Bumper stickers advise, "Slow down! This ain't the Mainland."</TE>
<TE>   Faced with what they feel are unrealistic limits, Hawaiian drivers
have developed a tendency to view speed-limit signs as advisory, not
mandatory. Chronically understaffed, the Honolulu Police Department
occasionally cracks down on speeders but concedes traffic is not a
day-to-day priority.</TE>
<TE>   To correct this laissez-fare approach, the state signed a contract
with Dallas-based Affiliated Computer Services Inc. to run a three-year
pilot program.</TE>
<TE>   The firm gets a slice of each ticket paid. When a motorist is fined
$77 for going 55 mph in a 45-mph zone, for example, Affiliated Computer
gets $29.25.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaiians accuse the firm of working on a bounty system. That feeling
increased when news surfaced that some tickets were for driving only 6
mph over the posted limit.</TE>
<TE>   A judge recently ruled that no ticket could be issued unless the
driver was going at least 9 mph over the limit, which the jurist said has
been the unofficial rule used by the Honolulu police.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Minaai, director of the state Department of Transportation, said
many of the tickets are for drivers going 75 mph to 85 mph in zones where
the limit is 45 mph or 50 mph. One driver was going 90 mph on the winding
Pali Highway through the mountains that separate Honolulu from the
Windward Side.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who drives 85% or 100% above the posted limit is a threat to
everybody else on the road," Minaai said.</TE>
<TE>   Tourists are not exempt. Many are returning home to find tickets
forwarded to them by rental car agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Honolulu resident Gene Fukushima, a naval architect, learned that a
reporter taking the same flight from Los Angeles was asking questions
about the camera vans. He passed a note up the aisle with his views.</TE>
<TE>   Like a lot of Hawaiians, he believes the program is a way for a
company to make money and the government to fatten its coffers with
safety only a secondary concern. "[I] question the true motives of those
in charge," Fukushima wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In most cities where cameras are used, the local police are boosters.
Not in Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   The police officers union is opposed and the police department is
neutral. Officers once supplemented their salaries--some of the lowest in
the nation--with overtime pay for doing traffic enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   When a Honolulu cop ticketed one of the camera vans for speeding,
radio disc jockeys went ballistic with joy.</TE>
<TE>   Some radio stations specialize in "camera van alerts," providing
updated intelligence on where the vans are parked. Motorists are buying
plastic license plate holders to make their plates unreadable by the
cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys have had several dozen tickets thrown out of court on
technicalities, including the lack of an assurance on the ticket that the
camera operator was properly trained. The state has printed a new batch
of tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Michael Kam thinks part of the reaction is related to the
beating Hawaii's tourist economy has taken since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "People here are mostly laid back, but these are bad times for
Hawaii," Kam said. "People are losing their jobs, taking two to three
jobs to survive. The van-cams just increased the stress on everybody."</TE>
<TE>   The state Legislature is split. Gov. Ben Cayetano and the legislator
heading the transportation committee are of the "mend it, don't end it"
philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   But another key legislator is thinking of withdrawing his support. He
received a ticket in the mail that he says is unfair because he was not
driving his car that day.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, the registered owner of the car is presumed to be the
driver. The owner has to prove to a judge that it was someone else,
although the method for doing that is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Minaai said he continues to believe the program will mean fewer
speeders and traffic fatalities. Hawaii has about 100 traffic fatalities
a year.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen people have been killed in racing incidents on Oahu since
1995. A pending bill would confiscate the car of anyone caught racing.</TE>
<TE>   One court challenge to the cameras asserts that the laser technology
used to calibrate speed is flawed; another claims that the brilliant
Hawaiian sunshine puts a glare on windshields and makes it impossible to
determine the driver's identity.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Bakke, one of the island's top criminal defense attorneys,
started taking ticket cases after his wife got two tickets on the
Likelike Highway. Cars traveling to Honolulu pick up speed as they go
through a tunnel, and the highway begins a sharp drop in elevation.</TE>
<TE>   "I said I better get involved or it's going to cost me a fortune,"
Bakke said. "Everybody is involved here. This is the worst thing to hit
Hawaii since Pearl Harbor."</TE>

<HD>S.C. Boycott by NAACP Hits Road</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FORT MILL, S.C.
</DL>
<LD>Travelers driving into South Carolina on Saturday were met by
protesters waving yellow signs telling them to take their money elsewhere
as the battle over the Confederate battle flag hit the state's borders.</LD>
<LD>   The protests are the latest push in an NAACP boycott of South Carolina
that was launched two years ago over a Confederate flag that flew atop
the Statehouse dome.</LD>
<LD>   The Legislature eventually agreed to bring the flag down, but in a
compromise, it raised another at a Confederate monument on the Statehouse
grounds. The compromise satisfied some groups, but the National Assn. for
the Advancement of Colored People says the Confederate flag now flying is
still on state-owned property and must go.</LD>
<TE>   "We will continue until the Confederate swastika is removed from a
position of sovereignty on state property," the Rev. Charles White Jr.,
director of the NAACP's southeast regional office, said Saturday at a
welcome center just south of Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   The message is simply "not to shop, not to stop until the flag drops,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   While about 20 members of the civil rights organization flashed signs
outside the welcome center, two members of the Carolina Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan greeted travelers inside. The Klansmen left after state
authorities asked them not to distribute material inside the building.</TE>
<TE>   Some who stopped also disagreed with the NAACP's message.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a symbol of pride, of courage," said Rickey Rutherford, of Fort
Mill. "That's our heritage--white people's heritage."</TE>
<TE>   But Rebecca Feind, of Harrisonburg, Va., said she planned to follow
the boycott and agreed with the flag complaint. "It's offensive to many
people . . . and shouldn't fly on the Statehouse grounds."</TE>
<TE>   State Atty. Gen. Charlie Condon, a Republican candidate for governor,
has threatened to sue over the boycott, saying the welcome center
protests are illegal because their aim is to harm someone else's business
and because the centers are nonpublic forums for greeting visitors.</TE>
<TE>   "In the minds of all reasonable people, the Confederate flag
controversy was resolved," Condon said. Gov. Jim Hodges has also said the
controversy ended when the flag came down from the Capitol dome, where it
had been flown for 38 years.</TE>
<TE>   The NAACP says the protests are legally protected, and the state
tourism department that runs the centers said it has no plans to take
action against the protests.</TE>

<DL>CUMBERLAND, Md.
</DL>
<LD>At the YMCA in this northern outpost of Appalachia is a rarity: a
federal social program that President Bush wants to beef up.</LD>
<LD>   A group of teens and preteens is gathered in a windowless cinder-block
room playing a game called "basket of consequences."</LD>
<LD>   A boy whose flattop looks like freshly mowed grass reaches into a
basket, pulls out a plastic egg, cracks it open and takes out a picture
of a ghost. The ghost represents death, the middle-school student says,
adding that you can die of AIDS if you have sex.</LD>
<TE>   "Good," the instructor says, as she pushes the lesson one step
further. "How about: A ghost can haunt you, and you can be haunted by
decisions you make that might seem good to you right now but aren't--like
having sex or drinking or taking drugs?"</TE>
<TE>   In a budget tight for almost everything but defense and homeland
security, Bush has asked Congress for $135 million next year--a 30%
increase--to encourage teens to abstain from sex as their only form of
birth control.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for federal money, local programs must deliver a very
strict message of abstinence, one that omits any guidance regarding birth
control. During the 1996 overhaul of federal welfare programs, Congress
said abstinence programs were supposed to focus exclusively on the
"social, psychological and health gains" to be realized from avoiding
premarital sex.</TE>
<TE>   "We never discuss where to get birth control or anything like that. We
can't," said Kelli Lehew, who teaches the curriculum at the Cumberland
YMCA. "We do tell them that birth control is ineffective and that at
least three types of sexually transmitted diseases can get through
condoms."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of teaching abstinence to the exclusion of other forms of
sex education goes to the core of deeply held moral values and a
long-standing dispute concerning Washington's proper role in guiding
people's most intimate decisions. The White House push for
abstinence-only funds angers proponents of comprehensive sex education,
who criticize it as unduly prescriptive and not very effective.</TE>
<TE>   California, alone among the states, has gone so far as to turn back
federal funds for abstinence-only programs. State lawmakers, led by
Democrats, cited concerns that the state's own abstinence-only program
did not work.</TE>
<TE>   But advocates of the program say that diluting the abstinence message
destroys it. Claude Allen, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services
in Washington, put it this way:</TE>
<TE>   "If I have a shiny new Lamborghini parked in the driveway with the
keys on the hall table and I say to my son, 'I don't want you to drive
that car until you are older,' and then I say, 'But if you do drive it,
please wear a seat belt,' what do you think he will do? That's a mixed
message."</TE>
<TE>   The debate is heating up at a time when teenage birth rates are down:
48.7 births per 1,000 females ages 15 to 19 in 2000, from a recent high
of 62.1 births in 1991. Still, the U.S. rates remain higher than for any
other industrialized nation.</TE>
<TE>   While the cause of that decline is in disagreement, experts cite a few
possible explanations, including more conservative social attitudes in
the 1990s and increased fear of sexually transmitted diseases. Appeals to
sexual abstinence and the political message of personal responsibility,
embodied by welfare reform, may have helped too, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Brown, director of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
Pregnancy, says it's futile to ask whether abstinence or contraception
was responsible. Birth rates fell 22% in the 1990s, she said, "because of
both--less sex and more contraception."</TE>
<TE>   In a recent letter to Bush, 71 national organizations asked him to
retract his request for more abstinence-only funds. The organizations
instead embrace what they call "abstinence plus," which urges delaying
sexual activity but also educates students about contraceptives and their
role in preventing sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the abstinence-plus plan argue that an abstinence-only
message may harm rather than help teens. They cite research suggesting
that teenagers who have taken "virginity pledges" may be more likely to
skip birth control if they ultimately do engage in premarital sex.</TE>
<TE>   And there also is concern that teaching students that condoms cannot
protect against all diseases obscures their effective use in limiting the
spread of AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   "Abstinence is the best choice. It's choice No. 1, 2 and 3," Brown
said. Still, she maintained, it is a mistake to overlook young people who
will ignore the message.</TE>
<TE>   Recent comments by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell in support of
condom use were in line with this approach, but they sparked an outcry
among social conservatives. The Family Research Council branded Powell's
remarks "reckless and irresponsible." White House officials responded
that the president believes both strategies have benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials, however, were displeased when recently
departed Surgeon General David Satcher spoke out harshly last year
against excluding instruction about birth control from sex education. The
White House refused to back Satcher's report on the nation's sexual
health.</TE>
<TE>   But Satcher's support for informing students about birth control is
supported by a majority of parents. A national survey in 2000 by the
Kaiser Family Foundation found that nearly two-thirds of parents believed
sex education should teach that "young people should wait to have sex,
but if they don't, they should use birth control and practice safer sex."
One-third of those surveyed said abstinence until marriage was the only
option that should be presented.</TE>
<TE>   Abstinence-only supporters such as Robert Rector, a scholar at the
conservative Heritage Foundation who has been highly influential in the
movement, says the concept of "safe sex" gives youths a false sense of
security. The Bush proposal, Rector and others say, is merely an attempt
to get spending for abstinence on an equal footing with other programs
that may include birth control planning.</TE>
<TE>   Rector said most parents were "never comfortable with programs that
promoted contraception. I think most parents do not want their children
to be sexually active, and they're very happy for the government to come
in and reaffirm that message."</TE>
<TE>   Allen, the deputy HHS secretary whose office wall bears an
abstinence-only poster from his days as Virginia's secretary of health
and human resources, said he had no doubt that research supported the
effectiveness of programs that followed the rules laid out by Congress
when welfare was reformed.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time--as Congress sees fit--that we need to try another
message," Allen said. "In the end, the point is: What does the science
say about this? I think it shows that it is working."</TE>
<TE>   Jody Levin-Epstein, senior policy analyst at the Center for Law and
Social Policy--a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping the poor,
said she expects "a contentious debate" on the subject, which may flare
up when Congress reviews welfare policy in the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   At the Cumberland YMCA, where three-fourths of the students enrolled
in after-school programs rely on financial aid, the $250,000 grant
received under Bush's community-based initiatives last year has helped
bring the abstinence-only message to more than 1,200 young people.</TE>
<TE>   Officials there say they would like to do more.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope to be able to go to the public schools with this program
soon," instructor Lehew said. "I believe this message really works."</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>A late-winter storm cruising through the Midwest snarled airport
traffic Saturday and threatened to dump an additional 5 to 10 inches of
snow on cities already digging out from as much as half a foot.</LD>
<LD>   The snow started falling Friday night, moving through Kansas,
Oklahoma, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and Michigan, and was lingering
Saturday in the Midwest. Chicago and Des Moines each have about 6 inches
of snow on the ground.</LD>
<LD>   "This is one of the most significant storms of the winter season,"
said Oliver Lucia, a staff meteorologist at Weather Services Corp.</LD>
<TE>   The storm breaks a spell of record warm winter weather and is only the
second big snow of the season for the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   Three to 10 inches of snow were expected to fall Saturday in parts of
Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin and Missouri, with the heaviest
snowfall forecast for northeastern Iowa and northern Michigan, according
to data from Weather Services Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The slushy snow seen in Chicago gummed up traffic at O'Hare
International Airport, where arriving planes were delayed an average of
38 minutes, but some encountered delays of more than four hours,
according to the Federal Aviation Administration.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 flights at O'Hare were canceled because of the weather,
local television reports said.</TE>
<TE>   Accumulations could top 12 inches by the time the snow has stopped in
Chicago, local forecasters said. Primary roads around the city were
clear.</TE>

<PH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</PH>
<KH>COMEDY REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Riordan Has Audience Laughing, Groaning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>In the order of things Friday night at the McKenna Theatre on the
campus of San Francisco State University, comedian Richard Riordan was
sandwiched between Brett Butler, the former star of the ABC sitcom "Grace
Under Fire," and Steve Dacri, a magician billed as "direct from Caesars
Palace."</LD>
<LD>   Riordan was direct from the campaign trail, which has only gotten
rockier as the Tuesday primary nears. As a result, his decision to make
room for a two-night stand-up comedy engagement on the last weekend of
the race--and to work on an act in the bargain--seemed almost
"Bulworth"-ian: What was he doing, sharing a bill with "The Karate Kid's"
Pat Morita, Carl "The Great Ballantine" Ballantine, and hotelier-talk
show impresario Merv Griffin, when there were precious votes out there to
woo and opponents to criticize?</LD>
<LD>   Of course, there were television crews on hand, and the audience,
conditioned to appreciate politicians who labor through jokes to expose
their humanity, greeted each one-liner appreciatively.</LD>
<TE>   Purists might see the spectacle as more evidence that politicians are
co-opting comedy, leveraging an art form once used to expose them. In the
2000 presidential race, candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore stumped on
"Saturday Night Live" and the late-night talk shows, and Bob Dole became
a part of Comedy Central's "The Daily Show."</TE>
<TE>   And now, here were the comedy stylings of Riordan. "Gov. Gray Davis
has been destroying this state for the last four years," he said. "Now
it's my turn."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said he had long ago committed to the event, an annual
fund-raiser for the college's athletics department, emceed by his friend,
comedian and San Francisco State alumnus Ronnie Schell, who calls the
evening "Veterans of Comedy Wars: A North Beach Reunion," a reference to
the San Francisco neighborhood where many comedians built their following
in the 1950s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   As for Riordan, maybe the maverick multimillionaire was just doing
what he wanted, refusing to betray concerns that a primary race he once
owned appeared to be slipping away.</TE>
<TE>   But there was something else at work, too, it seemed: Riordan's yen
for Borscht Belt comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Schell and Riordan are cronies in a klatch of comedians, comedic
actors and writers called Yarmy's Army, a group whose ranks include Bill
Dana, Harvey Korman, Shelley Berman and Tom Poston.</TE>
<TE>   They have put on benefits and meet regularly at Jerry's Deli in
Westwood, where they sit in a big room and trade insults, stories and
jokes over pastrami on rye and matzo ball soup. The group is named after
the late Dick Yarmy, the comic actor whose struggle with cancer prompted
the group's initial gatherings.</TE>
<TE>   There's a comforting relentlessness in their vaudevillian approach, an
appreciation of a less cynical time in comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said he had written half of his act, including "all of the
Viagra [jokes]" (Like this one: "If Viagra works so well, why isn't
Elizabeth Dole the spokesperson?")</TE>
<TE>   And so, while Riordan might have been expected to deliver a few
one-liners and then head back off into the night Friday, he evidently
intended to work up a little stage sweat, in his campaign-issue suit and
tie.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, the act involved Schell prompting him with set-ups and Riordan
responding stiffly, as if going over talking points. Schell: "You know, I
hope you've enjoyed the wonderful weather we've had here in San
Francisco. You know, it's been very warm, it's not like. . ."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan: "The last time I was here it was so cold. . ."</TE>
<TE>   Schell: "It was so cold, what?"</TE>
<TE>   Riordan: "Even the lawyers had their hands in their own pockets."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd groaned a little.</TE>
<TE>   Schell: "How cold was it?"</TE>
<TE>   Riordan: "It was so cold, if you wanted to meet a Jehovah's Witness,
you had to go knock on his door."</TE>
<TE>   Schell: "How cold was it?"</TE>
<TE>   Riordan: "It was so cold that flashers in Golden Gate Park were just
describing themselves."</TE>
<TE>   "Or just describing themselves," Schell offered.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, while the intentionally bad Great Ballantine made the whole
audience disappear by blindfolding himself, Riordan held forth out in the
lobby with reporters on his campaign trail.</TE>
<TE>   He talked about negative ads and Bill Simon Jr., and then he also
talked about comedy. Bob Dole, he said, had the best timing in politics.
"Timing is everything, as you know," Riordan said. "Particularly, I
think, non-sequiturs work sometimes better than sequiturs if you have the
right timing.</TE>
<TE>   "They say the secret to good writing is to discard your darlings," he
continued. "You know what that means? It means throwing away your best
lines."</TE>
<TE>   "You're not worried people will think your campaign is ending on a
joke?" a reporter later ventured.</TE>
<TE>   Tough crowd.</TE>

<HD>Bush Chided Over Drug Aid Plan</HD>
<DH>Health: Democrat says the president hasn't lived up to his promises
to older Americans about prescription coverage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush has not done enough to ensure that all older
Americans receive enough money to cover the expensive prescription drugs
so many must purchase, a Democratic senator said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   In his party's weekly radio address, Sen. John D. "Jay" Rockefeller IV
of West Virginia said Bush promised money for all seniors while a
candidate.</LD>
<LD>   He hasn't made good, Rockefeller said.</LD>
<TE>   "When President Bush submitted his budget last month, he backed away
from that commitment to provide coverage to all seniors," Rockefeller
said. "Even though costs are rising, President Bush proposed even less
funding for prescription drugs than Congress approved last year."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is touting its revised plan to promote private
drug discount cards as a much-needed step toward helping seniors save
money on prescriptions.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, unveiled this week, encourages older Americans to buy
discount cards from private companies by giving some cards what amounts
to a government seal of approval. After paying a onetime enrollment
fee--not more than $25--senior citizens could get discounts of up to 15%
on some medicines, White House officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But Rockefeller said the plan won't help enough seniors and that many
wouldn't realize significant savings.</TE>
<TE>   "Prescription drug costs are climbing almost 20% a year, five times
the rate of inflation," he said. "Even more outrageous, Americans pay an
average of almost twice as much for the same prescription drug medication
as people pay in other countries."</TE>

<HD>Bush Promises Effort to Recruit, Train Teachers</HD>
<DH>Education: The White House plans to feature reform proposals over
the next few weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush pledged Saturday to work to enlist a new generation
of well-trained teachers to help America's children succeed in school and
beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Highlighting his education agenda, Bush said in his weekly radio
address: "The effectiveness of all education reform eventually comes down
to a good teacher in a classroom.</LD>
<LD>   "In our new era of education reform, we're asking a lot of our
teachers, and we owe them something in return," the president said. "We
must treat them as the professionals they are. We must give them our
respect and support.</LD>
<TE>   "A good teacher can literally make a lifelong difference."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said that America will need 2 million new teachers over the next
decade and that the budget he approved for this year includes nearly $3
billion for teacher training, recruiting and hiring. That is an increase
of more than 35% over the previous year's budget, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of the Senate education
committee, said Bush's budget "cuts the very programs that recruit new
teachers, improve teacher quality and reduce class size."</TE>
<TE>   "Our teachers need real help, not empty words," Kennedy (D-Mass.) said
in a statement in which he described Bush's education budget as "a severe
blow to our public schools."</TE>
<TE>   Bush will focus on teacher recruitment during a trip Monday to
Minnesota, and he intends to feature efforts to improve public school
education in a series of events over the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Aides say they are frustrated that Bush has not received more credit
and attention for signing a landmark education overhaul bill that
stressed school accountability.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush education plan requires schools to test student achievement,
monitor teacher quality and close the gap between poor and middle-income
students--and white and minority students.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has asked Congress to expand programs that recruit math, science
and special-education teachers by forgiving part of their college loans
in exchange for a commitment to teach in poor neighborhoods for at least
five years. He also wants to make it easier for people who have been
successful in other fields to become teachers.</TE>
<TE>   But he noted that a high percentage of teachers say they feel
ill-prepared for their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll focus on teacher training efforts where the need is
greatest--in early childhood education, special education, math, science
and reading instruction," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   Through a reading program, Bush said, "we are placing a new emphasis
on the most basic of skills, and many of our teachers will need training
in the best and proven methods of reading instruction."</TE>
<TE>   Bush was spending the weekend at the presidential retreat at Camp
David in western Maryland. He had his daily intelligence briefing before
being visited by his dentist Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The president and First Lady Laura Bush planned to attend the annual
fund-raising gala at Ford's Theatre tonight.</TE>

<HD>Plumbing Glitch Won't Stop Shuttle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>NASA gave the shuttle Columbia astronauts permission Saturday to
proceed with their full mission to renovate the Hubble Space Telescope
despite clogged plumbing on their ship.</LD>
<LD>   Optimism had been growing throughout the day, aboard Columbia and
inside Mission Control, that the 11-day Hubble servicing mission would
remain on track despite a problem with a radiator line used to shed heat
from shuttle electronics. The trouble had threatened to cut short the
flight.</LD>
<LD>   Debris in the line, possibly left from a welding job during Columbia's
recent overhaul, resulted in a violation of flight safety rules during
Friday's launch.</LD>
<TE>   But mission director Phil Engelauf emphasized that engineers had
become more comfortable with the reduced flow of Freon in the line and
that it would be sufficient for handling the increased heat load from
shuttle systems during landing.</TE>
<TE>   The final decision by mission managers came late in the afternoon as
the seven astronauts slept. It means the crew can press forward with
today's rendezvous with Hubble and five days of spacewalks to improve the
telescope's electrical and scientific output.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia's commander, Scott Altman, said earlier in the day that he
and his crew were "charging ahead full speed with our eyes on the goal,"
regardless of what the outcome might be.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, we've gone on the assumption that we're here to stay,
that we're going to do our job, and we've just kind of kept that thought
foremost in our minds," he said in an interview with Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   The cooling system problem arose moments after Columbia reached orbit.
The flow of Freon in one of two coolant loops dropped drastically and
even dipped a little below the safety limit. Once the shuttle's payload
bay doors were opened, exposing large radiators that dispel heat, the
cooling problem was eased for the time being, Engelauf said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Deploys Sensors to Detect Nuclear Materials</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Alarmed by growing hints of Al Qaeda's progress toward obtaining a
nuclear or radiological weapon, the Bush administration has deployed
hundreds of sophisticated sensors since November to U.S. borders,
overseas facilities and choke points around Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Officials have placed the Delta Force, the nation's elite commando
unit, on a new standby alert to seize control of nuclear materials that
the sensors may detect.</LD>
<LD>   Ordinary Geiger counters, worn on belt clips and resembling pagers,
have been in use by the U.S. Customs Service for years. The newer devices
are called gamma ray and neutron flux detectors.</LD>
<TE>   Until now they were carried only by mobile Nuclear Emergency Search
Teams dispatched when extortionists claimed to have radioactive
materials. Because terrorists would give no such warning, and because
NEST scientists are unequipped for combat, the Delta Force has been
assigned to kill or disable anyone with a suspected nuclear device and
turn it over to the scientists to be disarmed.</TE>
<TE>   The new radiation sensors are placed in layers around fixed objects
and are temporarily put at certain "national security special events,"
such as last month's Winter Olympic Games in Utah. Allied countries,
including Saudi Arabia, have also rushed new detectors to their borders
after American intelligence warnings. To address the technological limits
of even the best current sensors, the Bush administration has ordered a
crash program to build better devices at the three national nuclear
laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   These steps are among several other signs, described in recent
interviews with U.S. government policymakers, that the administration's
nuclear anxieties have intensified since U.S.-backed forces began
fighting Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and its Taliban backers in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly . . . the sense of urgency has gone up," said a senior
government policymaker on nuclear, biological and chemical terrorism.
Another high-ranking official said, "The more you gather information, the
more our concerns increased about Al Qaeda's focus on weapons of mass
destruction of all kinds."</TE>
<TE>   In "tabletop exercises" conducted as high as Cabinet level, President
Bush's national security team has highlighted difficult choices Bush
would face if the new sensors detect radiation on a boat steaming up the
Potomac River or a truck heading for the capital on Interstate 95.</TE>
<TE>   Participants in those exercises said gaps in their knowledge are
considerable. But the intelligence community, they said, believes that Al
Qaeda could already control a stolen Soviet-era tactical nuclear warhead
or enough weapon-grade material to fashion a functioning, if less
efficient, atomic bomb. Even before more recent discoveries, some
analysts regarded that prospect as substantial.</TE>
<TE>   Some expressed that view when the intelligence community devoted a
full-day retreat to the subject early last year in Chantilly, Va., said
someone with firsthand knowledge. A majority of those present assessed
the likelihood as negligible, but none of the more than 50 participants
