<DH>Music* Opera, bel canto, show tunes, jazz: Renee Fleming
somehow finds the time and energy to perform and record on two
continents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BLUM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The last time Renee Fleming was to sing in "Il Pirata" in the United
States, she was so nervous she was desperately hoping she wouldn't
have to go on.</LD>
<LD>   Fleming was the cover singer for Aprile Millo, who was getting
ready for a 1989 concert performance as Imogene, the starring role,
at Carnegie Hall with Eve Queler's Opera Orchestra of New York.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd be bringing her tea, telling her, 'Stay healthy, please!' "
Fleming recalls.</LD>
<TE>   Now, Fleming stars in the Metropolitan Opera's first production of
Bellini's "Il Pirata," starting Oct. 21. It's part of another busy
season for America's peripatetic diva, who sang Desdemona in Verdi's
"Otello" at the Met's opening gala Sept. 23.</TE>
<TE>   After "Il Pirata," she's off to the Lyric Opera of Chicago for her
first staged performances in Massenet's "Thais" and to the Houston
Grand Opera for her first Violetta in Verdi's "La Traviata."</TE>
<TE>   She has a new solo recording, "Bel Canto," and is trying to get
Ann Patchett's novel of the same name made into a movie. She's just
finished a recording of show tunes with Bryn Terfel and plans to
record her first jazz album.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, and the 42-year-old soprano is raising two daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she's expected to be perfect--and glamorous--at all times.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel the sense of expectation the public has for my work,"
Fleming said.</TE>
<TE>   The bel canto repertoire--the so-called "beautiful singing" often
filled with ornamentation--would seem an unusual choice for a lyric
soprano who became a star in the early 1990s for her work in Strauss
and Mozart.</TE>
<TE>   Fleming has sung Bellini's "La Straniera" and "La Sonnambula," had
an infamous night at Milan's Teatro alla Scala in 1998 when an
anti-American clique booed her in Donizetti's "Lucrezia Borgia," has
sung Donizetti's "Maria Padilla" and Rossini's "Armida," and has
recorded Donizetti's "Rosamonda d'Inghilterra."</TE>
<TE>   Imogene, who has one of opera's great "mad scenes," will be her
most high-profile bel canto role to date.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like the repertoire. People really love it," she said.
"There's so much pathos. When the music is at its best, it's a pure
expression of emotion, loss, longing."</TE>
<TE>   Her big, silvery voice has no trouble with the coloratura in these
works. Some criticize her exaggerated phrasing in spots, but it seems
to fit, and her "Bel Canto" recording on Decca is one of the season's
top releases.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for bel canto work, she listened to recordings by Maria
Callas, Montserrat Caballe, Beverly Sills and Joan Sutherland.</TE>
<TE>   She performed "Il Pirata" in Paris earlier this year. In New York,
the cast also includes tenor Marcello Giordani and baritone Dwayne
Croft.</TE>
<TE>   After singing bel canto, Fleming may act in "Bel Canto," the movie
version.</TE>
<TE>   Patchett, whose novel won the PEN/Faulkner award, patterned the
character of soprano Roxanne Coss after Fleming, without ever
speaking with her.</TE>
<TE>   Last October, they finally met in the canteen at the Metropolitan
Opera, when Patchett was visiting New York, but she still hasn't seen
Fleming perform.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not sitting around saying, 'I'm going to make this person
into Renee,' " Patchett said from her home in Nashville. "I was
listening to Renee's music, but I had never seen her other than the
little picture on the CD packaging. It's uncanny, because ... there
are so many similarities between Roxanne and Renee. But they were
accidental other than power and passion.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the character is so merged in my mind that I think it is
Renee."</TE>
<TE>   Caroline Baron, producer of "Monsoon Wedding," has taken on the
project, and Fleming hopes to star in it.</TE>
<TE>   Only the first part of Fleming's season is dominated by bel canto.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Hampson, which whom she recorded "Thais," will also appear
with her in the Chicago production, which opens Dec. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Although she originally was to have sung Violetta at the Met in
1998 as the replacement for Angela Gheorghiu, she postponed that role
for five years, finally agreeing to take it on in Houston starting
April 17. She's to sing it at the Met for the first time on opening
night of the 2003-04 season.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Fleming went to Wales to record with Terfel a CD that
will include "Not While I'm Around" from "Sweeney Todd," "So in Love"
from "Kiss Me Kate," "All I Ask of You" from "The Phantom of the
Opera" and other show tunes.</TE>
<TE>   She can't wait to get back to Europe, where she spends late spring
and much of the summer. She bought an apartment in Paris, which she
can finally use after a lengthy renovation, and she's starting to
like urban life so much that she's thinking about moving with her
family from suburban Connecticut to Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy there," she said of Paris. "I live well. I eat
well."</TE>

<HD>William Hall Master Chorale Bids Memorable Goodbye to Its
Creator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few artists are astute enough or lucky enough to step away from their
careers at the peak of their powers. Vocal conductor William Hall is
one of these.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday night, Hall bid farewell to his eponymous ensemble, the
William Hall Master Chorale, and to Segerstrom Hall at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center, which the chorale has called home
since its opening in 1986. Hall founded the ensemble in 1956; in
1989, it merged with the Orange County Master Chorale.</LD>
<LD>   It was an auspicious night but not one fraught with tears or false
emotion. Conductor Hall, a vigorous 68, will continue as the dean of
music at Chapman University in Orange, and the ensemble is also
expected to find a home there, although its name, exact form and
leadership have not yet been announced.</LD>
<TE>   The Sunday concert treated the milestone appropriately, with a
resplendent, memorable performance of the Verdi Requiem.</TE>
<TE>   For the occasion, the chorale was enlarged by the Chapman
University Choir plus an Alumni Choir to 296 singers and accompanied
by the Chorale Orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   The choral singing achieved the technical superiority and
spiritual projection always hoped for in this masterpiece. The
dynamic range--from ethereal but solid pianissimos to potent
volume--took one's breath away; the clarity of the words and the
chorale's ability to communicate its meaning was awesome.</TE>
<TE>   The Requiem contains many special moments. No composer puts the
fear of God into an atheist more powerfully than Verdi. In the
opening movement, for example, the mode changes from minor to major
on the entrance of the tenor soloist, and the shift is poignant in
its Schubertian transformation; it can bring tears to the eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Conductor Hall and his colleagues delivered that moment
effortlessly, and without any grandstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Many conductors speed through the Sanctus, trying to make it a
display of vocal and instrumental virtuosity. Hall found its
exhilaration without passing the speed limit of Allegro. He showed
similar mastery in the "Libera me" finale, which achieved drama
without frenzy, seriousness without overstatement.</TE>
<TE>   The four vocal soloists are all graduates of Chapman University
with international and operatic credits. Basso Louis Lebherz
dominated the proceedings with a beautiful sound and powerful word
delivery. Mezzo-soprano Catherine Stoltz handsomely identified
meaning through her clear and authoritative singing. Tenor Robert
MacNeil made all his lines ring solidly. Soprano Kathryn Carpenter
delivered a wonderful high C near the end but seemed to lack the
temperament the rest of the "Libera me" demands.</TE>

<HD>Vibrations Better Than Good at Wilson Benefit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's not much missing from "Good Vibrations," Brian Wilson's 1966
Beach Boys masterpiece that took six months, miles of tape and an
everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to realize.</LD>
<LD>   But it turns out that the song can stand the addition of one more
thing: some blues guitar licks.</LD>
<LD>   At least it can if the person providing the licks is Eric Clapton.
The English guitarist joined Wilson and his band on that song Sunday
at UCLA's Royce Hall, and though "Vibrations" is about as un-blues as
you can get, Clapton, with typical grace, slid in subtly here and
there. At the closing coda, with its warbling electronic oscillation,
though, he let fly with some rich, stinging runs that transformed the
music briefly but remarkably.</LD>
<TE>   It was an unlikely payoff of a new friendship between Clapton and
Wilson, which began at the Buckingham Palace concert for Queen
Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee in June. And it was one of many
sparkling moments of Sunday's fifth annual benefit for the Carl
Wilson Foundation, Wilson's brother and Beach Boys co-founder who
died of lung cancer in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Clapton--who was backed by Wilson's band on "Stormy Monday" and
"Layla," and also joined Wilson during his headlining set for the
lovely "Warmth of the Sun"--found himself in the middle of a family
affair. The evening began with two songs by In Bloom, a trio
featuring Carl's son Justyn as well as Carl B. Wilson, son of the
third Beach Boy brother, Dennis, who died in 1983. The group
suggested a Nirvana with sand between its toes. Brian's daughters
Carnie and Wendy also did two songs and sat in with dad on a
transcendently gorgeous "God Only Knows."</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Wilson collaborator Van Dyke Parks teamed with rocker
Matthew Sweet, and the Wondermints, the L.A. quartet that is part of
Wilson's band, showcased its own, very Wilson-esque "Ride." Onetime
Beach Boy Billy Hinsche contributed as well, trading vocals with
Sweet on "Sail on Sailor." And Sugar Ray, whose bassist Murphy Karges
is the stepbrother of Justyn Wilson and his brother Jonah, were
joined by Carnie and Wendy for the Beach Boys' spunky "Do It Again."</TE>
<TE>   By the time everyone (plus Bill Medley, Jackson Browne and
America's Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell) piled on stage for encores
of "Surfin' U.S.A." and "Fun Fun Fun," Clapton really seemed part of
the family, diggin' those good vibrations.</TE>

<HD>Now It's 'Saturday Night Lame'</HD>
<DH>In its 28th season opener, the sketch comedy show has lost
its edge, relying instead on worn-out formulas that aren't worth
staying up for.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer are gone, but, surprise of
surprises, "Saturday Night Live" came out of the seasonal gate
Saturday looking exactly the same as it has for most of the last
half-dozen years or so: like a tired, bloated icon of the television
and cultural establishments that it began life dedicated to mocking.</LD>
<LD>   Don't believe the latest, entirely predictable hype about a
revival at this breeding ground for a hundred last-choice movie
rentals, no matter what is asserted by the folks who just gave the
NBC warhorse a comedy-writing Emmy over Jon Stewart's "Daily Show"
and David Letterman's "Late Show," no matter what buzz may transfer
to the series' current edition from the artful and fascinating new
oral history "Live from New York."</LD>
<LD>   Just because Tina Fey and Jimmy Fallon are cute and have, indeed,
revivified the "Weekend Update" mock newscast doesn't mean the 80
minutes around them merit talking about by the water cooler on
Monday. "SNL" once held a central place in the nation's living room;
now it's just a battered old couch that's only tolerable for a few
minutes at a time but that nobody quite wants to dump in the alley.</LD>
<TE>   Saturday's meager 28th-season debut--enlivened only by Bruce
Springsteen's songs, Robert Smigel's ever-wicked cartoon and guest
host Matt Damon's virtuoso attempts to pump up a dozen flat
sketches--saw "SNL" sliding into the same sloppy patterns of recent
years. They are patterns the reader can see developing throughout
"Live from New York," which is really, despite all the delicious
drugs and sex and back-stabbing, the chronicle of a de-evolution from
the hatred of formula to its embrace, from challenging an audience to
pandering to it.</TE>
<TE>   There is still the amenable, big-name guest host slapped like duct
tape onto every skit that doesn't feature a stock character and most
of those that do. All credit to Damon for trying to do more than just
go through the motions as the show attached his celebrity to the
automatic milking machine. But with 10 starring and five featured
comic actors this is, or was, or could be, a comic ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   There is still, most damningly, the numbing overreliance on any
character who once earned a chuckle, beasts of television burden
flogged harder than Regis Philbin at the peak of "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire." Only when they appear in a movie, and that movie flops,
it seems, will we see the end of Brian Fellow, Tracy Morgan's
effusive talk-show host with the sixth-grade education; or Sully and
Denise, Fallon and Rachel Dratch's meathead Boston kids; or Donatella
Versace, Maya Rudolph's bored, exhausted Euro-trash fashion
maven-victim.</TE>
<TE>   All have shown flashes of inspiration, especially in the
performances, but their mandatory reappearances after the audience's
first flash of discovery have taken on the feel of Gary Coleman
repeating "Whatchu talkin' 'bout, Willis?" and the sitcom audience
applauding. As longtime writer Jim Downey points out in the book, the
Coneheads appeared only seven times. Now, Downey says, Will Ferrell
and Cheri Oteri's cheerleaders were featured nearly 20 times in
recent years. And they didn't even get a movie out of it.</TE>
<TE>   And there is still--despite its incorporation of women as comic
equals--the junior high boys' locker room fixation on a bodily
orifice used for expulsion, in Saturday's case through a commercial
for an instant meal in (giant) suppository form.</TE>
<TE>   Politics as Usual</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell, a utility man in the Phil Hartman mode who left "SNL"
after seven years because, he has said, it was time to move on,
wasn't particularly missed. As witnessed in, say, the cheerleaders,
he had a talent you could admire without particularly craving more of
it.</TE>
<TE>   He was most noticeably absent in the opening sketch, a war-on-Iraq
piece that instead of Ferrell's President Bush relied on Darrell
Hammond's Vice President Dick Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   The show has won praise for what some see as its sharp political
satire, but that's a tough sell. Yes, the nation's leaders are being
made fun of in the opening segments (their very placement also a
formula), but it tends toward gentle jibes. The show turns
politicians into stock characters too, rather than using them to
express a transgressive point of view.</TE>
<TE>   Having Cheney riding a bomb, "Dr. Strangelove"-style, headed for
Iraq no matter what the United Nations or Congress may think, was a
funny, broad concept, and Hammond infuses the character with a great
demonic ruthlessness. But the individual lines he was given were
barely political, leaning more toward throwaway pop-culture
references to the likes of Anna Nicole and the kid in the Dell
Computer TV ads.</TE>
<TE>   Aiming at Easy Targets</TE>
<TE>   There was a troubling tendency to slap such easy cultural
call-outs into most sketches, as if the rest of the show was trying
to borrow from the mission of "Weekend Update" (solid Saturday, if
not inspired). The first commercial parody, having duck hunters
shooting the AFLAC spokesfowl, was amusing and an accurate reading of
the zeitgeist, but as targets go, it was a sitting duck.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to prescribe a formula for watching "SNL" these days,
because a flash of good material and better performance can appear at
any moment. But if you truly want to see the comedy testing-ground
aspect of it, the thing that initially made this live enterprise so
exciting, then it's probably wise to just watch the last 45 minutes,
when "Update" generally runs, there's a number from the
often-excellent musical guest and the writers get a little bit of a
chance to be inventive.</TE>
<TE>   But even a partial viewing is strictly optional. "Saturday Night
Live" these days is history. So read the book.</TE>

<HD>Feeling Six Feet Tall</HD>
<DH>Patricia Clarkson has spent much of her film career in the
background. But with an Emmy win for her 'Six Feet Under' role, she's
taken the spotlight and will co-star this fall in two buzzed-about
independent films.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN MAYNARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Patricia Clarkson is what's known in the business as an actor's
actor, someone who her friend playwright Richard Greenberg says "has
always been a cult fixture on the New York theater scene" but
relegated to playing the obligatory love interest on film. That's
about to change.</LD>
<LD>   After years of perfecting the wife/girlfriend/appendage opposite
leading men including Kevin Costner ("The Untouchables") and Clint
Eastwood ("The Dead Pool"), the actress finally is coming into her
own. She's got a new boyfriend (actor-director Campbell Scott) she's
too shy to talk about. She just won an Emmy Award (for her role as
freethinking Aunt Sarah on "Six Feet Under") and is working on a
whopping nine film and television projects. And, mind you, all at the
dewy young age of 43.</LD>
<LD>   This fall, she co-stars in two buzzed-about indies. In "Far From
Heaven," Todd Haynes' paean to the '50s melodramas of Douglas Sirk,
she plays Julianne Moore's bigoted Connecticut confidante.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a connection between that character and the women I knew
in the South," says the Louisiana native. "It crosses the Mason-Dixon
line. In high school, we would have to have slumber parties at my
house because some of the white girls' parents would not allow blacks
to sleep in their house. I saw a lot more prejudice there than I care
to remember."</TE>
<TE>   In "Welcome to Collinwood," a remake of the classic Italian heist
film "Big Deal on Madonna Street," Clarkson plays Rosalind, a tough
Cleveland street chick on the skids looking for a piece of the
action. To get into character, she says, all she had to do was slip
on the clothes. "She wore a hideous '70s leather jacket, just
brown-orange horrible, suntanned panty hose and wedgies," Clarkson
says, reducing her voice to a whisper. "And a water bra." Then, after
another smoky-voiced gale of laughter, she adds, "Oh, come on! People
change their hair, why not change your bust size?"</TE>
<TE>   Clarkson loved the all-guy atmosphere of working with actors
George Clooney, Isaiah Washington and especially Sam Rockwell.
"Sammy's like my brother," she says. "I've known him for 13 years."
They met in 1989 in Wilmington, N.C., on different film sets. She was
filming "Tune in Tomorrow" and he was playing a bit part in "Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles." The actors stayed in touch and ended up
neighbors in the West Village, friends long before both their stars
began rising.</TE>
<TE>   "I call Patty when I get stage fright," says Rockwell, who says
Clarkson helped him when he performed "The Zoo Story" and "The Dumb
Waiter" in repertory at last year's Williamstown Theater Festival. "I
call her to calm me down. She helps me through a lot of actor's
stuff," he says. "I would love to do something on stage with her. She
really takes stage, as they say. She knows how to get into it."</TE>
<TE>   Lately, it seems Clarkson has a harder time getting out of
it--commitments, that is--the list of upcoming projects is
impressive. Just in time for November sweeps, she stars in a
revisionist TV remake of "Carrie" in the classic Piper Laurie role as
the Bible-thumping mother from hell. "It's very cinema verite, close
and dark, not sweeping and operatic like" Brian De Palma's, she says.
"But it will inevitably have humor because you can't say, 'I can see
your dirty pillows' without it being funny."</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the film roles, almost all the kind of shoestring
independents in which wardrobe changes take place in gas station
bathrooms. "Dogville," Lars Von Trier's latest wrenching melodrama,
is set in the Rockies circa 1930 and stars Nicole Kidman. All she
will say about that experience is, "I'll be honest with you, there
are moments in this movie where I went through hell." There's also
"All the Real Girls" from experimental filmmaker David Gordon Greene
("George Washington") and a whimsical Canadian fantasy called "The
Baroness and the Pig." Plus three more movies, each coincidentally
featuring one of the kids from "Dawson's Creek." In "Pieces of
April," she plays Katie Holmes' mother who's recovering from a double
mastectomy, and she's in "The Station Agent" opposite Michelle
Williams. In "The Safety of Objects" she plays a lonely neighbor who
beds Joshua Jackson. "All my nieces, I am God to them now," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in the upper-middle class suburbs of New Orleans,
Clarkson grew up in a sprawling, politically liberal family dominated
by women. She's the youngest of five sisters, and mother Jackie
Clarkson is a former real estate agent, current New Orleans city
councilwoman and regular fixture on the society pages of the
Times-Picayune. "She's incredibly gregarious, she coined the word,"
says Clarkson. "She knows people from all backgrounds because that's
how she grew up. And I do love that aspect of acting. I love meeting
new people." The only actor in her family had been her late
grandfather John Patrick Brechtel, a football coach and English
teacher who by night helped run a local repertory called the Algiers'
Little Theater.</TE>
<TE>   But by the time she was 13, Clarkson knew she wanted to follow in
his footsteps. She acted in school plays in her early teens and after
studying speech at Louisiana State University for two years, she
transferred to Fordham University in New Yorkl, where she graduated
summa cum laude with a degree in theater arts. It was at Yale Drama
School where she met classmates who would become lifelong friends,
journeymen actors including Chris Noth and Dylan Baker, and
playwright Greenberg for whom she's appeared in five plays including
"Eastern Standard" and "Three Days of Rain."</TE>
<TE>   At Yale, Clarkson had her pick of roles, complex character leads
in such plays as "Pericles" and "Pacific Overtures." Immediately
after graduation in 1987, she got a plum supporting role as a deaf
actress in John Guare's Broadway play "The House of Blue Leaves." But
like many of her fellow alumni, she was wooed by Hollywood, where she
nabbed the role of Catherine Ness, wife of G-man Elliot Ness (Kevin
Costner) in Brian DePalma's version of the Desilu TV series "The
Untouchables." "Brian took a gamble on me," she says. "There wasn't a
lot to audition with. But I think he liked that I had this somewhat
beatific look but this truck driver voice," and she lets loose a
husky laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, Clarkson got more high-profile film work, but
she was again "the girl" in such roles as Timothy Hutton's fiance in
"Everybody's All-American" and Clint Eastwood's reporter girlfriend
in "The Dead Pool." She continued to work on screen in several
projects including a couple of short-lived series ("Davis Rules,"
"Murder One") and occasional films ("Tune in Tomorrow," "Jumanji").
But none of those roles afforded her the opportunities of the theater
scene in New York where she made her home.</TE>
<TE>   "I was doing these insane, expansive plays for Richard Greenberg
and Nicky Silver, parts that would take me on these journeys," she
says. "I wasn't getting those kinds of offers and opportunities in
Hollywood. I needed something for my soul and spirit."</TE>
<TE>   That something came in the form of a $500,000-budget film called
"High Art." In the film, Clarkson played Greta, a washed-up
ex-Fassbinder film actress who clings to her smack habit as her star
photographer girlfriend (Ally Sheedy) ditches her for a much-younger
art magazine intern (Radha Mitchell). "I was in L.A. and I got this
call about this very small movie," Clarkson says. "So I fly in and I
had to go in the next day to play"--lowering her voice to a
whisper--"a German heroin-addict lesbian. Lesbian I wasn't worried
about. I wasn't one but I didn't know how you play one. What does
that mean? I had never taken any drugs. But I knew this German woman
for a lot of my life so I had that in my ear. And I thought, 'I'll
wing-ding it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Debut director Lisa Cholodenko cast her in the role the next day.
"My jaw dropped," Cholodenko says. "Because she was such a fine
actress, so astonishing. She had the whole snarky German lesbian
thing down without any direction." Despite the film's dark subject
matter, her ruefully funny performance got her an Independent Spirit
Award nomination. It also was a hard role for Clarkson to shake. "I
would just talk to my dog all the time with a German accent," she
says. "And he would wig out, I'd be like [in German accent], 'Bo,
come here!' " Cholodenko concurs: "Yeah, on the set, she didn't want
to switch gears. She just walked around in that creepy German haze
the whole time and we just left her alone."</TE>
<TE>   "That's the big thing about Patty," says pal Richard Greenberg.
"And I think that's one of the reasons her career is blossoming now,
15 years into it. She's always been a deeper talent than you would
have expected. Back when we were out of drama school, the young,
pretty girl existed mostly to prove the guy was straight. Patty
didn't necessarily do that. There's something about her that's more
interesting and perverse and there always has been. She was always
capable of playing fluffy, but she's so not."</TE>
<TE>   Clarkson doesn't claim to know why success has finally found her.
If she's learned one thing from more than 20 years as an actor, it's
to make up her own rules.</TE>
<TE>   "And to think oddly I play hotter parts now then when I was
younger," she says. "For all the bad rep on Hollywood, I don't think
it gives up on women who aren't 25. You might not make a lot of money
and it does become a challenge. But I still think there are great
parts. You just have to look for them."</TE>

<HD>Salute to an Upright Man</HD>
<DH>Jazz* Former bassist John Levy is honored for taking care
of the bottom line for many of the top musicians of the last five
decades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN L. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Levy, the 90-year-old former bass player with George Shearing
who has been managing artists since 1951, was standing before a
crowd, preparing to say something about his life's work.</LD>
<LD>   He was in his musical prime during a revolution in jazz centered
on New York's famed 52nd Street. Duke Ellington wanted him to join
his orchestra, and Billie Holiday hired him for her comeback concert
at Carnegie Hall in 1948.</LD>
<LD>   Then he put away his upright, became an artist manager and, over
the years, had a rich stable of clients: Dakota Staton, Betty Carter,
Lou Donaldson, Herbie Mann, Les McCann, Ernie Andrews, Randy
Crawford, Brook Benton, Ahmad Jamal, Freddie Hubbard, Cannonball
Adderley, Wes Montgomery, Joe Williams, Shirley Horn, Ramsey Lewis,
Roberta Flack, Donny Hathaway, Eddie Harris, Johnny Hartman, Stanley
Turrentine, Dianne Reeves, Sarah Vaughan, Nancy Wilson and Maxine
Weldon.</LD>
<TE>   Levy was inducted into the International Jazz Hall of Fame in
1997, and last week he was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award
by the Los Angeles Jazz Society. Always the sideman, Levy kept his
remarks brief.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to be here," he said, and then used the tried-and-true
one-liner often heard from aging comedians: "Above all, I'm happy to
be anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   But Levy's demeanor belies his age. He is still usually found
working at his desk in his Altadena home, where recently he was
haggling with a festival promoter over the flight schedule of the
best known of his half-dozen clients, song stylist Nancy Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   The promoter wanted to squeeze Wilson into a festival date in
Bermuda before another concert engagement in Kansas City. She could
make it in time with two or three flight changes. Nancy will not be
squeezed, Levy insisted. "She's earned that right." The promoter
agreed to fly Wilson in a private jet.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson has been represented by Levy since the early 1960s, an
agreement that's not on paper but sealed by word of mouth and a
handshake. She was a promising young singer from Ohio when she went
to Levy with a recommendation from Adderley. He signed her and helped
to get a deal with Capitol Records.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the only manager I considered having, because he was
concerned about musicians as people," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a great musician, and I wanted someone who would know me
as a person. I wanted a life, and he was a manager who would allow me
to have a life because he understood."</TE>
<TE>   Bass players make good managers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to hear the bottom, and the bass is my foundation," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He brings that to his work. Aside from music, it was about
building a career that would last."</TE>
<TE>   And Levy, who has handled some of the top female artists, said
that women entertainers need special care. He makes note of it in his
autobiography, "Men, Women and Girl Singers: My Life as a Musician
Turned Talent Agent," written with Devra Hall, Levy's wife and the
daughter of jazz guitarist Jim Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a particular breed," he said, echoing a theme in his
book. "They require special treatment, you have to learn their
temperament, personal relationships with their husbands and children.
It's not the same with a man."</TE>
<TE>   Levy didn't learn that from playing bass. He learned it much
earlier--from his birth in New Orleans to his coming of age in
Chicago--growing up in households of strong women.</TE>
<TE>   "My father was home, but I was raised with all these strong
women--my mother, aunt and grandmother--and they ran everything," he
recalled. "That stayed with me all my life."</TE>
<TE>   A high school dropout, Levy taught himself how to play piano and
performed for guests in a neighborhood house of prostitution. He
switched to bass when he discovered he could earn more money. In the
clubs around Chicago, he gained a reputation as a solid bass player
and eventually teamed up with a trio headed by Stuff Smith, a man who
played violin as if he were blowing a horn.</TE>
<TE>   In 1944, the trio landed on 52nd Street, the mecca of jazz, and
Levy began working with other greats: Ben Webster, Erroll Garner and
Milt Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "Going to 52nd Street was like going to heaven," Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   But even though his career was on a roll, he didn't expect it
would last.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just an average player," he said.</TE>
<TE>   British pianist Shearing didn't think so when he invited Levy to
become an original member of his quintet. But while touring across
the country, Levy soon began splitting his duties between playing
bass and working as Shearing's road manager, a task made difficult by
travel in the segregated South. In 1951, the savvy bass player
established John Levy Enterprises Inc. and began representing jazz
artists. Shearing was his first client.</TE>
<TE>   "Shearing gave me an opportunity at a time when other doors were
closed," Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   Levy, then the first jazz manager of African American descent,
began building a stable of artists, largely by word of mouth:
Andrews, Staton, Jamal. Adderley was recommended by Miles Davis.
Williams, a personal friend, called in desperation one day after
leaving the Count Basie Band in the early '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Levy represented Williams until his death in 1999 and never signed
a contract.</TE>
<TE>   "We shook hands and that was it until he died," Levy said. "I
still like to do business that way."</TE>
<TE>   Such history was present on Sept. 29 at the Biltmore Hotel, where
the Los Angeles Jazz Society held its 20th annual jazz tribute,
honoring Levy and five others, including headliner Herbie Hancock,
another former Levy client, and Annie Ross, Roger Neumann, James
Newton and Howard Rumsey. Levy joked about being the second oldest
person in the room, behind 95-year-old Benny Carter. There was a
brief memorial tribute to Ray Brown, Harold Land, Conte Candoli and
John Collins.</TE>
<TE>   Quincy Jones spoke of them all as being pivotal to jazz, which he
said can't be played without an appreciation or basic knowledge of
its roots. As for Levy, Jones simply stated: "He is history."</TE>

<LD>   Posthumous Aaliyah Album in the Works</LD>
<LD>   Aaliyah fans will soon be able to hear the final tracks the
22-year-old R&amp;B singer recorded before she died in a plane crash 14
months ago.</LD>
<TE>   A posthumous album, still untitled, will include several songs
she'd finished along with some previously released recordings,
according to a spokeswoman for Blackground Records, which will
release the album "probably in late November."</TE>
<TE>   The charter jet Aaliyah was aboard crashed shortly after takeoff
in the Bahamas, where she and her crew had been on a video shoot. The
singer and seven others died. She will be the subject of a musical
salute called "Where My Girls At" featuring Missy Elliott, Eve, Tweet
and others on Oct. 22 at a New York benefit concert for the Step-Up
Women's Network.</TE>

<TE>   Dylan Pays Tribute to Ailing Zevon</TE>
<TE>   Bob Dylan started his fall tour Friday and gave a salute to fellow
singer-songwriter Warren Zevon, who has inoperable lung cancer, by
adding three Zevon songs to his set list.</TE>
<TE>   Dylan performed Zevon's "Accidentally Like a Martyr," "Boom Boom
Mancini" and "Mutineer" in Seattle on Friday, and the following
night, in Eugene, Ore., he included "Martyr," "Mutineer" and
"Lawyers, Guns and Money."</TE>
<TE>   Dylan and Zevon reportedly met when Dylan played harmonica on "The
Factory" for Zevon's 1987 album "Sentimental Hygiene."</TE>
<TE>   On the new tour, which includes three sold-out shows at the
Wiltern Theatre starting Oct. 15, Dylan also has been playing piano
for a significant portion of the evening and has added a version of
the Rolling Stones' "Brown Sugar."</TE>

<TE>   Trove of Unseen Beatles Photographs Discovered</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 500 previously unseen, 1960s photos of the Beatles
have been found in the archives of a university in Scotland--many
taken during the making of their film "Help!"</TE>
<TE>   The London Telegraph reports that the photos were shot by Michael
Peto, a Hungarian photojournalist who died in 1970. His archive of
130,000 negatives was given to Dundee University in 1971 by his
stepson, Michael Fodor, who had been a student there.</TE>
<TE>   The negatives had languished unseen for most of that time, but
university officials discovered them while going through the
collection to create an Internet database of photographic material.</TE>

<TE>   'Puppetry' Performers</TE>
<TE>   Will Talk With Leno</TE>
<TE>   It will be all talk but no action when the performers from the
stage hit "Puppetry of the Penis" appear Wednesday on "The Tonight
Show with Jay Leno."</TE>
<TE>   Although a newspaper ad suggests that some of the show's "genital
origami" will be seen on the late-night program, an NBC spokeswoman
said that the performers from the current production at the Coronet
Theatre in L.A. will only discuss the play.</TE>
<TE>   That will avoid the a repeat of what happened when "Puppetry of
the Penis" cast members Simon Morley and David Friend appeared on a
live morning news show on San Francisco's KRON-TV last Friday to
discuss the show's upcoming engagement there. A cameraman
accidentally shot Friend from the waist down rather than from the
waist up.</TE>
<TE>   A station spokesman said the shot lasted "less than a second," and
that there were only a few calls and e-mails from viewers
complaining.</TE>

<TE>   'Morning Edition'</TE>
<TE>   Commissions a Comedy</TE>
<TE>   There's no telling what the news will be come December, but
National Public Radio's "Morning Edition" is planning to inject some
levity in any case. The producers have commissioned
screenwriter-playwright Peter Ackerman to write a five-part comedy
that will be broadcast during the program the week of Dec. 16.</TE>
<TE>   The production is called "I'd Rather Eat Pants" and deals with two
old folks heading west to find fame. It will be produced for NPR by
L.A. Theatre Works, a local company that regularly stages plays for
public radio. No casting yet.</TE>

<TE>   Actors' Child Swallows</TE>
<TE>   Part of Ecstasy Tablet</TE>
<TE>   The 2-year-old daughter of actors Jude Law and Sadie Frost spent
Saturday night in the hospital after swallowing part of an Ecstasy
tablet at a children's party, police said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Scotland Yard spokesman Nick Jordan said the girl was attending a
party Saturday at Soho House, a popular club in London's West End
that had been used the previous night as a bar and nightclub.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan said the mother realized the girl had something in her
mouth and managed to remove half of it before the child could swallow
it, then Frost called an ambulance. The toddler was released Sunday
morning, he said, adding that there was no issue of neglect and that
police had no plans to take action against the parents.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Geoffrey Rush, who won an Academy Award for "Shine," has signed to
play the title role in "The Life and Death of Peter Sellers," a movie
for HBO about the comedic actor.... Ed O'Neill, former star of
"Married ... With Children," will play Joe Friday in ABC's remake of
the police drama "Dragnet." He replaces Danny Huston, who has left
the show.... And speaking of cops, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett
are paired as fellow officers in "Hollywood Homicide," an
action-comedy now before the cameras here.</TE>

<HD>Some Will Buy That DVD Again--If It's Got the Goodies</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pasadena City College student Michael Schneider stares at the back of
the new "Reservoir Dogs" 10th anniversary DVD and decides to plop
down the $27 for the two-disc set.</LD>
<LD>   Which will strike some as strange since Schneider already owns the
movie on DVD.</LD>
<LD>   "But this is a re-release of the film," he explains, "and it has
all the extra features I've been waiting for."</LD>
<TE>   This scenario isn't an uncommon one.</TE>
<TE>   Film fanatics and casual movie viewers alike increasingly are
placing a high priority on a DVD's supplemental features. A DVD
stores considerably more data than a VHS tape or laserdisc, so movie
studios are using this space to pack bonus materials onto the disc.
Typically, these include audio commentaries by the director and/or
other creative personnel, documentaries, deleted scenes and outtakes,
cast interviews, trailers and interactive content such as DVD-ROM
materials accessible on a personal computer.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Chapek, president of the DVD Entertainment Group, an
industry-supported trade coalition, reports that a recent study it
conducted showed that 63% of DVD owners say supplemental materials
are an important determinant when buying a new movie.</TE>
<TE>   The national study, conducted last spring, also found the
preferred DVD special features were deleted scenes and other
"cutting-room floor" material, followed by behind-the-scenes
documentaries and Web links to additional content.</TE>
<TE>   "When DVDs first debuted [in 1997], consumers enjoyed the fact
[that] DVDs didn't require any rewinding or fast-forwarding--but now
it's all about the bonus materials," says Chapek.</TE>
<TE>   Chapek is also the president of Buena Vista Home Entertainment,
whose "Monsters, Inc." recently sold a record-breaking 5-million DVD
units in North America on its first day of release.</TE>
<TE>   In approaching the "Monsters, Inc." DVD, Chapek says, the company
recognized there were two different audiences for this film, so the
DVD was segregated in two segments. One was the "monster world"
designed for families, and the other the "human world" for film
zealots. The former includes activities primarily for kids such as
video games, collectible "scare cards" and a new short film, "Mike's
New Car," commissioned exclusively for the DVD. The "human world"
features sections such as outtake sketches, an insider's look at the
film's computer animation and a 360-degree virtual tour of Pixar.</TE>
<TE>   But not all consumers will spend the time to click through a DVD's
special features.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I find the extra stuff on a DVD a waste of time,"
says Julie Straith, an L.A.-based dental hygienist. "Nobody I know
even watches these outtakes or interviews. If it came down to it, I'd
much rather pay $10 for a DVD with just the movie than $25 for a DVD
with a bunch of things I won't even look at."</TE>
<TE>   Her co-worker Dahlia Greenberg agrees but then adds a caveat:
"Well, it depends on the movie."</TE>
<TE>   "I admit it's cool to see how special effects were done, like on
'Blade II,' " Greenberg continues. "My boyfriend and I rented it last
weekend and, yes, we watched some of the extra stuff, which was
great."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Stradford, vice president of DVD programming and content
at Columbia Tri Star Home Entertainment, says Greenberg's sentiment
is common. "Yes, this is especially true for big action films such as
'Spider-Man,' 'Men in Black II' or 'XXX,' " he says, "which lend
themselves to DVD extras more than, say, some dramas or comedies."</TE>
<TE>   He adds: "If you have something that's pertinent to the film, then
it warrants putting on the extra stuff. There's no reason not to
include it--remember, with DVDs, no viewer is forced to look at
anything they don't want to."</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man" is expected to be one of the hottest DVD sellers this
coming holiday season. The wide-screen and full-screen versions of
the film will be released on Nov. 1 and, naturally, will house a
"web" of features, such as historical facts on the 40-year-old comic
book wonder, commentary by director Sam Raimi, outtakes and an HBO
"Making of Spider-Man" featurette.</TE>
<TE>   One of the latest trends is to re-release the same film on DVD
multiple times but with varying supplemental features. These
re-releases are usually billed as "special," "ultimate" or, as with
"Reservoir Dogs," "anniversary" editions. Other recent examples
include "Pearl Harbor," "Memento," "Sixth Sense," "American Pie,"
"The Evil Dead" and "Highlander."</TE>
<TE>   Chapek says DVDs are often re-released with new supplemental
content because it's not unusual for it to take a long while to
collect the materials a film fan demands, or, in other cases, a
studio must work around a filmmaker's schedule to record commentary
or conduct interviews.</TE>
<TE>   New Line's "Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" is
another to enjoy two DVD launches in 2002: A two-disc set debuted in
August, while a new four-disc collection is slated for a Nov. 4
release. In an effort to avoid the perception that they were out to
fleece fans by selling them the same movie twice, company officials
put the word out in August that the second edition was in the works,
and they promised that none of the extra materials in the first
release would be repeated on the second, which additionally will
boast a "director's cut" of the film with an extra 30 minutes of
footage.</TE>
<TE>   That's enough to entice Michael Inthear, a freelance sports writer
in Buffalo, N.Y., to purchase "Lord of the Rings" again.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case--because now it's the full 3 1/2-hour film [Peter]
Jackson wanted to make--it's worth picking up," Inthear reasons. "Who
knows--I'll probably sell the first one I bought on EBay anyway."</TE>

<LD>Nick Fallin has a lot going for him: intelligence, good looks and a
job as a corporate lawyer in his father's Pittsburgh firm. Yet with
slimeball tendencies and with drugs threatening to torpedo his
career, he's far from perfect.</LD>
<LD>   Much the same can be said of CBS' "The Guardian," which traces
Fallin's life. The second-season show has fine acting and healthy
ratings. It also possesses an intriguing premise: To avoid
disbarment, Nick must perform 1,500 hours of community service at a
legal services firm, straddling the worlds of corporate and
not-for-profit law.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the series has a troubling addiction--not to drugs, but to
improbable plot twists, usually involving conflicts of interest among
its well-connected protagonists.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight's episode, sandwiched between the CBS legal dramas "JAG"
and "Judging Amy" at 9 p.m., is no exception. Nick (Simon Baker) has
started his own firm and must represent a developer who wants to dig
up part of a cemetery. It's not a particularly popular case,
especially with the survivors of those to be exhumed.</TE>
<TE>   Nick, being the shark he is, has devised a practical if not
morally sound solution. His legal adversary is, of course, his boss
at the legal services firm (Alan Rosenberg).</TE>
<TE>   As if that weren't enough, there are complications involving
Nick's father, Burton (Dabney Coleman), who has left his own firm and
is waiting to be sworn in as a judge. Without revealing what the
conundrums are, let's just say they'd be at home on any episode of
"Days of Our Lives" or "General Hospital."</TE>

<HD>Time to Make Voting a Prime Issue</HD>
<DH>Does FX's 'American Candidate' mock the presidential
process? Nah. The electoral system has already done that.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLEN WARREN</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Granted, the idea seems sleazy and commercial: using a reality TV
show to pick a presidential candidate. But have you checked out
democracy lately?</LD>
<LD>   In the age of television and short attention spans, the real
process of choosing a president is every bit as slick, calculated,
commercial and creepy as the show that cable channel FX is planning
for January 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Anybody who immediately dismisses the idea of the "American
Candidate" show hasn't checked into what the presidential election
system has become.</LD>
<TE>   Those of us who have slogged through the frigid New Hampshire
comedy of "the nation's first presidential primary," the quaint
cornfield drama of the Iowa caucuses or the aw-shucks charm of the
gunnysack races of the summer state fair circuit know there has to be
a better way to choose a president.</TE>
<TE>   Every four years, the forced march of the U.S. presidential
selection process turns up citizenry who tell us political reporters
that they're fed up with the lousy choices they get on election day.
"I don't like [believe, trust, respect] any of them," is a refrain
repeated from coast to coast.</TE>
<TE>   Given the crummy selection process, it's surprising that voter
participation--only about half of those eligible vote in presidential
elections--isn't even lower.</TE>
<TE>   Then consider the debacle of the 2000 Florida vote counting. Or
the impenetrable idiocy of the electoral college that makes a mockery
of the one man, one vote concept.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that the obscene spending on TV ads and our tax dollars
that go toward presidential campaigns--together totaling a cool $500
million in 2000 by some estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, there is plenty of room for improvement.</TE>
<TE>   So, back to the "American Candidate" show. Potential contestants
(anyone who could legally be president) submit an application, a
30-minute video sales pitch and signatures of 50 supporters.</TE>
<TE>   A panel of experts picks 100 finalists who then compete through
debates and such tests as fund-raising and getting on state ballots.
A point system, audience participation and telephone viewer voting
end in a season finale in which the winner is chosen in Washington,
D.C., on July 4, 2004.</TE>
<TE>   FX President Peter Liguori says contestants will have to decide
for themselves whether they actually want to run. FX won't pay for
their participation on the show or for their campaign.</TE>
<TE>   One of the creators of "American Candidate" is R.J. Cutler, who
produced the 1993 documentary "The War Room," which chronicled Bill
Clinton's race for the presidential nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Cutler told me that "there is a yearning for real leadership that
people can be passionate for" and that his show hopes to tap into
this. Citing the success of the "American Idol" reality show, Cutler
says, "I would hope America cares at least as much about selecting
its next president as it does about choosing an entertainment icon."</TE>
<TE>   Liguori says "American Candidate" will not make a "mockery out of
the electoral system."</TE>
<TE>   Judging from some of the inhabitants of the White House and the
way they got there, the current electoral system has already done
that to itself.</TE>

<LD>PARALLELS AND PARADOXES</LD>
<LD>   Explorations in Music and Society</LD>
<LD>   By Daniel Barenboim</LD>
<TE>   and Edward W. Said</TE>
<TE>   Edited by Ara Guzelimian</TE>
<TE>   Pantheon</TE>
<TE>   190 pages, $24</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Classical music, politics and contemporary society are the keynote
topics in "Parallels and Paradoxes," an engaging series of
conversations between literary critic and Middle East expert Edward
W. Said (who is also an accomplished pianist) and Daniel Barenboim,
music director of the Chicago Symphony and the Berlin State Opera, a
charismatic and at times controversial figure in the world of
classical music.</TE>
<TE>   The two men represent what seems, on the surface, to be opposing
ends of the Middle East spectrum: Barenboim is a Jew of Russian
descent born in Buenos Aires and raised in Israel; Said was born in
Jerusalem to an anglicized Christian Arab family and grew up in
predominantly Muslim Cairo. Both are passionate about music,
regularly advance strong (and often similar) opinions about Middle
East politics and Western culture and are highly articulate in
expressing those views. Their stimulating dialogue, moderated by Ara
Guzelimian, senior director and artistic advisor of Carnegie Hall,
takes flight with this emblematic story narrated by Said:</TE>
<TE>   Said and Barenboim helped organize a workshop in Weimar, Germany,
in 1999, bringing together Arab, Israeli and German musicians between
the ages of 18 and 25 to play in one orchestra, Said explains.
Tensions broke out when a group of Arab musicians, improvising late
one night, refused to allow an Albanian-Israeli musician to join in.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't play Arabic music. Only Arabs can play Arabic music,"
one of them told the Jewish musician. Soon, the question became,
"Well, what gives you the right to play Beethoven? You're not
German."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the all-encompassing scope of music was able to
transcend these confines of ethnicity, religion and geography. Ten
days later, Said tells us, "the same kid who had claimed that only
Arabs can play Arabic music was teaching Yo-Yo Ma how to tune his
cello to the Arabic scale. So obviously he thought Chinese people
could play Arabic music," and then gradually the circle extended.
"One set of identities was superseded by another set. There was an
Israeli group, and a Russian group, and a Syrian group, a Lebanese
group, a Palestinian group, and a group of Palestinian Israelis. All
of them suddenly became cellists and violinists playing the same
piece in the same orchestra under the same conductor."</TE>
<TE>   Barenboim, who conducted the young musicians, saw amazing things
happening through the communal music-making: "[I]n cultural
matters--with literature and, even better, with music, because it
doesn't have to do with explicit ideas--if we foster this kind of a
contact, it can only help people feel nearer to each other .... "</TE>
<TE>   The subjects up for discussion go far beyond Middle East tensions
to focus on mysticism and God, the esoteric elements of opera as well
as the everyday concerns of human existence--all viewed though the
lens of music. The men consider, for example, questions of national
identity and how that identity influences musical interpretation,
they debate how musical scores and literary texts should be
read--literal interpretation or with artistic license?--appraise the
music of Wagner against his rabid anti-Semitism and revel in
Barenboim's execution of the Beethoven symphonies and concertos.</TE>
<TE>   Though some of the material is so musically oriented as to nearly
exclude those readers who don't have a strong knowledge of classical
music, the subject is approached with such a generosity of spirit
that there's room for all; those of us with less scholarship in this
area may not get every nuance, but we aren't left behind.</TE>
<TE>   Barenboim and Said's fervent devotion to music, coupled with their
fondness for both well-considered arguments and for each other, is
the glue holding the wide-ranging topics of the book together.</TE>
<TE>   "If you wish to learn how to live in a democratic society, then
you would do well to play in an orchestra," Barenboim tells us. By
doing so, "you know when to lead and when to follow. You leave space
for others and at the same time you have no inhibitions about
claiming a place for yourself." And yet--in one of the paradoxes of
the book's title--music, he tells us, is also the best means of
escape from the problems of human existence.</TE>
<TE>   The crescendo of this genuine give-and-take between keen minds and
open hearts ensures a dynamic, ever-changing experience. When
Barenboim waxes philosophic about the mystical elements of music, for
instance, Said, who doesn't share Barenboim's belief in God, demands,
"Try it. Try and convince me," and the reader is taken along as
Barenboim makes his case. Each maintains respect for the other's
opinion yet holds clearly to his own well-argued perspective. The
fluidity of their relationship, like musicians in an orchestra, is a
compelling model for a world often splintered by dogma, ideology and
hermetically sealed minds.</TE>
<TE>   "To play music well you need to strike a balance between your
head, your heart, and your stomach," Barenboim explains, then asks:
"What better way than music to show a child how to be human?"</TE>
<TE>   What better way than reading about such passionate music lovers,
one might add, to remind us of the same?</TE>

<HD>Plastic Rules on University Campus With Growing Use of
Prepaid Cards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRENDAN SULLIVAN</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>As a young graduate in the 1967 movie "The Graduate," Dustin Hoffman
is advised to go into plastics. These days, plastics precede
graduation by at least four years.</LD>
<LD>   This fall, University of Connecticut students have been able to
swipe their student IDs at vending machines to buy Cokes or Doritos
or to make photocopies in the library. Students already can use their
IDs in the campus laundry machines, libraries and dining halls or
even to buy food at any one of the campus coffee shops. In a year,
they'll be able to swipe off-campus for groceries, haircuts, even
time in a tanning bed.</LD>
<LD>   "I get so used to having the card for everything that when I am
home, I have to remind myself to bring money when I go out," said
Hillary Orr of Simsbury, Conn., who just started her second year at
UConn.</LD>
<TE>   That kind of comment makes Matty Simmons smile.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the future of plastic," said Simmons, author of "The
Credit Card Catastrophe" and co-founder of Diners Club, the first
credit card.</TE>
<TE>   "The prepaid card will soon spread out into many areas, and they
will all keep a record of what you like and don't like," Simmons
said. "I think it's the best thing that could possibly happen. People
are spending what they have and not what they don't have."</TE>
<TE>   Parents who want to school their children early in the wise use of
plastics can sign up anyone age 13 or older for the new Citi Cash
Card. The prepaid card can be used at ATMs or wherever MasterCard is
accepted.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents can track where their kids spend their money and even set
up an automatic allowance," said Citi spokeswoman Gina Doynow.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a big step from such a card to a campus card or debit
card once they are out on their own making spending decisions.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the UConn card will be accepted at a new co-op,
expected to open at the end of the month across from the university's
Gampel sports pavilion. It will include a late-night convenience
store where students can use their IDs to swipe essentials when the
co-op is closed.</TE>
<TE>   Money for this account is separate from the meal plan points,
which can only be used at the school's dozen dining halls and the
student union's Papa Gino's.</TE>
<TE>   At Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., students can swipe
their "Q-cards," which also are their school IDs.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Betsy Cobb of Walpole, Maine, says the card has taught her
a lot about budgeting.</TE>
<TE>   On every receipt she signs (like a credit card receipt), Cobb can
check the bottom to see how much is left in her account.</TE>
<TE>   "When you first get here, it's like monopoly money to you, and you
don't think about what you're spending," she said. "I used to always
run out of money by the end of the semester." But she has learned to
check her balances.</TE>
<TE>   Cobb said students can use their cards to do laundry, order pizza
or even eat at nearby T.G.I. Fridays and Applebee's off campus.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the university expanded its card program to the town
surrounding the school.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gone out to the stores in town more because I know I can use
my card there," said sophomore Reshma Boloor of Bombay, India. Boloor
said she can use a single card to get into the new dorms, get lunch
in the cafeteria or even buy beer at Action Sports Bar in town. "But
the card says if you're 21 or not," she adds, "and it won't let you
buy alcohol with it if you're not."</TE>
<TE>   Where a pay phone once stood next to an ATM, the university has
installed a Value Transfer Station, or what the students call a
"black box." Three other boxes are in the library, law library and
near the dorms. Here, card users can check their balances and add
money to their accounts, which are managed by Black Board Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Students don't part well with cash," said Tom Bell, Black Board's
vice president of Industry Relations. "Setting aside a separate
amount for food and other necessities makes it easier for them to
budget the $10 in their pockets."</TE>
<TE>   Bell said that having one card eliminates the need for separate
cards for dining halls, health centers, laboratories, athletic
facilities and libraries. "The record holder was the University of
Chicago," he said. "At one time, students there could have carried as
many as 44 cards."</TE>

<LD>Meet Mary Seacole</LD>
<LD>   "I was born in Kingston, Jamaica. My father was a soldier, of an
old Scotch family; and to him I often trace my love of camp-life. My
mother kept a boarding house in Kingston, and was, like very many of
the Creole women, an admirable doctor ... and so from an early age I
had a yearning for medical knowledge and practice which has never
left me."</LD>
<LD>   These are the words of Mary Seacole, whose image was captured in
marble by the sculptor Henry Weekes in 1859.</LD>
<TE>   Seacole was a brave and energetic nurse who lived more than 100
years ago. She was skilled at treating such deadly diseases as yellow
fever and cholera. Her name became famous in England in the 1850s
because of her fearless medical service to British soldiers who were
fighting in a war.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very young when I began to make use of what I had learned
from watching my mother, on ... my doll, whatever diseases were most
prevalent in Kingston, be sure my poor doll soon contracted it.
Before long, it was very natural that I should seek to extend my
practice."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Mary Seacole did continue to learn about medicine and
healing. When she grew up, she traveled the world as a nurse. Seacole
wrote the story of her life, "The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs.
Seacole in Many Lands," which became a huge bestseller. By the time
the artist Henry Weekes sculpted her portrait, she was already famous
in England. However, Seacole never forgot her upbringing. Notice how
Weekes' sculpture includes curling palm leaves to remind us of Mary's
homeland, Jamaica.</TE>
<TE>   You can see Mary Seacole's portrait and learn about other
portraits in the Getty's collection by visiting the Family Room. Try
on costumes worn long ago and pose in front of various backdrops. And
don't forget the museum's Oct. 20 Family Festival--a daylong
celebration of music and dance, featuring art-making workshops,
storytelling and fun food. The museum invites children ages 12 and
younger to stop by the information desk in the entrance hall and
receive a free postcard showing the sculpture of Mary Seacole.</TE>
<TE>   For more information or parking reservations, call (310) 440-7300
or visit www.getty.edu. Parking reservations are not needed Saturdays
and Sunday or after 4 p.m. on weekdays.</TE>

<HD>Love Letters Sealed With a Kiss</HD>
<DH>Parents write missives to their young children to be opened
far in the future</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAMANTHA CRITCHELL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Carly Button is almost 6 years old and learning to read. She has a
lot of material waiting for her. Her parents, Diane and Mark Button,
have been writing her letters since the day she was born.</LD>
<LD>   Diane and Mark also have penned letters to their 4-year-old son,
Jack, and 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Hannah, to be opened on all the
big milestones of their lives, such as their high school and college
graduations, their wedding days and their 50th birthdays.</LD>
<LD>   "We tell our kids we love them dozens of times every day, but when
you put it in the form of a letter, it becomes real and tangible,"
Mark explains.</LD>
<TE>   Mark is the co-creator of the Koosh Ball toy, and Diane is a
former restaurateur. They live in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   The family's letter-writing tradition began moments after Diane
gave birth to Carly.</TE>
<TE>   At first Diane just saw a beautiful baby in Mark's arms. But then
she fast-forwarded this image and saw the rest of her daughter's
life--and the moment when she hopefully would have a child of her
own. Diane grabbed a pen and started writing notes, sort of a
journal, about the emotions that came with the first moments of
motherhood.</TE>
<TE>   She signed it "Love, Mom."</TE>
<TE>   This note was the first of many to go in Carly's "letter box."
Each member of the Button family, including Mark and Diane, now have
these decorated boxes that hold letters from loved ones until they're
opened at the appropriate moment.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes life easier when her [Carly's] grandparents ask what
they can get her for a gift. We say, 'Write a letter,' " Mark says.</TE>
<TE>   The Buttons guide other would-be letter writers in their new book,
"The Letter Box: A Story of Enduring Love" (Beyond Words Publishing).
They offer practical tips such as topics to be addressed and even
what types of ink last longer, but the couple also shares their love
story and how, thanks to letters, their family bond is preserved on
paper.</TE>
<TE>   Letters, especially handwritten ones, give the sender an
opportunity to present emotions and memories in a thoughtful way that
is easy to receive, Mark explains. And for the sender, a letter is
something that can always be cherished and brought out over and over.</TE>
<TE>   "Every day we do so much together as a family ... and those are
the memories we've built, but sometimes we forget the details. The
letters that capture a memory can remind us just how special each day
is. It's a forever gift," Diane says.</TE>
<TE>   Letters mean even more in this e-mail age. "How great is it when
you get a letter?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   And when he does get one, Mark says he puts it aside and reads it
when he has time to savor it. When he writes a letter, he--a devoted
computer user--uses pen and paper because it's more personal and
intimate than using "one of 24 fonts."</TE>
<TE>   It's easier to say some things on paper than in person, Mark
explains, and it probably will become truer as their children get
older and no longer will accept a kiss from their parents in front of
their friends.</TE>
<TE>   If you're trying to apologize to someone or break through to a
teenager with whom you are having trouble communicating, a letter
takes some of the volatility out of the equation, allowing sender and
receiver to think about what is being said instead of blurting out
comments that might be regretted later, Diane adds.</TE>
<TE>   The first letter Carly is supposed to open is one earmarked for
her eighth-grade graduation but, as she becomes aware of all the
letters piling up, she's getting a little itchy to open them.</TE>
<TE>   "She now wants to touch and feel the letters. We need to find some
milestone that she can open a letter for soon," Mark says.</TE>

<HD>Mini's a Mouse That's Roaring Again</HD>
<DH>The tiny, fun-to-drive car has been updated and retooled,
and so has its popularity</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Lewis has some problems with his car. He can't go anywhere
without being stopped to talk about it. He can't wipe the smile off
his face when he's driving it. And he hasn't been able to restrict
himself to owning only one.</LD>
<LD>   Lewis' car or, rather, cars are classic English Minis, 1960s and
'70s micro mobiles that are so narrow they could drive on sidewalks,
so short the only view out the driver's side window is often another
car's hubcap, and so responsive they can outmaneuver Ferraris.</LD>
<LD>   Since March, when BMW brought out its updated and retooled version
of the classic car, Minis--both old and new--have become more popular
than ever. Some say it's SUV backlash, a perspective BMW promotes in
its ad campaign, but the car's true fans know the real reason. Minis
are just "so much more fun to drive" than regular cars, said Lewis,
who bought his first Mini four years ago and now runs a vintage Mini
dealership in Ventura.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the fun in driving them is nostalgia--the car's been
around since 1959--and novelty--they're just 10 feet long and 4 1/2
feet tall. But almost every driver will tell you the biggest thrill
is the handling and performance.</TE>
<TE>   "We're gonna turn left," Chris Travers announced as he approached
a corner in his classic Mini Cooper S, speeding up rather than
slowing down to take a turn at 40 mph. There was no burning rubber,
no plume of smoke from the transmission. Just the echo of a scream as
Travers' passenger recovered from the maneuver. Travers was showing
off his ride at a recent meeting for the Mini Owners of America-Los
Angeles car club, whose members own the originals and the reissues.
Shrugging off the move, he said, "You didn't hear tires squealing."</TE>
<TE>   Travers, 52, has owned his Mini for 6 1/2 years, but the love
affair began many years earlier, when he saw the 1969 Michael Caine
film "The Italian Job."</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw that chase scene where the [Minis] made the getaway
through shopping mall sidewalks and stairways, I thought, that's the
coolest thing going."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the classic Cooper S's, the sports cars that are the most
coveted of all the Minis, were and still are being raced. As a
result, many have been destroyed. But the new ones are helping to
fill that gap. When BMW first announced it would be reissuing the
car--originally made by British Motor Corp. and branded as either
Austin or Morris Minis--dealers began compiling waiting lists, which
quickly grew out of control.</TE>
<TE>   At Nick Alexander Imports, the only BMW Mini dealer in Los
Angeles, 2,500 people were on the list by the time the car was
available, even though the dealership will only be receiving 350 this
year. Some customers are combing the state for Mini dealerships with
cars available. With a base sticker price of $16,850, the cars are so
popular that many dealers are asking thousands of dollars over
sticker, charging as much as $27,000--and getting it. In the six
months the car's been available here, 12,500 of them have been sold
nationally.</TE>
<TE>   The Mini's popularity doesn't surprise Dan Pund, associate editor
at Car and Driver magazine. "You build up equity over the course of
years in a particular name and people associate certain
characteristics with that name," he said. "If you had a fairly
successful vehicle over the course of several years, bringing it back
is ready-made marketing."</TE>
<TE>   It's a formula that worked for Volkswagen when it reintroduced its
bubbly new Beetle in 1998. The original Beetles were, at one time,
the best-selling import car in the country. Volkswagen sold more than
4.9 million of them in the U.S., but the company stopped distributing
them here in 1979. By the time the car was updated and brought back
to market, people were so misty-eyed and nostalgic for the little Bug
that they've since snatched up more than 320,000 of them.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., Minis are far more obscure than the Beetle. They were
sold in the U.S. from 1959 to 1967 only. In Europe, they are much
better known. By the time the company closed its doors in October
2000, 5.5 million of them had been sold worldwide--mostly in England,
other parts of Europe, Australia and New Zealand--but only 10,000 of
those were sold in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The new BMW Minis are built in the same plant as the old Minis but
are substantially different. The BMW is bigger than the classic: It
is 2 feet longer and 6 inches taller. It also comes with a number of
safety improvements over the original--air bags, side-impact beams,
crumple zones. To many classic car aficionados, the only thing the
new and classic Minis have in common is the name. But it is that name
that is getting more and more attention.</TE>
<TE>   The new BMW is not only raising the car's profile in America but
prompting a mini-resurgence in the original cars' sales.</TE>
<TE>   Though he declines specifics, Lewis says he has sold more Minis in
the first nine months of 2002 than he sold in all of 2001. It's rare,
he says, that he sells fewer than one a week.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the people who are buying them are those who'd always
thought about owning one but never got around to it.</TE>
<TE>   "My earliest recollection is seeing one [on TV] going around the
track beating the pants off a Corvette. I've wanted one since I was
about 12," said Antonio Rico, 34, who two years ago became the proud
owner of a Mini as old as he is--a Cooper built in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents had one of these. My first car when I learned to drive
was one of these," said Mike Walsh, 41, who grew up in Britain and
bought his vintage powder blue Mini a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The new one coming along was probably the impetus I needed to buy
this one," said Walsh, who lives in Garden Grove. "When they
announced it, I thought, 'What better time to buy a classic one than
now?' "</TE>
<TE>   It's a common sentiment, even among new Mini owners. Bill Sepaniak
of Long Beach has the Mini bug "big time," he said. He and his wife
each own the new BMW. They are so enthralled with the cars that they
are importing two of the classics from Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago, some people would say, 'Cute car. What is it?' "
Lewis said. "Now, pretty much everybody knows."</TE>

capricious and appealing looks</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>PARIS--It is an exquisitely difficult job to advance fashion, please
a wide range of tastes and deliver original clothes with lasting
impact.</LD>
<LD>   With a significant shift toward full and oversized silhouettes for
next spring, women may welcome the freer fit--and not fret about an
extra croissant or two.</LD>
<LD>   Though fashion has long been quoting retro references verbatim,
the best spring clothes here are looking fresh and distinct, even
though they trigger flashbacks. Halfway through the collections,
miniskirts, sheer evening dresses and resort-ready looks abound.
Holdovers from the '80s such as oversized shirts and tight,
high-waisted, cropped pants have invoked despondent sighs, mostly
about how quickly fashion cycles return but few comparisons to the
economic advantages of the yuppie years. Those blown-up shapes are
back because it's simply time for the narrow silhouette to change.</LD>
<TE>   Marc Jacobs for Louis Vuitton used the balloon as a symbol of the
inflated silhouettes he showed on Monday. A dozen huge, round or
cartoon-character-shaped balloons printed with the new, multicolor LV
logo floated outside the Parc Andre Citroen. They were a nod to the
recent balloon installation of his latest guest artist, Takashi
Murakami, whom Jacobs invited to tweak the LV logo. Models carrying
the new logo bags marched out with the first dozen dresses, each in a
color in the new logo. Though a stiff, neoprene coat and a ruffled
micro-mini stood away from the body, Jacobs stuck to sleek tight cuts
for high-waist pants, striped sweaters and lace dresses. Though at
first glance his clothes seem proper and conservative, a second look
shows that a prim skirt, a swingy trench coat and a ladies-who-lunch
suit were cut from rubber.</TE>
<TE>   At John Galliano's namesake show, models had their hair wrapped
over a trio of balloons, a perfect look to accompany his supersized
'80s bombers and ruffled hoop skirts. The inflated looks also
contrasted with the items that likely will be the big sellers--trim,
fitted leather military jackets with a stack of bands that zip off
the sleeves. Galliano probably has a whole range of elegant pieces in
the multicolor silk prints that he showed as scarves and burkas  on
the runway. His Sunday show was a dazzling production, if only for
the multicultural finale that showered the clothes, the stage and
front-row VIPs with colored chalk dust.</TE>
<TE>   True, all the changes coming next season sound quirky, capricious
and complicated, but avant-garde designers have embraced the classics
to good effect. Clever styling on runways has proven that spring's
romantic/utilitarian/exotics will require careful attention to
details. Micro-shorts, skinny cropped pants, slim minis and full,
knee-length skirts each demand a different kind of shoe or boot,
though most here are skyscrapers on soles. Bags large and small,
belts wide and narrow and ribbons and scarves in vivid, contrasting
tones often give the outfits their panache. The days of tossing a
black jacket over black pants are gone, unless you work in a
mortuary, or the fashion industry, where it remains a uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Yet legions of those noir-loving fashion pros swooned over
Alexander McQueen's colorful show on Saturday. In a large music
auditorium on the outskirts of the city, McQueen screened a
three-part video that enhanced the show's three fashion acts:
medieval shipwreck, ultra-gothic black and vivid ethnic feather
prints.</TE>
<TE>   He brilliantly delivered clothes with understandable proportions
and inventive personalities. In other hands, a corset vest might seem
romantic and innocent, but McQueen's turned edgy with leather belt
straps lashed across the front in the shape of a cross. He disguised
the utilitarian origins of a cropped, white military jacket under a
sprinkling of coin-size silver paillettes. While many have tried and
miserably failed to create sexy harem pants or knickers, McQueen
succeeded with cascades of silk that gently wrapped the legs and
tapered to the knee. His swirling, swinging feather-printed dresses
in a rainbow cascade of colors subtly recalled the 1980s, the last
time prints were in fashion and the last time clothes seemed to have
a distinct, original personality.</TE>
<TE>   The British designer, who will open a store soon in Los Angeles,
played up his bad boy image in his show's second act: an all-black
gothic escape that was like those horror flicks where teens turn into
vampires and zombies. Still, he can't hide that his precision
tailoring appeals to women with a wide range of tastes, ages and
professions.</TE>
<TE>   If McQueen ever leaves fashion, he should create stage shows with
Galliano, who also designs for Christian Dior. Galliano's campy,
paratrooper drag queens at Dior with their rhinestoned eyelids, pink
glitter lips and lace-applique eyebrows were great distractions from
the fact that his catwalk looks won't be recognizable when they're
worn on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, many whispered, that Crazy John, his red-hot streak of
creativity has finally burned out--he's gone too far. Who cares? It
was great theater, particularly with stars Laura Dern, Christina
Ricci, Claire Danes and Penelope Cruz in attendance. Just enough of
their fellow celebrities will don the runway exaggerations for
InStyle (or tabloid worst-dressed lists) that it won't matter if Dior
never sells a crazy, parachute silk, wing-backed, cinch-waisted
cropped jacket with bows, misplaced pockets and rhinestones. Fashion
victims will celebrate if they score a neon leather belt with the
Dior logo spelled out in sparkly letters 8 inches tall across their
backsides. The platform sandals were so impossibly high that several
models nearly fell and one confessed an hour after the show that her
legs were still shaking.</TE>
<TE>   So what? Magazines and ads will tout the dramatic imagery. In
stores, Dior customers will be offered the slim denim skirts,
macrame-back jersey dresses and amply cut alligator or silk gauze
bomber jackets that were piled into layers and seemed to occupy
one-tenth of a second on the runway, the exact length of time before
overexposure sets in.</TE>
<TE>   It may seem a simple thing to straddle the line between
avant-garde and classic. If it were, Helmut Lang wouldn't be in a
league of his own. In his first show here since moving to New York
nearly five years ago, the Austrian designer modernized his own
minimalist ethic with gussets of sheer chiffon or latex that shined
like silk under sleeves. His neat, black classics could shift from
the office to the nightclub by adding one of his zipper-edge
harnesses or a dress shirt stripped of everything but its collar,
placket and buttons, like some sort of shirt necklace.</TE>
<TE>   Lang's rival for most-classic tailor may be Martin Margiela, a
card-carrying member of the Belgian avant-garde who delivered soft
luxury sportswear for Hermes. In a black, white, gray and taupe
palette, Margiela created perfectly proportioned batwing blouses and
shirtdresses, sleeveless jackets and coats and clever cardigan
sweaters knitted low in the back to become halter tops. Banana
Republic will make a mint knocking him off.</TE>
<TE>   An unusual array of designers have embraced the new fuller
silhouette, with a notable exception. Nicolas Ghesquiere of
Balenciaga introduced sleek leggings and clingy, color-blocked mini
scuba dresses with deep-sea prints. In their silky, shiny, sleek and
black pants and tops, the models looked like seals on heels.
Ghesquiere's ultra-high-waist leggings and pants with long waist
darts looked exaggerated, even on the perfectly proportioned Gisele
Bundchen. If he once again has predicted the next fashion wave, we'll
soon be back in black denim jeans and bike shorts--as if they weren't
bad enough the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Working women, the artistic ones at least, may discover some
unexpected professional attire in Dries Van Noten's unlikely mix of
1950s silhouettes, punk accessories and an intriguing mix of African
folkloric and acid colors. He playfully "embroidered" jackets and
even leather belts with rows of small safety pins, the reigning
symbol of punk. But the collection wasn't about rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   "The '50s were a very optimistic period," he said backstage. "We
need optimism right now."</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, we can all be happy that fashion is abandoning
purposefully ugly or aggressively trashy clothes. Some guys, such as
Alber Elbaz, just like to make a lady look like a lady.</TE>
<TE>   After moving from four jobs in just about as many years, the
peripatetic Elbaz seems to have a solid future at Lanvin, where he
too worked with an African palette accented by Old World crystal
jewels. Using satin ribbons, pleated sheer gauze and clusters of
crystals, Elbaz fashioned short chemise dresses for day and night,
and intricately gathered dresses that fit loosely at the waist.
Executive women could wear his raw-edged, linen skirt suits.</TE>
<TE>   Customers come first in the work of Celine designer Michael Kors,
whose upbeat collection was ready to travel. Carefree crinkled linen
and cotton cut into sleek trench coats, tunics and trousers look
great when they're messy. Shimmery silk prints and hammered gold-coin
chandelier earrings, bracelet cuffs and belts added a luxury vibe to
his easy-wearing lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Three seasons into his gig as creative director at Emanuel Ungaro,
Giambattista Valli respectfully evoked his master's signature polka
dots, florals and hot pinks.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's hard to picture a run on Crayola-bright matador
jackets and cropped white jeans under densely ruffled dresses,
Ungaro, and now Valli, have a way of making them sensual and simple.</TE>
<TE>   For his namesake Lagerfeld Gallery collection, Karl Lagerfeld put
denim micro-shorts beneath his sheer dresses, a practical but sexy
continuation of his new alliance with Diesel jeans. Though men have
long (and awkwardly) combined jeans with tuxedos, Lagerfeld gave the
idea a feminine twist with pleated tuxedo shirts, shrunken tux
jackets and ankle-sweeping beaded tunics worn in combination with
black-washed shorts or white denim miniskirts or rolled-cuff jeans.</TE>
<TE>   The history of dressed-up denim is dubious, and its future
uncertain, even with Lagerfeld as a guide to good taste. One can only
imagine the disastrous knockoffs to come.</TE>

<LD>Standing in line at the grocery store, I'm checking my watch as I
unload my cart. I'm here between errands, due to pick up the kids
from the dentist in minutes.</LD>
<LD>   The woman ahead of me eyes my provisions. Two gallons of milk, a
giant bag of oranges, Pop-Tarts, rabbit food, three dozen juice boxes
... "You've got kids," she announces. I add six boxes of brownie mix
and a giant flat of potato chips. "Lots of kids."</LD>
<LD>   "Only three," I tell her. And a bake sale tomorrow and snacks for
the soccer teams this weekend.</LD>
<TE>   I glance enviously at her purchases--a bottle of wine, fresh
vegetables, salmon filets, French bread, gourmet pasta--and imagine
myself in her shoes, heading home to a leisurely meal in a clean,
quiet kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "I never had children," she blurts out. "I always hoped I would;
wonder what it would be like if I had."</TE>
<TE>   I smile and offer her my kids, but she doesn't smile back, just
collects her bags and leaves. Suddenly my shoes fit just fine. And a
life that, until a moment ago, seemed impossibly messy and exhausting
and complicated makes me feel like the luckiest woman alive.</TE>
<TE>   I realize that sometimes we cannot choose our fate. But we still
have the power to decide what we will lament and what we will
appreciate.</TE>
<TE>   This is my final column. Come Sunday, I'll be moving on to a new
assignment at the newspaper I've called home for 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   I've never been much good at leaving behind, at saying goodbye. I
still ache when I look out my kitchen window at the house across the
street I left three years ago. It was time to move, and yet I still
miss its shady front porch, the hibiscus bushes flanking the patio,
the tinkle of my neighbor's wind chimes wafting through my window at
night.</TE>
<TE>   Like all transitions in life, this one is bound to involve both
gains and losses.</TE>
<TE>   It will be a blessing to quiet the monologue in my head, as I'm no
longer compelled to evaluate my every thought, emotion and act, for
some sort of universal message to share.</TE>
<TE>   My daughters can stop living their lives on stage, forced to
admonish me--"Mommy, this is not for your column"--every time they
have a private story to tell. My friends will no longer risk finding
their foibles displayed on a newspaper page.</TE>
<TE>   But the losses will be more substantial. What I'll miss most is
the privilege of what felt--irrationally, I suppose--like an
intimate, ongoing chat with a million of my closest friends. Because
just as my life has colored this column, your feedback has enriched
my life.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, I stumbled into this space, with a mandate only to
write about life--about the things that make us human; the issues
that divide us and the emotions that bind us.</TE>
<TE>   When I began, I was still reeling from death of my husband three
years before, struggling alone to raise three little girls, and
trying to make sense of a life that had veered off course.</TE>
<TE>   Those little girls are becoming lovely young women--strong and
funny and wise and kind. Their mother has rediscovered love; has
stopped mourning what wasn't and learned to celebrate what is. And
what I've learned while writing this column has often helped me on my
way.</TE>
<TE>   You taught me that we are more alike than different. That there is
nothing we will be asked to do that someone before us has not already
done. That even when we suffer in solitude, the struggle is not ours
alone. That listening is more important than talking, forgiveness
more powerful than revenge. And sometimes the best healing salve is
the simple, inexorable march of time.</TE>
<TE>   Every columnist's final column seems to contain this apology: To
all those readers who wrote, e-mailed or left messages, I'm sorry if
I didn't respond. Like the other columnists, I blame the press of
news, the barrage of mail, the relentless push of twice-weekly
deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   But know that I read them all. There are boxes in my garage,
filled with your letters, e-mails, photos and cards. I dip in and
read them from time to time, when I need to be reminded of how
thoughtful, how wise, how compassionate people in Los Angeles really
are.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing I can leave you with to match all you have given
me. So let me simply close by sharing one reader's gift, a passage
attributed to author Victor Hugo that has guided me through many
difficult days:</TE>
<TE>   "Have courage for the great sorrows of life, and patience for the
small ones.</TE>
<TE>   "And when you have laboriously accomplished your daily tasks, go
to sleep in peace.</TE>
<TE>   "God is awake!"</TE>

<LD>   The story so far: Elaine has just started at a new school and is
lonely.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Well, it's Tuesday, and I'm back at school. I didn't want to go,
but my mom said I had to. She said it would get better.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't.</TE>
<TE>   At recess, I didn't get picked for four-square, which is probably
a good thing, since I am horrible at sports. But still, it would have
been fun to play. I sat on the grass and watched some ants. I wish I
were an ant. At least ants have friends. I'll bet at Ant School, the
new kid ant doesn't have as tough a time as I'm having.</TE>
<TE>   Today at lunch we had tuna noodle casserole, which is something I
usually like a lot. I know, everybody says, ick ... but it reminds me
of my old school. They had good tuna noodle casserole there. One girl
said hello to me today and smiled. But she didn't ask me to sit with
her.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting alone at lunch is just plain horrible. Tomorrow I'm going
to bring my Nancy Drew book. At least she'll keep me company. I wish
I were Nancy Drew. If I were Nancy, I would be with my friend George,
and we would have great adventures and solve crimes. But here I am,
all alone at a new school. And the tuna noodle casserole doesn't
taste good at all.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe tomorrow will be better. It better be better!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Will the other kids ask Elaine to sit with them at
lunch?</TE>
<TE>   Cherie Troped, loves to write stories and knows that it's really,
really hard to be the new kid. This story will be on The Times' Web
site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>SEC Said to Probe AOL-Oxygen Deal</HD>
<DH>Accounting: The inquiry reportedly focuses on whether ad
revenue was double-booked. Media giant denies impropriety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly is examining AOL
Time Warner Inc.'s 2001 advertising deal with Oxygen Media Inc. to
learn whether revenue received under the arrangement was improperly
booked.</LD>
<LD>   Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street
Journal said Monday that the probe focuses on whether the same
revenue was "double-booked" at different units of the company,
America Online and Time Warner Cable.</LD>
<LD>   Such a focus would indicate that federal investigators have
broadened their previously disclosed probes, the newspaper said.</LD>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said the accounting
for the Oxygen Media transactions was proper.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no double-counting issue," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are cooperating closely with the SEC and [Justice Department]
in their inquiries but have no comment on the specifics of those
inquiries," Primrose added.</TE>
<TE>   Oxygen Media, which runs a women-oriented cable TV channel, did
not return calls for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC, through spokeswoman Christi Harlan, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner disclosed in July that the SEC had launched a
fact-finding inquiry into the accounting treatment of certain
advertising deals at its America Online unit.</TE>
<TE>   Later that month, the company confirmed that the Justice
Department had begun a criminal probe into the same issues.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, the company said the scrutiny was limited to
America Online.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-August, AOL Time Warner announced that it had learned of
three transactions--again, all at the Internet unit--that apparently
involved the improper booking of advertising and commerce revenue.</TE>
<TE>   America Online, before its January 2001 merger with Time Warner
Inc., was an original investor in Oxygen Media, along with Oprah
Winfrey and Microsoft Corp. billionaire Paul Allen.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2001, AOL Time Warner increased its minority stake and
agreed to carry Oxygen's channel in 10 million of its Time Warner
Cable homes.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, according to the Journal, Oxygen agreed to spend $100
million on advertising with the company, mostly on America Online.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper said its sources contended that some of that revenue
was improperly booked with both the Internet and cable units, perhaps
misleading investors about the strength of those divisions.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, partly on investor fears that the scope of the federal
probes is widening, shares of AOL Time Warner sank 61 cents, or 5%,
to $11.20 in New York Stock Exchange trading. Although the stock has
edged up from a July 25 closing low of $9.64, it is down 65% this
year and down 76% since the merger.</TE>
<TE>   The dismal stock performance is in large part responsible for the
departures of two top AOL Time Warner executives this year: former
Chief Executive Gerald M. Levin and former Co-Chief Operating Officer
Robert W. Pittman, both cheerleaders for the merger. Several company
directors also have put pressure on Chairman Steve Case to resign,
although he has given no indication of leaving.</TE>

<HD>Industry Gears Up for Task of Untangling Huge Backlog</HD>
<DH>Transportation: More than 200 cargo ships wait to be
unloaded. Shortages of workers, truck drivers and trains could hamper
effort.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even if the Bush administration wins a court injunction to reopen the
ports immediately, untangling the huge backlog of cargo at West Coast
ports might take four to six weeks of round-the-clock work.</LD>
<LD>   The transportation industry is gearing up for the massive task of
removing the logjam of undelivered goods, but those efforts could be
hampered by port bottlenecks and shortages of dockworkers, railroad
cars, truck drivers and other equipment to haul shipping containers.</LD>
<LD>   "The ports are going to have to work 24-7," said Erik Autor, vice
president of the giant National Retail Federation, which represents
2,500 businesses, many of them dependent on waterborne trade.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not sure anyone has an idea how it will all be handled, but
we do know it will be a logistical nightmare," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The 29 West Coast ports have been closed since Sept. 29, when the
Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and terminal
operators, locked out union dockworkers in response to work
slowdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to escalating calls for intervention, President Bush on
Monday established a board of inquiry that will issue a report today
on whether there is enough evidence to win a court order under the
Taft-Hartley Act to reopen the ports for an 80-day cooling-off
period.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 cargo ships are waiting to be unloaded at West Coast
ports, and dozens more are expected to arrive in the days ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The queued-up vessels carry several hundred thousand shipping
containers laden with apparel, electronics, auto parts, consumer
goods and toys for the holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   The worst backlog is in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach,
the nation's largest harbor complex. About 120 cargo vessels are
either docked in port or anchored nearby.</TE>
<TE>   If the lockout were to end today, terminal operators, shipping
company executives and businesspeople said, they would expect cargo
to be delivered from early November to Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   Some retail associations, such as the West Coast Waterfront
Coalition, are advising their membership that restoring the ports to
normal operations will take four to six days for each day the harbors
are closed.</TE>
<TE>   How to move the stranded cargo has been the subject of repeated
planning sessions involving shipping lines, tug operators, harbor
pilots, officials with the Marine Exchange, which oversees harbor
vessel traffic, and the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a significant challenge, but the experience to handle it
is there," said John Patchner, a former shipping executive and
consultant to the Pacific Maritime Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to unclog the ports as quickly as possible," Patchner
said. "The plans will have some extraordinary elements to them. Let's
say ports will not be limited to an 8-to-5 day."</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which has been in a lengthy contract
dispute with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, has
established a central clearinghouse for allocating labor in each West
Coast port.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles and Long Beach, ships will be unloaded on a
first-come, first-served basis. Capt. Manny Aschemeyer, director of
the Marine Exchange, said no priorities have been assigned yet to any
refrigerated cargo, perishable items or other goods needed on an
emergency basis.</TE>
<TE>   Vessels already docked, Aschemeyer said, probably will be unloaded
first to make way for the others in line--much the way the port
normally operates.</TE>
<TE>   "It is going to take a long time," Aschemeyer said. "Once ships
are in, there might not be enough gangs of dockworkers to go around.
Five might be ordered, but the ship might only get two. You'll just
have to wait your turn."</TE>
<TE>   Officers of the ILWU, which represents more than 10,500 West Coast
dockworkers, said labor shortages are probable when the ports reopen.
They also said they did not want safety compromised by intense
industry pressure to clear the backlog quickly. Five ILWU workers
have been killed in waterfront accidents this year.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks before the lockout, an ILWU official said, there were
already shortages of dockworkers caused by a 10% to 20% increase in
cargo arriving at West Coast ports.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't the people to do this," said Steve Stallone, an ILWU
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been pushing them [the Pacific Maritime Assn.] to register
more people in the union. They won't do that. Then they complain
[that] we don't send them enough trained people."</TE>
<TE>   Labor isn't the only concern. The huge onslaught of cargo is
expected to put severe pressure on terminal space used to store
containers. Port roads are expected to be clogged more than usual as
truck drivers line up to pick up the swelling inventory of cargo.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be lines to get into the terminal. There will be lines
to pick up a chassis [a container trailer] if there are shortages.
There will be lines to pick up your container," said Salvador Abrica,
a truck driver for Aztlan Logistics in Wilmington. "I don't want to
go there and sit and not make any money."</TE>
<TE>   To handle the shipments, trucking companies are trying to obtain
land to store vehicles they will need. Even then, trucking executives
expect there will be shortages of rigs.</TE>
<TE>   Railroads such as Union Pacific are setting aside extra cars and
locomotives to service the ports once they open. But, rail
representatives say, they don't want to move so fast that they will
swamp the network with trains.</TE>
<TE>   John Bromley, a spokesman for Union Pacific, said the railroad is
putting together a recovery plan to move cargo as quickly as possible
given the capacity of the company.</TE>
<TE>   James Garst, director of the International Furniture Products
Shippers Assn. of High Point, N.C., is advising his 42
members--retailers, manufacturers and wholesalers--to steer clear of
the railroads and hire trucks to bring their goods across the country
as quickly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Many U.S. furniture companies have new collections stuck on
containers that they want to show customers at the nation's largest
furniture show, which opens in two weeks. Garst estimates it will
take at least 30 days after the port reopens before all the cargo is
delivered and the transportation system is back to normal.</TE>
<TE>   "They either pay a little bit more now or risk an empty showroom,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the retailing and manufacturing side, major companies are
planning to accept deliveries on a 24-hour basis, despite the costs
of overtime and extra staffing. Smaller businesses are considering
expanded hours for deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the ports are opened right away, many manufacturers and
retailers fear that their shipments will not be delivered in time for
the holiday season. Containers could be lost, shipments might arrive
piecemeal and shortages of equipment and labor could cause further
delay.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to be a disaster," said Robin Lanier, director of
the West Coast Waterfront Coalition, representing retailers and
manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   "Some containers have been sent to Panama or Mexico. Shipments are
going to be off-loaded, but chassis are not available to deliver
them. Just figuring out where your shipping containers are is going
to be a problem."</TE>

<HD>Brazilian Markets Reel on Leftist's Win</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Renewed sell-off is based on fears that Lula
may seek to renegotiate the country's public debt or roll back
free-market reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAO PAULO, Brazil</DL>
<LD>A leftist candidate's victory in the first round of Brazil's
presidential election sent markets here reeling Monday, amid
deepening pessimism over whether Latin America's biggest country can
avert a debt default and economic implosion that could spill into
neighboring countries.</LD>
<LD>   Workers' Party candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took 46.4% of
the vote in Sunday's election, short of the 50% needed to win
outright but enough to make his ascension to the presidency a virtual
certainty after an Oct. 27 runoff.</LD>
<LD>   Investors resumed selling Brazilian bonds, stocks and the nation's
currency after a brief respite in the markets' losses late last week.</LD>
<TE>   But declines in other Latin American markets were muted. Mexico's
IPC stock index eased 0.3%, Argentina's main index lost 1.8%, and
Venezuela's fell 1.2%.</TE>
<TE>   In Brazilian markets, however, "the fear factor ... is at an
all-time high," said Lawrence Goodman, managing director of
Globalecon, an economics consulting firm in New York. "People fear a
reversal of Brazil's previous [free-market] reforms as well as a
re-profiling of its debt obligations."</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's most commonly traded government bond, the 10-year C bond,
fell 2.5% in price Monday and now trades at about half its face
value, with an annualized yield of about 24%.</TE>
<TE>   The Bovespa index of Brazilian stocks dropped 4.3% to close at
8,863.18, falling back toward the three-year low it hit last week.
The nation's currency, the real, slid to 3.675 to the dollar. It has
lost more than a third of its value this year.</TE>
<TE>   Statements Disavowed</TE>
<TE>   Worries about a Lula victory have been weighing on markets since
April, when his poll numbers began showing him as a possible winner
on his fourth try for the presidency. He made statements in previous
campaigns that he might seek to renegotiate Brazil's $260-billion
public debt load and rethink the Real Plan, the free-market economic
scheme that current President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has
implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lula has disavowed those statements and promised in
recent weeks to meet Brazil's obligations and adhere to strict
budgetary guidelines laid down as conditions for continued
International Monetary Fund assistance, investors remained
unconvinced. Many on Wall Street were hoping the populist former
metalworker would make statements or staff appointments Monday that
would calm markets.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference here Monday, Lula did nothing to allay
investors' fears. The votes he garnered, he said, demonstrated that
Brazilians didn't share the "exaggerated economic concerns that the
analysts have."</TE>
<TE>   Lula said he was elected to "change Brazil's economic model,"
although he has so far given few details about what his new policies
might look like or how he would finance them. He also declined Monday
to name any members of his prospective economic team, should he be
elected. "First you have to win, then you can give names," Lula told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   He said that economics in his administration would not be "sacred"
and that he had other important appointments to make in social and
planning functions. "We want to win mainly to make changes in the
social sector," Lula said.</TE>
<TE>   Domino Effect Feared</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the direct effect a Lula administration would have on
Brazil's economy and markets, investors in the U.S. and elsewhere
fear a domino effect on other Latin American economies. Argentina
already is in a state of crisis over its shrinking economy, large
public debt load and collapsed currency.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Carlos de Faria, an economist with Deutsche Bank in Sao
Paulo, said the effect of Brazil's currency plunge already is being
felt by its neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a huge depreciation of Brazilian currency, and
that affects other countries with trade relations with Brazil," Faria
said. "They may be forced to devalue to level the playing field."</TE>
<TE>   The devalued real makes Brazilian exports cheaper, threatening
competitors in other nations. At the same time, the devaluation has
devastated Brazilians' purchasing power, hurting their ability to buy
foreign goods.</TE>
<TE>   Many Brazilian officials have said in recent weeks that investors
have been unfairly punishing Brazilian markets. They have pointed out
that the country may show a $10-billion trade surplus this year and
that it has demonstrated budgetary discipline, excluding the cost of
servicing its public-sector debt.</TE>
<TE>   Alvaro de Souza, president of the American Chamber of Commerce
here and a former Brazilian head of Citibank, argues that Brazil has
made great macroeconomic progress that has been overshadowed by
investors' memories of "what Lula said 12 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledges that in today's precarious global environment,
investors are steering clear of anything that smells of risk.</TE>
<TE>   One rumor has it that Lula might try to impose controls on capital
to keep investors from fleeing Brazilian investments, said Mario
Mesquita, an economist with investment bank ABN Amro of Sao Paulo.
"That's why the market is waiting for a [Lula] announcement of a
market-friendly economics team that is not inclined to take measures
limiting the ability to move capital in and out of Brazil," Mesquita
said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Brazil's economy is being strangled by sky-high
interest rates--the cost the country is paying to retain capital.</TE>
<TE>   Goodman of Globalecon pointed out that Brazilian money market
funds must now pay 45% interest to entice investors' cash. "Under the
present circumstances, the right set of policies could readily turn
Brazil around," he said. "But time is running against Brazilian
financial markets."</TE>

<LD>The value of the Bronfman family's holdings in Vivendi Universal has
plummeted as the share price has fallen more than 80%. Though the
Bronfmans still hold the largest single block of stock, the family
has sold nearly half of its Vivendi Universal shares during the last
22 months.</LD>
<LD>   * December 2000: The Bronfman family holds 88.9 million shares
worth $65 each, or $5.8 billion.</LD>
<LD>   * October 2002: The family holds 51.5 million shares worth about
$11 each, or $567 million.</LD>
<TE>   Edgar Bronfman Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Bronfman Jr.'s responsibilities as a Vivendi Universal board
member now include acting as a liaison between Paris and the American
entertainment companies. Key moments in his career:</TE>
<TE>   * 1989: Named Seagram president and chief operating officer at age
34.</TE>
<TE>   * 1993: Leads Seagram purchase of 15% of Time Warner over a
two-year period. Average share price: $38.</TE>
<TE>   * 1994: Named Seagram president and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   * 1995: Leads Seagram purchase of 80% of MCA, parent company of
Universal Studios and MCA Music, for $5.7 billion from Matsushita
Electric Industrial. To pay for MCA, Bronfman sells Seagram's 24.2%
stake in DuPont at $56 a share, or $8.8 billion. When DuPont's share
price later doubles, other Bronfman family members criticize the
move.</TE>
<TE>   * 1997: Agrees to buy Viacom's half of USA Network cable channel
for $1.7 billion. Later sells Barry Diller 55% of MCA's television
assets, including USA, for $4.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * 1998: Sells the last of Seagram's stake in Time Warner for an
average share price of $57. Buys PolyGram Music for $10.6 billion;
the merger would take MCA Music from the No. 6 music company to No. 1
in worldwide sales.</TE>
<TE>   * 2000: Closes the sale of Seagram, including Universal Studios,
to Vivendi for $24 billion. A stock swap makes the Bronfmans the

<HD>Curtain Rises on Bronfman's Third Act</HD>
<DH>Media: Vivendi's vice chairman is focused on shaping the
firm's future and boosting its stock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edgar Bronfman Jr. has a rare shot at redemption in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   As scion of the Seagram dynasty, Bronfman gambled his family
fortune when he helped transform its Canadian liquor business into
the world's second-largest media conglomerate. Then he watched his
family's $6-billion stake in Vivendi Universal shrivel as the
company's shares lost 80% of their value in an ensuing financial
crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Bronfman, Vivendi's vice chairman, now has been charged with
taking a more activist role. Not only is he trying to boost the media
giant's share price, the 47-year-old also is out to restore the
family's fortune--and perhaps add a little luster to the family name.</LD>
<TE>   "My focus is entirely on trying to help all of the stakeholders,
management and shareholders, to recapture the value that has been
squandered and formulate a future that is exciting," Bronfman said in
an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou announced at a board meeting
last month that Bronfman would assume a more hands-on role as a
liaison to Vivendi's music, movie, television, game and theme park
executives.</TE>
<TE>   The move comes as the Paris-based company struggles to remake
itself. Although there are political pressures in France to keep a
stake in the company's bedrock--the water and sewage operation--the
goal is to reduce that holding. Vivendi probably will then spin off
at least a portion of its entertainment companies in an initial
public offering, possibly with one or more strategic partners in the
American media, Bronfman confirmed. Any spinoff would depend on the
market for media properties improving, something analysts say is a
year or two away.</TE>
<TE>   "The end game is clear. You are going to have to end up with an
American-listed vehicle that U.S. media investors can buy into," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether Bronfman's third go-around in
Hollywood will prove more successful than his first two.</TE>
<TE>   After skipping college, the grandson of Seagram founder Sam
Bronfman hit Hollywood, where he had some success as a songwriter
(Dionne Warwick's "Whisper in the Dark") and movie producer ("The
Border" starring Jack Nicholson).</TE>
<TE>   He established long-term friendships with then-Paramount Studios
Chairman Barry Diller, former agent Michael Ovitz and actor Michael
Douglas.</TE>
<TE>   But he quickly realized the limits of a freelance Hollywood career
and moved to New York in 1982 to work at Seagram for his father,
Edgar M. Bronfman.</TE>
<TE>   At first dismissed as a rich man's son with an arrogant attitude,
Bronfman eventually won respect for refocusing the company on upscale
liquor brands and increasing profit by slashing Seagram's work force.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Bronfman never lost his lust for Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   As Seagram's chief operating officer, Bronfman began venturing
into the entertainment arena, acquiring 15% of Time Warner Inc. from
1993 to 1995. After being promoted to chief executive, Bronfman
convinced the Seagram board to buy 80% of Universal Studios' parent
company, MCA Inc., for $5.7 billion in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Bronfman now was a player, and through a couple of strategic
moves, he made his mark on Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   With the acquisition of PolyGram Music in 1998, he transformed MCA
Music, a second-tier company known mostly for its urban and country
acts, into the world's largest record company. He hired Ron Meyer as
president of Universal Studios, laying the groundwork for a
management team that currently is one of the movie industry's
strongest. And he pushed forward the construction of the $2.5-billion
Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Fla., to wide acclaim.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of accomplishing that," Bronfman said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, there are other, less rosy, views of those years.</TE>
<TE>   Bronfman earned the enmity of the movie industry with his efforts
to impose on the studios the cost-based financial models he had
learned at Seagram. And his stiff, patrician manner isolated him in a
culture in which relationships depend on instant intimacy.</TE>
<TE>   More significant, Bronfman slighted MCA's aging patriarch, Lew
Wasserman, who had advised U.S. presidents from Kennedy to Clinton,
by excluding the legendary Hollywood power broker from a significant
role at the studio.</TE>
<TE>   The industry delighted in speculating that Bronfman had been
snookered when he sold 55% of Universal's television assets,
including USA Network, to Barry Diller in a complex 1997 agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Some said Bronfman was taking his revenge when he invoked a clause
in the agreement and killed a deal Diller was hatching to buy NBC
because it would have diluted Bronfman's stake in the company.</TE>
<TE>   In his new role, Bronfman will be working closely with
Diller--something Diller says he welcomes.</TE>
<TE>   "The relationship was able to withstand the [earlier] conflict,"
said Diller, chairman of Vivendi Universal Entertainment. "Contrary
to popular mythology, I have been and continue to be friends with
Edgar. Having Edgar involved [in Vivendi], in whatever way, is in no
part negative."</TE>
<TE>   When asked what role Diller would play in the future of Vivendi's
entertainment companies, Bronfman declined to comment other than to
say Diller would be a factor in determining that future.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Bronfman agreed to merge with Vivendi in what started as
a $34-billion deal that ended up being worth $24 billion when the
company's stock slumped. Bronfman and then-Vivendi CEO Jean-Marie
Messier believed they could create a rival to AOL Time Warner Inc. by
linking movies, music and cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   But that vision failed to excite Wall Street. That, combined with
a downturn in the market for media companies and Messier's
uncontrolled spending, triggered the downward spiral in Vivendi's
share price.</TE>
<TE>   Bronfman declined to discuss rumored fissures in his once
tightknit family attributed to the lost wealth, as did other members
of the clan. But he made it clear that he feels betrayed by Messier.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I wish Jean-Marie had been a different person? Do I wish he
hadn't lost his head and structured a company that could not survive?
Sure," Bronfman said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he added, "We did the right thing for Seagram shareholders
by selling at the top of the market. It's hard to say where we would
be if we hadn't sold the company. The whole media sector has had
trouble. Granted, Vivendi is in worse shape than the other
companies....Knowing what I know now, would I do the same thing? Yes.
If you sold your shares when the company was sold you'd be very
happy."</TE>
<TE>   Bronfman's first step in rebuilding his reputation came earlier
this year when he led the boardroom coup to oust Messier.</TE>
<TE>   "In the spring and summer, it was increasingly clear that all was
not well with the company," Bronfman said. Messier could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Bronfman also was key in lining up emergency bank loans to help
ease Vivendi's cash shortfall. When that crisis was averted, he
became less engaged, he said, until he was approached by Fourtou.</TE>
<TE>   "Jean-Rene came to me in September when it became increasingly
apparent that [Vivendi Universal] would retain some interest in
entertainment assets and he asked if I could be of help," Bronfman
said. Fourtou, through a spokesman, declined to comment about
Bronfman's expanded role.</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment assets, so far, have weathered Vivendi's
financial turmoil unscathed. The movie and music businesses continue
to be moneymakers for the company.</TE>
<TE>   "We can help them stay focused as long as they believe that, in
short order, there will be greater clarity about their future,"
Bronfman said.</TE>
<TE>   The first step is working with Fourtou to "determine what
strategic direction to take," Bronfman said. "There are probably a
hundred different scenarios that can get you to that end point," he
said, noting that they will be sorting through those options for "a
few more months."</TE>
<TE>   Bronfman refused Fourtou's request that he take a salaried
executive position, saying he has no desire to concern himself with
day-to-day management. Instead, he said his goal will be to improve
the Paris-to-Hollywood communication.</TE>
<TE>   With so many possible future configurations, not to mention rival
media companies circling it, Vivendi's business-as-usual approach
will be difficult to sustain.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's prize companies are heading for a tense period sure to
be filled with rumors about the company's future.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just French versus English," Bronfman said. "It's a new
industry for Fourtou. Industries have their own language and rhythms.
He has told me, 'I don't know these businesses and I need someone to
interpret these discussions for me.' Every important discussion that
involves the U.S. entertainment assets is a discussion that Jean-Rene
and I have. I expect the next couple of months to be pretty intense."</TE>

<HD>EchoStar, Hughes Seek to Delay Ruling</HD>
<DH>Media: Two satellite TV providers ask the FCC to postpone
review of their proposed merger and hold a public hearing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an apparent last-ditch effort to salvage their merger, EchoStar
Communications Corp. and Hughes Electronics Corp. asked the Federal
Communications Commission on Monday to delay its review so the
companies can discuss the possibility of major revisions.</LD>
<LD>   The two satellite TV providers, in a letter filed Monday, also
asked the agency to hold a public hearing on the merger before
completing its review.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the FCC, which had been poised to block the deal as
early as this week, declined to comment. But sources inside the
agency dismissed the letter--particularly the sudden interest in a
public hearing--as a transparent delaying tactic and vowed to move
forward as scheduled.</LD>
<TE>   A majority of FCC commissioners are prepared to block the deal,
but a vote is not expected until Wednesday because EchoStar Chairman
Charlie Ergen was scheduled to meet with some commissioners today.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar's proposed $15-billion purchase of satellite rival
DirecTV and its parent, Hughes, was announced a year ago. If
approved, the merger would combine the No. 1 and No. 2 satellite TV
providers and create a pay-television giant reaching 18 million
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were not surprised that Ergen would launch a last-minute
campaign to save the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "No eleventh-hour concessions can change the simple fact that this
merger would create a monopoly, leading to higher prices ...
especially in rural America," said Adam Schwartz, a vice president of
the National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative, a reseller of
DirecTV in rural markets.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar spokesman Marc Lumpkin said the company wants more time
to discuss the possibility of making changes to the merger that would
address the concerns of regulators. But he cautioned that EchoStar
has not promised to make any revisions--only to talk about the
possibility of making them. He declined to comment on what sort of
concessions the companies might offer.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, the companies said the changes would go beyond a
previous promise to offer a national pricing plan to ensure that
rural customers are not hurt by the loss of competition.</TE>
<TE>   One concession Ergen may offer is to give up some of the combined
company's satellite slots. New York-based Cablevision Systems Corp.
has offered to take over some EchoStar-DirecTV frequencies and create
a rival satellite firm, but EchoStar has been cool to the offer.
EchoStar attorneys said they had set up a schedule with the Justice
Department--which also must approve the deal--to discuss possible
changes, and they plan to present "structural remedy proposals" to
Assistant Atty. Gen. Charles James on Oct. 28. They asked the FCC to
delay its ruling until after the Justice Department has acted.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the FCC does not complete its merger review until
the Justice Department decides whether a deal violates antitrust law.
But FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell has said he would release a
decision as soon as it is ready.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar's shares closed Monday at $17.02, up 7 cents on Nasdaq.
Hughes' shares fell 7 cents to close at $8.92 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Economic Toll of Shutdown Spreads</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MARLA DICKERSON and ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vlady Cornateanu's Halloween sales are a bust because his witches and
goblins are stuck at sea. Navy reservist Anna Weber can't get back to
her Iowa janitor job because her car is trapped inside the Port of
Los Angeles. Van Nuys retailer Steven Dunn has laid off 23
employees--40% of his work force--because he can't get his shipment
of infant toys from China.</LD>
<LD>   Even as the Bush administration took steps Monday to reopen West
Coast ports, the economic toll of the shutdown is rising fast. The
blow that initially struck truckers, shipping lines and farmers is
rippling to other parts of the economy.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts have estimated the losses at anywhere from $1 billion to
$2 billion a day as manufacturers run low on parts, exporters lose
sales and retailers watch supplies of key merchandise dwindle. No one
knows for sure what the real number is or how much of those losses
can be recouped. But few people question that the shutdown is
entering a crucial phase for a U.S. economy that has embraced lean
inventory practices that require a swift, smooth flow of goods to
keep the wheels of commerce turning.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a strong sense that if this continues for another week
it will have a major, negative impact on manufacturing," said William
Primosch, director of international business policy for the National
Assn. of Manufacturers in Washington. "Because of just-in-time
production, no one has big supplies of inventory or parts on hand. It
starts with an industry like autos and just goes down the line."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Monday brought the second announced shutdown of a U.S.
auto plant since the dockworker lockout at 29 West Coast ports began
Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Co.'s production of 767 and 777 jetliners in Seattle, made
with fuselage panels, cargo doors and other parts from Asia, is
beginning to be disrupted. Parts are on ships anchored off Seattle
and Tacoma, Wash., forcing Boeing to juggle the order of work on some
jets, spokesman Peter Conte said.</TE>
<TE>   For exporters of perishable goods, the window for moving cargo is
quickly closing. Dole Food Co., the world's largest producer of fresh
fruit and vegetables, sought an emergency court order that would
allow it to retrieve more than 8.3 million pounds of bananas,
plantains and yuccas being held in 241 refrigerated containers on the
dock at the Port of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village-based Dole said in court papers it stood to lose
more than $1.7 million unless it could get access to the produce,
shipped last week from Ecuador. Named as defendants in the action are
the Pacific Maritime Assn. and one of its members, Transpacific
Container Service Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Sunkist Growers Inc. estimated that it stands to lose
about $2.1 million a week in citrus export sales.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, consumers can expect to pay more for bananas in
coming weeks, the California Farm Bureau warned. In some cases,
wholesale produce firms are charging double for bananas as their
supplies have dwindled.</TE>
<TE>   Automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said it would halt production at
its Normal, Ill., assembly plant Wednesday because the port closures
had reduced supplies of parts from Asia needed to make passenger
cars. About 3,000 employees will be offered paid training, vacation
time or unpaid leave.</TE>
<TE>   Other automakers are turning to expensive air freight to keep
their factories running.</TE>
<TE>   The New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. plant in Fremont, Calif.,
which shut down last week, reopened its passenger car assembly line
Monday after receiving two shipments of parts, including heavy
transmissions, flown from Japan on chartered 747 jets. The plant is a
joint venture of General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the airlifts are too costly to provide more than a stopgap
alternative to ocean freight.</TE>
<TE>   Production has been slashed at many of the nation's beef and pork
plants, in some cases by as much as half, as cold storage facilities
fill up with expensive cuts bound for Asian markets, the American
Farm Bureau Federation said.</TE>
<TE>   Minneapolis-based meat producer Cargill Inc. said its Excel beef
unit has gone from a typically six-day plant schedule down to five in
the last two weeks and the company has had to pay extra to haul its
beef to outside cold storage since its own facilities are full.</TE>
<TE>   Large corporations aren't the only ones feeling the pain from the
port shutdown. Small-business owners nationwide say they are caught
in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial photographer Joe Atlas stands to lose one of his
biggest jobs of the year shooting photos of furniture for a major
trade show this week in North Carolina. With their goods bobbing on
the water somewhere in the Pacific, several of his furniture clients
probably will cancel all or part of their contracts, Atlas said.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel pretty helpless," said Atlas, of Atwater Village. "I
don't have the ear of politicians or unions to fight for my
concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Small manufacturers likewise lack deep pockets to absorb losses
from canceled orders and out-of-date merchandise. Vlady Cornateanu,
president of novelty clothing maker Addiction Apparel in downtown Los
Angeles, said he had about $100,000 in merchandise--including men's
ties with witches and pumpkins for Halloween--waiting somewhere
offshore.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the dispute is settled within the next few days,
Cornateanu said, untangling the mess of containers at the ports could
take weeks, well after the deadline for sending Addiction's wares to
stores in time for Halloween.</TE>
<TE>   "Some retailers are just looking to cancel orders. If you're not
on time, too bad," Cornateanu said. "By the end of this week, we'll
be getting cancellation letters."</TE>
<TE>   Munchkin Inc., a Van Nuys manufacturer of infant toys and
products, already has laid off 23 of its 58 employees and is looking
at more pink slips for later this week or next.</TE>
<TE>   To stay in customers' good graces, the company has been shipping
products by air. But unlike with a truck or passenger car, the costs
can't easily be absorbed on items that retail for just a few dollars.
Munchkin's two-packs of children's no-spill cups, which retail at
Wal-Mart for about $3.99, cost about 14 cents to bring in by boat,
company President Steven Dunn said. Bringing in the same item by air
costs about $2.50, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're losing money on every product we're air-freighting in,"
Dunn said. "We're just eating those costs to maintain the price to
our customers."</TE>
<TE>   That's why air really isn't an option for the majority of
ocean-shipped goods, said Guy Fox, executive vice president with
Global Transportation Services Inc. and chairman of the Los Angeles
Air Cargo Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Air-freight space is tight industrywide--this time of year
normally is busy for shipments anyway--which has sent air-freight
prices soaring 40% or more for those customers not under long-term
contracts with carriers. "Prices are changing on a daily basis," said
United Parcel Service spokeswoman Lynette McIntire.</TE>
<TE>   As for Anna Weber, she is just trying to get home to Iowa. The
Navy reservist has been serving in Hawaii since January doing a
voluntary tour of service after last year's terrorist attacks. She
flew to Los Angeles last week, hoping to get her car, which had been
shipped ahead on a cargo vessel. Unable to retrieve it, she and her
husband have been forced to bunk with a cousin in Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   They both have lives and jobs to return to. They just missed a
family reunion and their savings are running low.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm being held hostage," Weber said. "It's the little
people that are paying for this."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Is First Customer for Honda's Fuel-Cell Cars</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Los Angeles on Monday became the first retail customer in
the U.S. for fuel-cell-powered passenger vehicles, announcing that it
will lease five of the hydrogen-fueled, zero-emission cars from
Torrance-based American Honda Motor Co. by the end of the year.</LD>
<LD>   The deal was announced by Mayor James K. Hahn, who called it an
important step in the development of fuel-cell technology.</LD>
<LD>   Tests such as the Honda-Los Angeles program are considered
critical for putting the vehicles on the road and subjecting them to
real-world stresses, said Tom Elliott, executive vice president of
American Honda.</LD>
<TE>   City employees will begin learning immediately how to operate and
service the Honda FCX fuel-cell car, which has been certified by the
California Air Resources Board and the federal Environmental
Protection Agency as a zero-emission vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The FCX has a range of up to 220 miles, seating for four and the
performance characteristics of a four-cylinder Honda Civic. City
employees will use the vehicles as regular pool cars and for
commuting. Plans for refueling systems are being developed.</TE>
<TE>   Almost every major automaker is developing fuel-cell-powered
vehicles, and most have announced plans to begin field tests over the
next several years.</TE>
<TE>   Torrance-based Toyota Motor Sales America, the U.S. arm of
Japanese automotive giant Toyota Motor Corp., earlier this year said
it will sell or lease a sizable number of fuel-cell vehicles to
private and government entities in North America by year's end, but
so far it has not identified its customers. And DaimlerChrysler
officials in Germany said Monday that the company will place 60
fuel-cell cars with customers in Europe, Asia and the U.S. for field
tests beginning next year.</TE>
<TE>   Fuel-cell-powered vehicles convert hydrogen to electricity in an
electro-chemical process. The Honda model has water vapor as its only
tailpipe emission. The electricity then powers an electric motor that
propels the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike battery-powered electric cars, fuel-cell vehicles do not
need to be recharged from the electric power grid. They do, however,
need a steady supply of fuel-grade hydrogen, and most fuel-cell
development specialists say it will be a decade or more before a
nationwide retail hydrogen fuel system could be readied.</TE>

<HD>Idun Hopes Nobel Attracts Financing</HD>
<DH>Drugs: The San Diego firm is optimistic that the award to
its founder will increase backing of its cell-death research. But
that isn't a sure bet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What is a Nobel Prize worth to Idun Pharmaceuticals?</LD>
<LD>   The small San Diego company has an exclusive license on the
discoveries by Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist H.
Robert Horvitz, including his breakthrough work on the "cell death"
gene that on Monday won the Nobel Prize in medicine. Horvitz
co-founded Idun, named for the Norse goddess of eternal youth, in
1994 to transform his science into medicines for heart attack, stroke
and cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The company, with just 55 employees, is several years and many
millions of dollars from delivering a drug to patients. Harnessing
the biology that controls cell death into a single pill has proved
extraordinarily difficult. Persuading investors to back a visionary
but risky technology that only recently has received attention from
big pharmaceutical companies has been just as tough.</LD>
<TE>   The privately held company is preparing to close a round of
financing that took six months longer than expected and values the
company at one-tenth the amount it commanded in 1999. Idun lost 20%
of its employees in the last year because of a salary freeze
implemented to conserve cash.</TE>
<TE>   The company hopes that the Nobel Prize will assist its
fund-raising efforts. "With this level of validation, hopefully, they
will pay attention and realize this may be really important," said
Chief Executive Steven J. Mento.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is evidence that even a Nobel Prize isn't a sure bet
in biotechnology, where it takes many years to translate a laboratory
observation into a mass-produced drug. Colorado-based Ribozyme
Pharmaceuticals Inc. is testing a drug that uses Nobel Prize-winning
cell-replication technology, but the company is out of favor with
investors. Its shares closed Monday at 33 cents on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes 10 to 15 years to go from cutting-edge research to drug
development," said John McCamant of the Medical Technology Stock
Letter in Berkeley. "A lot of things can happen when you take a drug
from the laboratory to the human body."</TE>
<TE>   Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis ended a collaboration with
Idun in 1998 after the companies found that a drug that appeared to
prevent brain cell death in the laboratory would not work in people.</TE>
<TE>   Idun's lead drug candidate is designed to prevent the death of
cells damaged by liver disease. Mento said Idun chose liver disease
because the company has the technology to direct cells to that organ.
The drug is about to enter the second of three phases of human
testing required by the Food and Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Idun, like many California biotechnology companies, was born of
invention and frustration. Horvitz and co-founder John C. Reed formed
the firm after big pharmaceutical companies rejected cell-death
technologies as too risky.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mercks, the Pfizers, they thought it was all too early stage,
and they did not want to take the first steps," said Reed, president
of the Burnham Institute, a San Diego-based cancer research center.
"It was really out of that frustration that we decided to seek more
open-minded investors."</TE>
<TE>   The company has raised a total of about $75 million since its
inception, with $15 million of that from venture capitalists and the
rest from pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis.</TE>
<TE>   Horvitz's discovery of the cell-death gene anchors an intellectual
property portfolio that includes 100 patents related to the
mechanisms that cause cells to commit suicide. Though Horvitz studied
a worm, humans have a similar gene that triggers production of an
enzyme that causes cells to die.</TE>
<TE>   Horvitz is chairman of Idun's scientific advisory board and
attends its board meetings, though he is not a corporate director. He
belongs to a group of founders who will own less than 10% of the
company when the latest round of financing is completed, probably
before the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Idun is using the technology in two ways. Relying on Horvitz's
expertise, it is developing drugs to halt the death of cells
threatened by injury or disease. It also is developing drugs that
hasten the death of cancer cells, Reed's specialty.</TE>

<HD>Bad News Keeps Investors at Bay</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Sears' profit warning, war worries and the
port shutdown help send indexes to new multiyear lows. Treasury
yields fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks fell for a fourth straight session Monday as a dismal earnings
forecast from retailer Sears Roebuck and fear of a U.S.-Iraq war
helped drive market indexes to new multiyear lows.</LD>
<LD>   The market passed another unwelcome milestone: The benchmark
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index now has fallen 48.6% from its March 2000
peak. That surpasses the 48.2% price decline of the 1973-74 bear
market, making this the worst bear since the S&amp;P 500 tumbled 54% in
1937-38.</LD>
<LD>   The continued shutdown of West Coast ports also weighed on
investors, despite moves by the Bush administration to intervene in
the labor dispute.</LD>
<TE>   "There are just no signs of buying interest," said Arnold Kaufman,
editor of the S&amp;P Outlook newsletter. "The news continues to be poor,
and there are no heroes out there to step up and buy stocks."</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 lost 15.30 points, or 1.9%, to 785.28, becoming the
last of the three major indexes to break through the multiyear low it
set during the summer. It was the index's lowest close since April
1997.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average fell 105.56 points, or
1.4%, to 7,422.84. It was the Dow's second straight triple-digit loss
and its lowest close since October 1997.</TE>
<TE>   A late wave of selling sent the tech-packed Nasdaq composite index
down 20.50 points, or 1.8%, to 1,119.40. Nasdaq closed at levels last
seen in August 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by more than 3 to 1 on the New York
Stock Exchange and by 8 to 3 on Nasdaq. Trading was active but down
from Friday's levels.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were skittish in anticipation of President Bush's
televised speech Monday evening, an effort to rally Americans behind
a possible military strike against Iraq. War talk has dogged the
market for weeks as investors worry that a military strike could
imperil the frail U.S. economic recovery.</TE>
<TE>   The market enjoyed a fleeting rally at midday that some credited
to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said that despite a
sharp climb in business failures and investor losses in recent years,
the nation's financial system remains in good shape.</TE>
<TE>   But the rally failed to hold as the dimming outlook for corporate
profits continued to top investors' list of worries.</TE>
<TE>   Sears, the No. 4 U.S. retailer, sank $5.39 to $32.25 after it
warned that third-quarter profit would be below Wall Street
expectations because of rising losses on its credit card accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The damage spread to other retailers and credit card issuers. The
S&amp;P retail index slid 4.4%, led by Home Depot, off $1.59 to $24.21,
and Wal-Mart Stores, down $1.40 to $50.35. Among other big retailers,
Federated Department Stores dropped $1.62 to $26.40 and Target lost
$2.20 to $26.15.</TE>
<TE>   Among consumer finance firms, Capital One Financial dropped $2.32
to $28.06, and Household International fell $1.41 to $23.25. Goldman
Sachs cuts its ratings on the shares.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't just consumer- related stocks that were hit. Utility
TXU sank $4.40, or 16%, to $22.64 after slashing its profit outlook
for next year by more than a quarter because of low power prices and
fierce competition in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   And Cisco Systems fell 38 cents to $9.08 after Deutsche Banc
Securities cut its fiscal second-quarter and full-year earnings
estimates for the maker of Internet gear, citing a slowdown in U.S.
economic activity. Rival Juniper Networks lost 38 cents to $4.43.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields fell, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year
T-note to 3.62% from Friday's close of 3.67% as concern that the U.S.
will attack Iraq fueled demand for the safest investments.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is not doing well, stocks are plunging; and add to
that an impending war, and demand for Treasuries is going to remain
high," said Christopher Mahony, who manages fixed-income assets at
J&amp;W Seligman &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Among other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Fears that Japan's decision to fix debt-saddled banks might lead
to a spate of corporate failures sent share prices plunging in Tokyo
to a 19-year low. The benchmark 225-stock Nikkei index closed down
339.55 points, or 3.8%, at 8,668.00. The Nikkei last hit a lower
finish on June 16, 1983, when it closed at 8,645.33. Meanwhile, the
dollar surged against the yen. Japan stocks were higher in early
trading today.</TE>
<TE>   * Intel, the world's biggest chip maker, rose 11 cents to $13.82
after Chief Executive Craig Barrett said he was optimistic about the
tech sector and saw the current crisis ending by early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   * On a less rosy note, Prudential Securities cut its ratings on
the semiconductor industry, saying it now expects a more "muted"
recovery in the sector. Prudential cut ratings on LSI Logic, Broadcom
and others and cut price targets, estimates or both for Texas
Instruments and others in the sector.</TE>
<TE>   LSI fell 42 cents to $5.23, Broadcom shed 41 cents to $9.70, and
Texas Instruments ended down 43 cents at $14.25. The SOX index of
semiconductor stocks tumbled 3.1% to a new multiyear low and is down
58% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   * Philip Morris climbed $1.99 to $38.58, offering support to the
Dow. The stock sank Friday after a jury in Los Angeles ordered the
world's largest cigarette maker to pay $28 billion in damages to a
woman with lung cancer.</TE>

<HD>Ovitz Is Sued by Another Former Top Exec of AMG</HD>
<DH>Courts: Film unit head alleges mogul fired her for sharing
suspicions about him with auditors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA M. BUSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Onetime super-agent Michael Ovitz is being sued again by a former top
executive.</LD>
<LD>   Cathy Schulman, the former president of Ovitz's film production
division at now-defunct Artists Management Group, said in court
papers that her former boss flew into a "rage" and fired her for
telling auditors that she suspected Ovitz of "improperly allocating"
film company funds.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, which seeks more than $4 million in damages for
wrongful termination and breach of contract, also accuses Ovitz of
denying her producing credits and fees.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit filed Monday in Los Angeles County Superior Court
comes nearly six months after Ovitz was sued by the former president
of his television division. In that suit, Eric Tannenbaum is seeking
$9.6 million, claiming breach of contract, fraud and defamation.
Ovitz has since countersued Tannenbaum, accusing him of fiscal
irresponsibility. Those cases are pending.</TE>
<TE>   Once considered Hollywood's most powerful agent, Ovitz was forced
to sell Artists Management Group in May after the television business
failed and investors, including Vivendi Universal's StudioCanal,
backed out. What followed was a stunning meltdown in which Ovitz
claimed he was the victim of a well-orchestrated attack by
Hollywood's "gay mafia" and other enemies. Ovitz later apologized for
the comment.</TE>
<TE>   Schulman's lawsuit names Ovitz, StudioCanal and Ovitz's feature
film unit, Artists Production Group. The lawsuit cites 11 causes of
action, including wrongful termination, breach of contract, fraud and
defamation.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Ovitz and Vivendi declined to comment, saying
they had not seen the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit centers on an agreement between APG and StudioCanal
under which StudioCanal paid $8 million a year to cover overhead and
film project development costs. In return, StudioCanal would receive
foreign distribution rights and share in the profit of films produced
by the joint venture.</TE>
<TE>   The joint venture began unraveling this year after a routine audit
by Vivendi Universal raised questions about how more than $2 million
was spent.</TE>
<TE>   According to the complaint, Schulman was interviewed by a Vivendi
Universal auditor Feb. 4 and disclosed that she and other APG
employees were using StudioCanal funds "developing projects in which
StudioCanal had no interest." She also relayed suspicions to auditors
that "APG was improperly allocating and billing these non-venture
related time and expenditures to StudioCanal."</TE>
<TE>   Schulman's attorney, Randy Sunshine, said that until Schulman's
firing there was no indication that she was performing inadequately.</TE>
<TE>   "She answered questions truthfully as she was obligated to do, and
for that she was fired," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schulman, who joined Ovitz's company shortly after its inception,
was responsible for overseeing the development and production of
feature films. Her contract was renewed for three years in January
2001, at which time she was given "up to a 10% equity interest" in
the film company, $600,000 a year in salary and a promise of
producing fees and credits on movies that the film unit developed and
produced, the complaint states.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a month before Schulman's termination, the suit says,
Ovitz "lauded APG's progress in a nationally televised interview." It
was a reference to Ovitz's interview on the Jan. 23 Charlie Rose
show, during which Ovitz said, "The theatrical production business is
going really, really well."</TE>
<TE>   The following day, though, Ovitz announced he had hired former
Columbia Pictures chairman-turned producer Mark Canton as chairman
and chief executive of APG, a move that vaulted him over Schulman,
who had been running the division since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Schulman began negotiating her exit from her
presidency post to become a producer at APG.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't mention Mr. Canton in the complaint, but he obviously
did enter the picture and may have relevant testimony to give,"
Sunshine said.</TE>
<TE>   Schulman stated in the complaint that she had become frustrated by
Ovitz's efforts to "prevent her from using funds" from StudioCanal to
develop and produce movies and hire staff for the joint venture. She
stated she also was "thwarted by Ovitz and the various financial
managers within APG, who cited imaginary budgetary overages as the
reason to deny Schulman's requests."</TE>
<TE>   It is at that point, Schulman said, that she "began to suspect
that the overhead moneys contributed by StudioCanal that were
supposed to be used for venture-related projects were neither being
used nor allocated in a proper manner," the lawsuit claims.</TE>
<TE>   She also alleges that Ovitz never invested the "millions of
dollars annually" toward overhead and development that were
"required" under the joint agreement.</TE>
<TE>   When Ovitz learned that Schulman had told auditors she believed
money was being used improperly, he immediately fired her and she was
escorted out of the building on Feb. 14, according to the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Schulman also is seeking credits on the more than 40 projects that
she says she developed at APG. One of the more high-profile films is
Michael Crichton's "Timeline," which is scheduled to be released by
Paramount Pictures in May.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint could be problematic for Paramount, because one of
its most important films has been caught in litigation cross fire. It
would not be unusual for attorneys to ask for an injunction on the
release of the film. Sunshine declined to comment on whether he would
pursue such a tactic.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Tannenbaum did in his complaint, Schulman also alleges
that Ovitz "lured" her and other executives to his company "under
false representations of unlimited financial resources and promises
of running and owning a significant share" of the company.</TE>
<TE>   Schulman also alleges that her ex-boss is using her as a
"scapegoat," claiming, among other things, that she was "responsible
for APG's fraudulent financial reportings to StudioCanal."</TE>

<HD>Pimco Surpasses Vanguard 500</HD>
<DH>Finance: The bond fund becomes the nation's biggest mutual
fund, ending September with $64.6 billion. Ex-leader slips to $62.8
billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Bond king" Bill Gross has a new crown: His Newport Beach-based
mutual fund now is the nation's largest.</LD>
<LD>   Gross' Pimco Total Return fund ended September with $64.6 billion
under management, while assets in the former leader, the Vanguard 500
Index stock fund, sank to $62.8 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The rise of the Pimco bond fund and the decline of the Vanguard
stock fund illustrate the dramatic shift in U.S. financial markets
over the last two years. As the now 30-month-old decline in stocks
has devastated equity fund portfolios, many Americans have shifted
money into the relative safety of interest-bearing government and
high-quality corporate bonds.</LD>
<TE>   That has been a boon for Gross' Pacific Investment Management Co.,
one of the world's best-known bond investment houses.</TE>
<TE>   Pimco Total Return lured $10.2 billion in net new investment in
the first eight months of this year, making the fund the industry's
biggest winner, according to Boston-based Financial Research Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Stock funds on balance have seen money flow out this year.</TE>
<TE>   Falling market interest rates have boosted the value of
high-quality bonds, fueling strong returns on many bond funds. Pimco
Total Return Class A shares are up 7% this year, including principal
appreciation and interest earned. Vanguard 500, which closely tracks
the blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, is down 30.8% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Berry, analyst at fund tracker Morningstar Inc., said many
investors have continued to reallocate assets as they find stock
funds "far more volatile" than they realized.</TE>
<TE>   But as bonds boom in popularity, some experts warn that investors
could get whipsawed when interest rates rebound, which would depress
bond values. Vanguard, which also manages bond mutual funds, has been
cautioning its investors against chasing performance by getting
carried away with fixed income.</TE>
<TE>   "Bonds belong in most investors' portfolios as a diversification
tool. But if you're just seeking greater returns than the stock
market has provided in the last couple of years, you may be making a
change for the wrong reasons," said Vanguard spokesman John Woerth.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Monday, Gross acknowledged that a spike in
interest rates--now near generational lows--would depress prices on
most bonds. But as for the flood of money into Pimco Total Return and
other bond funds over the last year, Gross said, "To the extent that
investors are more diversified now, that's all to the good."</TE>
<TE>   He said Treasury securities look the most "toppy," as investors
have flocked to government debt in a flight to safety. Pimco Total
Return's portfolio is focused more on corporate and mortgage debt,
Gross said, although he conceded that rising interest rates could
hurt most bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have long given Gross high marks for his portfolio
management skills. "It's really hard to find a fund with a better
long-term record or a more proven manager than" Gross, Berry said.
Pimco Total Return has beaten a broad Lehman Bros. bond index seven
straight calendar years.</TE>
<TE>   Gross, 58, who co-founded Pacific Investment Management in 1971,
has become to the bond market what Fidelity Investments' Peter Lynch
was to the stock market in the 1980s: the guru whose words carry
enormous weight. Fortune magazine and others have dubbed him the
"bond king."</TE>
<TE>   Gross is known for his humor-laced, and sometimes acerbic, written
commentaries. Last spring, he assailed General Electric Co.'s debt
load.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, he said the Dow industrials could fall to 5,000
before the bear market is over. "Stocks stink and will continue to do
so until they're priced appropriately," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Pimco fund's new title as the industry's largest, Gross
said Monday: "It's no knock on Vanguard 500 that stocks have been
going down while bonds have held up. But as for our fund being No. 1
and not others, our team has done a great job of returning value to
investors over the years."</TE>

<LD>U.S. consumer debt grew in August at the slowest rate in eight
months, dragged down by the smallest increase in auto loans in more
than three years, the Federal Reserve said.</LD>
<LD>   Personal borrowing, excluding mortgages, rose at a 2.9% annual
rate, or $4.2 billion, in August, the Fed said. Nonrevolving loans,
including those for auto purchases, rose in August at the slowest
rate since June 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The rise in total borrowing was the smallest since a 2.8% increase
in December. Consumer confidence has slipped for four straight
months, reflecting weak job growth and the declining stock market.</LD>

International Inc. founder and director Philip Anschutz a second time
about his role in the company's day-to-day affairs, a congressional
spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   The renewed interest in Anschutz arose from public testimony last
week from former Qwest Chairman and Chief Executive Joseph Nacchio,
who said he talked to Anschutz about all major decisions, said Ken
Johnson, spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</LD>
<LD>   Anschutz, Nacchio's co-chairman, told investigators he was largely
uninvolved, Johnson said.</LD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges alleging
fraud against WorldCom Inc.'s former general accounting director
hours after he admitted playing a criminal role in the telephone
giant's financial collapse.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC's action against Buford Yates, 46, alleged he
"participated in a massive fraud that inflated the company's earnings
at the direction and with the knowledge of WorldCom's senior
management."</LD>
<LD>   Earlier in the day, Yates pleaded guilty to two felony charges
that he conspired to commit and committed securities fraud, saying
his supervisors told him to make "adjustments" to the company's
books.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC's action seeks a return of all ill-gotten gains, civil
fines and to bar Yates from serving as an officer or director of a
public company.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, WorldCom's board of directors may revoke the
$1.5-million annual pension awarded to former Chief Executive Bernard
J. Ebbers after he resigned in April, sources said.</TE>

<LD>Drug makers Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. settled
claims that they knew or should have known that a Kansas City, Mo.,
pharmacist was diluting cancer drugs.</LD>
<LD>   The companies did not disclose the terms. A spokesman for
Indianapolis-based Lilly would not say whether there was a financial
component to the settlement, but he said the settlement would not
have a material effect on the company.</LD>
<LD>   Pharmacist Robert Courtney pleaded guilty in February to diluting
lifesaving chemotherapy drugs prescribed to thousands of cancer
patients, some of whom sued the companies that supplied Courtney with
the drugs.</LD>
<TE>   The drug companies have said there is no evidence they were at
fault.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ribapharm Inc. shares fell for a second day after Schering-Plough
Corp. said it expects increased generic competition for a liver
disease drug sold by the two companies.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Ribapharm fell 50 cents, or 14%, to $3.15 in NYSE
trading. ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., which owns 83% of Ribapharm, fell
80 cents to $7.39.</LD>
<LD>   Ribapharm licenses ribavirin, its only product, to
Schering-Plough, which sells the drug as Rebetol in combination with
its Peg-Intron medicine. The drugs treat hepatitis C.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Schering-Plough said 2003 profit may be hurt by generic
competition in the U.S. for ribavirin, prompting shares to fall 12%.</TE>

<HD>Overseas Investors Buy L.A.'s Figueroa Plaza</HD>

<AU>ROGER VINCENT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pair of office buildings in downtown Los Angeles has been sold to
overseas investors for $91.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   Figueroa Plaza--twin 16-story towers at 201 and 221 N. Figueroa
St.--was bought by Northridge Capital, a Washington-based firm that
makes investments for wealthy individuals.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the investors are from Europe, said real estate broker
David Doupe of Insignia/ESG, whose firm represented both parties in
the sale. This is Northridge Capital's first investment in the West
and represents growing buyer interest in downtown Los Angeles, he
said.</LD>
<TE>   "The attitude among investors has changed substantially," said
Doupe, who credited the growing base of housing downtown as the key
factor attracting buyers. The amount of available office space rose
for the last two quarters and stands at 21.4% of the market, Insignia
said.</TE>
<TE>   Figueroa Plaza's towers were completed in 1986 and 1991 and house
615,112 square feet. They are almost completely leased to such
tenants as law firm Lewis, Brisbois, Bisgaard and Smith, Los Angeles
County and the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The seller was a venture of Goldman Sachs and Insignia Financial
Services Co.-Investment Group, which bid $77 million for the property
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Recent downtown office sales include BP Plaza for about $200 per
square foot and interest in KPMG Tower for about $220 per square
foot. Figueroa Plaza traded for about $148 a foot.</TE>

<HD>Sears Shares Fall as Profit Fails to Meet Expectations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. shares fell 14% on Monday, the biggest drop in
15 years, after the largest department store chain said third-quarter
profit would be less than forecast because more credit card customers
are having trouble paying their bills.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Chief Executive Alan Lacy said he dismissed
Kevin Keleghan, head of the credit card unit, because he "lost
confidence in his personal credibility."</LD>
<LD>   Sears said it increased reserves for uncollectable credit card
accounts by about 10% in the third quarter and expected to raise them
more in the current quarter.</LD>
<TE>   The company has become increasingly reliant on profit from the
credit card unit as sales have dropped in the last 12 months. Sears
customers typically charge large purchases such as Kenmore
appliances. The card unit generated nearly two-thirds of Sears'
overall profit in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Sears said third-quarter profit would be 80 cents to 82 cents a
share, compared with 80 cents a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by
Thomson First Call forecast 86 cents. Sears said it still expected to
meet its full-year target of $5.15 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Lacy said Keleghan's departure, announced Friday, "has nothing to
do with the business performance." Lacy declined to comment further
on the firing. Keleghan didn't return calls.</TE>
<TE>   Sears shares fell $5.39 to $32.25 in New York Stock Exchange
trading. The stock is down 32% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of banks and other credit card lenders have dropped in the
last week amid concern that the weak economy will hurt profit.</TE>
<TE>   Sears, which in past years has been penalized for its
high-pressure tactics in collecting from bankrupt credit card
holders, was fined $60 million and paid $498 million in 1999 for
settlements related to credit card disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Keleghan was named president of the credit unit in 1999, after
working for Sears in risk management and card products. He joined
Sears in 1996 from General Electric Co.'s finance business.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Area Grocery Workers Approve 3-Year Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California's major grocery retailers averted a strike this
week when members of the Teamsters union voted overwhelmingly to
approve a three-year contract that includes wage hikes and no
increase in health care costs.</LD>
<LD>   The contract covers more than 5,000 workers at Kroger Co.'s Ralphs
grocery chain, Albertson's Inc., Stater Bros. Markets and Safeway
Inc.'s Vons. The workers are based in the Los Angeles area but
deliver goods to most of the markets in the state.</LD>
<LD>   The workers covered by the pact were operating under a contract
extension that expired Friday. Negotiators from both sides worked
overnight Friday, and six locals voted overwhelmingly Saturday and
Sunday to approve the new contract, union spokesman Don Owens said.</LD>
<TE>   "There will be grocery harmony in Southern California for the next
three years," said Owens, noting that there hasn't been a Teamsters
grocery strike in the Southland since 1985. The union had authorized
a strike about a month ago, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The contract calls for hourly wage increases averaging 50 cents in
the first year and 45 cents each year for the following two years.
The boost will bring the hourly pay of the average union worker to
$19.90, Owens said.</TE>
<TE>   The contract also includes keeping health benefits at existing
levels. The retailers had sought to increase employee deductibles and
co-payments, Owens said.</TE>
<TE>   The labor difficulties between dockworkers and their employers at
West Coast ports did not figure into the negotiations, Owens said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Teamsters union was successful in sweetening the terms
of the contract, which it hopes to use as ammunition in efforts to
organize workers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The retailer has announced
plans to bring its Super Wal-Mart format, which includes groceries,
to California.</TE>

<HD>Patent Suit Against Unocal Revived</HD>
<DH>Energy: Supreme Court orders appeals court to reconsider
case involving cleaner-gas formula.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An engineer won a round Monday in a lawsuit that alleges El
Segundo-based Unocal Corp. stole his formula for a less-polluting
gasoline.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Supreme Court sent the suit, filed by William Talbert of
Allentown, Pa., back to a federal appeals court in California to
reconsider the claims against the oil company in light of a high
court ruling in May that broadened patent rights for inventors.</LD>
<LD>   Talbert's suit is separate from patent infringement litigation
that Unocal is pursuing against five major competitors that produce
cleaner-burning gasoline, which Unocal has estimated could bring in
annual revenue of as much as $150 million when a resolution is
finally reached.</LD>
<TE>   The Supreme Court order represents the first major legal victory
for Talbert, 70, since his lawsuit was filed in 1998. A lower court
had dismissed the suit on the grounds that Unocal's gasoline had
different characteristics from Talbert's fuel, and the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld that ruling in January.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason it feels so good is I had a lot of doubts about
fighting Big Oil in the court system, but now I feel we'll get a good
decision," said Talbert, whose legal team includes Harvard Law School
professor Arthur Miller and Melvyn I. Weiss of Milberg Weiss Bershad
Hynes &amp; Lerach, a national law firm known for class-action securities
litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Talbert's lawyers portrayed the case as a David-versus-Goliath
matchup with important implications for the other gasoline patent
case, in which Unocal is trying to wring damages from five major oil
companies for infringing its patent for cleaner-burning gasoline.
Unocal won that suit in 1997, but a proceeding to determine damages
is being delayed by federal regulatory investigations into whether
Unocal received the patent improperly.</TE>
<TE>   However, lawyers for Unocal and another defendant, Tosco Corp.,
said the Supreme Court order is narrowly focused and unlikely to
change the outcome of the Talbert case or the other, even bigger
patent lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Although testimony in the Talbert case centered on arcane matters
such as the boiling point of various grades of gasoline, a key claim
by Talbert was that Unocal stole his idea to make a cleaner-burning
gasoline after he shared details of his then-pending patent with
Unocal in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal, which expressed no interest in Talbert's invention, got
its own patent in 1994 on a form of cleaner-burning gasoline designed
to meet California's clean-air mandates. The Unocal patent became the
center of an intense legal battle between Unocal and virtually the
rest of Big Oil over whether Unocal secretly secured a patent using
shared research with other oil companies.</TE>
<TE>   The gasoline patent lawsuit, Talbert Fuel Systems Patents Co. vs.
Unocal Corp. and Tosco Corp., is one of several bounced back to lower
courts because of the Supreme Court's decision in May in Fesco Corp.
vs. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co.</TE>
<TE>   That ruling gave inventors wider latitude to sue makers of
competing products that are similar to the original patent but don't
exactly copy it.</TE>
<TE>   Tosco., which is now part of ConocoPhillips, was named in the suit
because it purchased Unocal's refineries.</TE>
<TE>   In other rulings, the Supreme Court:</TE>
<TE>   * Rejected calls by Exxon Mobil Corp., Dow Chemical Co.'s Union
Carbide and other companies to halt a West Virginia asbestos trial
that at one time involved claims by 8,000 people exposed to the
cancer-causing fiber.</TE>
<TE>   The justices, without comment, let the trial that began Sept. 23
go forward, letting stand a West Virginia state court decision. The
case, which had involved about 250 companies, has been scaled back as
all but a few have settled.</TE>
<TE>   * Turned down challenges to the $246-billion nationwide tobacco
settlements by a smoker and by reduced-toxin cigarette maker Star
Scientific Inc., which didn't sign the accords and yet has been
forced to put more than $33 million in escrow.</TE>
<TE>   * Rejected phone customers' challenge to SBC Communications Inc.'s
$81-billion purchase of Ameritech Corp. in 1999, which created the
nation's largest telecommunications company.</TE>
<TE>   * Boosted a challenge by bar-code scanner makers to patents that
have cost companies more than $1 billion in licensing fees. The
justices rejected an appeal by the Lemelson Medical, Education &amp;
Research Foundation, which owns the patents.</TE>

<HD>Webcaster Royalty Deal Gets House OK</HD>
<DH>Internet: Bill would let small online radio stations pay
less, but its prospects in the Senate are uncertain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The House of Representatives on Monday rushed through a bill to let
small Internet radio stations pay discounted royalties to record
labels and artists, but its prospects in the Senate were clouded by
hints of opposition from other broadcasters.</LD>
<LD>   The bill by House Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) would implement a deal hammered out by
small Webcasters, record labels and artists' representatives after
more than a week of intense negotiations. Instead of requiring them
to pay about $92 per listener per year, the bill would let small
Webcasters pay a percentage of their revenue or expenses, whichever
were greater.</LD>
<LD>   Several small Webcasters welcomed the legislation, although
neither they nor the labels were declaring victory.</LD>
<TE>   "It's obviously very difficult to negotiate when the option is
going out of business," said Kevin Shively of Beethoven.com, an
Internet broadcaster that specializes in classical music. "The rates
are considerably higher than we had hoped."</TE>
<TE>   Added David Landis of Ultimate-80s, a Los Angeles-based Webcaster,
"It is expensive, but we did get what we, in a sense, needed to
survive."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, some small Webcasters shut down Monday after
learning the terms of the deal. For example, Internet Radio Hawai'i
turned off its Hawaiian music Webcasts, saying it couldn't afford to
pay even the discounted royalties provided by the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would apply only to Webcasters with less than $1
million in accumulated revenue since November 1998 and whose revenue
remained below $500,000 in 2003 and $1.25 million in 2004. Royalties
would be 7% of expenses or 10% to 12% of revenue, with the higher
amount kicking in as a Webcaster's revenue increased.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would give small Webcasters a greater discount on the
three years of back royalties they owe, as well as pushing back the
due date.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation almost foundered in the House on Monday morning in
the face of opposition from some artists' representatives. But the
labels ultimately agreed to clarify a provision requiring performing
artists to receive half of the royalty payments directly, rather than
have them pass through the labels.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said he
wanted the Senate to act on the bill in the waning days of the
legislative session. But some large Webcasters and the powerful
National Assn. of Broadcasters voiced concerns about the bill, saying
they wanted more assurance that the deal for small Webcasters
wouldn't affect the royalties they pay to labels, artists or
songwriters.</TE>

<HD>UnionBanCal Says It Beat Estimates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of UnionBanCal Corp. surged Monday after the San
Francisco-based company said it expected third-quarter profit to come
in above Wall Street's estimates.</LD>
<LD>   The forecast from the parent company of Union Bank of California
came as welcome news in the banking sector, which was hit last week
by warnings from a string of national and regional banks. Some
institutions, struggling amid the weak U.S. economy, said they were
increasing reserves for bad loans, and a major index of bank stocks
lost almost 10% for the week.</LD>
<LD>   UnionBanCal's stock also had been falling, but it reversed that
slide Monday, climbing $1.35, or 3.8%, to $37. The gain came even as
the broad market tumbled and the Bloomberg index of bank stocks fell
again, dropping 4.1%.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said the company didn't specify by how much it expects to
beat Wall Street's forecast for its third-quarter operating earnings,
which Thomson First Call's consensus estimate now puts at 85 cents a
share.</TE>
<TE>   However, it said the improving profit picture was due to several
factors, including lower provisions for credit losses and lower
nonperforming assets compared with the second quarter of this year.</TE>
<TE>   The company expects to report results Oct. 16.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Townsend, a senior analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp;
Co. in Arlington, Va., said UnionBanCal's credit condition has been
improving for several quarters, so the upbeat profit outlook wasn't
wholly unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, "I was very pleased to see this. It was the only
[winning stock] on my screen today."</TE>
<TE>   Documents Indicate</TE>
<TE>   Conflict at CSFB</TE>
<TE>   Further evidence emerged that Credit Suisse First Boston may have
used coverage of companies by its research department to win and
retain lucrative investment banking business.</TE>
<TE>   According to documents obtained in the course of a regulatory
probe of CSFB, the bank wooed potential clients by contrasting its
top rating for a company it had brought public against competitors'
less enthusiastic ratings.</TE>
<TE>   In a July 1999 presentation, the bank headlined a confidential
proposal to Virata Corp., a company seeking to make an initial public
offering of shares, "CSFB Stands by Its Clients."</TE>
<TE>   The presentation included charts showing that CSFB retained its
top-rated "strong buy" after a company released results below
analysts' expectations, in contrast with other underwriters of IPOs
that cut their recommendations after bad news.</TE>
<TE>   The documents also show that a CSFB employee asked Frank
Quattrone, a top West Coast banker for the firm, to return a client,
Research In Motion, to what is described as "most favored nation"
status after the company paid $1.8 billion in underwriting fees.</TE>
<TE>   Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin told several
newspapers that the documents provide a "smoking gun" against CSFB
and Quattrone.</TE>
<TE>   Galvin, who is leading a probe of CSFB on behalf of state
securities regulators, could not be immediately reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Galvin referred the preliminary results of his
investigation to New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, who is helping to
head a coalition of about 40 state securities regulators
investigating Wall Street research practices.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street has been under scrutiny as regulators investigate
whether brokerages misled investors as they privately disparaged
stocks while publicly touting the companies to win their banking
business.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome the participation by Mr. Galvin in the new coalition
of state and federal regulators who are trying to move these issues
forward toward constructive resolution to restore investor
confidence," a CSFB spokeswoman said.</TE>

as financial companies, especially mutual fund firms, scaled back
their advertising spending.</TE>
<TE>   Mutual fund companies, reeling amid a severe stock market downturn
that has eroded their profits, increasingly have sold their funds

important.</TE>

<LD>Datum Inc., an Irvine maker of timing and frequency products for
telecommunications industry, said Monday that its directors have
rejected an unsolicited bid to buy the company for cash and stock
worth $51.7 million.</LD>
<LD>   Datum said in a news release that Frequency Electronics Inc. in
Mitchel Field, N.Y., offered, in a Sept. 26 letter, to buy Datum for
$2 in cash and one share of Frequency stock for every Datum share.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Datum said it will continue with plans to merge with
Symmetricom Inc., which it said would provide a better strategic fit.
The San Jose company would exchange nearly 2.8 of its shares for each
share of Datum, a deal worth $97 million in May when it was announced
but now worth $79.4 million.</LD>
<TE>   In 1999, Datum turned down an unsolicited bid from Frequency,
which had offered $10 in cash and 1.06 shares of Frequency for each
Datum share.</TE>
<TE>   In Nasdaq trading Monday, Datum stock gained 1 cent to close at
$7.20 a share, though it hit its 52-week low of $6.68 a share during
trading. Symmetricom gained 15 cents to $2.60. Frequency lost 26
cents to close at $6.2O on the American Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Waldseemueller Map--A story in Section A on Sunday about the 1507
Waldseemueller Map incorrectly ascribed the Europeans' discovery of
the Pacific Ocean to Ferdinand Magellan. Magellan was the first to
sail into the Pacific through the Straits of Magellan, although Vasco
Nunez de Balboa was the first European to sight the ocean. The story
also misspelled the name of Spain's royal map. The correct spelling
is Padron Real.</LD>

<HD>Ripple Effect of Dockworkers' Strike Could Turn Into
Tsunami</HD>
<DH>Globalization makes a world of difference in port labor
disputes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HELVARG</AU>
<BD>David Helvarg, the author of "Blue Frontier: Saving
America's Living Seas" (Henry Holt paperback, 2002), is also a
commentator for the public radio program "Marketplace."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1999, the longshore union shut down West Coast ports for a day in
solidarity with anti-globalization protesters at the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle. Now, with the owners locking out the
dockworkers, globalization may give the workers an advantage that has
frightening implications beyond the labor-management bargaining
table.</LD>
<LD>   Harry Bridges has to be laughing in his grave.</LD>
<LD>   Bridges was the fiery Aussie organizer who, through pickets,
deadly street battles and a San Francisco-Oakland general strike, won
recognition in 1934 for what became the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union. One of his lawyers once said, "There are eight
bridges in San Francisco, and the one you don't want to cross is
Harry."</LD>
<TE>   But Bridges was pragmatic enough to recognize change when he saw
it.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than fight the shipping-container revolution that began in
1956, he cut deals that took the reduced need for stevedore labor
into account.</TE>
<TE>   Through the 1960s, 1970s and beyond, older ILWU members were
allowed to retire with their benefits intact while the union retained
control of the dockside cranes, forklifts and trucks that continue to
move the boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Now the shipping industry is trying to squeeze the union to make
additional job concessions. But the dockworkers no longer need
painful months-long strikes and confrontations to show their power.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1 billion tons a year--97% of trade goods not under the
North American Free Trade Agreement--come through our ports in huge
container ships that need to be offloaded immediately.</TE>
<TE>   With the globalized demand for bigger, faster, cheaper delivery,
many warehouse operations have been replaced with a "just in time"
delivery system. This means everything from Chinese toys for Wal-Mart
to car parts for General Motors is supposed to cross oceans and docks
and be with the end user just as the old parts run out. It's like
that "I Love Lucy" episode with the assembly-line chocolates, only on
a planetary scale.</TE>
<TE>   Significant parts of the U.S. economy could grind to a halt if the
shutdown continues.</TE>
<TE>   The shipping industry may be hoping for intervention from the Bush
administration to force the union to agree to its terms. But if the
dockworkers say no, free-market thinkers from the Heritage Foundation
or the Competitive Enterprise Institute won't be climbing the cranes
to offload the ships.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, with global shipping imports expected to double by
2020, the vulnerability of this endless conveyer belt of consumption
doesn't end at the picket line anymore.</TE>
<TE>   I've recently been on the docks with members of the Coast Guard
and Customs Service who are rightly worried that the sheer scale of
our appetite for stuff--bottled water from Italy and France, for
example, or nails from Korea and Saudi Arabia--could overwhelm their
best efforts to secure our ports not against strikes but against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "If a container has some nasty stuff in it, once it gets to this
port it's already too late," the director of the port of Oakland
warned me.</TE>
<TE>   Better intelligence, surveillance and so-called smart seals on
shipping containers (which would indicate whether the boxes had been
tampered with) may be one answer, but smart thinking about how much,
how fast and how safely we consume the fruits of the world's many
labors could be another way to go.</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, it would be nice to see the shipping industry,
port authorities and dockworkers working together to help secure our
most vulnerable transportation and commercial hubs, America's more
than 360 major ports.</TE>

<HD>Governor's Race Needs Bada-Bing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>Bill Kelley, a former New Jersey resident, is a writer
for "MadTV."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>According to the polls, there isn't much interest in California's
race for governor, and it's unlikely that anyone who stayed awake
during Monday's debate changed his mind--unless it was to move out of
state, abstain from voting or write in the name of the "American
Idol" winner. It seems that Gray Davis came out on top in the debate
and will probably win the election--because, well, someone has to.</LD>
<LD>   The absolute lack of excitement, however, is indicative of a
bigger problem with California politics: Its scandals are boring.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, our governor has questionable judgment when it comes to
fund-raisers, and his opponent's business practices have an
Enron-like quality to them.</LD>
<TE>   But in a state where billions are spent annually on producing
entertainment, Californians certainly don't know how to hold an
election.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, there's a simple answer. Just as Hollywood turned to
New Jersey for inspiration with "The Sopranos," California may
benefit from looking to the Garden State for guidance on campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, Jersey's current senatorial campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats forced Sen. Robert Torricelli, the incumbent, to
withdraw because voters had trouble seeing beyond the fact that a
former campaign contributor gave the senator gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Among them were a wide-screen television and cuff links--which
don't sound so much like bribes as they do consolation prizes.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli also received a Rolex from the contributor and
allegedly had him pick up the tab for 10 custom-made suits.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine either Davis or Bill Simon getting involved
in anything that sleazy--or interesting.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it's hard to imagine that Davis has 10 suits; if he does,
they're off the rack.</TE>
<TE>   I'm also pretty confident that Simon already owns a wide-screen
television, on which he views "Lou Dobbs Moneyline" and just about
anything on Nick at Nite. Except, of course, the "Bewitched" episodes
with the gay husband--or at least that's what he tells his
ultraconservative supporters.</TE>
<TE>   As for the cuff links, my guess is that Davis has one pair, the
ones he got for his wedding, and Simon has plenty from the family but
usually wears the pair he bought at the gift shop at the Richard
Nixon Library.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to watches, Davis looks more like a Casio man, and
Simon has probably misplaced more Rolexes in his houses than he's
bought.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, once Torricelli was out, Democrats had to find a
replacement. The job went to Torricelli archenemy and former Sen.
Frank Lautenberg, who, if elected, will be 84 years old at the end of
his term.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans challenged the substitution, but the New Jersey
Supreme Court in effect told the GOP to "fuggedaboutit." It turned
out to be a bigger story that day in California than anything our own
candidates were doing.</TE>
<TE>   California and New Jersey, of course, are not the same. For one
thing, you can still use the beaches in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   But given this current campaign, it might be worth it the next
time you see Gray Davis to whisper to him, "Hey guv, wanna Rolex?"</TE>

<HD>'The Bush Doctrine' Leaps Into History</HD>
<DH>Wage first-strike war to achieve peace: The consequences
could be enormous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most television networks chose not to cover President Bush's speech
Monday. There would be no real news, they were told. Indeed, the
White House wanted to low-key the talk--perhaps to avoid accusations
that it was wagging the dog in regard to the midterm elections. And
so the networks were eager to carry on with their commercial
programming. But long after "King of Queens" and "Fear Factor" are
forgotten, people will remember 2002 as the year that Bush propounded
a new doctrine for the world, one likely to define the next century.</LD>
<LD>   To be sure, much of Bush's speech was devoted to the question of
"why now?" for Saddam Hussein. As the president said, "By its past
and present actions, by its technological capabilities, by the
merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is unique." But he also said,
"For the sake of peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him ... we
cannot wait for the final proof." First-strike war to achieve
peace--that's a new doctrine for America.</LD>
<LD>   That's the Bush Doctrine. It's likely to be remembered right up
there with other doctrines that received relatively little notice
when first propounded but that proved to be vastly consequential in
the fullness of time.</LD>
<TE>   For example, the Monroe Doctrine wasn't even enunciated in a
speech, and the word "doctrine" wasn't used at all. It was first
expressed in a written message to Congress on Dec. 2, 1823. President
James Monroe, noting the anti-Spanish revolutions throughout South
America and worrying about future interventions, declared that it was
"impossible" for European powers to "extend their political system to
any portion of either continent without endangering our peace and
happiness." At the time, the world cared little about what the U.S.
had to say. But over the next century, as American power burgeoned,
the Monroe Doctrine became Uncle Sam's rationale for dozens of
military interventions in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the Truman Doctrine had modest beginnings. It was
simply a speech that President Harry Truman gave to Congress on March
12, 1947, in which he said the U.S. must help Greece and Turkey
resist communist encroachment. At the end he added: "I believe it
must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who
are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside
pressures."</TE>
<TE>   Truman hadn't reached this conclusion right away. For nearly two
years after World War II, his administration had seesawed on the role
of the U.S. in the world. But the Truman Doctrine of aiding
anti-communist regimes was followed up, three months later, by the
Marshall Plan for aiding in the reconstruction of Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Those initiatives were the beginnings of the Cold War, punctuated
by hot wars in Korea and Vietnam--in addition to bidding wars for the
loyalties of so-called nonaligned countries.</TE>
<TE>   And so it is with Bush. It is only gradually becoming obvious that
he has a grand plan for the world. After the Sept. 11 attacks, he
mostly focused on Osama bin Laden and Mullah Mohammed Omar. And in
military operations that commenced a year and a day ago, the U.S.
routed the Taliban from Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But beginning with his 2002 State of the Union address, Bush
escalated. He unleashed the phrase "axis of evil," referring not to
Al Qaeda or the Taliban but to Iraq, Iran and North Korea. Then came
his speech at West Point in June in which he called for "preemptive
action" against potential enemies.</TE>
<TE>   The world is paying attention. The stock market goes down when
Bush talks about war, even as oil prices rise. The Russians have been
making noises that they wish to apply the doctrine to neighboring
Georgia. And speculation abounds that others--China, India,
Israel--will use the Bush precedent to settle their own scores.</TE>
<TE>   And that's the point: Any action generates a reaction, not always
foreseen. Indeed, one of the cornerstones of world security--limits
on the number of nuclear weapons--could soon fall victim to the
feeling among Third World nationalists that only weapons of mass
destruction offer safety from the Pentagon. Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva, almost certainly the next president of Brazil, suggested to a
Rio de Janeiro audience on Sept. 13 that countries such as Brazil had
been foolish to abide by the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.</TE>
<TE>   Lula, of course, is a leftist critic of the U.S. and its economic
system. But if the U.S. has its nonnegotiable doctrines, other
countries will have theirs as well.</TE>
<TE>   It may be that the Bush administration has foreseen the danger of
a world in which other countries feel emboldened to attack enemies
and build up their arsenals. It also may be that Bush is intoxicated
with the thought of a doctrine in his name. Either way, future
historians will be studying his words closely, recognizing that
something huge began in 2002.</TE>

<LD>President Bush's sober address last night showed an encouraging hint
of restraint cloaked in tough declarations about the United States'
new role in the post-9/11 world. As he took his case for confronting
Saddam Hussein directly to the American people, Bush also
acknowledged that questions about going to war were legitimate,
rather than anti-American. Perhaps most important, Bush emphasized
again that he would go through the United Nations first and that any
war would be waged "with allies," presumably meaning more than
Britain alone.</LD>
<LD>   Bush emphasized that war was not the first resort of a powerful
democracy, even as he warned that waiting too long was "the riskiest
of all options." If Hussein fully complies with whatever demands
emerge from a new U.N. Security Council resolution, Bush promised,
Iraq can avoid war. Or, he all but said out loud, Iraqis can just
deal with Hussein and expect plenty of American help afterward.</LD>
<LD>   The president did not offer any shocking revelations--or even new
revelations--about Iraq's attempts to acquire biological, chemical
and nuclear weapons. He did state that Iraq was attempting to rebuild
its nuclear weapons program and that weapons could be funneled to
terrorists or aimed directly at the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Bush conceded that the U.S. simply did not know how close Hussein
was to building a bomb but contended that after 9/11, no U.S.
president could afford to wait for a gathering storm from abroad to
strike at home. He also seemed to acknowledge that the United States
should not go to war alone.</TE>
<TE>   Bush insisted, as he has before, that United Nations inspectors
must return to Iraq without any conditions on where they go, when
they go and what they look at. Nothing should be off-limits and
inspectors should be able to show up unannounced and unimpeded.</TE>
<TE>   "The time for denying, deceiving, delaying has come to an end," he
said--a proposition with which no one interested in seeing Hussein's
accumulation of weapons halted can disagree. However, he also said
the U.S. would, if Hussein failed to comply, "lead a coalition to
disarm him," coalition being a welcome word.</TE>
<TE>   Bush went beyond earlier speeches in declaring the United States
"a friend to the people of Iraq" and stating that "our demands are
directed only at the regime that enslaves them and threatens us." His
language echoed his delineations between the Taliban and the people
of Afghanistan. He did not lay out any specific plans for a
post-Hussein Iraq, which he must eventually do. "The oppression of
Kurds, Assyrians, Turkomans, Shi'a, Sunnis and others will be
lifted," he said. Perhaps, but how would he then prevent this freedom
from turning into civil war?</TE>
<TE>   The president painted big, confident pictures of America's role in
the world. But with Congress apparently ready to offer him a strong
Iraq resolution, he also seemed rightly concerned about assuring
Americans he wouldn't start a war alone. That is promising,
closer-to-the-middle ground to stand on.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Should Step In at Ports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At $1 billion or more a day, the cost of the West Coast port
stalemate is far too damaging to the nation's economy, the wave of
economic pain rolling toward the country's trading partners far too
ominous for Washington to let it continue. The shippers and longshore
workers can reach a speedy agreement or President Bush should force
them to behave responsibly.</LD>
<LD>   The increasingly costly disruption isn't simply about 10,500
well-paid longshore workers and the few companies that employ them.
It's also about Fresno-area farmers whose crops are rotting, Fremont
auto workers who are idle because imported parts are bobbing offshore
in a flotilla of container ships and the independent truckers who
risk losing their rigs because there's no cargo.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has signaled its intention to invoke--as
early as today--the rarely used Taft-Hartley Act, which would reopen
the 29 ports between Mexico and Canada by requiring a return to work
and an 80-day cooling-off period. Ultimately, though, federal
involvement won't ease tensions between the International Longshore
and Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents
shippers and terminal operators. That will occur only when both sides
bridge their relatively narrow contract disagreements over such
matters as who will control the new clerical and computer-oriented
jobs created by automation.</LD>
<TE>   Confrontations between the union and the shipping-line owners date
to the days when dockworkers used their collective muscle to hoist
cargo from ship holds. But the two parties also know how to get
along--the West Coast was strike-free from 1948 to 1971, the last
time a labor dispute closed the ports.</TE>
<TE>   Longshore workers and the owners association forged solutions to
hard-edged disagreements prompted by the introduction of massive
cranes and container ships. Those negotiations should form the
foundation needed to position ports for the inevitable introduction
of electronic technology already used in foreign ports.</TE>
<TE>   The last time a labor dispute shut down West Coast shipping the
economic effect was relatively minor. But West Coast ports now are
crucial players in a global economy where "just in time" is the order
of the day. Labor and management have legitimate concerns that
they're entitled to settle. But for them to remain entangled like
stubborn, self-absorbed wrestlers while the economy sinks is more
than the nation should have to witness, more than the Bush
administration should tolerate another day.</TE>

<LD>One-third of California schoolchildren sit in classrooms so crowded
that students twist like pretzels to squeeze themselves into the
wall-to-wall rows of desks. The state legislative analyst says the
same number of students spend the school day in buildings where the
roofs leak or the toilets and sinks spill onto the floors. California
students learn science in classrooms with 1960s lab equipment, and
those in a class of 40 may have to take turns at two computers
because school wiring will blow if teachers plug in one more
terminal.</LD>
<LD>   Parents in Los Angeles know all too well that the problem of worn
and inadequate public school facilities is especially acute in their
district. New state and local bond money in recent years has begun
healing years of neglect and underfunding. But year-round schedules,
long bus rides and playground-eating portable classrooms are daily
reminders of the critical need for upgrades and new construction.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 47, on the Nov. 5 ballot, would provide $13.05 billion
statewide in general obligation bond funds to build more classrooms,
make safety repairs and upgrade schools. The lion's share of this
bond, $11.4 billion, would go to elementary, middle and high schools.
The remaining $1.65 billion would aid community colleges, state
universities and University of California schools.</LD>
<TE>   Four years ago, Californians passed Proposition 1A, authorizing a
$6.7-billion school repair and construction bond. That money has been
either allocated or spent. The job of upgrading the state's 275,000
worn and outdated classrooms and building the estimated 46,000 new
ones needed is far from finished.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. schools historically got the short end of the stick on state
bond funds because the application requirements favored suburban
districts that could easily identify sites for new schools. A lawsuit
on behalf of minority students allowed the L.A. Unified School
District to claim more of Proposition 1A than expected, and the
process in the future should be fairer to urban districts. Opponents
of Proposition 47 say openly that they oppose Los Angeles' ability to
get a larger share of the proposed bond under a "crowded districts"
clause.</TE>
<TE>   The state legislative analyst calculates that the state's
indebtedness as a percentage of the general fund is moderate, even
low, compared with many other states. Even if Proposition 47 and
every other bond measure on the November ballot passed, the ratio of
debt service to revenue would still be no higher than it was in the
mid-'90s.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 47 needs a simple majority of votes to pass.
California can afford this school bond and California's
schoolchildren need it. Vote yes on Proposition 47.</TE>

<LD>Sonia Nazario's "Enrique's Journey" series (Sept. 29-Oct. 7) needs to
be published in book form so it can have an even greater impact. The
sad truth is that it would take less money to improve living
conditions in Honduras and other poor countries than it does to deal
with illegal immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   At the personal level, an individual, church group or school could
easily enter into a sister-school relationship to keep a school going
in a poor village: $600 will operate an entire school for a year; $2
per month will pay the parents' share of expenses so that another
child can attend school.</LD>
<LD>   If more of us would visit these areas we would have a greater idea
of how hard these people work and how much they sacrifice to help
each other. Give up your trip to Europe and go to Central America,
where you can stay in a village hotel for $2 and have a restaurant
dinner for a dollar. It will open your eyes.</LD>

<TE>   I cannot believe the lack of compassion shown by some of your
readers regarding "Enrique's Journey." One Oct. 4 letter reads,
"Sympathy for illegal immigrant criminals is something we do not
need." Where is this person's humanity, his basic decency?</TE>
<TE>   This is the story of a child enduring the unthinkable, trying to
join his mother. Imagine the level of poverty and desperation that
would drive a child to attempt this journey.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Power Paradox," Opinion, Oct. 6: I am far from convinced that
the president and Congress have fully thought through the economic
consequences of a war with Iraq. To be a strong country requires
being strong militarily and financially. Our debt continues to
increase within and, even more important, abroad. The economy is in
trouble now, and with a long-term commitment in Afghanistan, the
Middle East, Colombia and many places I'm sure the American public is
not told about, I worry if we already have too much on our plate.</LD>
<LD>   We seem to have quickly forgotten that it was the economy that
brought the USSR down and ended the Cold War. Did our leaders not
learn anything from this?</LD>

<TE>   I am at a loss to understand the position of Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.) and so many letters that are published by The Times
("Senate Debates as House Panel OKs Iraq Measure," Oct. 4). Have all
of these folks forgotten what happened in 1936 when Winston Churchill
warned that the body politic should do something about Hitler--and
most politicians stood against him and preached "appeasement"? The
result was the blood of 6 million Jews and many others, including
Gypsies, the handicapped and homosexuals at the hand of the Nazi
madman. The potential for Saddam Hussein to do likewise is real. If
he gets his hands on weapons of mass destruction, the Jews of Israel
are dead, and many other people will perish. Why is Boxer willing to
appease?</TE>

<TE>   Some other president, some other time, could depose Hussein
without earning the contempt of most of the world. Even President
Bush could have done it if he'd gone to the United Nations and
quietly gathered support instead of declaring war first and then
asking for support. But with an election a few weeks away, with Vice
President Dick Cheney's and Bush's ties to the oil industry, with the
economy nose-diving and with Dubya saying of Hussein, "This is a guy
that tried to kill my dad at one time" (Oct. 3), everyone will see
war on Iraq as wagging the dog.</TE>
<TE>   The moral authority the U.S. has been able to wield will be gone.
Depending on whether the U.N. gives cover to the war, this
administration will have destroyed either the effectiveness or the
credibility of the U.N. International relations will take a step back
to Thomas Hobbes' "war of all against all." Terrorists will spring up
like dragons' teeth.</TE>

<HD>Jury Awards $28 Billion to Smoker</HD>

<LD>Re "Philip Morris Ordered to Pay $28 Billion to Smoker," Oct. 5: The
Los Angeles jury award last week of $28 billion in punitive damages
to a smoker with lung cancer is absolutely absurd. The jury
forewoman, by way of explanation, stated: "Only one in 28,000 smokers
get to come into the courtroom. Based on what we awarded in the first
phase, we wanted to award $1 million for each person." Doesn't she
realize that this money would not be going to 28,000 people and that
this is not a tobacco settlement award? The smoker with lung cancer,
Betty Bullock, who may have only three months to live, will never see
a penny of the award. Can't the jurors see that they will only be
enriching the pockets of the family and their attorney to this
extent? I don't think that any ordinary citizen's life is worth much
more than a million, and there just shouldn't be billion-dollar jury
awards. I think that everybody has a choice. The jury should not have
awarded anything beyond the $850,000 in compensation that she
received.</LD>

<TE>   One wonders if the jurors who so generously awarded $28 billion to
the litigant for her self-inflicted malady realize that, thanks to
our complex tax structure, we all pay. And as these unwarranted
lawsuits take their toll on the tobacco industry, cigarettes may one
day become just another lucrative commodity of illegal drug
smugglers.</TE>
<TE>   Would that be preferable, or more advantageous, for our society as
a whole?</TE>

<TE>   What about the thousands, perhaps millions, of other smokers who
contracted lung cancer and died from it--and their survivors?</TE>
<TE>   My late husband, Warner Law, was a heavy smoker for 40 years. He
was also a true gentleman, a wonderful life partner and a great,
award-winning writer. Our 30 anniversary would have been on Oct. 14,
but I lost him to lung cancer, which had spread to other parts of his
body as well, 23 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Since I am not litigious, I have not asked any tobacco company for
recompense for my husband's murder. That's what it is, murder. The
tobacco companies know their products are lethal to their users, but
they don't care. If smokers are addicted to cigarettes, tough luck.
It's their own fault, right?</TE>
<TE>   My sympathies to Betty Bullock. I hope she and her daughter and
granddaughter can enjoy a few more years together.</TE>

<LD>Re "Port Talks Fail; Bush May Act," Oct. 7: It is not just the
retailers looking for their holiday goods who will soon be hurt by
the port closure. Many factories have closed their warehouses and
gone to "just in time" inventories for their manufacturing
operations. This will affect the auto makers, household-goods
manufacturers and countless distributors of manufactured goods, from
auto parts suppliers to power tool accessories purveyors.</LD>
<LD>   The sooner President Bush realizes that "it's the economy,
stupid!" the better. This little spat along the West Coast can tank
any recovery our economy is struggling to achieve--and will--soon.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Dockworkers Shore Up Their Case," Commentary, Oct. 4: The
media, marching in lock step, have repeatedly reported that the
Pacific Maritime Assn. lockout of dockworkers was in response to
slowdown tactics by the rank and file. In Miguel Contreras' piece is
the first mention and only reporting I have seen of the maritime
association's gambit--how employers eliminated night shifts and
overtime, hoping to spark walkouts or slowdowns to justify a lockout.</TE>
<TE>   The relentless anti-union drumbeat of the corporate media is
further evidence of the death of probative journalism in this country
and exposes again the myth of the "liberal" media.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This has gone on long enough. Bush needs to do the same thing that
President Reagan did to the air traffic controllers in 1981: Fire the
dockworkers who refuse to perform their jobs. This strike is about to
seriously affect the economy and is a crime against America. If these
workers want to ensure their job security, they should enroll in a
community college to enhance their education to perform the future
tasks of a modern world. They are only hurting themselves with this
disruption.</TE>

<LD>Re "Valley City Police Force Is Proposed," Oct. 4: Joyce Pearson
suggested that a new Valley city would pay for 2,500 more police
officers over a five-year period. The money would supposedly come
from the 5% annual reduction in the $127-million alimony payment to
Los Angeles. Five percent would be about $6.4 million in the first
year. If that were the amount of the reduction in each succeeding
year, after five years, that would be $32 million. For 2,500 more
police officers, that would come out to be about $12,800 per officer,
but that does not include other employment costs. And that does not
include support staff, new facilities, vehicles and equipment. Just
where do they think the money will come from?</LD>
<LD>   The secessionists are also pledging tax cuts. Given their fuzzy
math, I'm sure the "tax cuts" would actually be more taxes.</LD>

9th Circuit Court of Appeals, the guards better pack it up and get
out the beard trimmers for the inmates, for surely this liberal court
will grant the inmates' requests, regardless of the safety issues.</LD>

<HD>Alaska Drilling Holds Benefits for California</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Snow Job on Arctic Drilling," your Oct. 1 editorial opposing oil
exploration in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, was
surprisingly uninformed. While your concern for preserving elk
habitat is laudable, there are no elk within 750 miles of the Arctic.
Perhaps this effort would be better directed toward tule elk
conservation in California.</LD>
<LD>   Similarly, you deny California's most important connection to
Alaskan oil (other than environmental fund-raising): Your state
refines nearly 1 million barrels of Alaskan oil every day. By law,
Alaskan oil must be transported in U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged,
U.S.-crewed, double-hulled tankers, including three new tankers being
built in California shipyards over the next three years.</LD>
<LD>   By not allowing additional Alaska oil development, you risk
bringing another 1 million barrels of foreign oil each day into
California waters.</LD>
<TE>   This foreign oil arrives on California's shores in single-hulled
tankers, like the one that fouled Alaska's waters in 1989. Your
opposition to ANWR drilling actually increases the risk of a major
oil spill in California waters--the same waters that California
protects at great cost by blocking its own offshore oil development.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps The Times should worry more about California's supposedly
fragile shores than a frozen wasteland 2,600 miles north of your
offices.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John C. Abram, chairman and chief executive officer of Southern
California Gas Co. during the turbulent early 1980s, when prices for
natural gas were rising and supplies were declining, has died. He was
82.</LD>
<LD>   Abram, a staunch opponent of industry deregulation proposed by the
Reagan administration, died Sept. 4 at his home in Glendale of
undisclosed causes.</LD>
<LD>   Abram worked for Southern California Gas from 1951 to 1985, except
for the decade of the 1960s, when he was an executive with Pacific
Lighting Service Co. He held the top posts at Southern California Gas
from 1981 until his retirement.</LD>
<TE>   During those difficult years for the industry, he traveled
frequently to Washington to testify before Congress and to Sacramento
to address the Public Utilities Commission on deregulation
legislation, rising prices and declining supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Ending price controls on natural gas by 1986 as proposed by
President Reagan would be pure disaster, Abram told the U.S. Senate
Energy Committee and the utilities commission in 1983. He said such
deregulation would cost his 12 million Southern California
residential customers billions of dollars after their gas bills had
already doubled in the past four years.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way to create a free market in natural gas analogous
to the free market that exists in oil," he told the U.S. Senate
committee.</TE>
<TE>   At home in Los Angeles, Abram became more innovative by creating
what he called Operation Cope to enlist customers' help in battling
rising prices.</TE>
<TE>   Encouraging his employees to deliver greatly increased customer
service, he established and publicized cost-saving programs that are
still in use.</TE>
<TE>   Among these are offering rebates for home weatherization,
providing free energy audits of homes, adjusting appliances to save
energy, and repeating safety and conservation tips. He also promoted
low-interest financing and partial payment plans for those having
trouble paying the rising bills.</TE>
<TE>   Before joining the utility, Abram worked for Lockheed Aircraft
Corp., George F. Hartman Engineering Co. and Aladin Heating Corp.
After his retirement from Southern California Gas in 1985, he became
chief executive officer of AEA International Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Abram served on the boards of the Pacific Coast Gas Assn., the
American Gas Assn. and the Gas Research Institute.</TE>
<TE>   He also served as vice chairman of the Economic Development Corp.
of Los Angeles County and of the California Museum of Science and
Industry Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   In his charitable pursuits, he raised money and volunteered with
such groups as Junior Achievement, the Red Cross and the American
Cancer Society.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Des Moines in 1920, Abram served in the Army Air Forces
during World War II. He received a bachelor's degree in electrical
engineering from UCLA in 1949 and did postgraduate work at UC
Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Abram is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Buettner, whom
he married in 1946, and their two children, James of Placerville and
Susan of Ventura.</TE>

Foundation, 1501 NW 9th Ave., Bob Hope Road, Miami, FL 33136-1494.</TE>

move to the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao.</TE>
<TE>   After the Soviet Union annexed Lithuania and closed that
consulate, Warhaftig persuaded Japanese Consul-General Chiune
Sugihara to issue an additional 3,500 visas for Polish Jews to travel
through the Soviet Union and Japan and on to Curacao, Palestine or
the United States. To do so, Sugihara defied his own government, a
military ally of Germany since 1936.</TE>
<TE>   By 1942, Warhaftig had moved to New York, where he was elected to
the executive board of the World Jewish Congress and continued
persuading Jews to move to Palestine.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947, Warhaftig settled in Palestine, where he served in the
provisional Israeli Parliament and, in 1948, became one of 37 people
to sign Israel's Declaration of Independence.</TE>
<TE>   He served in the Israeli Parliament from 1949 to 1981, and in 1956
helped create the National Religious Party.</TE>
<TE>   He was also deputy minister of religious affairs from 1952 to 1962
and then minister of religious affairs until 1974.</TE>

<HD>In Final Weeks, Candidates Seek to Highlight Opponent's
Weaknesses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Gov. Gray Davis and his Republican challenger Bill Simon Jr.
sparred Monday for the first time, they offered a glimpse at the main
lines of attack each will pursue for the final four weeks of the
race.</LD>
<LD>   For Simon, the goal is to paint the Democratic incumbent as an
unethical career politician whose bungling of the energy and fiscal
crises has damaged California's economy.</LD>
<LD>   For Davis, the aim is to cast Simon as a dishonest businessman
whose conservative stands on guns, abortion and other issues would
take California "backward and to the right."</LD>
<TE>   With polls finding voters largely unhappy with both candidates,
the harsh exchanges suggest each will continue to offer voters a host
of reasons to dislike and mistrust his rival. At the same time,
however, they confront the question of how to motivate their
supporters with positive images of their candidacies and goals for
the office.</TE>
<TE>   Strategists said Monday that Simon may do that by highlighting his
family and emphasizing his views on education, while Davis will
trumpet the social issues agenda, where he is closer to most
Californians than Simon.</TE>
<TE>   The two men enter the key stretch of the race with far different
resources to carry out that double-edged mission; Davis'
fund-raising, while providing Simon with an opening to criticize him,
also has armed the incumbent with more than $20 million for the final
weeks. Simon has barely a fifth of that on hand.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates already are doing so in television commercials. In
Simon's latest ad, he says Davis is "corrupted" by campaign money. In
a new Davis ad, the governor says a Simon company faces a lawsuit for
"defrauding the post office."</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all the charges and countercharges, the Times-sponsored
debate also demonstrated contrasts on issues that could play a larger
part in the final stage of the race. Davis, for instance, can be
expected to keep up his social issues drumbeat until the election.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm strong pro-choice; he's against a woman's right to choose,"
Davis said. "I do vote for sensible gun control; he's fought it."</TE>
<TE>   USC political science professor Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said Davis
"did what he wanted to do, which was to paint Bill Simon as out of
step with the electorate."</TE>
<TE>   It's a strategy that worked well for Davis in his 1998 race
against another conservative, Dan Lungren, and for Democratic Sen.
Barbara Boxer in her race that year against GOP challenger Matt Fong.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis also is broadening his effort to other social issues. On
Monday, for example, he cited his approval of new family leave and
stem cell research bills; Simon opposed both of them.</TE>
<TE>   On the environment, a topic Simon has used to reach beyond his
conservative base, Davis criticized Simon for opposing a bill, signed
by the governor, that will curb tailpipe emissions to fight global
warming.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Simon repeated his vow to enforce gun and abortion
laws already on the books, but was more nuanced on the other issues;
rather than denounce the family leave and global warming bill, as he
has in the past, Simon expressed support for their objectives, taking
exceptions instead to details in the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Political experts predicted that approach would define Simon's
stance on those questions in the coming weeks. "The idea is to really
express a lot of empathy for the goals so you're not coming across as
a harsh conservative," said political science professor Bruce Cain of
UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   But Simon's main vehicle for reaching out to moderates,
particularly women, is education. While short on details for his
plans to improve California schools, he blamed Davis on Monday for
the "2 million children trapped in their failing schools" and pledged
more "accountability."</TE>
<TE>   State Republican Party spokesman Rob Stutzman said it was no
accident that Simon described himself in the debate not just as a
"successful businessman" and former prosecutor, but also as a father
and "family man."</TE>
<TE>   The point, he said, was to offer a contrast with Davis, who is
married but has no children. In a larger sense, the point is to
suggest that Simon's life gives him more empathy for the issues faced
by voters.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that voters believe you're better prepared to lead
if you have life experiences that are common to most Californians,
that helps voters better identify with--and be drawn to--Bill Simon
as a candidate," he said. "It also helps contrast Bill Simon, family
man-philanthropist, with Gray Davis,
bloodless-career-obsessed-politician."</TE>
<TE>   Veteran GOP consultant Allan Hoffenblum said he expects the Simon
campaign's final thrust will be to "humanize him so that he's not
some right-wing nut or bungling businessman."</TE>
<TE>   "What he needs to do is create a contrast," Hoffenblum said. "It's
one thing to attack. It's another thing to say this is what I would
do differently." But Simon's ability to get his message across has
been hampered by a shortage of money for television ads. Campaign
finance reports filed Monday show that Davis has maintained a
distinct fund-raising advantage.</TE>
<TE>   The governor had about $21.3 million available in his campaign
treasury at the end of September, almost five times more than his
challenger. Simon had nearly $4.3 million in the bank on Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign coffers would have been nearly empty if the
candidate had not loaned $4 million to his effort last month. The
loan has enabled Simon to resume buying television ads after barely
running any during a summer onslaught of Davis spots.</TE>
<TE>   Because Monday's debate could represent the last opportunity for
Simon to speak to a statewide television audience for free, money
becomes increasingly important from this point on.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the key question is whether the GOP candidate will
lend his campaign millions more to boost his visibility on
television.</TE>

<HD>Mediator to Decide if Catch Was Fair</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Two men are still battling, but hope to avoid
trial over the home run ball Barry Bonds hit last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Two fans locked in a tug of war over which of them legally owns Barry
Bonds' record-setting 73rd home run ball agreed Monday to find a new
umpire.</LD>
<LD>   As their civil trial was set to open--one year to the day after
Bonds' blast at Pac Bell Park sent fans scrambling into an elbow
throwing free-for-all--Alex Popov (he caught the ball and lost it)
and Patrick Hayashi (he picked it up and won't let go) agreed to let
a mediator make the ownership call. The ball is valued at more than
$1 million.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides were instructed to find out if former Contra Costa
Judge Coleman Fannin would be available to help settle the case and
report back to court. Lawyers said late Monday that Fannin had agreed
to mediate and would meet with the parties Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Mediators are often quicker and less expensive than trials.</TE>
<TE>   But naming a possible mediator was all either side could agree
upon on a day when America's pastime once again shifted from the
ballpark to the courtroom, where the only pinstripes were on
attorneys' blue suits.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by reporters in a cramped hallway outside Superior
Court Presiding Judge Ronald Evans Quidachay's courtroom, Popov
repeated his claim over the hunk of horsehide, which Hayashi is
keeping in an East Bay bank safety deposit box.</TE>
<TE>   Each man questioned the other's motivation for wanting the ball.
Popov suggested his adversary was a get-rich-quick opportunist.
Hayashi called Popov, a 38-year-old Berkeley restaurant owner, rigid
and said he refused to compromise.</TE>
<TE>   The pair said they both were prepared for trial.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd just like this piece of baseball history returned," said
Popov, adding that he wanted to return the ball to San Francisco. "I
caught it, and it was forcibly removed from me. And I want it back."</TE>
<TE>   Hayashi insists that during the scrum, he looked up from the
bottom of a pile of bodies to see the ball lying next to him. Popov
says he had the ball in his hands before it was illegally seized by
the 37-year-old Hayashi.</TE>
<TE>   "I caught the ball. I controlled it. I took it to my torso and
took it all the way to the cement," he said. "There is not a single
witness who can say I dropped that ball."</TE>
<TE>   Popov told reporters that two weeks after the incident, he called
Hayashi and left a message at his home, offering to settle the matter
"over a couple of beers," but that the call was never returned.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to sue," he said. "My golf handicap has gone up
five or six strokes because of this."</TE>
<TE>   Hayashi acknowledged receiving the message. "He told me my cause
was going nowhere, and offered me $5,000 for the ball. This is a
historical ball. And it's a very simple story. He made it complex."</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys say several organizations, including the San Francisco
Giants baseball team, have offered to arrange that the ball be
auctioned off. Bonds has reportedly said he thinks that would be a
fair resolution, said Michael Lee, Hayashi's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Triano, Popov's lawyer, told reporters that his client
resisted a suggestion by Hayashi that the ball be auctioned off and
both men split the proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like having a family heirloom stolen," he said. "Would it be
fair if you didn't get it back and had to split the proceeds of its
sale with the person who stole it from you?"</TE>
<TE>   If the case goes to trial, both sides will summon a phalanx of
witnesses that includes umpires, scorers, fans and legal experts.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, reporters asked Popov if he would be willing to
discuss a resolution without lawyers present. When he agreed, half a
dozen television cameras turned and rushed toward Hayashi, who was
standing with his lawyers just 10 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   Wincing in front of the bright TV lights, Hayashi said he was
willing to talk when Popov offered him "a national apology" for
comments made about him in the press.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm open to negotiations," he said. "I'm very flexible."</TE>
<TE>   He suggested the pair split the proceeds from the sale of the
ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I value that ball just as much as he does. If it goes to trial, I
will be the owner of that ball."</TE>
<TE>   Popov said Monday that he has so far spent more than $100,000 in
legal fees, "money that could have gone to" Hayashi.</TE>
<TE>   The case has turned heads even among courtroom veterans.</TE>
<TE>   "I was talking to a friend the other night at the Giants game,"
said lawyer Jack Friedman. "We agreed Barry Bonds probably leads the
league in home run balls ending up in litigation."</TE>

<HD>Justices Rule in 4 Death Penalty Cases</HD>
<DH>Law: U.S. Supreme Court upholds two execution reversals,
orders review of a third and clears way for '83 Chino Hills killer to
die.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand two decisions by the U.S.
9th Circuit Court of Appeals in which death sentences were reversed,
but the high court said it would review another death penalty
reversal by the appellate court.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the Supreme Court upheld a 9th Circuit decision that
permits the planned execution of Kevin Cooper to move forward.
Cooper, convicted of a 1983 quadruple murder in Chino Hills after
escaping from prison, now goes to the head of the list of those
facing execution on California's death row, according to Dane
Gillette, who heads the death penalty unit in the California attorney
general's office.</LD>
<LD>   Cooper is seeking further hearings before the 9th Circuit, but
prospects dimmed last week when the state attorney general's office
said that new DNA testing appears to place Cooper at the crime scene.</LD>
<TE>   Although the three other 9th Circuit decisions all reversed death
sentences that had been approved by the California Supreme Court, the
cases did not otherwise fall into a particular pattern.</TE>
<TE>   In one case that the high court let stand Monday, the death
sentence of a Lassen County man had been reversed because of
ineffective assistance of counsel in the penalty phase of his trial.
Last February, the 9th Circuit ruled 3-0 that the attorney for
Benjamin W. Silva, who had been convicted of first-degree murder and
kidnapping stemming from the deaths of two college students in 1981,
had failed to investigate and present potentially compelling
mitigating evidence during the penalty phase.</TE>
<TE>   His appellate attorneys unearthed evidence that Silva had been
"severely abused and neglected as a child by alcoholic and
impoverished parents; that he may suffer from organic brain disorders
resulting from fetal alcohol syndrome; ... and that at the time of
the crime, he was probably suffering from amphetamine-induced organic
metal disorders and withdrawal symptoms," according to the 9th
Circuit.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court also declined to review a 2001 appellate
ruling that a trial judge had given confusing instructions to a jury
in the penalty phase of Bruce W. Morris' 1987 murder trial. The
appeals court said jurors were given written instructions that at one
point stated that Morris, if not sentenced to death for the 1985
murder of a man hitchhiking to Lake Tahoe, would face life with the
possibility of parole. The instruction should have said life without
possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   Gillette said that both cases have been sent back to federal
district court judges for further examination of other issues that
arose at the guilt phase of each trial. He said that "at the very
least," each man would be entitled to a new penalty phase trial.</TE>
<TE>   In the fourth case, stemming from another 2001 reversal by the 9th
Circuit, the high court decided it will review the case based on a
technical question. The 9th Circuit ruled that the judge in Robert F.
Garceau's 1987 Kern County murder trial improperly invited jurors to
consider the defendant's previous murder conviction--or his record of
drug dealing, burglary and weapons violations.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court indicated that its decision would be based on
interpretation of a 1996 federal statute, the Anti-Terrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act. That law was designed to limit the
rights of convicted murderers to have federal courts review their
cases.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, there has been considerable litigation over which
cases it applies to.</TE>

road to help cut soot and smog.</LD>
<LD>   The California Natural Gas Vehicle Partnership is an effort by
business and government leaders to close ranks behind a series of
regulations that Los Angeles-area smog fighters recently approved to
convert fleets of taxis, trash trucks, shuttle buses and other
vehicles to clean fuels.</LD>
<LD>   The goal of the partnership is to place about 777,000 natural
gas-powered vehicles on the highways in 10 years, a huge increase
from the 19,000 such vehicles that operate in California today.</LD>
<TE>   "The status quo is unsustainable," said Norma Glover, a Newport
Beach councilwoman and chair of the South Coast Air Quality
Management District governing board. "Natural gas vehicles are clean
and available today, [and] California must deploy more."</TE>
<TE>   While limited numbers of natural gas cars and trucks are in use,
they are constrained in part by a lack of refueling stations. A chief
goal of the program will be to increase the availability of fueling
stations as fleets expand.</TE>
<TE>   However, the partnership program does not call for new government
spending or regulatory initiatives to get the job done. Instead,
Glover said, the proposal relies on outreach and education to promote
use of the vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   Among the participants, Ford Motor Co. is providing natural gas
cars for taxi fleets, Waste Management Inc. will deploy garbage
trucks using the fuel, and Super Shuttle Corp. will use natural gas
airport vans.</TE>
<TE>   California Air Resources Board Chairman Alan Lloyd said the
program is part of an ongoing effort to diversify fuels used by
trucks, buses and cars.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time we can have some competition with fuels, it's healthy
and good. Natural gas is a technology that has developed for
heavy-duty engines," Lloyd said.</TE>
<TE>   Fueling the push to cleaner fuels are recent studies that link
diesel soot to health and environmental problems, including cancer,
asthma and global warming. A 2-year-old study found diesel soot
accounts for 70% of the air pollution cancer hazard in the Los
Angeles region.</TE>
<TE>   But finding an alternative to diesel fuel has been difficult.
Diesel engines are cheap, reliable and powerful. They are getting
cleaner and cleaner, too, as soot traps and improved engine designs
reduce emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Air Resources Board approved regulations that
require a 90% reduction in sooty emissions from diesel engines by the
end of the decade. Natural gas engines emit fewer nitrogen oxides,
which can mix with other pollutants to form ozone and haze. However,
natural gas engines typically cost more and some fleet operators
complain they are not as durable as diesel models.</TE>

<HD>Eagle Rescued at Sea Is Recovering</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: The bird, part of a reintroduction program at
Santa Cruz Island, was found by divers. Others trying to reach the
mainland have fared less well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bedraggled bald eagle, recently set free on Santa Cruz Island, is
recovering after being plucked from the ocean by two men returning
from a diving trip around Channel Islands National Park.</LD>
<LD>   The Alaska-born eagle was released last month as part of a major
effort to reintroduce the species to the Channel Islands. A dozen
eagles have been released on Santa Cruz Island this year, and another
12 are to be set free there annually for the next five years.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-month-old female was malnourished and dehydrated when Mark
Ferguson spotted it floundering eight miles off Santa Cruz Island
last week.</LD>
<TE>   "We saw something in the water and sea gulls were circling, so we
went over to take a look," said the 42-year-old engineer from
Thousand Oaks. "It looked like it was using its wing to do a
breaststroke. I could see the transmitter attached to its back."</TE>
<TE>   After some debate, Ferguson and his friend maneuvered their boat
close, and Ferguson grabbed the eagle by the tail.</TE>
<TE>   "I was afraid of getting scraped by its claws but it looked pretty
exhausted," Ferguson said. "We put it in the front of the boat. After
20 minutes it started to revive. It flew to the front end and turned
around to face us."</TE>
<TE>   But the bird, which has a 6-foot wingspan, stayed put all the way
back to shore. There, it was turned over to the Ojai Raptor Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We have basically had it under 24-hour surveillance for a week,"
said Patty Perry, who works at the nonprofit raptor rehabilitation
and education center in Oak View. Perry said the bird looked as
though it hadn't eaten for three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The bird was fed fish and rodents, administered blood tests and
given electrolytes to rehydrate it, Perry said. It has gained 2
pounds since arriving Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   "She weighs 7 1/4 pounds, but she should weigh 11 or 12 pounds,"
Perry said. "She was in very critical condition when she got here."</TE>
<TE>   The sleek black eagle seemed chipper Monday as it sat in a wood
aviary at the raptor center.</TE>
<TE>   Still wearing its blue wing tags, the bird opened its mouth wide
and squawked noisily.</TE>
<TE>   It probably will be taken to Santa Cruz in a week or so and put in
a nesting box for observation and feeding, biologists say.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its condition, the eagle rescued last week was lucky. A
few weeks ago, another of the original 12 tried the 20-mile crossing
from Santa Cruz to the mainland but dropped into the ocean and
drowned less than a mile from Point Mugu. Another was tracked over
the water for at least eight days and has not been located since. A
third made it across the water and kept going.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Sharp, biologist with the Arcada-based Institute for
Wildlife Studies, the group overseeing the eagle program, said it's
common for young birds to try flying to the mainland. But thermal air
currents, which help birds glide over land, are absent over the
ocean, requiring the eagles to flap all the way across. He said some
losses are expected.</TE>

<HD>Officials Can't Repay From Accounts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Ethics Commission ruled Monday that elected city
officials cannot use their political officeholder accounts to repay
controversial campaign contributions received from the beleaguered
Entertainment Industry Development Corp.</LD>
<LD>   As a result of the ruling, City Controller Laura Chick said she
would personally repay a $1,000 campaign contribution that she
received from the quasi-public film permit agency while she was a
member of the City Council.</LD>
<LD>   "It's money that has come into question, and she felt this was the
right thing to do," said Rob Wilcox, a spokesman for Chick.</LD>
<TE>   Chick and several City Council members had sought advice from the
Ethics Commission after questions were raised by county prosecutors
about whether the film agency's funds are public money, which by law
cannot be used for political contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office recently raided the agency's
offices as part of a probe into whether the agency had misspent
money. The agency was formed by the city and county in the mid-1990s
to expedite the film permit process.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign committees that received agency contributions to benefit
Chick and others have since been closed, so she and council members
asked whether they could tap their political officeholder accounts,
which cover costs associated with holding office.</TE>
<TE>   "An expenditure from officeholder funds made to return a
contribution does not serve, assist or communicate with constituents,
nor would it be made in connection with your official duties as
controller," concluded the commission's executive director, LeeAnn
Pelham, in an advice letter.</TE>
<TE>   Two City Council members, Dennis Zine and Hal Bernson, also
received money from the agency. Bernson said that, as a result of the
opinion, he probably would not return the $500 he received.</TE>

<HD>Family of 4 Found Dead in Apparent Murder-Suicide</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man, his wife and their two young sons were found shot to death
Monday in San Jose in what appeared to be a murder-suicide, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   A friend found the bodies about 1:15 p.m. in the family's modest
house, about a quarter of a mile east of California Highway 101, said
Lt. Glenn McCourtie, commander of the San Jose Police Department's
homicide division.</LD>
<LD>   The man, woman and boys, about 4 and 2 years old, apparently had
all died of gunshot wounds, McCourtie said. He said a gun was
recovered at the scene.</LD>
<TE>   The names of the victims were withheld, pending positive
identification and notification of relatives.</TE>
<TE>   McCourtie said the motive for the killings had not been
established, "but we presume it's a murder-suicide."</TE>
<TE>   He said further details about the crime would not be released
until the police investigation had progressed, and the Santa Clara
County coroner's office had completed the autopsies.</TE>

<HD>Tony Mazzocchi, 76; Workplace Safety Advocate, Political
Activist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Mazzocchi, a longtime advocate for workplace safety whose
disenchantment with traditional politics led him to organize the
nation's first labor party in 70 years, died at his home in
Washington, D.C., on Saturday. He was 76 and had pancreatic cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Mazzocchi brought 1,400 union leaders to a Cleveland convention
hall in 1996 to form the Labor Party. Labeled a foolhardy idea by
union leaders and political analysts, it was conceived in an era of
waning union strength and has fewer than 14,000 members.</LD>
<LD>   Although disappointed by the fledgling party's slow growth,
Mazzocchi remained committed to its pro-worker agenda, focused on
single-payer national health insurance, free higher education and
workers' rights.</LD>
<TE>   His slogan: "The bosses have two parties. We need one of our own!"</TE>
<TE>   An intellectual who never finished high school, he was considered
"the Ralph Nader of industrial safety." Along with Nader and other
activists, he was a key figure behind the passage of the Occupational
Safety and Health Act in 1970, often called the most far-reaching
pro-labor law of the last half-century.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last 30 years, nobody comes close to him," said Nader,
who praised Mazzocchi's leadership on the drives to pass OSHA, the
Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act and other major legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "He is an icon," said Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the
California Nurses Assn. "More than anyone, he is the unsung hero of
organized labor. I literally lay in bed at night wondering what we
are going to do without Tony Mazzocchi."</TE>
<TE>   A former secretary-treasurer of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers International Union, he advised its most famous member,
Oklahoma plutonium plant worker Karen Silkwood, whose death after
struggles to ensure plant safety inspired the 1983 Oscar-nominated
movie "Silkwood."</TE>
<TE>   Mazzocchi grew up in Brooklyn, the son of a unionized garment
worker who lost the family home because of medical bills for his
cancer-stricken wife. She died when Mazzocchi was 6.</TE>
<TE>   A ninth-grade dropout, he served as a combat soldier in the
European theater during World War II, fighting in the Battle of the
Bulge and other key campaigns. He was among the first soldiers to
reach the Nazi death camps.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he worked as an auto worker, steelworker and in
construction.</TE>
<TE>   He became president of Oil and Chemical's Local 8-149 in 1953. In
1954, he negotiated for employees of a Helena Rubenstein cosmetics
factory what many believe was the first dental insurance plan in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   He served as union president until 1965. Through the 1960s and
'70s, he was a behind-the-scenes leader in key legislative battles
involving labor. He was known for forging alliances of unions,
scientists and environmentalists on issues involving nuclear safety,
asbestos and other toxic materials that threaten workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Dealing with the dangers that employees face in the
workplace--that was a passion [that] continued throughout his
career," said Bob Wages, a former president of OCAW, now the Paper,
Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union.</TE>
<TE>   Mazzocchi was based in Washington as director of the union's
legislative office in the early 1970s when Silkwood came to see him.</TE>
<TE>   Silkwood, a technician at the Kerr-McGee nuclear processing
facility in Crescent, Okla., told him she believed Kerr-McGee
officials were falsifying records about the integrity of the plant's
plutonium rods.</TE>
<TE>   She was contaminated in a series of unexplained plutonium
exposures in the weeks before her death.</TE>
<TE>   She died in a suspicious car accident in 1974 while on her way to
talk to a reporter about safety violations at the Kerr-McGee plant.</TE>
<TE>   A private investigator hired by the union after her death found
evidence that Silkwood's car might have been forced off the road
while she was allegedly carrying documents confirming her allegations
about Kerr-McGee's safety violations. No documents were ever found.</TE>
<TE>   Mazzocchi pressed for a formal government inquiry into the
circumstances surrounding her death, which was ruled an accident
despite unanswered questions that fed speculation for years. In 1986,
12 years after her fatal car crash, a civil suit lodged against
Kerr-McGee by Silkwood's estate was settled out of court for $1.3
million. The Kerr-McGee nuclear fuel plants closed in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Mazzocchi later established an innovative internship program that
exposed medical and public health students to workplace conditions.
He also was instrumental in the union's commissioning of a play by
Denver playwright Larry Bograd called "The Half-Life of Karen
Silkwood," which made its premiere in 1993 at the Attic Theatre in
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   A firm believer in the power of art to enrich the labor movement,
he pressed for a play to be written about his union's history. It was
presented at a national convention.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he organized a film festival in Washington that
featured movies with working-class themes.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1980s, Mazzocchi drew attention to efforts in industry
to make women working around toxic materials undergo sterilization.
He was cited by Ms. magazine in 1982 as one of the "40 Male Heroes of
the Decade" for "exposing exclusionary corporate 'fetal protection
policies' " that restricted the hiring of women of childbearing age.</TE>
<TE>   Mazzocchi had been arguing for a national political party
controlled by working people since at least the early 1980s, when he
made it a central plank of his run for the national presidency of the
Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers. He lost the election to a more
traditional unionist. But, by the end of the decade, he sensed that
conditions had changed.</TE>
<TE>   At a union board meeting in early 1989, Mazzocchi and his
colleagues were discussing what they saw as the moribund state of the
American labor movement and the lack of Democratic Party leadership
on workers' issues.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing led to another, and Tony laid out this vision," Wages
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Later that year, a survey was conducted of the union's membership
and that of 90 other local and regional unions. It showed
overwhelming support for a labor party. Mazzocchi saw the results as
a mandate.</TE>
<TE>   With his union's backing, he launched Labor Party Advocates to
build a national network of supporters. As chief organizer, he
crisscrossed the country for the next several years, talking up the
party at factories, refineries, foundries--anywhere he could find
workers.</TE>
<TE>   The last time unions had thrown their weight behind a labor party
was in 1924, when they supported Wisconsin Sen. Robert LaFollette for
president against Calvin Coolidge. LaFollette's defeat--he came in
third--was the death knell for the Progressive Party.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the decline in union membership at the end of the 20th
century, labor analysts and trade union leaders were skeptical of the
new attempt to form a workers party. Lane Kirkland, then AFL-CIO
president, dismissed it as "a formula for wandering in the political
wilderness."</TE>
<TE>   Mazzocchi was undeterred.</TE>
<TE>   "Movements grow in desperate times," he told Newsday in 1995. "We
are being born."</TE>
<TE>   By 1995, he had pledges of support from four small national unions
and 10,000 individuals. At the founding convention the following
year, the keynote speakers included Nader and Jerry Brown, the former
California governor and future Oakland mayor. The 1,000-plus

cancer, which he disclosed a few months ago, had prevented him from
stumping for the cause.</TE>
<TE>   It irked him that he was forced to slow down at what seemed an
opportune moment: He saw in the Enron and Worldcom scandals that left
hundreds out of work an opening for a robust new assault on big
business that could energize the party.</TE>
<TE>   "I am both afflicted with an incurable disease and blessed with an
incurable optimism," he wrote to party members in July.</TE>

<HD>Orange County Concert Hall Debut Delayed</HD>
<DH>Arts: Donations are lagging for the $200-million venue, but
officials say the holdup is to ensure acoustics are perfect. Opening
is now set for October 2006.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With donations at a standstill halfway to their goal, leaders of the
Orange County Performing Arts Center said Monday that the
$200-million concert hall they had aimed to open in the fall of 2005
will be delayed a year.</LD>
<LD>   While acknowledging that the delay will provide more time to raise
money, the center's chairman, Paul F. Folino, said the decision to
push back the opening until October 2006 was not based on
fund-raising difficulties.</LD>
<LD>   About $100 million has been raised or pledged since the campaign
began nearly three years ago. But, amid a plummeting stock market and
other economic woes, only $3.5 million in new donations has been
announced in the last 12 months.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, center officials proclaimed a "no wine before its time"
ethic: Because of its complex acoustical engineering, they said, the
2,000-seat hall requires a break-in time of three to six months to
"tune" it for peak sonic performance, and pushing to keep to the
original schedule would have risked getting off to a bad start.</TE>
<TE>   Folino and center President Jerry E. Mandel pointed to the
experience at Philadelphia's Verizon Hall, which struck a sour note
with most critics when it opened in December. Acoustical engineer
Russell Johnson was in charge of the Philadelphia hall's sound as
well as the one in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of cities have looked at the Philadelphia experience and
are making sure they have plenty of time for the tuning period," said
Johnson, who was at the center Monday along with the project's
architect, Cesar Pelli, for the first public unveiling of the hall's
interior design.</TE>
<TE>   Center leaders hope that with the design complete and detailed in
an assortment of models, sample materials and artists' renderings,
they can use them to focus community interest and inspire donations.
Last October, then-Chairman Roger T. Kirwan set a goal of $125
million to $150 million for the campaign by the end of 2002. Folino
said the aim now is to raise $30 million in the coming 12 months,
putting the center, at the end of 2003, in the range that leaders
hoped they could reach this year.</TE>
<TE>   A ceremonial groundbreaking is planned for Jan. 21, with actual
construction to begin next spring. Where previously the strategy had
been to raise as much as $150 million during a "silent phase" when
only prospective high-rolling donors were approached, Folino said the
plan now is to seek donations from all comers starting with the
groundbreaking.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get more community momentum for the project, and we
can do that by reaching out to the public," Folino said. As former
president of neighboring South Coast Repertory, Folino has led a
five-year fund-raising campaign that passed its target of $40
million--including $19 million for a just-unveiled theater expansion.
Folino, the chief executive of Emulex Corp., a Costa Mesa high-tech
company, contributed $10 million of that himself.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look around, people are still raising money, and our goal
is to get going" despite the poor economy, Folino said. If need be,
he said, the center could issue bonds to ensure that the new
timetable is met.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Symphony, which will be the new concert hall's leading
tenant, views the extra year as "welcome news," President John E.
Forsyte said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The interior design unveiled Monday calls for an auditorium with
ivory-colored plaster facades for its four undulating balconies, and
bright, red velvet upholstery on the seats. The three adjustable
acoustical canopies would hang above the stage, and orchestra areas
will have silver facades. The outside walls will be of pale beige
limestone; the building's hallmark will be a curved glass facade
intended to be set a-glitter with light while providing a see-through
effect.</TE>

<HD>Expand Inn? Be Our Guest, Residents Say</HD>
<DH>Ojai Valley: Resort's $60-million upgrade would add jobs
and boost tax revenue for the community, which has been wary of many
building projects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAIL DAVIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmentally sensitive Ojai is not known for embracing
development.</LD>
<LD>   But ever since the Ojai Valley Inn &amp; Spa first proposed a
$60-million expansion, one of the largest development projects in
recent city history, there has been little public opposition.</LD>
<LD>   One reason is that the family-owned inn remains Ojai's largest
employer and chief source of revenue. The proposed expansion would
boost the resort's work force to about 700, double the $1 million in
annual taxes paid to the city and help increase tourism.</LD>
<TE>   That is welcome news for the city and local merchants.</TE>
<TE>   Competition with swanky resorts in neighboring Santa Barbara is
driving the inn to add more $300-a-night rooms, said Thad Hyland,
managing director. About 60,000 guests visit each year.</TE>
<TE>   The 80-year-old mission-style inn is nestled along the Ojai Valley
floor and surrounded by majestic oaks and spectacular mountain views.
The picturesque setting has long made it a popular refuge for
celebrities, from Bing Crosby to Barbra Streisand.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council will consider the proposal during its meeting
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Although the development project would fell trees, encroach on
wetlands and bring unwanted traffic, environmentalists have not
exactly come out in force against it. They acknowledge the resort's
importance to the community.</TE>
<TE>   "We see it as a vital part of maintaining Ojai," said Ivor
Benci-Woodward, president of the environmental group Citizens to
Preserve the Ojai. But his group remains concerned about increased
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Hyland said the inn encourages employees to carpool and use local
bus service to help reduce traffic. Service trucks will also be
directed to an entrance south of downtown to avoid congestion there.</TE>
<TE>   Plans also call for enhancing wetlands located near the new
construction site by removing non-native eucalyptus and planting
hundreds of new oaks. The development would also require a new
traffic light at the intersection of Hermosa Road and California 150,
which many residents welcome.</TE>
<TE>   The town's taste for debate has settled more on which aspect of
expansion would benefit Ojai most.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Bowman, who owns three high-end clothing stores in Ojai,
says inn guests tend to be well-traveled and big-spenders. So having
more of them frequenting local businesses can only be good, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even a rival spa welcomes the expansion. Sheila Cluff, owner of
the Oaks at Ojai Spa, said the inn's hefty marketing budget benefits
the whole city. "We could never begin to get the exposure that they
give," Cluff said.</TE>
<TE>   The one significant downside of the 14-month project is that it
would temporarily shrink the inn to about 60 rooms.</TE>

<HD>Driver Fails One of Basic Sobriety Field Tests--Counting
Number of Tires</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's time for another action-packed episode in the city of
Paramount's monthly newsletter, which recounts how a motorist was
pulled over on suspicion of drunk driving the other day and demanded
to know why.</LD>
<LD>   He was told it had something to do with the fact that his car was
missing one tire and that he was leaving a shower of sparks as he
maneuvered down the street.</LD>
<LD>   Dueling signs: Henk Friezer of Eagle Rock found a couple of
notices that were linked only by tape (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   Unrelated (part II): A reader tipped me to the Web site of UC San
Diego, commenting that she was surprised that the school would say
greed was part of its tradition (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   I phoned the campus to check and it turned out that the two terms
at the top of the image were part of a neon art sculpture, "Vices and
Virtues," and the juxtaposition with "A Dynamic Tradition," was
inadvertent.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the school doesn't advocate temperance ...</TE>
<TE>   Abe Lincoln's kind of house: Another reader dispatched me an ad
for a mansion with a most unusual foundation (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   An early trick or treat: Laguna doesn't have much crime to cover,
so the city's News-Post turned its attention to the shopper who
"would not take no for an answer."</TE>
<TE>   The woman had tried to buy a pumpkin growing on a vine at a
nursery but was turned down. So "she scooped the pumpkin up and fled
with it to her car. The shop owner discovered that the pumpkin was
missing 10 minutes later and called police."</TE>
<TE>   Alas, 10 minutes can be a long time in these matters. "Police
responded to the petty theft call," the newspaper said, but couldn't
find the pumpkin pilferer.</TE>
<TE>   The News-Post added: "A full identification of the pumpkin has not
been disclosed." Not that the ID will be helpful for much longer. In
a few weeks, the thief will undoubtedly alter the gourd's looks with
a carving knife for Halloween.</TE>
<TE>   Don't call us, we'll call you: The L.A. Business Journal published
some interview blunders by unsuccessful job-seekers, including the
remark of one applicant who said she was leaving her current job
because "all managers are jerks." And then there was the candidate
who was complimented on his choice of college and said, "I'm glad
that got your attention. I didn't really go there."</TE>
<TE>   I was reminded of my one experience as an employer when I had to
hire a nanny.</TE>
<TE>   Those of you who have been in the same position know that a
nanny-wanted ad draws calls from every misfit in the area. Look at it
from their point of view: All they have to do is watch TV while the
baby sleeps or plays, the boss isn't there, and there's a
refrigerator within walking distance.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, among the people we rejected was a woman who told us that
she had hurriedly moved here from the East Coast. She added: "Don't
ask me why."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: I saw a preview of this week's episode of the TV drama
"24" in which star Kiefer Sutherland tells someone over the phone,
"You need to get out of Los Angeles now." Is this another rumor about
the real estate bubble bursting here?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Harvey can be reached at (800) LA-TIMES, ext. 77083, by fax
at (213) 237-4712, by mail at Metro, L.A. Times, 202 W. 1st St., L.A.

<HD>Judge Lifts Ban on Playa Vista Roadwork</HD>
<DH>Environment: Workers begin widening Culver Boulevard after
activists lose court decision in battle to conserve wetlands
vegetation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bulldozers began widening a stretch of Culver Boulevard near the
Playa Vista project Monday morning, immediately after activists
concerned about wetlands habitat lost their court battle to stop the
work.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Helen Bendix denied a request for
a preliminary injunction sought by a Sierra Club wetlands task force
in a suit against the California Coastal Commission and Playa Vista.</LD>
<LD>   Her refusal to grant an injunction ended a prohibition on grading
in the area near Marina del Rey. Work had been stopped since another
judge granted a temporary restraining order Sept. 16.</LD>
<TE>   The Coastal Commission voted 10-1 a year ago to approve the work,
part of many road improvements that are supposed to ease traffic flow
and improve safety around the controversial development, which was
first proposed more than two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Sierra Club's Ballona Wetlands Task Force said
the group plans to proceed with a suit against the Coastal Commission
and Playa Vista, aimed at protecting land that the plaintiffs say
includes wetlands plants such as seaside heliotrope and mule fat. But
Roy van de Hoek, chairman of the task force, suggested that the
grading could make the group's case tough to prove.</TE>
<TE>   "They could destroy the wetlands vegetation and evidence we need
for a trial we're going to have in a few months," Van de Hoek said.</TE>
<TE>   The project opponents say they will continue with their litigation
partly as a symbolic gesture, but also in hopes that roots of the
plants plowed under Monday have survived and that the vegetation can
make a comeback.</TE>
<TE>   George Mihlsten, an attorney for Playa Vista, said Bendix's
decision indicated that she had decided that the activists were
unlikely to prevail at trial. He said the area at issue is about five
acres and that just a tiny sliver, perhaps 1/100th of an acre,
contains wetlands vegetation.</TE>
<TE>   "The court concluded that these were not wetlands and that the
Coastal Commission acted appropriately when it determined these
improvements should be made," Mihlsten said.</TE>
<TE>   The plans call for adding a traffic lane and a turn lane to Culver
Boulevard between Lincoln Boulevard and the Marina Freeway and
building modified and new ramp connections between Culver and
Jefferson boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   Playa Vista opponents have filed 15 suits challenging aspects of
the 1,087-acre project over many years, Mihlsten said. Although a
couple of cases are still pending, he said the developer has
prevailed in the others.</TE>
<TE>   Large portions of the development have been built in recent
months. Rental units in three buildings at the northeast corner of
Jefferson and Lincoln boulevards have been steadily filling since
April 1. Playa Vista has yet to seek occupancy permits for two other
rental buildings in that project, called Fountain Park.</TE>
<TE>   Two commercial buildings at the site have yet to find tenants,
perhaps a reflection of the difficult economy.</TE>
<TE>   Builders say they are poised to begin writing sales contracts on
hundreds of condos, townhomes and single-family dwellings south of
Jefferson Boulevard.</TE>

<LD>Stepping up a campaign against Walt Disney Co., activists on Monday
charged that workers--some as young as 10 years old--labored for more
than 13 hours a day stitching Winnie the Pooh shirts at a Bangladesh
factory.</LD>
<LD>   During the last two weeks, the National Labor Committee for Human
Rights has picketed outside Disney Stores in Chicago, New York and
Nashville to protest what they say are low pay and poor working
conditions at factories turning out Disney-themed merchandise. Today,
they plan to demonstrate at Disneyland in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Shirley Slesinger Lasswell, who owns the rights to Pooh
merchandise and is locked in a bitter royalty lawsuit with Disney,
sobbed at a news conference in Beverly Hills as Lisa Rahman, 19,
described life inside the Dhaka factory. Rahman said she toiled at
the factory for three years, earning as little as 8 cents an hour.</LD>
<TE>   "None of us wants to profit from human suffering," said Lasswell,
81. Her attorney, Bertram Fields, said his team is researching
whether to incorporate the allegations into its lawsuit, which is
scheduled for trial in March. Lasswell and her daughter, Patricia
Slesinger, have received more than $66 million from Disney since 1961
for the sale of Pooh merchandise.</TE>
<TE>   Burbank-based Disney maintains that the company is being unfairly
targeted. "We feel that we have one of the best international labor
standards programs in the world," spokesman Gary Foster said. "We
take these issues very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   He said Disney spends millions each year investigating and
enforcing its code of work standards, auditing about 25,000 factories
in 50 countries. Disney-hired auditors visited the Dhaka factory 11
times and could not substantiate charges of worker abuse, Foster
said.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, Disney has set up a computerized tracking system to
monitor its merchandise contracts and conditions. The company also
requires that Disney work be pulled from factories that fail three
audits.</TE>

<HD>Disney Hopes Bug Adds Life to Park</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: New California Adventure venue, based on a
popular animated film, is designed to boost attendance of young
families.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Signaling a significant shift for its low-drawing California
Adventure amusement park in Anaheim, Disney officials on Monday
opened a new kid-friendly attraction based on the popular "A Bug's
Life" animated movie and announced plans for a spring stage show
based on the "Playhouse Disney" television show.</LD>
<LD>   Disney officials described the new attractions, along with the
Tower of Terror ride being built for a 2004 opening, as part of a
general and long-running evolution of its amusement parks.</LD>
<LD>   "We're hoping with the addition of 'a bug's land' and Tower of
Terror, and with continuing creative development, that Disneyland
Resorts will continue to grow and prosper," Disney chief Michael
Eisner told employees, invited guests and California Adventure
patrons. "I'm unbelievably enthusiastic about what's going on down
here."</LD>
<TE>   The spring "Playhouse Disney--Live on Stage" show will extend
Disney's overtures to young families--a demographic group noticeably
absent since the 55-acre California Adventure opened in February
2001, and which has failed to meet initial attendance projections.</TE>
<TE>   Little of that was on the minds of hundreds of youngsters and
their families who defied a sweltering sun Monday morning to pour
into the new Flik's Fun Fair, based on the award-winning "A Bug's
Life," which had merged with the existing It's Tough to Be a Bug and
Beautiful Valley Farm attractions to create "a bug's land."</TE>
<TE>   "The rides are really cute," said Alyssa Hansen, 9, of Irvine
moments after alighting from Heimlich's Chew Chew Train caterpillar
ride through a forest of food--including a watermelon rind that drips
"juice" and smells like the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   "I like that they've done this--it seems more like traditional
Disney," added her mother, Janice Hansen, 37.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will encourage families with young children to come
here," she said. "I think [Disney officials] listened to what the
people said they wanted."</TE>

<HD>City Dives Into River Revival</HD>
<DH>Environment: Council panel hopes to guide efforts to make
waterway an attractive part of the urban landscape.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The newly formed ad hoc committee on the Los Angeles River met
Monday, marking the first time the city will try to come up with a
master plan for the revitalization of the river.</LD>
<LD>   The group, headed by Councilman Ed Reyes, is hailed as significant
by those long involved in efforts to revive the river because the
committee can act as a central organization to coordinate various
efforts.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the first time the City of Los Angeles has taken an
active, organized role in the development of the Los Angeles River,"
said Lewis MacAdams, the chairman of the board of the Friends of the
Los Angeles River, a nonprofit group that promotes restoration of
natural habitat, open space and parks around the river. "It's very
significant at that level."</LD>
<TE>   Observers note that the body--composed of Reyes and City Council
members Eric Garcetti, Wendy Greuel, Tom LaBonge and Jan Perry--has
direct power over things such as zoning that may make it easier to
accomplish projects.</TE>
<TE>   The committee was created in August by Los Angeles City Council
President Alex Padilla.</TE>
<TE>   The committee held its first meeting--attended by about 150
community members, environmentalists and city officials--in Lincoln
Heights atop the Buena Vista Bridge, where the river trickles along
beneath North Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   The committee plans to centralize numerous studies done on the
51-mile river over the years, take stock of ongoing revitalization
projects and consult with community members. Members warned that
converting the river into an attractive attribute of the city is a
long-term effort.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that we change the image of the river," Reyes
said. "In the past, everything we wanted to hide, to not see, we put
them next to the river. And in the process, we failed to recognize
the power of this resource."</TE>
<TE>   The task of the committee is to come up with ideas for projects.</TE>
<TE>   For its first action, the committee adopted a set of nine guiding
principles. The principles include the idea that the river, restored
to its natural beauty, offers opportunities for business development
and housing. The principles also advocate that the river can have
many uses, including recreation, open space and flood protection.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles River runs from the western San Fernando Valley to
Long Beach. In some parts, it has vibrant natural habitats. But in
some parts--such as the stretch through the central city--its path
was paved long ago, creating an attractive target for graffiti
vandals.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, there have been a flurry of projects. Most
heard about are plans for state parks at two sites, known as Taylor
Yard and the Cornfield, near downtown Los Angeles. Other projects
include the development of a system of small parks and bike and
walking paths.</TE>
<TE>   Key in keeping the river projects alive have been groups such as
Friends of the Los Angeles River.</TE>

<LD>A group of American Indians is suing the federal government, saying
they have been illegally denied full membership in the Mooretown
Rancheria.</LD>
<LD>   If successful, the nearly 70 Maidu Indians would be able to claim
a share of the profits from Oroville casinos in Butte County.</LD>
<LD>   The case stems from a 1983 judgment that reversed a policy
allowing tribes to take over rancherias if they forfeit their status
as Indians and the benefits that come with federal designation.</LD>
<TE>   The suit contends the Bureau of Indian Affairs is misinterpreting
the ruling to hold that only American Indians who had received
distribution of the rancheria's assets under the defeated policy can
now take part in tribal affairs.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Opponents of an English-only public school measure lost another legal
challenge Monday when a federal appeals court declined, for a second
time, to block it from taking effect.</LD>
<LD>   Proposition 227, a measure that virtually banned bilingual
education in California public schools, has prevailed through the
federal courts since taking effect in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Four years ago, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denied a
request by bilingual education advocates for an injunction that would
have prevented the measure from taking effect. The court issued its
written ruling Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The initiative, approved by 61% of the voters, repealed 30 years
of policies that allowed California public school students to be
taught subjects in their native languages until they were fluent in
English.</TE>

<LD>As a massive fire gutted Santana Row, the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms offered its national response team to help
determine the cause, but city officials declined the offer.</LD>
<LD>   Weeks after the Aug. 19 blaze, fire officials still don't know
what started it. The fire caused more than $50 million in damage to
the retail and residential development and left 71 people homeless.</LD>
<LD>   "We felt there was nothing this team could do that we couldn't do
ourselves," said Fire Capt. Mark Mooney. But, he said, had he
understood exactly how much help the ATF could have lent, he probably
would have accepted the offer.</LD>

<HD>Valley Secessionists Present First TV Ad</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Low-budget spot is produced by a city council
candidate. Also, business leaders vow to spur redevelopment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nudging the campaign to break up Los Angeles forward on a shoestring,
San Fernando Valley secessionists on Monday began airing their first
television commercial, a low-budget cable spot that says City Hall
ignores local needs.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, a group of local business leaders who have long
pushed for secession vowed to help an independent Valley city use
redevelopment money to build industrial parks throughout the area and
expand commercial space on Ventura Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   The TV ad was produced by a secession supporter, Garrett Biggs,
who is running for a seat on the city council that would be created
if the Valley became a city.</LD>
<TE>   Biggs, who donated most of the work, cobbled the spot together
from footage of a commercial he filmed for his own campaign. He also
has produced a second spot for the secession drive, but the San
Fernando Valley Independence Committee, which is running the
campaign, has not yet decided whether to use it or one of its own.
The Independence Committee has budgeted $150,000 for one or both
spots.</TE>
<TE>   The first ad shows a Valley resident petitioning an indifferent
city council with complaints.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the ad, the Valley resident asks, "Is anybody
listening?" The camera cuts to one council member's notes, which turn
out to be a crossword puzzle with the word "Disenfranchise"
highlighted.</TE>
<TE>   Biggs estimated that the first commercial will reach about 200,000
homes, but said it may not be shown outside the Valley. He said there
are no plans yet to buy time on more-expensive broadcast TV stations.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-secession campaign led by Mayor James K. Hahn is
preparing to launch a multimillion-dollar ad blitz that will include
broadcast TV.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a coalition of Valley business leaders said a new city
would bring in more investment, increase sales-tax revenues and cut
business taxes in half.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lack of interest on the part of the city of Los
Angeles in attracting businesses," said Bill Allen, former president
of the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Blighted or abandoned areas should be used for industrial parks,
Allen said, with more police patrols to show potential tenants that
their employees would be safe.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be able to announce that we're open for business again
in the San Fernando Valley," said Bill Powers, chairman of the San
Fernando Valley United Chambers of Commerce. Powers and others in the
group expressed confidence that they would have enough influence with
a Valley city to see the tax-cutting, business-promoting policies
carried out.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working on this for six years," said Jeff Brain,
president of the secession group Valley VOTE. "Do you really think
that in our own city we wouldn't have any influence?"</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Hollywood secessionists announced several
endorsements that they said would help build support for their cause
among African Americans in South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The endorsements came from Daude Sherrills of Watts, who helped
negotiate a truce between members of the Bloods and Crips gangs in
1992; Eunice Carr, executive director of the Black American Political
Assn. of California, a group that claims 60,000 members; the Rev. Lee
P. James, a chaplain for the association; and the Rev. Waymon Baker
of New Pleasant Hill Church.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget the hot dogs and the bagels, the chiles and the oranges.
That's way too easy. Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly and Minneapolis Mayor
R.T. Rybak have upped the ante on friendly wagers.</LD>
<LD>   Depending on the outcome of the American League Championship
Series between the Angels and the Minnesota Twins, which starts
today, one mayor will have to toss his dignity out the window.</LD>
<LD>   "Because we beat the Yankees so soundly, I told [Rybak] I thought
the Angels should be favored over the Twins. He didn't disagree,"
Daly said. "I think he'd look pretty cute in Mickey Mouse ears."</LD>
<TE>   Rybak is equally certain Daly will be wearing a Twins jersey and a
hunting cap a la Elmer Fudd. (The headwear must be worn for one
entire day--even to city meetings.)</TE>
<TE>   "When the Twins win, he will not only wear a Twins jersey, but a
'Fargo'-styled hat with the ear flaps," Rybak said. "I could even
have him up the stakes because I am so confident the Twins are going
to win."</TE>
<TE>   The two mayors on Monday took to Minneapolis airwaves to make
their friendly wager official. They agreed on the usual gift baskets:
chiles and oranges from Anaheim; beer, tea and Pillsbury flour from
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   But both agreed they should make things a little more interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Rybak complained that his bet with Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown was
"pretty lame." Brown now owes him a gondola ride.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim, meanwhile, awaits its shipment of hot dogs and bagels
from New York City.</TE>

<HD>German Media Firm Discloses Nazi Ties</HD>
<DH>Europe: A commission set up by Bertelsmann reports that the
company published anti-Semitic books and used forced Jewish labor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>German media giant Bertelsmann made large profits by selling millions
of anti-Semitic books during the Nazi era and used Jewish slave
laborers, a commission set up by the firm said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Bertelsmann tapped the rising Nazi tide to switch from publishing
religious and school books to entertainment for the German army,
selling 19 million books to soldiers in World War II, according to
the Independent Historical Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Chief executive Gunter Thielen on Monday reaffirmed the company's
"sincere regret" over inaccuracies in the conglomerate's previous
history and its activities during the Nazi era as Bertelsmann
presented the final report by a commission led by Israeli historian
Saul Friedlaender.</LD>
<TE>   "We have learned that we cannot neglect our history, rather, our
goal was to uncover the truth and learn from the mistakes that we
have made," Thielen said in a statement, adding that all the material
used for the 800-page report would be made public.</TE>
<TE>   The commission found that the company did not use slave laborers
at its headquarters in Guetersloh, but that Jews were forced to work
at printing facilities used by Bertelsmann in Nazi-occupied Vilnius,
Lithuania--and probably in Riga, Latvia.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unclear if C. Bertelsmann had any influence on the work
conditions in these presses, and if, on account of the use of cheaper
[Jewish] forced labor, the move to the Baltic for printing meant
saving money," the commission's report concluded.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also found the company "legend" that it was a
victim of the Nazis was a lie. The Nazis did indeed close the firm in
1944, but probably because their own publishing house wanted to kill
off competition, not because of subversive texts.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1945, the legend that C. Bertelsmann was closed down because
of resistance to the Nazis smoothed the way for the occupation
authorities promptly granting the firm a new license to publish," the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   When Bertelsmann became America's biggest book publisher by
acquiring Random House in 1998, it portrayed its role in the Nazi era
as being prosecuted for its theological works. However, media reports
about its past prompted Bertelsmann to set up the commission.</TE>
<TE>   "Bertelsmann published a variety of papers and books that clearly
had anti-Jewish bias," Friedlaender told a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   The commission found Bertelsmann produced books to indoctrinate
soldiers and targeted the youth market with its "Exciting Stories"
series and the likes of "The Christmas Book of the Hitler Youth" as
its sales shot up by a factor of 20.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'Exciting Stories' series and other material belonging to the
firm's theological and popular literature programs contained
anti-Semitic stereotypes and polemics," it said.</TE>
<TE>   Bertelsmann is one of 6,000 German firms paying half of a $5-
billion settlement with hundreds of thousands of people forced to
work under the Nazis. Several large German companies including
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank have appointed independent historians
to probe their background during the Third Reich.</TE>

<HD>Brazil Faces Choice of Visions</HD>
<DH>Election: Finalists with opposing views on financial woes
prepare for a runoff. Despite big lead, Lula could easily falter,
analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO</DL>
<LD>The top two finishers in Brazil's presidential election began a
three-week runoff campaign Monday that promises to present voters
with two very different visions of the future of this economically
troubled country.</LD>
<LD>   Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the leftist Workers Party candidate,
will take a big lead into the Oct. 27 election, having won 46% of the
vote in Sunday's first round, double the total of the second-place
finisher, Jose Serra of the ruling Social Democratic Party of Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   But political analysts say the Workers Party candidate, known here
simply as Lula, will face big challenges in his effort to become
president of Latin America's largest country. He could easily be done
in by the complex web of inter-party alliances that are a constant
backdrop to Brazilian politics.</LD>
<TE>   Lula has performed well in the early stages of previous
elections--this is his fourth run for president--only to see his
campaign falter in the home stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Already on Monday, with the last first-round ballots still being
counted, Lula's campaign was encountering new obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Garotinho, who finished third with 18% of the vote, said
he had presented Lula with conditions for supporting him in the
second round. Garotinho complained about the Workers Party's
alliances with right-wing political bosses in northeastern Brazil,
including former President Jose Sarney.</TE>
<TE>   "Lula is with Sarney, with those politicians who brought Brazil
down," Garotinho said. "If he wants our support, he's going to have
to think about who he makes friends with."</TE>
<TE>   Serra faces an even steeper climb after winning just 23% of the
vote Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   More than three-quarters of the Brazilian electorate voted for
left and center-left candidates, in a loud rejection of the
pro-market policies of outgoing President Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
who picked Serra to be his successor.</TE>
<TE>   Milton Seligman, campaign coordinator for Serra, asked the losing
candidates to "stop, think and look in the eyes of the [two
remaining] candidates and pick the one who is best prepared to govern
Brazil."</TE>
<TE>   David Fleischer, a political science professor at the University
of Brasilia, said both candidates risk having first-round allies
desert them. In the first round, Lula received the support of the
right-wing Liberal Front, or PFL, the largest party in the lower
house of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "A large part of the PFL is considering moving to Serra,"
Fleischer said. The party was a member of Cardoso's ruling coalition
but pulled out earlier this year after accusing Cardoso of torpedoing
the campaign of Liberal Front presidential candidate Roseana Sarney,
daughter of the former president, who resigned in the wake of a
corruption scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Serra will also have to decide whether to run on Cardoso's
economic policies or break formally with the president. Up to now,
Serra has issued vague pronouncements about "change" without directly
criticizing the government's stewardship of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very hard call to make, but he's going to have to decide
one way or the other," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   About 115 million people cast ballots in Sunday's vote, in which
all congressional seats, part of the Senate and all 26 governorships
and state legislatures were at stake.</TE>
<TE>   On a regional level, too, the vote announced a changing of the
guard, with many veteran politicians losing. In the state of Alagoas,
former President Fernando Collor de Mello, who was impeached on
charges of corruption in 1992, lost to Socialist Party incumbent
Ronaldo Lessa.</TE>
<TE>   "Collor will never win an election in Alagoas," Lessa said Sunday
after casting his vote. "The only place he can win is in Miami," he
added, referring to the city where Collor once lived in exile. It is
a favorite destination of wealthy Brazilians.</TE>
<TE>   Lula's Workers Party added 10 seats in the Senate and increased
its block in the lower house, the National Congress, though it will
still remain a minority party in both houses.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the memory of past debacles haunts the party's leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Lula lost the presidency to Collor in a runoff amid
widespread charges of fraud. In 1994 Lula led in early polls only to
lose to Cardoso.</TE>
<TE>   But the Workers Party has never won as big a chunk of the
Brazilian electorate as it did Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have achieved the greatest victory ever for a leftist party in
Latin America," Lula said at a news conference Monday. "The people
have voted against an economic model, against dependency, and for a
new direction for our country."</TE>
<TE>   Lula also spoke late Sunday with the fourth-place finisher in the
race, Ciro Gomes of the People's Socialist Party, or PPS, who was a
finance minister in the mid-1990s. Gomes took 12% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we can make an alliance with the PPS because in the
election the PPS ran a campaign against the government," Lula said
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the loudest voice heard in favor of a Serra presidency
came, once again, from Brazil's financial markets, which prefer the
ruling party candidate because he is more likely to continue
Cardoso's policies of fiscal austerity. Lula's strong showing sent
both the Sao Paulo stock market and Brazil's currency, the real,
tumbling.</TE>
<TE>   The value of the dollar climbed from 3.62 to 3.68 reals, while the
Bovespa stock index fell 4%.</TE>

<HD>Kashmiris Infuriated by Falwell</HD>
<DH>India: Protests erupt after report that televangelist
called Muhammad a terrorist.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Thousands of Muslims demonstrated in India's Jammu and Kashmir state
Monday after a local newspaper reported that conservative U.S.
religious leader Jerry Falwell had called the founder of Islam a
terrorist.</LD>
<LD>   People shouted slogans, shops and businesses closed, and
demonstrators attacked vehicles as Islamic groups called for a
daylong strike to protest Falwell's remarks, which were made in an
interview broadcast Sunday on CBS-TV's "60 Minutes."</LD>
<LD>   The Greater Kashmir newspaper quoted the region's main separatist
alliance, the All Party Hurriyat Conference, as saying that Falwell's
remarks about Muhammad were part of a "war against humanity" and that
Christians are the "terrorists."</LD>
<TE>   "They wreaked havoc in Vietnam, killed innocent people in Iraq and
are responsible for the killings of Palestinians," the group said.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press quoted Kashmir's chief Muslim cleric, Mirwaiz
Omar Farooq, as saying Falwell's comment "reflects his ignorance and
bigotry."</TE>
<TE>   Falwell had "no right to outrage the religious sentiments of the
second-largest religious group in the world," Farooq was quoted as
saying.</TE>
<TE>   Activity Monday in several main towns, including Jammu and
Kashmir's summer capital, Srinagar, slowed to a crawl. Falwell's
comments were not broadcast in the state.</TE>
<TE>   At least 14 people were killed in the disputed region, adding to
the hundreds of casualties recorded since voting for a new state
assembly was announced Aug. 2. Polling has taken place in stages so
that security forces, poll workers and observers can move from one
area to another.</TE>
<TE>   Both India and Pakistan lay claim to the Kashmir region, which has
been the subject of two wars between the wary neighbors since they
became independent from Britain in 1947. Close to a million Indian
and Pakistani soldiers are positioned along their border.</TE>
<TE>   The voting wraps up this week. Seven seats in Jammu and Kashmir's
Doda district are up for grabs, with about 90,000 security forces
deployed for today's vote. Polling stations are under tight security.
Some are located in such remote spots that election officials have
been dropped in by helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   Voter turnout to decide the other 80 seats for the 87-member
legislature has been around 44%, well below the 54% participation
rate in a 1996 election.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts report less vote-rigging by pro-Indian officials than
six years ago. In that context, some argue, the turnout isn't bad.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent this election has turned into a contest of
legitimacy between Pakistan and India, India has come out ahead in
the propaganda war," said Ajai Sahni, executive director of the
Institute for Conflict Management in New Delhi.</TE>
<TE>   In fighting today, at least one police officer and a guerrilla
were killed in an attack on a polling station in Doda district. Three
suspected separatists, a police officer and a civilian died in
incidents across Doda on Monday. Clashes elsewhere killed three other
suspected separatists, three civilians and three security force
personnel.</TE>
<TE>   One of the closely watched contests today will be in Kupwara,
bordering Pakistan. First-round voting there was postponed after
state Law Minister Mushtaq Ahmad Lone was assassinated by separatists
opposed to the election.</TE>
<TE>   Final statewide results are expected by week's end. With many
moderate separatists boycotting the election, the ruling Indian
National Conference party is expected to return to power, although
its majority could be diminished.</TE>

<HD>Militants Kill Palestinian Police Official</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Street fighting between Hamas and law enforcement
in Gaza reflects Arafat's waning influence. Israel draws fire for a
deadly raid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KISSUFIM CROSSING, Gaza Strip</DL>
<LD>Islamic militants kidnapped and killed a Palestinian police official
in Gaza on Monday, prompting some of the worst street fighting among
Palestinians since the start of the uprising against Israel two years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   By nightfall, five Palestinians, including the police colonel, had
been killed in the fighting between Palestinian police and members of
the radical Hamas movement. Combined with a predawn raid by the
Israeli army against Hamas in which 14 Palestinians were killed, it
made for one of the deadliest and most chaotic days in the Gaza Strip
in months.</LD>
<LD>   The raid, in which the army fired machine guns on a hospital and
used a combat helicopter to fire into a Palestinian crowd, drew
widespread criticism from the diplomatic community and especially
strong language from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who warned of
the danger of escalation.</LD>
<TE>   Annan was "particularly concerned by reports that a missile from
an Israeli helicopter gunship was fired into a crowd of civilians in
reckless disregard of the obligation under international law to
protect the civilian population," said a statement read by Annan's
spokesman, Fred Eckhard. "Such actions have no legal or moral
justification," he said, calling on Israelis and Palestinians to
"halt all violent and provocative acts."</TE>
<TE>   "We are deeply troubled," State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher told reporters in Washington. "It's very important that
Israeli forces do their utmost to act in a manner that avoids harm to
civilians and humanitarian facilities."</TE>
<TE>   The surge in violence could be a harbinger of rising tensions as
the United States threatens a military campaign against Iraq. It came
near the one-year anniversary of an anti-U.S. rally in Gaza City in
support of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden at which two Islamic
militants were killed in a clash with Palestinian police.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian colonel killed Monday, Rajeh abu Lehiya, was the
head of the riot police, and his slaying apparently was revenge
exacted by Hamas-affiliated family members of one of the victims from
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Hamas militants disguised as police set up a fake
checkpoint in Gaza City and tricked Abu Lehiya and his bodyguards
into stopping. The entourage was then driven to a Hamas-controlled
neighborhood, where Abu Lehiya was shot. Shortly afterward, hundreds
of people in the Nusseirat refugee camp held a celebration in front
of the house of Yusuf Akel, a 21-year-old Hamas activist killed
during last year's riot.</TE>
<TE>   "We implemented, thank God, the sentence of death for the killer
who was responsible for martyring so many people to satisfy his
masters, the Jews and the Americans," read a statement distributed by
Imad Akel, brother of the late Hamas activist.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas is the most powerful of the Islamic political movements in
the Palestinian territories and is blamed for many of the suicide
bombings and other attacks against Israelis. On Monday, the group
denied any involvement in the colonel's killing, saying it was a
matter of "family revenge."</TE>
<TE>   "Hamas will still work to maintain Palestinian national unity and
to put an end to any kind of differences," spokesman Abdulaziz
Rantisi told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   But in a region where tribal and political loyalties are easily
blurred, the Palestinian police appeared to be retaliating against
Hamas loyalists Monday. Clashes broke out when Palestinian police
tried to arrest Hamas members who they believed were involved in the
slaying.</TE>
<TE>   The intra-Palestinian violence reflected the waning power of
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, who until last week
was held under virtual house arrest by the Israelis at his West Bank
headquarters in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   "Hamas is getting stronger in opposition to the Palestinian
Authority," said Brig. Gen. Israel Ziv, commander of the Israeli
army's Gaza division.</TE>
<TE>   During a briefing at an army base at the Kissufim crossing into
the Gaza Strip, Ziv defended the raid in the city of Khan Yunis,
which he described as a Hamas stronghold. He said the army was trying
to arrest Hamas militants and destroy weapons factories.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians said most of the 14 people killed during the raid,
which began at 2:30 a.m., were unarmed civilians. They said that many
people emerged from their homes after they believed the raid was over
simply to inspect the damage and that they were fired on by the
combat helicopter. The Israeli army denied that, saying the crowd was
armed and was trying to prevent the army's retreat.</TE>
<TE>   The army acknowledged that it had mistakenly killed 50-year-old
Raheema Hassam Salama, the mother of one of the suspected Hamas
activists it was seeking. Army officials also acknowledged firing on
Nasser Hospital, the main hospital in Khan Yunis, where the wounded
were taken. They said troops were returning fire from nearby.</TE>
<TE>   There were no Israeli casualties during the raid.</TE>
<TE>   The raid was filmed from above by an unmanned drone, and pressure
is building for Israel to release the images.</TE>

<HD>Baghdad Attempting to Curry Favor With Neighbors</HD>
<DH>Persian Gulf: The Iraqi foreign minister visits five
countries to forestall their helping the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DOHA, Qatar</DL>
<LD>As President Bush tried to rally the American people Monday behind
his tough stand toward Saddam Hussein, the foreign minister of Iraq
arrived here on a mission to convince Persian Gulf nations not to
cooperate with a U.S. strike against his country.</LD>
<LD>   Qatar is the final stop by Foreign Minister Naji Sabri on a trip
to Iran, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. His message has
been constant throughout the trip: The U.S. and Israel are the true
"axis of evil," and any U.S.-led strike against Iraq should be
regarded as an attack on all Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   But if Hussein and Sabri had hoped for active opposition by
Persian Gulf nations to the idea of a strike by the United States to
force a regime change in Baghdad, the trip has fallen far short.</LD>
<TE>   The ruler of Bahrain, Sheik Hamed ibn Isa Khalifa, told Sabri that
Hussein's government must comply with United Nations resolutions
adopted after the 1991 war over Kuwait and "spare the area from all
risks and tensions."</TE>
<TE>   Much the same message was expected to be delivered by Qatar's
emir, Sheik Hamad ibn Khalifa al Thani, and his ministers.</TE>
<TE>   American military personnel, planes and other weaponry stationed
at several locations in the Persian Gulf would be integral to any
U.S. attack on Iraq aimed at ousting Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar's Hamad has approved the expansion of an air base to
accommodate U.S. warplanes and possibly a command-and-control center.
Bahrain is the home of the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, and an air base
under construction in Oman could accommodate U.S. bombers and
refueling planes.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Bee, senior analyst at the UC San Diego-based Institute on
Global Conflict and Cooperation, said he was not surprised that Sabri
was getting a cold shoulder from Persian Gulf nations.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a growing world opinion that is skeptical about Iraq and
11 years of Iraq ignoring U.N. resolutions," Bee said. "Why should
they believe anything from an Iraqi diplomat? Lip service is about
the best they can expect."</TE>
<TE>   In Iran, Sabri gave President Mohammad Khatami a letter from
Hussein "concerning the improvement of our bilateral relations."</TE>
<TE>   But Iranian media said Khatami lectured Sabri about Iranian
prisoners who still have not been repatriated from the Iraq-Iran war
of the 1980s. Sabri arrived in Tehran just as Iran completed its
annual commemoration of the start of the war. An Iranian newspaper
that often reflects the government's views said that "the only thing
Naji Sabri's visit would accomplish for us is to associate Iran with
a regime that is in its dying days."</TE>
<TE>   As U.S. and Iraqi public relations heated up, Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tarik Aziz said last week in Turkey that Iraq would not
attack any Muslim country.</TE>
<TE>   The comment was thought to be aimed at lessening tension with
Kuwait, where many believe that Iraq will attack again if the U.S.
launches a strike. The U.S. maintains an air base in Kuwait where
some of the U.S. warplanes that enforce one of the two "no-fly" zones
over Iraq are based.</TE>
<TE>   No U.S. officials are scheduled to visit the region, but British
Foreign Secretary Jack Straw will visit Iran, Jordan, Kuwait and
Egypt with the message that Hussein is a danger to their governments.</TE>

<DL>YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>Heavy explosions and the crackle of machine guns terrified residents
of Ivory Coast's second-largest city Monday as government forces
smashed through rebel lines in a long-promised offensive against the
insurgents, who have seized half the country.</LD>
<LD>   Encouraged by government advances on the eastern side of Bouake,
young people with sticks and stones chased heavily armed rebel
fighters through the streets and set fire to the bodies of four
rebels, a witness said.</LD>
<LD>   The government said it hoped to liberate Bouake, a rebel-held city
of 500,000, within 24 hours. As night fell, government officials
claimed to have recaptured Bouake--even as heavy firing continued.
French military officials said rebels still controlled the north of
the city. The rebels, who seized Bouake in a failed coup attempt
Sept. 19, said they were holding their ground.</LD>
<TE>   The government had been promising an all-out offensive for more
than a week. It began Sunday--even as West African mediators
struggled to save a proposed cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels include a core group of 750 to 800 former soldiers,
many dismissed from the army for suspected disloyalty. Their demands
vary from reinstatement to the establishment of a new government.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels have held Bouake and Korhogo, in the far north, since
the start of the uprising, gathering support from northerners who say
the government treats them as second-class citizens. The occupation
has stirred anger in the government's southern strongholds.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on Monday, rebel forces advanced to the town of Vavoua,
within 40 miles of the world's biggest cocoa producer. Ivory Coast's
crisis has pushed cocoa prices above 16-year highs.</TE>
<TE>   The insurrection has heightened ethnic tension in the polarized
country of 16 million.</TE>
<TE>   The army holds the mainly Christian south, where people are
opposed to any deal with the rebels who hold the Muslim north.</TE>
<TE>   France has given what it describes as logistic support to the army
and has more than 1,000 troops in its former colony to protect
foreigners.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Counting money is not just business here. It is like a sport, a
source of pride, close to an art form.</LD>
<LD>   Witnessing an Afghan count money is as breathtaking as watching
someone play a musical instrument well. One hand holds a fat block of
bills while the opposing thumb bends the notes and a forefinger leaps
through the stack at warp speed.</LD>
<LD>   Without money-counting machines and with the highest-denomination
note--10,000 afghanis--worth only 20 cents, workers at Kabul's
currency exchange spend up to nine hours a day just counting money.</LD>
<TE>   A block of 10 million afghanis, worth $200, is made up of 1,000
bills. The fastest counters can rip through it in five minutes,
checking the serial numbers and discarding bad notes without losing
count. They can recognize rival Afghan currencies merely by the
texture of the paper.</TE>
<TE>   Money counters race one another, betting on who can win. Among the
fastest are Jawid and Zahir, who are paid $2 a day as counters. Both
go by one name.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's anyone faster than Jawid. No one tries to
race him," said money counter Izmarai Nangialai, from Haji Shir
Qandahari's money exchange at the central Shahzada money market.</TE>
<TE>   "But we others are racing each other every day," he said as he sat
on two large sacks of money at the Central Bank.</TE>
<TE>   But the art form might be short-lived--along with the jobs of many
money counters. On Monday, the government introduced new currency to
make commerce more convenient and give the Central Bank control over
the money supply for the first time. The new bills, printed in
Europe, are noticeably smaller than the older official currency.</TE>
<TE>   Three zeros have been lopped off, so the 10,000 afghani note
becomes 10. Higher-denomination notes -- up to 1,000 afghanis, worth
about $20 -- will go into circulation.</TE>
<TE>   The change means Afghans will no longer have to carry large
bundles of money for small transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Nangialai was waiting at the Central Bank to exchange his old
bills for new. Each of his two sacks contained 1 billion afghanis
($20,000), weighed more than 200 pounds and had to be hauled to the
bank by porters.</TE>
<TE>   "I will miss this money counting," Nangialai said. "This is
something Afghan money dealers are proud of. In the money market,
some people change 1 million Pakistan rupees for afghanis, and the
owner of the shop can feel proud to give the customer all his money
in 20 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   A team of people has to count out 82,000 notes of 10,000 afghanis
to make 1 million Pakistan rupees, worth about $17,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of problems carrying money about," said Qandahari,
40, who is one of the market's big dealers. The largest amount he
ever had to transport, in a deal for a load of flour, was 10 billion
afghanis, about $200,000 at today's exchange rate. He transported the
money from Kabul, the capital, to the southern city of Kandahar
during the reign of the Taliban, when security on the roads was good.
But he still needed four cars and eight men to do the job.</TE>
<TE>   The governor of Afghanistan's Central Bank, Anwar-ul-Haq Ahady,
said in an interview that 10% of Afghan bank notes circulating were
not authorized by the Central Bank, making the money supply
impossible to control.</TE>
<TE>   Various people, including former President Burhanuddin Rabbani and
Abdul Rashid Dostum, a warlord who is now deputy defense minister,
issued bank notes in past years.</TE>
<TE>   "Money was issued by so many different people, it was difficult
for us to engage in meaningful monetary policy," Ahady said.</TE>
<TE>   The value of the afghani has fluctuated between 30,000 and 75,000
to the dollar since the fall of the Taliban late last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It created such a degree of economic uncertainty that it was
difficult for investors to make rational investment decisions based
on the value of the afghani," Ahady said. "So they used Pakistani
rupees or dollars instead.</TE>
<TE>   "If we did not introduce a new currency, what would happen is that
foreign money would completely replace the afghani, and I don't think
that is in the interests of the country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Afghans have until Dec. 4 to exchange their old money for new
notes.</TE>
<TE>   Haji Amin Jan Khosti, head of the Kabul money market, arrived at
the market at 12:15 p.m. Monday waving bundles of the new money,
inciting a wild crush and excited cheers from dealers. By 3 p.m., the
front gates of the market had to be locked to prevent more people
from crowding into the yard to get new money.</TE>
<TE>   The first to get their hands on the notes spilled into the bazaar
outside and were besieged by people willing to pay five times the
face value of the bills just to have a piece of new money.</TE>
<TE>   Qandahari, the money dealer, was sure the value of the new
afghanis would hold steady or rise.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone thinks the value will go up," he said. "The U.S. wants
to help Afghanistan. They're with us now, so the value of the afghani
will go up."</TE>

<HD>Stalin's Bash Doesn't Hold a Candle</HD>
<DH>Russia: For President Putin's 50th birthday, the nation
piles up the gifts and the accolades.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>President Vladimir V. Putin's 50th birthday Monday gave Russians from
all walks of life a chance to bow and scrape before this nation's
unchallenged leader, with several TV specials, a crystal crocodile
("the only animal that never backs down") and a $50,000
jewel-encrusted crown fit for a medieval czar.</LD>
<LD>   Putin's jubilee dominated news columns and prime-time TV, as
commentators tripped over one another to recount the steely
determination with which he has tackled the country's disorder and
brought about a prouder, more disciplined and more respected state
during his two years and nine months as president.</LD>
<LD>   Any shortcomings of his term, such as the quagmire of the war in
the republic of Chechnya, predictably received scant attention.</LD>
<TE>   "What is happening around Putin dwarfs even the celebrations of
Josef Stalin's 70th birthday back in 1949," said Andrei A.
Piontkovsky, director of the Independent Institute for Strategic
Studies here. "The scale of those festivities was much more modest."</TE>
<TE>   But it would be wrong to accuse Putin and his functionaries of
orchestrating a cult of personality, said Moscow State University
political scientist Yelena Shestopal. The truth is that hero-hungry
Russians have been willing to do it on their own, she said.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, a bookstore on Moscow's tony Tverskaya Street
reports that its "Presidential Section"--devoted exclusively to Putin
books, portraits and calendars--outsells everything in the shop but
Harry Potter items. And one ordinary Russian family has been coaching
its dog to bark Putin's nickname, "Vova."</TE>
<TE>   "Putin's unprecedented popularity stems not so much from the
personality of the president himself but from the need and desire of
the society to be ruled by a person worthy of all the people's love
and adoration," said Shestopal, head of her university's political
psychology department. "People needed someone onto whom they could
pour their feelings, and Putin was a perfect choice."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a hodgepodge of imaginative presents, from the very
weird to the very wonderful, Putin has received priceless publicity
that seems quite likely to be used to launch a campaign to reelect
him in two years.</TE>
<TE>   A one-hour special on state-owned RTR television featured a
kitchen-table chat with Putin in which the president, dressed in an
open-necked shirt, spelled out his goals and methods. The
prerequisite for any state official is love, he said, love of the
country and its citizens. State-controlled TV 1 aired a similar
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on RTR of his reform program, which has included
implementing a flat 13% income tax and allowing private land
ownership for the first time since 1917, Putin said he never forgets
about the least privileged.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clearly necessary to advance, but in fact we should not
forget about the rear," he said. "We should not forget that all these
reforms are carried out not for the benefit of some extraterrestrials
but for our citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Putin also said he is worried that Russia has yet to develop a
strong middle class.</TE>
<TE>   "Resources are concentrated in the hands of a limited number of
people. And this gap between the poor and those who can boast of
having accumulated millions and billions is unacceptably wide," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by TV 1 what he had given up by becoming president, Putin
said, "My freedom." And the last time he had been able to sit in a
cafe with his wife? queried the interviewer on RTR. "Don't remember,"
the president replied.</TE>
<TE>   Piontkovsky said the broadcasts on the government-controlled
networks meant that Putin's reelection bid had begun.</TE>
<TE>   "This should leave every Russian still capable of independent
cerebral effort dejected," he said. It "means that those who brought
him to power two years ago do not know how to do anything but
organize and run campaigns."</TE>
<TE>   Among the gifts offered Putin for his birthday was a replica of
the Crown of Monomakh, traditionally used in the coronation of the
czars centuries ago at the Kremlin's Cathedral of the Assumption.</TE>
<TE>   An original present was created by Gabit Sabitov, the former
deputy prime minister of the Russian republic of Bashkortostan: three
pages of text addressed to Putin made up only of words beginning with
the letter P. It finishes with the sentence: "Po Planete postavyat
pamyatniki Pervomy Prezidentu Planety Putinu," or "All around the
planet they will put up monuments to the first president of the
planet, Putin."</TE>
<TE>   But if Russians really want to make Putin happy, they should put
their noses to the grindstone and work hard, said Sergei Mironov,
chairman of the Federation Council, the upper chamber of parliament.
"The less fuss about his jubilee, the better he will feel."</TE>
<TE>   The object of the wishes himself seemed to take the same advice.
Putin spent most of Monday in Moldova at a summit of the Commonwealth
of Independent States, a grouping of former Soviet republics, though
he did throw himself a birthday dinner with high-ranking government
and military officials when he returned to Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   And lest there be any taint of personal profit from the
celebration, the Kremlin issued a statement saying all the gifts
would become state property--presumably including the crystal
crocodile, a gift from the Moldovan president.</TE>

<HD>French Open Probe Into Tanker Blast</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Yemeni officials continue to reject theory that
the explosion was deliberate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>French counter-terrorism prosecutors opened a preliminary
investigation Monday into the explosion on a French oil tanker off
the coast of Yemen, but other officials said the blast was an
accident.</LD>
<LD>   The explosion Sunday morning near the port of Mina Dabah caused a
massive fire in the tanker Limburg and left a crewman missing.</LD>
<LD>   French diplomats in Yemen initially said they suspected a
deliberate act. The tanker's captain said in media accounts that he
saw a small boat approaching just before the explosion. And the
owners of the ship, a Belgian company, said the damage was at the
water line, suggesting a blast caused by an external source such as a
boat carrying explosives.</LD>
<TE>   The counter-terrorism section of the Paris public prosecutor's
office opened its inquiry Monday as investigators from the DST
counter-terrorism agency, the navy, the Transport Ministry and other
agencies hurried to Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   "It resembles an attack," said a judicial official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. "It appears that the report of a small boat
in the vicinity of the tanker has been confirmed. The captain said he
saw the boat disappear in the explosion. But it is still impossible
to confirm whether it was an accident or intentional."</TE>
<TE>   Yemeni officials discounted terrorism from the start. Yemen's
minister of transport and marine affairs, Capt. Said Yafai,
reiterated the denials Monday. He said the initial probe indicated
that the explosion had come from within the tanker, which carried
about 400,000 barrels of Saudi crude oil.</TE>
<TE>   French diplomats were cautious regarding the cause of the blast.</TE>
<TE>   "No possibility is being excluded," Foreign Minister Dominique de
Villepin said in a radio interview. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said
a vice consul in Yemen who had spoken of an apparent attack was
expressing an opinion, not the official position.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement experts have warned for months about the
possibility of a terrorist strike intended to disrupt oil shipments
in the Middle East, a region racked by the aftermath of the Sept. 11
attacks and tension over the U.S. confrontation with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The context of the tanker explosion contributed to suspicions: It
occurred six days before the second anniversary of the bombing of the
U.S. Navy destroyer Cole in Yemen. Seventeen U.S. sailors died in the
attack, which was blamed on Al Qaeda terrorists using a small boat
packed with explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorists from Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network often
choreograph the timing, place and method of attacks to send symbolic
messages, a senior French law enforcement official said Monday. But
he cautioned that it was too early to draw conclusions about the
tanker explosion.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-led hunt for Al Qaeda suspects has focused recently on
Yemen, the ancestral homeland of Bin Laden. U.S. authorities in Yemen
were following the tanker case closely.</TE>
<TE>   John Balian, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Sana, the Yemeni
capital, said there were indications that an electrical malfunction
aboard the ship could have been the cause. "It's all speculation at
this point," he added.</TE>
<TE>   A French military task force was reported to have boarded and
secured the ship and towed it farther out to sea to keep any further
spillage as far from the coast as possible. Most of the ship's oil is
still inside intact containers.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-four members of the 25-man crew--a mix of French and
Bulgarian sailors--were rescued Sunday, but one Bulgarian was still
reported missing late Monday.</TE>

to let their daughters attend a new girls school, people in this
desert outpost branded them heretics.</LD>
<LD>   The town's elders, many of them illiterate, declared that the
Jalals were "opening the gates of hell." Once girls started getting
educated, one man charged, they'd be able to write letters to their
boyfriends.</LD>
<LD>   But a few dozen brave parents, particularly those working as
servants, enrolled their girls anyway. And that has made all the
difference in their lives.</LD>
<TE>   A decade after the first class graduated, this isolated desert
region near the Iranian border has been affected in ways both simple
and profound.</TE>
<TE>   The school, which now hums with the voices of nearly 1,000 girls,
has brought jobs here. It has tilted the economic balance in favor of
the graduates, who have emerged as their families' breadwinners and
hold the best-paying jobs in town.</TE>
<TE>   The school also has brought colorful clothing, confidence and even
condoms here. Girls as young as 10 have learned to just say "no" if
they don't like the men their parents have picked out for them to
marry. Several have gone on to college, living in hostels a
three-hour drive from home--independence inconceivable just a few
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The classism and racism that still are powerful forces here are
also beginning to erode. Darker-skinned servants' daughters--the
descendants of African slaves--who never would have been chosen as
brides by the town's landowners now dream of becoming doctors. One
black student became a teacher and has built her family a house that
sports a big new satellite dish.</TE>
<TE>   These changes are no small feat in Pakistan, an impoverished,
largely rural nation whose problems are compounded by the vast
illiteracy that contributes to festering Islamic extremism. Two out
of three girls nationwide still get no education at all. (One in
three boys is uneducated.)</TE>
<TE>   Tribal leaders still wield great clout, and family and clan
continue to be the dominant influences. In this patriarchal society,
young women typically are expected to tend house and raise hordes of
children, sometimes living in compounds they share with their
husbands' other wives.</TE>
<TE>   Named after its founder, the Zobaida Jalal School is testament to
the difference one woman with an education and a dream can make. And
it illustrates the hurdles that still must be overcome so that
everyone in this nation can learn to read.</TE>
<TE>   The school's success prompted President Pervez Musharraf to name
Jalal his education minister last year and has led Jalal to implement
similar initiatives nationwide; President Bush cited the efforts of
the "very brilliant" education minister and pledged hundreds of
millions of dollars to Pakistan's education efforts in a meeting with
Musharraf in Washington last year. Jalal served until recently, when
she resigned to run for a National Assembly seat against several men
in Thursday's parliamentary elections.</TE>
<TE>   Jalal herself is as unusual as her school's success: She didn't
marry until last year, at 42, an age when most Pakistani women have
grandchildren, some even great-grandchildren. She seems like a
modern-day Western career woman and until recently commuted by plane
from the capital, Islamabad, on weekends to see her husband in
Quetta. Except that her husband also has another wife.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a headscarf, like most women in Pakistan, Jalal is
confident and poised and speaks fluent English.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to bring change gradually, to make people themselves
accept it, not push it on them," she says. "Being economically
independent has created much more respect for women. They now have
power to make decisions--the power to make their own decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Although revolutionary, the school hasn't been able to cure all
her hometown's woes. Mand, a sleepy place that appears to have a few
thousand people but actually is home to 35,000, still seems stuck in
another century. Phones and computers are scarce. Much of the
electricity comes from portable generators. Jobs are few. And girls
still get married at what most people in the West would consider
frighteningly young ages and have babies soon thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the school is as much of an oasis here as the underground
karez system that brings water from the mountains, allowing the trees
to grow lush amid the desert and bear the world's largest crop of
dates. Although she was the force behind the school, Jalal couldn't
visit prospective students' families because of the purdah tradition,
which prohibits contact between unmarried women and men outside their
families.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike her sisters, who married in their teens, Jalal turned down
suitor after suitor picked by her father, demanding that any husband
be sufficiently educated.</TE>
<TE>   Jalal and her nine siblings were lucky. Their father, Haji Jalal
Khan, had moved the family in 1948 from Mand to Kuwait, where he
worked as a police interpreter. Oil-rich Kuwait provided quality
education for all there, including the many migrant workers from
poorer nations.</TE>
<TE>   When the family returned to Mand in 1978, Khan found that the town
had regressed, becoming even more remote from the rest of the world.
He believed the family had a duty to spread the education they had
received in Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   "No one will come from outside to educate these people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He had bought land in Mand a decade before his return, and the
family moved into the sprawling compound where many of its members
still live. Zobaida had finished eighth grade, but because there was
no girls school in Mand, her father demanded that she be allowed to
study at the boys school. The compromise: A teacher came to her
house. She finished her education at a university in Quetta, the
provincial capital, several hundred miles to the northeast, earning a
master's degree before returning home to Mand and opening the school.</TE>
<TE>   To recruit students, Jalal's mother and sisters marshaled the most
convincing argument they could think of: The girls would learn to
read the Koran and be good Muslims. The Koran is written in Arabic,
and most of the people in this corner of Baluchistan province speak
only their tribal tongues, not even the national Urdu language.</TE>
<TE>   When school started in a sitting room in the Jalals' guest house
in 1982, girls as old as 12 came for the first grade. Doubtful
mothers and grandmothers, clad in dark attire, came along to
supervise, some doing the lessons as well.</TE>
<TE>   Jalal's father donated land for the school and provided water from
his underground karez channels. Jalal taught. And did almost
everything else, including planning for expansion and, later,
fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   After a few years, the highest class of people in Mand, members of
the Jalals' Rind tribe, finally started sending their daughters too.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the students, clad in blue-and-white uniforms of tunics and
pants, sing out when Jalal's sister Rahima, now the principal, visits
the 30 neat classrooms in a building near the Jalal family compound.
Ten 10th-grade classes, the highest level, have graduated, about 140
young women in all.</TE>
<TE>   "Good morning, Madam," the girls say in English. "Thank you,
Madam." Retention rates are improving. In the first class, 70
students started, but just nine were left by graduation. Although
many still drop out in the first few grades, many others forge
friendships and want to remain.</TE>
<TE>   These days, many continue classes even after they marry. And while
pregnant. In fourth grade, 12-year-old Rukislania married six months
ago. In an eighth-grade social studies class, five of 30 students
raise their hands when asked if they are married. In a 10th-grade
algebra class, five of 30 girls learning how to factor equations have
husbands, and a 16-year-old's protruding belly shows she is eight
months pregnant. One has a child in the first grade--they come to
school together.</TE>
<TE>   Marriage is undoubtedly still a priority here. "Are you married?"
was often the first question posed to a visiting American woman. But
a number of the girls in these classes say they intend to remain
single.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what they want to do when they grow up, the girls toss out
occupations such as teacher, engineer and technician.</TE>
<TE>   A ceremony held late one evening at one family's home, however,
reminds one of other choices. Two cousins, one 11 and one 12, who had
no schooling, were to marry two brothers the next day. As women
danced and stuck 10- rupee notes on top of the brides' heads, others
painted their hands with henna in elaborate designs, a traditional
practice.</TE>
<TE>   Such scenes, however, are not quite as common as they once were,
thanks in part to Jalal's school. But as successful as it has been,
the school struggles to meet its payroll, sometimes borrowing money
to pay the teachers' salaries of about $100 a month.</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of the students can't afford the $1 to $3 monthly
tuition. They are orphans or children of drug addicts who partake of
the opium that comes through here on camels and trucks en route to
Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the budget squeeze, the simple classrooms are immaculate
and the school is well organized.</TE>
<TE>   The girls learn English, Urdu, Arabic, science and social
sciences. They learn about Islam and their rights as women under the
Koran. They keep current-events journals chronicling happenings such
as the attack on the World Trade Center and the role of Osama bin
Laden. They learn that if their fathers propose that they marry
someone unpalatable, they can refuse. Many have, and their fathers
have backed down. (If the fathers insist, however, the girls probably
have no choice.) The married girls interviewed at the school say they
wanted to marry their partners.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by their teachers, they also learn that it's all right to
wear brightly colored clothing, in contrast to the dark attire their
mothers still wear.</TE>
<TE>   Several graduates who went on to college have obtained respected
positions as "lady health workers," traveling to outlying villages to
teach health, hygiene and family planning techniques. They report to
the husband-wife team of doctors that runs a maternity hospital here
funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   One in 10 women nationwide dies in childbirth, and one in five
children dies before reaching age 5. The new clinic provides birth
control, delivers babies and tries to reduce pregnancy risks and
malnutrition through prenatal counseling. It also gives sterilization
kits to the untrained traditional midwives who have been helping with
births for decades.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Educated Girls a Boon</TE>
<TE>   Without the school, it would have been hard to find staff to help
treat the 300 women seen each month and win their trust.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a blessing, because we couldn't do the job if the workers
weren't from Mand," says Dr. Tarique Zaheer Arain, who manages the
clinic and comes from the port city of Karachi. "The women trust them
because they're from the community."</TE>
<TE>   The health workers tell the women of the merits of birth control
and smaller families, about vaccinations and the advantages of
breast-feeding.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people listen to us, some don't," says Tahira Khudabakash,
20. As the first in her family to go to school--her father was a taxi
driver--she dreams of furthering her education in Karachi, hoping to
study computers.</TE>
<TE>   "There's everything available there," she says longingly. Her
well-paying job has encouraged many other families to offer her their
sons' hands in marriage, but she has refused. "I want to be
something," she says. "I want to study. To progress."</TE>
<TE>   Of the 4,500 rupees, or $75, she gets each month from the Gates
foundation, she keeps almost half for herself.</TE>
<TE>   It is stories like Khudabakash's that have made believers out of
most of those who first doubted the school, including the men who
fought it.</TE>
<TE>   The students' knowledge has benefited all: They can interpret
television programs in Urdu for their Baluchi-speaking families. They
accompany them on doctor visits to the big cities, where their
families otherwise would be unable to communicate. They do their
families' writing.</TE>
<TE>   And what has happened here is being replicated in surrounding
villages, where a dozen new schools have opened, because of graduates
who now are available to teach.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the gated walls of one family's farmhouse, goats with ears
that droop to their thighs lazily roam near groves of lush date,
lemon and mango trees. Two wives of one man--who live in different
parts of the compound but appear to get along well--discuss the
school's impact on their lives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regret for a Lost Chance</TE>
<TE>   When the school first opened, the Ali family allowed their second
daughter, then 8, to attend but kept the elder daughter, then 9, at
home.</TE>
<TE>   The younger girl, Nejah Mohammed Ali, became a teacher and is now
the family's breadwinner. Says their father, Mohammed Ali, "She's the
only one working in the household."</TE>
<TE>   "Our fathers were uneducated, illiterate," says Ali's wife,
Nuoribibi, who doesn't know her exact age but guesses about 50 or 55.
"So we didn't know what would happen, what she would learn. We
thought education wouldn't be useful for us. Our daughters were 8 and
9, and we thought it wasn't unreasonable to keep one home because
they'd be married soon anyway."</TE>
<TE>   She glances at her illiterate daughter, and says, "There is a big
difference between being educated and uneducated, in terms of
manners, politeness, way of sitting and eating."</TE>
<TE>   The other wife, Pari Khatoon, 60, laments not sending her
children.</TE>
<TE>   "They could have learned a different language. They cannot write
to anyone. They could have a job, have an income. The burden would be
so much less."</TE>
<TE>   But then Khatoon looks at her 1-year-old granddaughter and hugs
her.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't send her mother to school, but we will send her."</TE>

<HD>President Moves Toward Forcing the Reopening of West Coast
Ports</HD>
<DH>Labor: A court order could come as early as today after
Bush hears from a board of inquiry. But the union threatens to
attempt a 'slow-up.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN, NANCY CLEELAND and JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush set the stage Monday to force the rapid reopening of
West Coast ports after federally mediated contract talks between
shipping lines and locked-out dockworkers broke off.</LD>
<LD>   The president created a three-member board of inquiry that will
report to him today on whether there are grounds to seek a court
order to reopen the ports under the rarely used Taft-Hartley Act.</LD>
<LD>   The order--and the resumption of shipping through the ports--could
come within hours of the panel delivering its findings.</LD>
<TE>   Bush acted amid escalating pressure from retailers, manufacturers
and other business groups dependent on Pacific Rim trade. Losses to
the national economy have been estimated at $1 billion to $2 billion
a day, and more than 200 cargo ships are stranded at the West Coast's
29 ports.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, Bush's action would force the Pacific Maritime Assn.
to end its shutdown of the ports for an 80-day cooling-off period.
But the expected move was being viewed Monday as a blow against the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which represents the
10,500 workers at the center of the bitter labor battle.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials and Washington labor leaders charged that Bush
undermined any chance of a settlement over the weekend by ordering
the board of inquiry's chairman, former Republican U.S. Sen. Bill
Brock of Tennessee, and his colleagues to San Francisco on Sunday.
That was more than 24 hours before Bush signed the executive order
establishing the panel.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the wrong decision," said AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer
Richard Trumka. "The federal government has tipped the balance of
power heavily in the employer's favor."</TE>
<TE>   Labor criticism aside, the president's move to force the ports'
reopening played to bipartisan praise.</TE>
<TE>   "In view of the enormity of the economic problems resulting from
the lockout, I do not believe that the president had any other
choice," said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who surprised union
supporters last week by reversing position and demanding that Bush
put a stop to the shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   "This economic homicide cannot be allowed to continue," said Sen.
Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.), who said his farm state constituents are
suffering because of a falloff in agricultural shipments.</TE>
<TE>   Brock and fellow panel members Patrick Hardin, a University of
Tennessee law professor, and Dennis Nolan, a University of South
Carolina law professor, set up shop in the General Services
Administration building in San Francisco and were taking testimony
from the two sides late Monday. The panel is expected to report to
Bush by early today.</TE>
<TE>   James Spinosa, president of the International Longshore and
Warehouse Union, and other union officials said they would resist any
order to resume work at full speed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to continue to 'work safe,' " Spinosa said, using a
phrase associated with work slowdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I guess it is a slow-up," Spinosa said. "That's the way
we're going to work."</TE>
<TE>   But if a court injunction is granted, a federal judge would not
tolerate such slowdowns, said Joseph Miniace, president of the
Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and terminal
operators.</TE>
<TE>   Miniace said port operators had detailed productivity records that
they could show to a judge if work pace falls off. "We have them by
ship and by crane," he said. "Federal judges are pretty powerful
people."</TE>
<TE>   Spinosa claimed that the management group had planned on creating
a crisis that would justify federal intervention. He said union
officials were still evaluating a management proposal from Sunday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not an impasse," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Miniace said the offer made to union negotiators Sunday night
"would have made them the envy of every blue-collar worker in
America." The proposal included wages topping $100,000 a year in all
categories, full health-care coverage and a pension averaging $50,000
per year.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for the introduction of new technology, the shipping
association also guaranteed full employment for life to all current
union members and said any new clerk jobs created by the technology
would be part of the union's jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave the union the opportunity to get the ports up and running
last night without government intervention," Miniace said. "We made
it clear we would be willing to make some changes. We would have the
federal mediator to help us. But they rejected that offer."</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn. locked out the union Sept. 29 after a
series of alleged work slowdowns, saying it was more cost-effective
to close the ports than to operate them with disruptions. Federal
mediation efforts began last week but collapsed late Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the ports reopen today, shipping industry officials said
it would take four to six weeks to eliminate the cargo backlog.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration called business executives to a 9 a.m.
meeting at the White House today to hear about plans for ending the
shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear whether Bush would have the Brock
panel's findings in hand by the time of the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of executives were expected to attend the session, said
Robin Lanier, executive director of the West Coast Waterfront
Coalition, which represents firms such as Wal-Mart and Target that
depend heavily on the ports.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials and industry groups worked hard Monday to
detail the shutdown's damaging effect on the economy. Labor Secretary
Elaine Chao told reporters, "Factory workers are being laid off
because they can't get vital parts delivered.... Family farmers and
ranchers are being devastated by the shutdown."</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Manufacturers released a survey suggesting
that the effects of the shutdown are substantially greater than the
often-cited figure of $1 billion a day. "Five percent of our members
say they have already cut back or closed facilities," said Frank
Vargo, a vice president of the trade group. "By early next week, it
will be 25%."</TE>
<TE>   Chao raised the specter of the shutdown damaging U.S. military
readiness in case of war with Iraq. Union officials quickly responded
that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the
10-day shutdown, but an administration official, who asked not to be
identified, said that only a portion of what the Defense Department
needs has made it ashore.</TE>
<TE>   "America's military relies on commercial ships, docking at West
Coast ports, to supply our armed forces," the Labor secretary said.
"Any disruption in the flow of these military shipments could
significantly impact the Defense Department's ability to support our
men and women in harm's way."</TE>
<TE>   If Bush invokes the Taft-Hartley Act to end the shutdown, it will
be the first use of the once-crucial labor law in almost a quarter of
a century. President Carter sought--unsuccessfully--to employ the act
to end a major coal strike in the midst of the energy crisis in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   The law was last used successfully in the West Coast dock strike
of 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Under provisions of the law, the president can establish a panel
of inquiry to look into a labor dispute and tell him whether it will
"imperil the national safety and health." Although the law sets no
timetables, panels in the past have acted quickly; in 1966, President
Johnson received a panel's report on the same day he appointed it.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush decides to act, he will order Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft to
federal district court to seek a temporary restraining order.
Administration officials, speaking to reporters on background, said
Ashcroft could act, and a court rule, as early as this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Under Taft-Hartley, the judge who issues an injunction sets the
schedule for compliance based on the urgency and complexity of the
situation.</TE>
<TE>   The judge could order an immediate return to work or could give
the parties a day to comply, said Jason Greenwald, a spokesman for
the maritime group.</TE>
<TE>   Labor Department officials said that once the shutdown has ended,
they expect the two sides to return to the bargaining table with
federal mediator Peter J. Hurtgen. If no agreement results, the Brock
panel would step in after 60 days and issue a report laying out where
the two sides stand. After the report, union members would be
required to vote on management's latest contract offer.</TE>
<TE>   If the offer were defeated and the 80-day cooling-off period
expired, the two sides could renew their conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 35 times the Taft-Hartley provision has been used, the
cooling-off period failed to produce labor peace in 10 instances.
Both administration officials and industry leaders appeared to
understand Monday that a court order reopening the ports, if it
comes, may offer only temporary respite.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials issued carefully worded statements
justifying the president's action but avoided any claim of damage to
military readiness.</TE>

<HD>Reaching Ports Deal Made More Difficult by History, Emotion</HD>
<DH>Negotiations: Not even intervention can heal the union and
shipping lines' mutual distrust.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the national economy holding its breath and a federal mediator
working through the weekend, why couldn't the shipping lines and
longshore union make a deal?</LD>
<LD>   There are dozens of small reasons, from the union's insistence on
controlling all technology- related jobs to the employers' adamant
refusal to set minimum staffing levels on terminal yards.</LD>
<LD>   But the ones that matter most are broad and deep and seemingly
intractable, weighed down by history and emotion. And that is
something federal intervention will be hard pressed to resolve.</LD>
<TE>   The union claims that employers want to outsource their jobs and
dilute its power. Employers claim that the union is blocking basic
technology needed to bring the West Coast ports up to international
standards. Neither side takes the other at its word.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't trust them," said David Arian, a past president of the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union and a current member of
the negotiating committee, as he picked through the shipping lines'
latest proposal. "There's a new faction in there trying to break this
union. That's what this is all about."</TE>
<TE>   Among members of the Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents
shipping lines and terminal operators, the heat is equally intense.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been here 37 years and I've watched this union deteriorate,"
said one shipping company executive, explaining why he and others
decided to stand fast in these negotiations. "It's not what it was
years ago. When people come to work now, all they care about is when
they're going home and what kind of deal they make."</TE>
<TE>   Those emotions are surfacing at a time when new technologies in
ocean shipping are throwing the question of control up in the air.</TE>
<TE>   No longer must clerks note the movement of a container off a ship
and through the yard with pen and paper, or even a laptop computer.
That data now can be entered at the port of origin and transferred
electronically. A scanner then can note the number of the container
as it is unloaded. Each subsequent move can be tracked by sensors,
scanners and remote cameras, to the point the container leaves the
terminal.</TE>
<TE>   And there goes the power of marine clerks, a relatively small
group of longshore members who are among the highest paid in the
union.</TE>
<TE>   Clerks contend that as their power wanes, so does the union's
clout--and eventually its members' enviable pay and benefits.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, both sides made it clear that technology and
control, rather than wages and benefits, were at the forefront of
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Since talks opened in May, they have not been easy. Each side gave
wildly different interpretations to proposals that passed back and
forth, usually claiming it had given the other "exactly what they
wanted" or was getting a deceptive deal.</TE>
<TE>   Then came slowdowns by union workers that cut productivity on the
docks by half, followed by the lockout of a week ago. When a federal
mediator finally was able to bring both sides together at a San
Francisco hotel Thursday, bad blood already was running thick.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, the talks started on a promising note. But that
mood soon dissipated. Meanwhile, federal mediator Peter Hurtgen was
losing patience, and the threat of federal intervention became
increasingly real.</TE>
<TE>   "We were told when we started that we were on a very short leash,"
said Joseph Miniace, president of the shipping group. "Then we were
told that the leash got shorter. By the end, we were on a choke
collar."</TE>
<TE>   As economic and political pressure mounted, each side waited for
the other to give in. On Sunday, the union handed over a proposal
that the shipping group said contained old, unacceptable language
calling for minimum staffing levels.</TE>
<TE>   Then Sunday night, as Hurtgen threatened to leave, the shipping
group presented a final proposal that, on the surface, seemed to give
the union everything it wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Along with a healthy pension increase and substantial wage gains
for some skilled equipment operators, the proposal also would
guarantee full-time employment for life for all registered union
marine clerks.</TE>
<TE>   In what it described as a significant concession, the shipping
group granted the union jurisdiction over some planning jobs that
currently are nonunion. But the group did not turn over crucial
vessel-planning jobs, which the union had sought.</TE>
<TE>   One contentious section would change the arbitration process,
putting all disputes concerning technology before a coast-wide
arbitrator, who would be chosen by both sides from the National
Academy of Arbitrators. The union insists that someone from the
shipping industry be the coast-wide arbitrator, and it suggested a
former union president as a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Another key paragraph covers control of computer systems related
to terminal operations and says that any such data should be
administered by a union clerk. But a union spokesman said because
those job duties and functions are not clearly defined in the
language, they eventually could be lost to off-site nonunion
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "Behind all the smoke, the employers association continues to
outsource jobs," said James Spinosa, the union's president.</TE>
<TE>   As the union and shipping group staged rival news conferences, it
became clear there wasn't much about the weekend's negotiations they
could agree on. A case in point: whether or not the seven-day
contract extension offered by the union was unconditional, therefore
meeting the shipping group's demand for reopening the ports.</TE>
<TE>   Miniace and others in the room when Spinosa made the proposal
insist it was contingent on the shipping group dropping all hopes of
addressing technology in the next contract, which Miniace said was
unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "I was there," Miniace said. "I know what I heard."</TE>
<TE>   Union officials were equally adamant that no strings be attached
to the extension and cited the shipping group's refusal to accept it
as proof of its disingenuousness.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it may not look like it to someone from the outside,
because this guy Miniace is a master of deceit," said Arian, the
former union president. "Eventually that will be exposed. All the
disguises will be ripped off."</TE>

<HD>Avila Wins Hearing Delay</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutors say cat hair, a sneaker print and tire
tracks link the Lake Elsinore man to Samantha Runnion's murder.
Preliminary has been reset for Dec. 2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors told a judge Monday that cat hair, a sneaker print and
tire tracks link a Lake Elsinore man to the kidnapping and murder of
5-year-old Samantha Runnion.</LD>
<LD>   The revelations came as Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas
argued against further delays in the prosecution of Alejandro Avila,
even offering to proceed without introducing DNA evidence if that
would keep the proceedings on track.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to expedite this process and get it through the court as
fast as we can," Rackauckas said in what turned out to be a losing
effort.</LD>
<TE>   But Orange County Superior Court Judge Francisco P. Briseno
granted a defense request to delay the preliminary hearing for Avila,
agreeing that his attorneys needed more time to analyze the physical
and scientific evidence provided by prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   The proceeding was originally scheduled to begin Friday; Briseno
set a new date of Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Avila, 27, has pleaded innocent to kidnapping, sexually assaulting
and killing Runnion. He could face the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Until Monday, prosecutors had revealed little about the case they
are building against Avila. Search warrants supporting his arrest and
the search of his apartment and car remain sealed.</TE>
<TE>   In court in Santa Ana, Rackauckas said that hair strands from
Avila's cat were found in his car, and they were similar in color,
thickness, shape and pigmentation as hair found in Samantha's hair.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas also argued that a print from a sneaker found at the
scene would implicate Avila as well, citing a shoe box for the same
brand and style in his closet. And a tire track was similar in width
and pattern to those on his car.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Public Defender Denise Gragg said the science of cat
hair is "more esoteric" than human hair, and that she has no evidence
that Avila's shoe size matches that of the print.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha was abducted July 15 as she played with a friend near a
row of garages at her Stanton condominium complex. Her body was found
the next day along a mountain road between Orange County and Lake
Elsinore. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled.</TE>

<HD>Rampart Probe a Top Priority, Bratton Says</HD>
<DH>Police: Mayor's choice for new chief calls for review,
expresses wonder at lack of reforms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moving quickly to assert command, William J. Bratton called Monday
for a complete review of how well the Los Angeles Police Department
has investigated the Rampart corruption scandal.</LD>
<LD>   The LAPD's investigation was called into question by the
disclosure Monday that allegations of wrongdoing by disgraced former
Officer Rafael Perez had not been thoroughly investigated.</LD>
<LD>   During a walking tour of a San Pedro neighborhood with Mayor James
K. Hahn on Monday, Bratton acknowledged that the Rampart scandal
continues to damage the department's reputation. He drew parallels
with corruption scandals he faced in 1993 as the incoming New York
police commissioner.</LD>
<TE>   "The Rampart issue, both in what has happened in the past as well
as these lingering issues, is certainly going to be one of my first
priorities," said Bratton. He said he would develop his own opinion
about "what has been done, what needs to be done, and how fast can it
be done."</TE>
<TE>   Perez is a former anti-gang officer who was convicted of stealing
cocaine seized as evidence. Three years ago, in exchange for a
reduced sentence on the charges against him, he identified eight
allegedly improper shootings. He told authorities that he had direct
knowledge of some of the incidents, and had heard about others from
fellow officers.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to inquiries from The Times, the LAPD acknowledged that
it had not thoroughly investigated three shootings that Perez said
had been covered up.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Bratton wondered why the Rampart scandal hadn't
led to more sweeping changes. He said he had discussed the shootings
with acting Chief Martin Pomeroy during a breakfast meeting Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn pledged that corruption allegations would be fully
investigated. L.A. County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley praised Bratton's
decision to review Rampart.</TE>
<TE>   "We share Chief Bratton's concerns that LAPD's investigations of
various Rampart-related shootings have been less than thorough. We
welcome the new chief's review of this matter," Cooley said in a
prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   The department Monday seemed already to be taking steps to adjust
to the priorities of Bratton, whose appointment still must be
approved by the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Cmdr. Cayler "Lee" Carter of the Central Operations Bureau
announced that officers within the Newton, Hollenbeck, Rampart,
Northeast and Central divisions, along with a group of city agencies,
would aggressively fight crime and blight in targeted city
neighborhoods. Carter said the plans were in the works long before
the selection of Bratton, a longtime advocate of enforcing laws
against minor crimes, such as graffiti, as a strategy toward reducing
major crime.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative calls for a cooperative effort by city workers,
from building inspectors to librarians, to attack neighborhood
problems, according to Gary Harris, chief street use inspector.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to take back the city street by street," said LAPD
Capt. Doug Shur of the Rampart Division. A 12-block area in the
division encompassed by Santa Monica Boulevard, Madison Avenue, and
Hoover and Marathon streets is being targeted.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to improve the quality of life in this area by
cleaning up the graffiti, educating people to take care of their
properties and enforcing every law for trespassing and loitering. The
Police Department is only part of the solution. It's a partnership,"
Shur said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Hollenbeck Division, officers will target a Boyle Heights
neighborhood plagued with prostitution. In the Central Division,
unlicensed street vendors will be targeted.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton said he regretted the continuing problems resulting from
the Rampart corruption investigation. "I would have loved to come
through the door and have it all behind me," he said.</TE>

<HD>MWD Told Mojave Plan Is All Wet</HD>
<DH>Resources: Committee recommends killing the Cadiz storage
project for Colorado River water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a surprise development, a key committee of the Metropolitan Water
District board recommended Monday that the district kill the
controversial Cadiz water project, a $150-million plan to store
surplus Colorado River water under the Mojave Desert.</LD>
<LD>   The MWD's Water Planning, Quality and Resources Committee voted 6
to 3 to recommend that the district's full board "not proceed with
the project." The vote went further than a recommendation from the
MWD staff, which had only proposed that the district indefinitely
defer the project.</LD>
<LD>   The full board, made up of 37 members representing more than 26
local and regional water districts, will take up the question at its
regular monthly meeting today.</LD>
<TE>   Whether the board will follow the committee's recommendation is
unclear. The board is not obligated to accept the committee's
recommendation. Moreover, while each board member has a single vote
on the committee, their votes on the full board are weighted
according to their districts' original investment in the MWD
infrastructure. Two of the committee votes to kill the project,
however, came from representatives of Los Angeles County, which has
the largest weighted vote on the full board.</TE>
<TE>   A board rejection would deal a mortal blow to the project, which
has been under consideration for five years but has generated fierce
opposition on environmental and fiscal grounds.</TE>
<TE>   After the vote, Santa Monica-based Cadiz Inc. urged the board to
continue considering the project.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the need for reliable water supplies and given that the
program has received all federal approvals, we respectfully suggest
that the public interest is best served by an open, public review of
the environmental documentation prepared by MWD staff and
consultants," the company said in a prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   "A great deal of public and private resources have been expended.
To not complete the evaluation and review would not best serve the
public interest."</TE>
<TE>   Cancellation of the project would be a serious defeat for Cadiz's
chief executive, Keith Brackpool, a key financial supporter of Gov.
Gray Davis and an advisor to the governor on state water policy.
Brackpool conceived the water project and ushered it through five
years of state and federal environmental reviews.</TE>
<TE>   Under the project's original plans, Cadiz and the MWD would share
the cost of constructing a 35-mile pipeline to carry water between
the MWD's Colorado River Aqueduct and Cadiz's storage site in the
Mojave Desert north of Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Under the tentative partnership terms, the MWD was to deliver an
upfront payment of more than $54 million to Cadiz upon final approval
of the project.</TE>
<TE>   The plan called for the MWD to store as much as 1.5 million
acre-feet of surplus Colorado River water in an aquifer under the
site and would have given the district the right to buy from Cadiz
another 1.5 million acre-feet of naturally occurring groundwater from
the aquifer. Cadiz stood to earn $500 million to $1 billion from the
plan over 50 years. One acre-foot is roughly enough water to serve
two average households for a year.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 29, the Interior Department gave environmental approval
for the sale to the MWD of the 35-mile right of way needed to build
the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents have raised numerous questions about it. Water
district sources have said that cost estimates for the project have
risen, which would require further negotiations with the company.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental critics contend that extraction of groundwater on
the scale that Cadiz projects could subject the delicate Mojave
Desert ecosystem to irreversible damage. Among those who have called
on the MWD to cancel the program are U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) and Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), whose district includes
the site.</TE>
<TE>   The most potent argument against the project recently has been
that the continuing drought has rendered the availability of
sufficient surplus water to fill the storage site doubtful. That was
one of the main reasons that MWD Chief Executive Ronald R. Gastelum
cited last month when he recommended that the board indefinitely
defer the project.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the drought, MWD officials say their expectations of
available surplus over the next 15 years--even under average rainfall
conditions--have been cut to 4 million acre-feet from as much as 9
million. That's not enough to justify the construction of major
storage project, MWD officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Gastelum also said that Cadiz's uncertain financial condition
increased the financial risks that would be borne by the MWD.</TE>
<TE>   District officials have long been concerned that the funds that
MWD paid to Cadiz could be attached by the company's creditors,
leaving the company without the wherewithal to meet its partnership
obligations.</TE>
<TE>   When Gastelum recommended to the board that the project be
deferred, he said that one of the unresolved issues in the district's
negotiations with the company is "the difficulty of fully insulating
Metropolitan from a Cadiz default."</TE>

<HD>Fireworks Take Place, but Away From Debate Stage</HD>
<DH>Election: Protests grow rowdy outside as Green Party
candidate is turned away as a guest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Monday's gubernatorial debate may have been civil, but outside the
Los Angeles Times building more than 100 protesters participated in a
raucous contest of their own as Green Party candidate Peter Camejo
unsuccessfully tried to attend the event.</LD>
<LD>   Camejo, who was not invited to participate in the debate sponsored
by The Times, attempted to enter the downtown Los Angeles building as
a guest of GOP candidate Bill Simon Jr., only to be turned away.</LD>
<LD>   "It is bad enough that I'm excluded, but to say that I can't even
be present to listen to the debate is really wrong," Camejo said
before the debate, as demonstrators of various persuasions tried to
drown each other out with competing chants.</LD>
<TE>   A few dozen Green Party supporters, some carrying photos of Camejo
with black tape across his mouth, argued with a crowd of union
members, who waved Gov. Gray Davis signs and shouted, "Four more
years!" Advocates for the poor yelled, "What about the rest of us?"
Meanwhile, a cast of political characters paraded up and down 1st
Street: a Superman waving a Simon sign, a woman wearing a question
mark costume, a man in a Davis mask dressed as a prostitute and two
protesters in Simon masks and jail stripes.</TE>
<TE>   The chaotic scene did not distract Camejo from his goal. About 45
minutes before the debate, he made his way to the door of The Times
building, surrounded by a crush of television cameras and reporters.</TE>
<TE>   After holding up his invitation from the Simon campaign, Camejo
was allowed inside by a security guard. At the check-in table in the
lobby, however, the newspaper's public affairs staff said he could
not attend the event.</TE>
<TE>   "But the L.A. Times said to Bill Simon that he could invite
people, right?" Camejo said. "And I'm on his list."</TE>
<TE>   "But you're not on the L.A. Times' invitation list," said Debbie
Ream, a public affairs representative.</TE>
<TE>   "So you're saying I can't come in?" the candidate asked. "OK,
thank you." He turned around and exited the building.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Goldstein, a spokeswoman for The Times, said later that
Camejo was not invited to participate because he did not have at
least 15% of support in the polls, a criteria used in presidential
elections. "Whether or not you're put on the list as a guest, he was
still a candidate, and we didn't feel he met the threshold of our
requirement to be here," Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   After being turned away, Camejo jumped up onto a planter outside
the building and told supporters that he was being excluded because
Davis is frightened that the Green Party candidate will siphon votes
away from him. Davis had threatened to boycott the debate if Camejo
was present.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the reason for this extreme overreaction on Davis' part
is because of the rebellion that is going on in the Latino
community," said Camejo, arguing that Latino voters are angry that
Davis vetoed a bill that would allow some illegal immigrants to get
driver's licenses. As he spoke, Davis supporters clambered up on the
planter to block Camejo signs with their own.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein said that the decision to exclude Camejo had nothing to
do with Davis. Davis spokesman Roger Salazar said that having Camejo
at the debate, the only one scheduled before election day, would have
been a distraction.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not interested in creating sideshows," Salazar said. "We
are interested in a serious debate on the issues."</TE>
<TE>   But outside, Simon supporters picked up on Camejo's theme. A man
in a chicken costume waddled around the crowd squawking, "Davis
chicken to debate Camejo!" A woman carrying a Green Party sign stared
at him quizzically, then nodded. "That's right!" she declared.</TE>
<TE>   As Camejo conducted media interviews, decrying his exclusion, the
debate continued on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   "What do we want?" chanted union members. "Davis! When do we want
him? Now!"</TE>
<TE>   Green Party protester Patrick Meighan stood in the middle of them,
yelling back.</TE>
<TE>   "We want a politician who's going to defend Californians, not
corporations," shouted Meighan, a 30-year-old writer from Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He waved a $20 bill in the air, adding his own words to the union
chant.</TE>
<TE>   "What do we want?" he shouted. "Money! What do we want? Donations!
What do we want? Cash!"</TE>
<TE>   "You don't know what you're talking about, pal!"
construction worker Ralph Velador yelled back. "What has Simon said
he's going to do for us as working people?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care about Simon!" the Green Party supporter said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the problem, you don't care," the union member shot back.</TE>
<TE>   After the debate, Camejo said that the public had been deprived of
hearing about the issues that he would have raised, such as
affordable housing, a living wage and the decriminalization of
marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the debate would have been substantially better with me
in it, because obviously on so many of these issues the Green Party
position is very different from the Democrats or Republicans," said
the candidate, who watched the debate in the lobby of a nearby
downtown hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was not allowed to participate, Camejo proclaimed
himself the winner of the debate.</TE>
<TE>   "You can sometimes win even when you're excluded," he said. "I
think people know that I was silenced and I think they realize that
another point of view on many of these issues could have really
helped to create debate."</TE>

<HD>Defense Denies Teen Was a Skinhead</HD>
<DH>Courts: Testimony ends in the trial of the Oak View
defendant accused of killing a homeless man in Ventura.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Testimony concluded Monday in the trial of an Oak View teen accused
of fatally beating a homeless man last year.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Coffman, 19, is one of four teenagers accused of kicking
and throwing rocks at homeless veteran James Clark, 58, as they
headed to a beach party June 30, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Clark died of blows to the head inflicted as he lay in a sleeping
bag near the shore.</LD>
<TE>   All four defendants, ages 14 to 19, were charged with murder. The
youngest was convicted earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   As Coffman's trial drew to a close Monday, defense lawyers
challenged a police officer's conclusion that the teen is a racist
skinhead whose ideology was a motive for the killing.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Police Officer Dan Swanson, who testified as a gang expert
for the prosecution, told jurors that Coffman admitted during police
interviews to associating with known skinheads and embracing their
white supremacist beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Swanson said that Coffman is a skinhead based on those interviews,
a racially motivated assault on an Ojai high school student two years
ago and Nazi writings and drawings found during a search of his home
and jail cell.</TE>
<TE>   But under questioning by defense attorney James Farley, Swanson
acknowledged that he formed his opinion without talking to Coffman
directly.</TE>
<TE>   Swanson could not identify a gang or hate group that the teenager
belongs to, and he acknowledged that having racist beliefs is not a
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, defense lawyers called to the stand two brothers who
lived with Coffman and his family for about a year. Lonnie and Joseph
Stanford, who are half black and half white, testified that Coffman
was like a brother to them.</TE>
<TE>   Farley asked Swanson how his client could be a racist skinhead if
he associated with--let alone shared a room with--people of another
race.</TE>
<TE>   Swanson said skinheads have been known to soften their views or
accept mixed-race friends.</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony Monday, defense attorneys called a pathologist
to testify about how long Clark may have lived after being beaten.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. John Cooper agreed with Ventura County Medical Examiner Ronald
O'Halloran's conclusion that Clark died from multiple blows to the
head.</TE>
<TE>   Autopsy results show that Clark sustained a fractured skull, a
crushed kidney, a broken rib and numerous bruises and abrasions.</TE>
<TE>   O'Halloran was unable to pinpoint the sequence of the injuries,
but testified that the kidney wound occurred some time after the head
injuries, possibly during a separate assault. He told jurors that
Clark could have lived for an hour or more after being attacked.</TE>
<TE>   But Cooper shortened that time frame. He told jurors that Clark
showed little brain or facial swelling, which suggests that he died
within minutes of the initial attack--not an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper also testified that Clark sustained no head injuries to
indicate that he was stomped on. According to earlier court
testimony, Coffman told friends he kicked and stomped Clark in the
head.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys have suggested that those statements were
overheard by witnesses and are unreliable exaggerations.</TE>
<TE>   Closing arguments are scheduled for Wednesday morning in Ventura
County Superior Court.</TE>

<HD>Simon, Davis Clash on Issues and Style</HD>
<DH>Debate: Challenger gives sweeping indictment of governor,
who hammers back on abortion, guns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gray Davis and Bill Simon Jr. clashed over ethics, guns, the economy
and the environment Monday in a scrappy gubernatorial debate that
highlighted their differing styles as much as their disparate
stances.</LD>
<LD>   Republican Simon, seizing on his first face-to-face meeting with
the incumbent, offered a sweeping indictment of the governor's nearly
four years in office. He condemned the state of the public schools,
California's business climate and Davis' personal probity, pledging
to "do better, a lot better" if elected Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Democrat Davis, in turn, offered a virtual point-by-point
dissection of Simon's positions on issues such as abortion and gun
control, asserting that his GOP rival is out of step with the values
of mainstream California. "I want to move us forward," Davis said.
"Mr. Simon wants to move us backward and to the right."</LD>
<TE>   There were no major gaffes and no startling revelations during the
hourlong session, suggesting nothing that would immediately change
the dynamic of the race with 28 days to go.</TE>
<TE>   The session, hosted by the Los Angeles Times and held at its
downtown headquarters, is so far the only debate scheduled between
the two major-party nominees.</TE>
<TE>   As promised, the Green Party candidate for governor, Peter Camejo,
tried to enter the building about 45 minutes before the noon debate.
He had been invited as a guest of Simon after The Times declined to
ask Camejo or three other minor-party candidates to participate
onstage.</TE>
<TE>   Camejo quietly left the building after being turned away at the
check-in desk, then joined a few dozen supporters in a demonstration
on the sidewalk outside the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, Davis and Simon managed for the most part to be civil, but
beneath that veneer their animosity occasionally showed through.</TE>
<TE>   Their sharpest exchange occurred roughly midway through the
debate, when each candidate was given the opportunity to directly
question his rival.</TE>
<TE>   Simon asked Davis, whose prodigious fund-raising has been an issue
in the contest, whether he ever accepted a campaign contribution in
his government office. Taking money under those circumstances would
be illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Davis--who served as an assemblyman, state controller and
lieutenant governor before winning the state's top job four years
ago--replied that he had always "conducted myself within the law."</TE>
<TE>   He then added a sharp rejoinder: "You're not in any position to
question anyone's ethics, Mr. Simon.... Do not throw rocks if you
live in a glass house."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, an investment banker whose business dealings have
engendered several controversies, angrily rejected Davis' insinuation
as "false and misleading in every regard."</TE>
<TE>   The discussion briefly carried over after the debate, in the press
briefing room outside the Times auditorium. Davis said he had "no
recollection of every doing that" when asked by reporters about
accepting contributions in his state office.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign asserted that one of its backers, a police and
sheriff's group, gave $10,000 to Davis in his lieutenant governor's
office during his last run for governor. The Simon campaign provided
no proof, however, and Davis aides dismissed the charge as a campaign
stunt.</TE>
<TE>   The back-and-forth was one of the few to strike sparks in a
session that served mostly to accentuate the understated,
buttoned-down demeanor of the two leading gubernatorial hopefuls.
Each man was meticulously coiffed and they wore nearly identical dark
suits, white shirts and red ties.</TE>
<TE>   Davis addressed the charisma question when asked why he was so
unpopular with his fellow Democratic legislators in Sacramento.
"Californians have entertainers, rock stars and athletes to entertain
and inspire them," Davis replied. Political officeholders are
expected simply "to get the job done," he said. "... I'm doing my
job. I would like that people like me, but as long as my wife likes
me, I'll live with that."</TE>
<TE>   Davis returned to that theme of experience and competency
throughout the debate, sometimes in a condescending way. "It's all
very nice to talk the talk, but I've walked the walk," the governor
said at one point, criticizing Simon--who is making his first try for
office--for his failure to vote in several past elections.</TE>
<TE>   At another point, Davis spoke of the difficulty of closing the
state's recent $24-billion budget gap and criticized Simon for
declining to say how he would have done it. "Welcome to the big time,
Mr. Simon," the Democrat taunted. "The people of the state expect
governors to make the tough decisions, not run from them."</TE>
<TE>   Simon repeatedly sought to turn Davis' incumbency into a
liability, suggesting that the problem facing Sacramento is "business
as usual."</TE>
<TE>   "What I want to bring is a breath of fresh air," Simon said,
starting with a more rigorous ethical standard.</TE>
<TE>   From his opening remarks, the GOP challenger painted an
unremittingly grim picture of California. He described a place where
failing public schools are infested with rats and cockroaches, a
sagging economy is bleeding taxpayers dry and the governor has
effectively auctioned off public policy to his most generous donors.</TE>
<TE>   "Taxes have gone up, services have been cut, hopes have been
crushed," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis should apologize, Simon went on, for the "awful ethical
tone" set by his administration as well as his handling of last
year's electricity crisis. "He promised us no [utility] bankruptcies,
no bailouts, no rate hikes," Simon said, "yet he's given us all
three."</TE>
<TE>   Davis responded by reeling off a series of upbeat statistics,
including improved student test scores, a crime rate below the
national average and the creation of nearly 1 million jobs in spite
of the economic slowdown of the last two years. "Despite tough
challenges ... we've made real progress in California in so many
areas," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   As for his fund-raising, the governor said he would sign
legislation to prohibit contributions during critical periods such as
the bill-signing window in Sacramento--but only if there were limits
on wealthy candidates such as Simon. Otherwise, Davis said, the only
people who will be elected to public office will be self-funding
millionaires.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also pledged to cut back--but not cease--his
aggressive fund-raising if elected to a second term. He declined to
vow to serve a full four years if he wins reelection, however. "I
have no intention for running for another office," Davis said. "...
I'm not making a commitment, but I have no plans to do anything
else."</TE>
<TE>   As much as their differences on issues, the debate also
highlighted the contrasting styles of the two candidates.</TE>
<TE>   While Simon used broad statements in outlining his philosophy and
assailing the governor, Davis put forth a raft of detail and
frequently dwelt on government minutiae. He returned over and over to
two issues--abortion and gun control--in an effort to paint Simon as
ideologically extreme.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Simon is a true-blue think-tank conservative," Davis said.
"... He is simply out of step with the values of most Californians."</TE>
<TE>   Simon opposes abortion, except in cases of rape, incest or to save
a mother's life. But he has said he would uphold existing California
laws that allow abortion. And he said as much on Monday about gun
control.</TE>
<TE>   "When I take an oath as governor, I take an oath to enforce the
law," Simon said, after noting his personal opposition to state laws
restricting so-called Saturday night specials and limiting gun
purchases to one a month.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't choose," Simon went on. "I don't pick and choose which
laws to enforce.... That's where my head is."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who has signed several laws expanding gun control and
liberalizing abortion laws, responded sharply. "Trust me," he said.
"Voters don't want to know if you're going to in some weak fashion
enforce laws you don't agree with. They want to know where your heart
is. And in his heart he is pro-gun. In his heart he is anti-choice.
And I'm just the opposite."</TE>
<TE>   The two candidates also differed over two pieces of
first-in-the-nation legislation that Davis signed into law. One curbs
tailpipe emissions to fight global warming; the second extends paid
family leave to parents seeking time off after the birth of a child.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he would have vetoed both measures. While expressing
concern about global warming, the GOP hopeful said the bill that
Davis signed was too ambiguous and relied too heavily on bureaucrats
to make it work. As for the family leave bill, Simon said it amounted
to a tax on employees.</TE>
<TE>   The family leave bill and another measure that requires businesses
to pay overtime after eight hours of work were noble objectives but
poorly executed, Simon said. "In both instances, those bills hurt
workers."</TE>
<TE>   The two candidates even managed to differ on their one point of
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Davis defended his decision to veto controversial legislation to
provide driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, even as he vowed to
sign a future version.</TE>
<TE>   "The bill that was sent to me was massively flawed because it said
if there was a warrant out for your arrest for treason, murder,
espionage, rape or other serious crimes, you could still get a
driver's license," Davis said. "... We want to confer this privilege
on people who are making our economy stronger and taking jobs that
many people otherwise wouldn't take, but we don't want to do it in a
way that compromises public safety. "</TE>
<TE>   Simon--who also opposed the legislation--nevertheless suggested
that Davis had double-crossed Latino supporters who were counting on
his signature.</TE>
<TE>   "That's exactly why they withdrew their endorsement late last
week," Simon said of the Legislature's Latino caucus. "That's exactly
why they have trouble, because sometimes Mr. Davis has trouble with
the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, speaking to reporters, Simon called for more debates,
noting that Davis participated in several when he ran for governor
four years ago. Davis responded that he wasn't ruling out the
possibility of another face-to-face meeting--but pointed out that
incumbent Gov. Pete Wilson debated his opponent only a single time in
1994 and his predecessor, George Deukmejian, did not debate at all.</TE>

<HD>Young Eagle Rescued at Sea Is Recovering</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: The bird is part of a reintroduction experiment
at Santa Cruz Island.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bedraggled bald eagle, recently set free on Santa Cruz Island, is
recovering after being plucked from the ocean by two men returning
from a diving trip around Channel Islands National Park.</LD>
<LD>   The Alaska-born eagle was released last month as part of a major
effort to reintroduce the species to the Channel Islands. A dozen
eagles have been released on Santa Cruz Island this year, and another
12 are to be set free there annually for the next five years.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-month-old female was malnourished and dehydrated when Mark
Ferguson spotted it floundering eight miles off Santa Cruz Island
last week.</LD>
<TE>   "We saw something in the water and sea gulls were circling, so we
went over to take a look," said the 42-year-old engineer from
Thousand Oaks. "It looked like it was using its wing to do a
breaststroke. I could see the transmitter attached to its back."</TE>
<TE>   After some debate, Ferguson and his friend maneuvered their boat
close, and Ferguson grabbed the eagle by the tail.</TE>
<TE>   "I was afraid of getting scraped by its claws but it looked pretty
exhausted," Ferguson said. "We put it in the front of the boat. After
20 minutes it started to revive. It flew to the front end and turned
around to face us."</TE>
<TE>   But the bird, which has a 6-foot wingspan, stayed put all the way
back to shore. There, it was turned over to the Ojai Raptor Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We have basically had it under 24-hour surveillance for a week,"
said Patty Perry, who works at the nonprofit raptor rehabilitation
and education center in Oak View. Perry said the bird looked as
though it hadn't eaten for three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The bird was fed fish and rodents, administered blood tests and
given electrolytes to rehydrate it, Perry said. It has gained 2
pounds since arriving Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   "She weighs 7 1/4 pounds, but she should weigh 11 or 12 pounds,"
Perry said. "She was in very critical condition when she got here."</TE>
<TE>   The sleek black eagle seemed chipper Monday as it sat in a wood
aviary at the raptor center.</TE>
<TE>   Still wearing its blue wing tags, the bird opened its mouth wide
and squawked noisily.</TE>
<TE>   It probably will be taken to Santa Cruz in a week or so and put in
a nesting box for observation and feeding, biologists say.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its condition, the eagle rescued last week was lucky. A
few weeks ago, another of the original 12 tried the 20-mile crossing
from Santa Cruz to the mainland but dropped into the ocean and
drowned less than a mile from Point Mugu. Another was tracked over
the water for at least eight days and has not been located since. A
third made it across the water and kept going.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Sharp, biologist with the Arcada-based Institute for
Wildlife Studies, the group overseeing the eagle program, said it's
common for young birds to try flying to the mainland. But thermal air
currents, which help birds glide over land, are absent over the
ocean, requiring the eagles to flap all the way across.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long crossing and some don't make it," he said. "We had
the same thing happen on Catalina. We pulled two birds dead from the
water and pulled one alive from the water twice."</TE>
<TE>   One Catalina eagle took the easy route and simply hopped a boat
and rode it to Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were losing 50% of our birds, that would be a concern,"
Sharp said. "On Catalina we have had a 75% survival rate. We have
birds that fly to British Columbia each year and come back."</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife officials say they are impressed by the rescue.</TE>
<TE>   "It was pretty darn lucky because it's a large ocean," Sharp said.
"And it was pretty brave" of Ferguson.</TE>
<TE>   Perry said a bald eagle talon can squeeze at pressures approaching
3,000 pounds per square inch, which can break bones.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been easy to look at the talons and beak and say
'Forget it,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ferguson seemed surprised to learn that the talons could do such
damage. "I had no idea it could snap my wrist," he said. "It seemed
like the right thing to do, but I will admit, it was scary."</TE>

<HD>Ruling Bars Repaying With Official Funds</HD>
<DH>Ethics: City officials who got contributions from
quasi-public film agency had sought advice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Ethics Commission ruled Monday that elected city
officials cannot use their political officeholder accounts to repay
controversial campaign contributions received from the beleaguered
Entertainment Industry Development Corp.</LD>
<LD>   As a result of the ruling, City Controller Laura Chick said she
would personally repay a $1,000 campaign contribution that she
received from the quasi-public film permit agency while she was a
member of the City Council.</LD>
<LD>   "It's money that has come into question, and she felt this was the
right thing to do," said Rob Wilcox, a spokesman for Chick.</LD>
<TE>   Chick and several City Council members had sought advice from the
Ethics Commission after questions were raised by county prosecutors
about whether the film agency's funds are public money, which by law
cannot be used for political contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office recently raided the agency's
offices as part of a probe into whether the agency had misspent
money. The agency was formed by the city and county in the mid-1990s
to expedite the film permit process.</TE>
<TE>   Campaign committees that received agency contributions to benefit
Chick and others have since been closed, so she and council members
asked whether they could tap their political officeholder accounts,
which are intended to cover costs associated with holding office.</TE>
<TE>   "An expenditure from officeholder funds made to return a
contribution does not serve, assist or communicate with constituents,
nor would it be made in connection with your official duties as
controller," concluded the commission's executive director, LeeAnn
Pelham, in an advice letter.</TE>
<TE>   She also said that if Chick used the officeholder account to repay
a campaign contribution, "the effect would be to use officeholder
account funds in connection with an election to city office, which is
not permitted."</TE>
<TE>   Two City Council members, Dennis Zine and Hal Bernson, also
received contributions from the film agency. Bernson said that, as a
result of the ethics opinion, he probably would not return the $500
he received.</TE>
<TE>   Zine said Monday that he wanted to return the money but would
await a legal opinion he requested from the city attorney. .</TE>

<HD>Pricey Homes, Cathedral OK on Farmland</HD>

<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Ana City Council on Monday unanimously approved a
development plan for a luxury gated community and a cathedral on the
last big parcel of open farmland in the city.</LD>
<LD>   A high school and a YMCA are also destined for the old Armstrong
Ranch, which has been owned by the Segerstrom family, owners of South
Coast Plaza, for more than seven decades.</LD>
<LD>   Shea Homes will build 156 houses, each to cost well over $600,000,
on the eastern side of the 90-acre parcel, which is bordered by
MacArthur Boulevard, Alton Avenue, and Bear and Greenville streets.
Although 88% of the city's households have an annual income of less
than $50,000, the luxury homes are considered by many city officials
as a way to balance the city's housing stock.</LD>
<TE>   Councilman Brett Franklin said the expensive homes "represent a
change in philosophy." Moving up used to mean moving out, he said,
but "what we are seeing now is a move-up purchase within the city."</TE>
<TE>   Added Councilman Jose Solorio: "We have something that will be a
real showcase for our community."</TE>
<TE>   The homes will replace beans, which have long been the yield on a
ranch that the pioneering Armstrong family sold in 1931.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the plan, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange will
build a cathedral, parish hall and administration building. The plan
would also allow for a YMCA.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining land, to the west, is expected to become the campus
for Segerstrom High School.</TE>

<HD>Screeners Take Posts at LAX</HD>
<DH>The 450 federal workers are diverse, starting on-the-job
training with a crisp look and new attitude</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first wave of new federal checkpoint screeners begins work today
at Los Angeles International Airport--noticeably upbeat about their
jobs and more ethnically diverse than their new colleagues around the
country.</LD>
<LD>   The initial group of 450 screeners takes over the checkpoints in
Terminals 7 and 8, wearing crisp white shirts, pressed navy trousers
and maroon clip-on ties, all part of the uniform required by the
federal Transportation Security Administration.</LD>
<LD>   After sitting through 40 hours of classroom instruction last week
in which they learned how to use security equipment, the new hires
will now undergo 60 hours of on-the-job training.</LD>
<TE>   They are the first of four groups of passenger screeners who will
take charge at LAX checkpoints in the next month. These 1,600
screeners will be joined by an additional 1,600 federal workers who
will operate new bomb-detection equipment in airport terminals by the
end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The force frees up screeners working for private contractors in
Terminals 7 and 8 to reapply for their jobs with the TSA. Current
screeners must pass a series of tests and provide proof that they're
U.S. citizens before they can be rehired.</TE>
<TE>   The rollout that began at LAX this week is mandated by an aviation
security law passed by Congress after the terrorist attacks of Sept.
11, 2001. It requires the federal government to hire and train
thousands of screeners to work at the nation's 429 commercial
airports by Nov. 19. Federal screeners currently work at 142 of these
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Officials emphasized the ethnicity of workers in the first group
of federalized screeners at LAX, saying the group is representative
of the Los Angeles area. About 70% of the workers are minorities.
That's well below the 98% of the current screening work force at LAX,
but a higher percentage than among other new federal screeners around
the country.</TE>
<TE>   At other airports, minorities have found it difficult to land the
new, higher-paying positions because of citizenship requirements and
pre-employment assessment tests.</TE>
<TE>   At U.S. airports with federalized screeners, about 58.3% are
non-Latino white, 11% Latino, 21.8% African American, 3.4% Asian, 1%
American Indian and about 4% other ethnicities, according to TSA
statistics.</TE>
<TE>   At LAX, about 26.6% of the 450 new screeners are non-Latino white,
19.1% Hispanic, 35.5% African American, 11% Asian and 1.4% American
Indian and about 6% other ethnicities, statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   "This force is reflective of the community where we live and
play," said LAX Federal Security Director David Stone. "This is a
result of a lot of people reaching out to various ethnic
organizations in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the new workers said they jumped at the chance to be a
federal screener because they felt compelled to give back to their
country after the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew someone on the first flight that hit the World Trade
Center," said Dorothy Denis, a 37-year-old former postal worker.
"They inspired me to get involved and to do something to help."</TE>
<TE>   At a graduation ceremony for the new screeners Monday, Stone gave
the group a pep talk, encouraging them to remember the importance of
their work.</TE>
<TE>   "About 1.4 million people applied to be federal screeners, and the
TSA hired 39,000. You're a member of a very select group," Stone
said. "Since 9/11, we all know what a threat terrorism is to our
country. What you've decided to take upon yourself is service to your
country, not just a job."</TE>
<TE>   The capacity crowd in a conference room at the Proud Bird
restaurant, just outside the airfield's perimeter, burst into
applause, waving miniature American flags.</TE>
<TE>   Stone hopes the upbeat attitude of the new work force, in marked
contrast to the depression that dogs private screeners who believe
they were blamed unjustly for the terrorist attacks, will help him
keep new workers on the job. Historically, turnover rates among
security screeners have been as high as 500% at some airports.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of the first wave of new federalized screeners at LAX
are naturalized citizens--a process the TSA has been encouraging to
help retain many of those in the current work force. About 40% of
employees who work for private screening companies at LAX are not
U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wanted to do a federal job," said Lubna Kamar, 24. "This
country gave me my education. It's a way to repay your country."</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro resident Kamar, who is Arab American and immigrated to
the U.S. when she was 12, began work as a federal screener at LAX
this week alongside her father, Nabil Kamar, 55, who formerly worked
as a business manager and a computer salesman.</TE>
<TE>   Kamar and her father will be trained this week by the TSA's mobile
screening task force, a group that travels among the nation's
airports mentoring new federal security workers.</TE>
<TE>   In other airport news Monday, the City Council's Public Safety
Committee accepted reports compiled by law enforcement agencies who
responded to the deadly Independence Day shootings at LAX.</TE>
<TE>   The reports offered a generally positive review of the response by
the 10 agencies that participated in the investigation. But they also
noted several areas that need improvement, such as better
coordination among agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss, who requested the documents, said he plans
to continue to investigate the city's preparedness to respond to a
major assault at its international airport.</TE>

<HD>College Board Hopefuls Raise Little Money</HD>
<DH>Election: Donations are sparse in the Ventura County
district, which has been rocked by a financial scandal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS and CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A financial scandal at the Ventura County Community College District
dominated headlines for months, drawing a full slate of candidates
seeking to take control of the problem-ridden college system.</LD>
<LD>   But so far, the 13 candidates vying for three seats in the Nov. 5
election have failed to attract much financial support for their
campaigns. Finance documents filed Monday show that five candidates
intend to raise less than $1,000, and contributions to the others
have also been light.</LD>
<LD>   Cheryl Heitmann, a community activist who hopes to replace
outgoing trustee Norm Nagel in the Thousand Oaks-based Area 2 office,
raised close to $13,000--the most of any candidate.</LD>
<TE>   That is far short of the $20,000 to $30,000 per candidate raised
in previous college district campaigns, said Herbert Gooch, a
Thousand Oaks political analyst. Gooch attributed the dearth of
donations to a sagging economy and lackluster interest in the
governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   "The money is not there across the board. It's not just the
college district," Gooch said. "People running for city councils and
school boards say they are having a hard time, too. This election
just isn't enlisting a lot of interest."</TE>
<TE>   He cautioned, however, that late money could still be pumped into
the races, as candidates push for crucial absentee voters in the
weeks to come. The next round of financial statements is due Oct. 24.</TE>
<TE>   District finances--and how closely trustees should monitor
budgets--are major themes for many of the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Better oversight of dollars and other reforms are needed,
challengers say, to fix problems in the 30,000-student district,
which has been rocked by a financial scandal involving Chancellor
Philip Westin.</TE>
<TE>   He came under fire last spring for charging the district $119,000
between 1998 and 2001 for cars, meals and computers. The five
trustees placed him on paid administrative leave in July--two months
after giving him a $30,000 raise--while they investigate allegations
that he misspent hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer money.</TE>
<TE>   With no end in sight to the ongoing probe, trustee Art Hernandez
has the most to lose. He was among four trustees who voted in May to
renew Westin's contract, including a $30,000 raise, even though they
were aware of the spending allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez has raised $3,495 so far in his effort to retain his
Area 5 seat, which represents Oxnard, El Rio and Port Hueneme. He
received $1,000 each from two private companies outside Ventura
County and from Rosales Calderon, a retired Whittier resident. The
balance came from donors who gave less than $100 each.</TE>
<TE>   Missing from his list of financial supporters is the college
district's faculty union, the Ventura County Federation of College
Teachers, which decided not to support any candidate in the Area 5
race. The union played a crucial role in pressuring the board to
remove Westin from his day-to-day management of the district during
the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Munoz Schnopp, a businesswoman challenging Hernandez, has
raised $3,302, half in a loan to herself. The remainder came from
individual contributions of $100 to $200.</TE>
<TE>   Mental health worker Deshay Ford raised less than $1,000, and
college instructor Ron Segovia Dyste's statement was not available.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee John Tallman, whose Area 1 covers parts of Oxnard, Ventura
and Port Hueneme, has raised $2,600 and spent $1,500. The retired
administrator within the district cast the sole vote against renewing
Westin's contract and has the support of the faculty union. He
received $100 contributions from several Ventura College teachers.
Tallman loaned himself $700.</TE>
<TE>   Tallman's strongest challenger in terms of contributions is Oxnard
teacher Mary Anne Rooney, who raised $6,968 and spent $5,220.
Challengers David Norrdin, a movie theater attendant, and Kevin
Laird, an accountant, raised less than $1,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   In the five-way race to replace Nagel, Heitmann, a small-business
owner, leads the fund-raising pack. She raised $12,500 and spent
$9,500. Half of her total came in a loan to herself, with the
remainder collected from individuals and organizations, including
$500 from Dist. Atty.-elect Greg Totten and $250 from Service
Employees International Union, Local 998, which represents the
college district's non-teaching staff.</TE>
<TE>   Although she won the faculty union's endorsement, she has yet to
receive a check from it, Heitmann said.</TE>
<TE>   She is followed closely by retired Firefighter Sandy Patrizio, who
raised $11,750, including $8,550 that he loaned to his campaign. He
spent $3,500.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Peate, an employee benefits consultant, loaned himself $1,400
and did not report any expenses for the period. The final two
candidates, retired college professor Carroll Bowen and parent Linda
Van Dolsen, said they will raise less than $1,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   Bowen, a Thousand Oaks city councilman from 1970 to 1978, said he
doesn't plan to solicit donations, even if it costs him the seat.</TE>
<TE>   "I may very well lose by not doing that, but in this particular
office, I would like to try to win on my qualifications and let the
chips fall where they may," he said. "It's definitely a calculated
risk."</TE>
<TE>   After eight years on the community college board, Nagel decided
not to run for reelection in Area 2, which represents Thousand Oaks,
Oak Park and Westlake Village.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Concert Hall Debut Postponed Until 2006</HD>
<DH>Arts: Though donations are lagging for the $200-million
venue, officials say the delay is mostly to ensure that the acoustics
are perfect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With donations at a standstill halfway to their goal, leaders of the
Orange County Performing Arts Center said Monday that the
$200-million concert hall they had aimed to open in the fall of 2005
will be delayed a year.</LD>
<LD>   While acknowledging that the delay will provide more time to raise
money, the center's chairman, Paul F. Folino, said the decision to
push back the opening until October 2006 was not based on
fund-raising difficulties. About $100 million has been raised or
pledged since the campaign began nearly three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   But, amid a plummeting stock market and other economic woes, only
$3.5 million in new donations has been announced in the past 12
months.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, center officials proclaimed a "No wine before its time"
ethic: Because of its complex acoustical engineering, they said, the
2,000-seat hall requires a break-in time of three to six months to
"tune" it for peak sonic performance, and pushing to keep to the
original schedule would have risked getting off to a bad start.</TE>
<TE>   Folino and center President Jerry E. Mandel pointed to the
experience at Philadelphia's Verizon Hall, which struck a sour note
with most critics when it opened in December. Acoustical engineer
Russell Johnson was in charge of the Philadelphia hall's sound as
well as the one in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of cities have looked at the Philadelphia experience and
are making sure they have plenty of time for the tuning period," said
Johnson, who was at the center Monday along with the project's
architect, Cesar Pelli, for the first public unveiling of the hall's
interior design.</TE>
<TE>   Center leaders hope that with the design complete and detailed in
an assortment of models, sample materials and artists' renderings,
they can use them to focus community interest and inspire donations.
Last October, then-chairman Roger T. Kirwan set a goal of between
$125 million and $150 million for the campaign by the end of 2002.
Folino said the aim now is to raise $30 million in the coming 12
months, putting the center, at the end of 2003, in the range that
leaders hoped they could reach this year.</TE>
<TE>   A ceremonial groundbreaking is planned for Jan. 21, with actual
construction to begin next spring. Where previously the strategy had
been to raise as much as $150 million during a "silent phase" when
only prospective high-rolling donors were approached, Folino said the
plan now is to seek donations from all comers starting with the
groundbreaking.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get more community momentum for the project, and we
can do that by reaching out to the public," Folino said. As former
president of neighboring South Coast Repertory, Folino has led a
five-year fund-raising campaign that passed its target of $40
million--including $19 million for a just-unveiled theater expansion.
Folino, the chief executive of Emulex Corp., a Costa Mesa high-tech
company, contributed $10 million of that himself.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look around, people are still raising money, and our goal
is to get going" despite the poor economy, Folino said. If need be,
he said, the center could issue bonds to ensure that the new
timetable is met.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Symphony, which will be the new concert hall's leading
tenant, views the extra year as "welcome news," president John E.
Forsyte said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The symphony faces its own challenges: building its audience and
raising money so it can present more performances when the hall
opens.</TE>
<TE>   The aim is to increase the annual budget from $11 million to $15
million by then. "It's important to have extra time, especially with
the economy," Forsyte said.</TE>
<TE>   The interior design unveiled Monday calls for an auditorium with
ivory-colored plaster facades for its four undulating balconies,
light-colored wood paneling on the walls, and bright, red velvet
upholstery on the seats. The three adjustable acoustical canopies
would hang above the stage, and orchestra areas will have silver
facades. Mounted on the back wall behind the orchestra will be an
organ with about 4,600 pipes, the largest 32 feet long. The outside
walls will be of pale beige limestone; the building's hallmark will
be a curved, wave-like glass facade intended to be set a-glitter with
light while providing a see-through effect, making it "a transparent
veil," as Pelli described it.</TE>
<TE>   Pelli said concertgoers in the lobbies of the new Renee and Henry
Segerstrom Concert Hall and the existing, 3,000-seat Segerstrom Hall
will be able to see one another. "It adds to the sense of festivity,
of the importance of a town center in Costa Mesa."</TE>
<TE>   Pelli described the concert space's interior as "a fairly simple,
spare hall but with enough elements to give it a sense of elegance."</TE>
<TE>   The new wing's second auditorium, a 500-seat space with flexible
seating, has a separate glass entrance that is meant to convey a less
formal atmosphere, Pelli said. "People should feel comfortable coming
there in bluejeans."</TE>

<HD>Expand Inn? Be Our Guest, Residents Say</HD>
<DH>Ojai Valley: The $60-million upgrade would boost tourism
for the town, which has been wary of development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAIL DAVIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmentally sensitive Ojai is not known for embracing
development.</LD>
<LD>   But ever since the Ojai Valley Inn &amp; Spa first proposed a
$60-million expansion, one of the largest development projects in
recent city history, there has been little public opposition.</LD>
<LD>   One reason is that the family-owned inn remains Ojai's largest
employer and chief source of revenue. The proposed expansion would
boost the resort's work force to about 700, double the $1 million in
annual taxes paid to the city and help increase tourism.</LD>
<TE>   That is welcome news for the city and local merchants.</TE>
<TE>   Competition with swanky resorts in neighboring Santa Barbara is
driving the inn to add more $300-a-night rooms, said Thad Hyland,
managing director. About 60,000 guests visit each year.</TE>
<TE>   The 80-year-old mission-style inn is nestled along the Ojai Valley
floor and surrounded by majestic oaks and spectacular mountain views.
The picturesque setting has long made it a popular refuge for
celebrities, from Bing Crosby to Barbra Streisand.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council will consider the proposal during its meeting
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Although the development project would fell trees, encroach on
wetlands and bring unwanted traffic, environmentalists have not
exactly come out in force against it. They acknowledge the resort's
importance to the community.</TE>
<TE>   "We see it as a vital part of maintaining Ojai," said Ivor
Benci-Woodward, president of the environmental group Citizens to
Preserve the Ojai. But his group remains concerned about increased
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Hyland said the inn encourages employees to carpool and use local
bus service to help reduce traffic. Service trucks will also be
directed to an entrance south of downtown to avoid congestion there.</TE>
<TE>   Plans also call for enhancing wetlands located near the new
construction site by removing nonnative eucalyptus and planting
hundreds of new oaks. The development would also require a new
traffic light at the intersection of Hermosa Road and California 150,
which many residents welcome.</TE>
<TE>   The town's taste for debate has settled more on which aspect of
expansion would benefit Ojai most.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Bowman, who owns three high-end clothing stores in Ojai,
says inn guests tend to be well-traveled and big-spenders. So having
more of them frequenting local businesses can only be good, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even a rival spa welcomes the expansion. Sheila Cluff, owner of
the Oaks at Ojai Spa, said the inn's hefty marketing budget benefits
the whole city. "We could never begin to get the exposure that they
give," Cluff said.</TE>
<TE>   The one significant downside of the 14-month project is that it
would temporarily shrink the inn to about 60 rooms.</TE>

<HD>Irvine Wants State Taxpayers to Fund Big Park</HD>
<DH>Ballot: Proposition 51 would give city $110 million in
state funds, which angers many.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it was the words "no new taxes" that that made many voters
think Irvine officials were promising to convert the closed El Toro
Marine base into one of the largest urban parks in the nation without
costing taxpayers a dime.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine officials would like to clarify: When they said "no new
taxes" in the ballot measure that approved the park, they merely
meant no local taxes. They actually want taxpayers statewide to pick
up the tab.</LD>
<LD>   Buried deep in the text of Proposition 51--the Traffic Congestion
Relief and Safe School Buses Act--among alternative transportation
projects, school bus funding and freeway expansion work, is $110
million in state funding for the so-called Great Park.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine officials say they need that state money to fulfill their
vision of transforming more than 80% of the base's 4,700 acres of
airfields and dilapidated buildings into lush meadows, playing fields
and museums. That would make it nearly the size of Griffith Park and
four times the size of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We never said that to create the Great Park will cost no money,"
said Irvine Mayor Larry Agran. "It's only some of the more sinister
people in Newport Beach who are asserting we said that."</TE>
<TE>   It's money that state officials on their own would have no
intention of directing Irvine's way, given California's budget
crisis. So Irvine is making an end run around Sacramento with the
November initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Should the measure pass, the park will become a priority project
in the state budget.</TE>
<TE>   That has some crying foul. The California Budget Project, the
California League of Women Voters and other groups warn that making
"luxury" projects such as the Great Park a priority during a budget
crunch will force cuts in essential state programs and services.</TE>
<TE>   Others suggest that Irvine is using a ballot measure full of
unrelated infrastructure spending to manipulate voters into approving
the wealthy suburb's pet project.</TE>
<TE>   "It's presented as, 'Isn't all this stuff really cool?' " said V.
John White, an environmental lobbyist in Sacramento. "But this
initiative pushes projects to the front of the line that don't belong
there.... You are taking funding away form other programs that
matter, particularly those that help low-income people."</TE>
<TE>   Should the initiative pass, Irvine's good fortune wouldn't end
with Great Park funds. Also tucked into the measure is $50 million
for a "remote" airport terminal for the city. No planes would fly out
of there; it would be a place to check in luggage and catch a shuttle
van to a real airport.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the initiative has come under fire from state lawmakers
who say several of the projects in it will help developers in
exchange for millions of dollars worth of campaign donations,
endorsements from many of the state's major environmental and
alternative-transportation groups give it a strong chance of passing.</TE>
<TE>   So how did Irvine get so much for itself written into Proposition
51?</TE>
<TE>   It didn't hurt that Agran sits on the board of the Planning and
Conservation League, the nonprofit environmental coalition sponsoring
the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the league say that when they were shopping the
measure around to cities and agencies, looking for projects that
could be included, Irvine was one of the few that showed interest.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them didn't take us seriously," said Jerry Meral,
executive director of the league. "They didn't believe it would get
on the ballot.... We did not get that kind of reception in south
Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   Meral said that the initiative does not call for new taxes. It
merely guarantees that 30% of state motor vehicle sales taxes would
be set aside for its nearly $1 billion worth of projects.</TE>
<TE>   As for those projects displacing other priorities in the state
budget, Meral counters that "this is a democracy, and all we are
doing is giving the public an opportunity to decide" which projects
should come first.</TE>

<HD>Irvine's Great Park Plan Carries Equal Price</HD>
<DH>Election: Proposition 51 would provide $110 million from
state taxpayers. City leaders call it fair--but many others don't.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it was the words "no new taxes" in the ballot measure Orange
County voters approved in March that left many with the impression
that the closed El Toro Marine base could be converted to a so-called
Great Park without costing taxpayers a dime.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine officials would like to clarify: They merely meant no local
taxes. They actually want taxpayers statewide to pick up the tab by
redirecting money from other projects.</LD>
<LD>   Buried deep in the text of Proposition 51--the Traffic Congestion
Relief and Safe School Buses Act--among alternative transportation
projects, school bus funding and freeway expansions, is $110 million
for the Great Park.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine officials say they need that state money to fulfill their
vision of transforming more than 80% of the base's 4,700 acres of
airfields and dilapidated buildings into lush meadows, playing fields
and museums--making it nearly equal in size to Griffith Park and four
times that of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We never said that to create the Great Park will cost no money,"
said Irvine Mayor Larry Agran. "It's only some of the more sinister
people in Newport Beach who are asserting we said that."</TE>
<TE>   It's money that state officials have no intention of directing
Irvine's way, given California's budget crisis. So Irvine is making
an end run around Sacramento with the November initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Should the measure pass, the park will become a priority project
in the state budget.</TE>
<TE>   That has some crying foul. The California Budget Project, the
California League of Women Voters and other groups warn that making
"luxury" projects such as the Great Park a priority during a budget
crunch will force cuts in essential state programs.</TE>
<TE>   Others suggest that Irvine is using a ballot measure full of
unrelated infrastructure spending to manipulate voters into approving
the wealthy suburb's pet project.</TE>
<TE>   "It's presented as 'Isn't all this stuff really cool?' " said V.
John White, an environmental lobbyist in Sacramento. "But this
initiative pushes projects to the front of the line that don't belong
there.... You are taking funding away from other programs that
matter, particularly those that help low-income people."</TE>
<TE>   Should the initiative pass, Irvine's good fortune wouldn't end
with the Great Park funds. Also tucked into the measure is another
windfall for the city: $50 million for a "remote" airport terminal
for the city. No planes would fly out of there; it would be a place
to check in luggage and catch a shuttle van to a real airport.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the initiative has come under fire from state lawmakers
who say several of the projects in it will help developers in
exchange for millions of dollars worth of campaign donations,
endorsements from many of the state's major environmental and
alternative-transportation groups give it a strong chance of passing.</TE>
<TE>   How did Irvine get so much for itself written into Proposition 51?</TE>
<TE>   It didn't hurt that Agran sits on the board of the Planning and
Conservation League, the nonprofit environmental coalition sponsoring
the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the league say that when they were shopping the
measure around to cities and agencies, looking for projects that
could be included, Irvine was one of the few that showed interest.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them didn't take us seriously," said league Executive
Director Jerry Meral. "They didn't believe it would get on the
ballot.... We did not get that kind of reception in south Orange
County."</TE>
<TE>   Meral said that the initiative does not call for new taxes. It
merely guarantees that 30% of state motor vehicle sales taxes would
be set aside for its nearly $1 billion worth of projects.</TE>
<TE>   As for those projects displacing other priorities in the state
budget, Meral counters that "this is a democracy, and all we are
doing is giving the public an opportunity to decide" which projects
should come first.</TE>
<TE>   "Making that old Marine base into a park and cultural center will
avoid creation of a huge amount of traffic," Meral said. He warned
that the alternative could be tens of thousands of homes built there,
further clogging one of the state's most congested areas.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say they have nothing against the park, they just don't
think it should be funded at the expense of more pressing projects
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "No harm meant to Irvine, but why should their projects go to the
top of the list?" said Brea Councilwoman Bev Perry. "This comes at a
cost to everybody else who has projects they desperately need. I have
a major problem with that. It is just not good planning."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the California League of Women Voters say the
initiative gives voters the impression that they are getting all
these projects at no additional cost, when in reality its passage
would wreak havoc with the state budget by reallocating millions of
dollars, putting essential public safety, social service and higher
education programs in danger of being cut.</TE>
<TE>   "Proposition 51 violates the principles of sound tax-and-spending
policy and key concepts of good government," says a league report.
"It will permanently tie the hands of our elected representatives as
they attempt to set priorities and budget for the current needs for
California."</TE>
<TE>   Agran makes no apologies.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County puts in a lot more than we get back from the state
General Fund," he said. "It's high time we receive our fair share of
money. That isn't elitist. It's just fair."</TE>
<TE>   The park and air terminal, Agran said, are projects that would be
used by residents throughout the county. And despite the criticism,
he said, "I'm not going to apologize to anyone for aggressively
pursuing projects that serve the county's public interest."</TE>

<HD>Priests Stand Up to Cardinal on Budget</HD>
<DH>Archdiocese: After private meeting, several say the
willingness to challenge Mahony over issues such as ministry funding
marks a change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alarmed by deep cuts in ministry budgets and shaken by the church's
response to the sexual abuse scandal, priests in the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Los Angeles confronted Cardinal Roger M. Mahony during
a private meeting Monday, questioning his statements about the
archdiocese's finances and urging him to restore funds for programs.</LD>
<LD>   The statements came during an annual meeting with Mahony of 600 to
700 of the archdiocese's 1,200 active priests in Los Angeles, Ventura
and Santa Barbara counties. The willingness of many priests to
challenge the cardinal on a range of issues marked a turning point in
their relationship with the archdiocese, several priests said,
although a spokesman for the archdiocese disputed that assertion.</LD>
<LD>   Known as the Presbyteral Assembly, this year's session was held at
the conference center of the new downtown Cathedral of Our Lady of
the Angeles. The meeting was closed to the public and press, but
several priests offered accounts of the discussions, generally doing
so only on condition that they remain anonymous.</LD>
<TE>   Calling Mahony's management style "paternalistic" and
"unilateral," one group of priests challenged the archdiocese's
assertion that the $4.3 million in budget cuts ordered last month had
nothing to do with the $189.5-million cathedral, which was dedicated
last month.</TE>
<TE>   Strains Credibility</TE>
<TE>   "It strains the credibility we have with our people when we
dedicate a $189-million cathedral--rejoicing that it is fully
funded--and, one week later, declare that 60 lay and religious
employees must be let go because we have not planned wisely enough to
raise the $4 million needed to fund their ministries to prisoners,
ethnic minorities, gay and lesbian outreach, and religious education
to children," Msgr. Timothy Dyer, pastor of Nativity Church in South
Los Angeles, told Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   As he read the prepared statement, a copy of which was provided to
The Times, eight to 12 priests stood beside him to lend moral
support.</TE>
<TE>   Two other groups of priests rose during the meeting to protest
cuts in the church's Latino ministry and its detention ministry for
people in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he could not restore the cuts without hurting still
other ministries, Tod Tamberg, the spokesman for the archdiocese,
said afterward. Falling investment income from a downturn in the
stock market and the need to plan for unknown future costs of sexual
abuse cases resulted a budget "emergency," Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Some priests said that clergy in the archdiocese have in the past
been notably less assertive in their relations with the hierarchy
than their brethren in other cities, including Chicago and Boston.
Tamberg disagreed, saying that Los Angeles priests have long been
"straightforward" in their comments to Mahony, which he said Mahony
has welcomed.</TE>
<TE>   But "this has been a troubled year for everyone in the church. The
cardinal has felt it and so have the priests," Tamberg said.
"Certainly there are people who got up and said things that are very
straightforward and very critical of the cardinal's leadership. The
cardinal has let them speak, and where he needed to, made responses."</TE>
<TE>   One priest, who spoke on condition that his name not be used,
chose less diplomatic language. "We are practically at a
gnashing-of-teeth place. There's a great deal of anger," the priest
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is kind of wondering what is going to happen next on so
many levels. Finance is part of it. Morale is a significant issue.
There is a feeling the priests just don't feel they can trust the
church right now."</TE>
<TE>   Burning Issues</TE>
<TE>   A second priest, who also asked to remain anonymous, said Monday's
meeting was unlike any in years past. "The urgency with which we have
come together is different. There are burning issues before us."</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks leading up to Monday's meeting, groups of priests
began meeting among themselves and drafting statements to be
presented to Mahony. In one case, a telephone conference call was set
up to discuss cuts in prison ministries.</TE>
<TE>   "We're usually lone rangers," a third priest said before the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "There exists at the present time a sense of distance from the
archbishop," said another priest. He said Mahony must convince his
priests "that he can continue to journey with us--not against us or
over us--but with us."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the talk at Monday's meeting involved budget cuts at the
Archdiocesan Catholic Center, the headquarters office in the
Mid-Wilshire district.</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. David O'Connell, pastor of St. Francis X. Cabrini Church in
South Los Angeles, said there had been little or no consultation with
priests, priests councils, or regional bishops and laity in the
nation's largest Roman Catholic archdiocese before the budget was
cut. Seven ministry offices are being closed. Among them are
ministries to ethnic groups, gays and lesbians, ecumenical and
inter-religious affairs, as well as anti-abortion efforts and campus
ministries at headquarters. The detention ministry headquarters
staff, which serves prisoners, is being cut by half.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell said that cuts in the prison ministries were especially
galling.</TE>
<TE>   "We just think that decision went against our values as to what
we're supposed to stand for as a church," he said in an interview.
"I'm hearing from South Los Angeles priests who are very concerned
about cuts for detention ministries. It affects an awful lot of
families in our area, and it's a ministry that is vitally necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Other priests are concerned about cutbacks in the African American
ministry. "That's a population that has really not got a good deal
from the church in the past," O'Connell said. "Historically, they
have been discriminated against and felt alienated in many ways by
the Catholic Church."</TE>
<TE>   The priests called on the cardinal to restore the cuts until "a
truly collaborative process" can be established.</TE>
<TE>   A Latino priest, who asked to remain anonymous, added, "We can't
believe that an archdiocese that is 80% Hispanic doesn't have an
office for Hispanic ministry."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has long been open to the points of views of priests,
O'Connell said, but he said priests have until now have remained
largely silent.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we're growing up a bit here," O'Connell said. "It is time
for us to accept our responsibility to speak up and say to the
cardinal, 'We disagree with this or think this is not well done.' "</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, O'Connell said Mahony had offered rational responses to
the priests' statements but "didn't feel the pain."</TE>

<HD>Disney Hopes Bugs Are Just the Ticket for Lagging
Attendance</HD>
<DH>Theme parks: The new California Adventure venue for young
kids is based on animated film.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Signaling a significant shift for its low-drawing California
Adventure amusement park in Anaheim, Disney officials on Monday
opened a new kid-friendly attraction based on the popular "A Bug's
Life" animated movie and announced plans for a spring stage show
based on the "Playhouse Disney" television show.</LD>
<LD>   Disney officials described the new attractions, along with the
Tower of Terror ride being built for a 2004 opening, as part of a
general and long-running evolution of its amusement parks.</LD>
<LD>   "We're hoping with the addition of 'a bug's land' and Tower of
Terror, and with continuing creative development, that Disneyland
Resorts will continue to grow and prosper," Disney chief Michael
Eisner told employees, invited guests and California Adventure
patrons. "I'm unbelievably enthusiastic about what's going on down
here."</LD>
<TE>   Yet the new "a bug's land" amusement is tacit recognition that
Disney's initial plan for an adult-friendly, "edgy" amusement center
adjoining Disneyland has not worked out the way the entertainment
giant would have liked.</TE>
<TE>   And the spring "Playhouse Disney--Live on Stage" show will extend
Disney's overtures to young families--a demographic group noticeably
absent since the 55-acre California Adventure opened in February
2001, and which has failed to meet initial attendance projections of
30,000 people per day.</TE>
<TE>   California Adventure's woes stem in part from bad timing. Part of
Disney's $1.4-billion expansion of the Disneyland Resort, California
Adventure, opened at the beginning of a national economic recession
exacerbated by the Sept. 11 terror attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Little of that was on the minds of hundreds of youngsters and
their families who defied a sweltering sun Monday morning to pour
into the new Flik's Fun Fair, based on the award-winning "A Bug's
Life," which had merged with the existing It's Tough to Be a Bug and
Beautiful Valley Farm attractions to create "a bug's land."</TE>
<TE>   Opening through a gigantic gate resembling a cereal box, the new
attraction unfolds like a bug's-eye view of the world, with 24-foot
clovers towering overhead, benches made of overlarge Popsicle
sticks--complete with stains--and refreshment stands made from
out-sized juice boxes, including massive plastic straws.</TE>
<TE>   The rides follow the same theme and scale. Cars are patterned
after ladybugs and Chinese takeout boxes, roly-poly bugs and a
caterpillar, each drawn from characters in the computer-generated "A
Bug's Life."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad they've added the small rides," said Jennifer Allen, 29,
of San Diego, who was viewing the new attraction with her husband,
Rob, 33, and their daughter Brittney, 3. "We didn't come here before
because there were not a lot of small rides, and she's too short for
all of them but the carousel."</TE>
<TE>   Eisner and other Disney officials stressed that the new Flik's Fun
Fair embraces the best traditions of founder Walt Disney by designing
amusements that bring young visitors in touch with themes and
characters from wide-release Disney movies.</TE>
<TE>   While a staple at other Disney theme parks, that indelible Disney
tattoo had been missing from California Adventure, which re-creates
myriad elements of California, from Monterey Bay wharves to the
gardens of the Central Valley--"not very Disneyish," said one parent.</TE>
<TE>   The new attraction changes that.</TE>
<TE>   "The rides are really cute," said Alyssa Hansen, 9, of Irvine
moments after alighting from Heimlich's Chew Chew Train caterpillar
ride through a forest of food--including a watermelon rind that drips
"juice" and smells like the real thing.</TE>
<TE>   "I like that they've done this--it seems more like traditional
Disney," added her mother, Janice Hansen, 37, who waited in line 90
minutes with her two daughters to be among the first people to enter
the new attraction.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will encourage families with young children to come
here," she said. "I think [Disney officials] listened to what the
people said they wanted."</TE>

<HD>Feeling Heat, YMCA Reopens Saunas</HD>
<DH>Fitness: New safety procedures begin in response to
concerns about health risks that had prompted closures.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tossing in the towel, YMCA officials have reopened steam rooms and
saunas they ordered "permanently" closed 3 1/2 months ago at Los
Angeles-area workout centers.</LD>
<LD>   "We backed off," said Larry Rosen, president and chief executive
of the YMCA of Metropolitan Los Angeles, withdrawing an
administrative order that shuttered the saunas and steam rooms June
18.</LD>
<LD>   The shutdown was triggered by the YMCA's concerns over the health
and safety of its members, and by a sauna-sparked fire that caused $1
million damage June 4 to the Westchester YMCA.</LD>
<TE>   "These facilities will not reopen ... this order will not be
withdrawn," Rosen said at the time, explaining that the fire "is but
the latest in a long list of problems involving these superheated
environments."</TE>
<TE>   But the closures left YMCA members hot under the collar. Hundreds
tendered their resignations, and thousands of others signed petitions
condemning the loss of the saunas.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the West Los Angeles YMCA created a protest Web site.
Hollywood YMCA members attracted international news coverage by
picketing their branch clad only in towels.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen said new safety procedures are being used at the reopened
steam and sauna facilities at branches in downtown Los Angeles,
Hollywood, San Pedro, South-Central Los Angeles, Torrance and West
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Downey YMCA has not yet decided whether to restore the
facilities, and administrators at the Westchester branch--where fire
repairs are still being made--have scrapped the sauna and steam room.
"The volunteer leadership of each of the branches reminded me they
are as interested in health and safety as I am," Rosen said.</TE>
<TE>   He credited Hollywood YMCA leaders with setting sauna safety
standards that were tried in a three-month test that started there in
mid-July. The procedures are now being implemented at the other
branches.</TE>
<TE>   The new standards are designed to prevent workout center members
from lingering too long in the 104-degree heat. They include visual
inspections of the rooms every 15 minutes by staff members, and new
member education materials that warn of the potential health hazards
to those with such ailments as heart disease and high blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the branches have installed flashing 10-minute timer
lights. Others have installed coverings over heater coils to prevent
burns and accidental fires.</TE>
<TE>   The fire in Westchester was caused by a towel touching a heater.
Operating hours also have been altered so heaters cool down before
the fitness centers close for the night. Sauna facilities at the
Hollywood YMCA, for example, close at 9 p.m., two hours before the
gym closes.</TE>
<TE>   Member Jackson Sleet said members are pleased that the saunas have
reopened. "We're still patting ourselves on the back," said Sleet, a
Silver Lake teacher and actor who was among those picketing in
towels. "It wasn't my nudity on TV that got them turned back on. We
had close to 2,500 names on a petition. Close to 100 had quit at my
Y. When they turned it back on, it was like going back to heaven."</TE>

<HD>Secession Foes Lead in Funding</HD>
<DH>Cityhood: The gap is wide as Mayor Hahn's L.A. United group
raised $2.86 million in recent reporting period. Valley camp took in
$471,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY and JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession drive reported Monday that it
had raised more than $4.7 million, mostly in large donations from
business interests and labor unions, for a television, radio and mail
blitz in the final weeks of the campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The San Fernando Valley independence campaign reported that it had
raised $546,883, as of Sept. 30. It said the contributions had come
from 797 individuals. The Hollywood secession effort reported raising
$585,326, 90% of it from the campaign leader, Gene La Pietra,
spokesman Geoffrey Garfield said.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the Valley nor the Hollywood secession committee released
a donor list Monday. Both said they were still compiling the lists,
which were due to be mailed by day's end to the city Ethics
Commission.</LD>
<TE>   The Hahn camp's huge financial advantage had many political
observers saying the secession measures face long odds to win passage
Nov. 5, unless breakup advocates can mount a broad volunteer
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The people against secession will have a louder bullhorn than the
people for it," said a Republican political consultant, Allan
Hoffenblum. "When the maverick goes up against the establishment,
it's hard to raise money."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's campaign committee reported raising $2.86 million during
the most recent period, from July 1 to Sept. 30. In comparison, the
Valley campaign raised $471,000 during that period. It also amassed
$102,000 in debts.</TE>
<TE>   The Hahn campaign, which received major contributions from
business and union supporters, ended the period with $3.3 million in
the bank.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley Independence Committee had $222,000 on hand for the
last push toward election day.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders said they were not discouraged by the money gap,
even though they once vowed to raise $4 million to $5 million. They
noted that the Valley and Hollywood campaigns, along with those of
the candidates seeking office in the proposed cities, have raised a
combined $1.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not disappointing because it is $546,000 from the people,
instead of $4.7 million from special interests and downtown power
brokers," said Carlos Ferreyra, co-chairman of the Valley
Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "This mayor sold his soul to them. He is going to owe these people
after the election," Ferreyra said.</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, an advisor to Hahn, said the money raised so far puts
the campaign on track to begin a major media campaign against
secession.</TE>
<TE>   "We now have to execute our game plan," Kuwata said.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about Ferreyra's comment about special interests,
Kuwata noted that La Pietra has said he has put $1.6 million into the
secession effort, including payment for a study that placed the
breakup question on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "The pro-secession side has a nightclub owner who has said he will
spend whatever it takes," Kuwata said. "We don't have someone like
that."</TE>
<TE>   Top contributors to Hahn's anti-secession campaign during the last
period include the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees, based in Washington, D.C., which contributed $250,000;
Univision Chairman Jerry Perenchio's Living Trust, which gave
$200,000; United Firefighters of Los Angeles, which gave $200,000;
and the Los Angeles Police Protective League, which gave $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a vested interest in controlling City Hall," Ferreyra
said.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign also received contributions from Beverly Hills
Construction Management, which gave $100,000; developers Castle and
Cook Inc., which gave $100,000; HNTB Corp., which gave $75,000.; the
L.A. Arena Co., which gave $50,000; the Anschutz Corp., which gave
$50,000; the Los Angeles Business Advisors, who gave $50,000; and Eli
Broad, chairman of Sun America, who gave $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Broad's contribution brought to $151,935 the total he has given to
the anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Other major contributions include $25,000 each from Oaktree
Capital Management LLC, Occidental Petroleum Corp., Paramount
Pictures Group, Parsons Corp., Sony Pictures and Local 347 of the
Service Employees International Union, which represents about 10,000
blue-collar employees of the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks studio partners--Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg
and David Geffen--together gave about $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   Airport Commission President Ted Stein held a fund-raiser for the
campaign, and several firms that do business at city airports also
have contributed to the campaign. They include Super Shuttle Los
Angeles Inc., Mini-Bus Systems Inc., Mercury Air Group Inc., Marriott
International and Joseph Lyons of FS Group.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the campaign received several contributions from
lobbyists and city commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   Firms regulated by City Hall that contributed included American
Outdoor Advertising Co., AT &amp; T Broadband and Regency Outdoor
Advertising.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign also reported receiving a total of $25,000 from the
Entertainment Industry Development Corp., but Hahn recently announced
he was returning the money to the film-permit agency, which is under
investigation by the district attorney for its spending practices.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's committee reported paying $1 million to Morris and Carrick
Inc. for TV air time and production costs.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's L.A. United campaign is one of 14 committees formed to
support or oppose Valley and Hollywood secession measures on the Nov.
5 ballot. Besides Hahn's campaign, others against secession raised
more than $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   The largest anti-secession committee besides Hahn's is one put
together by Hollywood area Councilmen Tom LaBonge and Eric Garcetti.
Their I Love L.A., No on Measures F and H Committee reported raising
$145,950 and, at the end of the period, had about half in the bank.</TE>
<TE>   That committee received $5,000 each from Broad, Police Commission
President Rick Caruso, Forest Lawn Mortuary, Majestic Realty Inc. and
Los Angeles Marathon Inc. It also received $10,000 each from former
mayor Richard Riordan and the Los Angeles Police Protective League.</TE>
<TE>   Another campaign committee was formed by Council President Alex
Padilla to target Valley Latinos, and reported raising $62,500,
including $5,000 each from Broad and developers Henry Cisneros and
Robert Voit.</TE>
<TE>   City Council members and City Hall lobbyists formed the Public
Safety Coalition, No on F, which reported Monday that it had raised
$59,750 during the period ending Sept. 30, and had $76,000 in the
bank.</TE>
<TE>   A campaign committee formed by Councilman Nick Pacheco called One
LA for Everyone reported raising $7,000.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold Steinberg, who formerly advised the secessionists, said the
recent resignation of consulting firm Goddard Claussen Porter and
Novelli from the breakup campaign probably hurt fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   "When you don't have consultants putting together a viable
strategy, you don't attract money," Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   In the race for mayor of the Valley city, Assemblyman Keith
Richman (R-Northridge) reported raising $127,533, including about
$60,000 that he transferred from his Assembly reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Richman reported having about $37,000 in the bank at the end of
the period.</TE>
<TE>   Mel Wilson, a real estate agent and another leading candidate for
Valley mayor, said he had raised about $48,000.</TE>

<HD>Fatal Police Gunfire Probed</HD>
<DH>Shooting: Authorities are investigating whether killing of
suspected car thief by Redondo Beach officer after high-speed chase
was accidental.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles authorities are investigating whether a Redondo Beach
police officer accidentally killed a suspected car thief by mistaking
a shotgun for a beanbag stun gun, law enforcement sources said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The 40-year-old man was shot to death after a high-speed pursuit
through several South Bay cities late Sunday, police said. The
pursuit, which began in Redondo Beach, came to a halt when the driver
of a stolen sport-utility vehicle hit a curb just south of Los
Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   "At the termination of the pursuit, a police officer fired his
weapon, striking the suspect," said Redondo Beach Police Sgt. Phil
Keenan. "The suspect was declared dead at the scene."</LD>
<TE>   No weapons were found on the man or inside the vehicle, Keenan
said. The man's name was being withheld Monday by the Los Angeles
County Coroner's office, pending the notification of his family.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement sources said a preliminary investigation suggests
the Redondo Beach officer may have discharged the wrong shotgun.
Instead of grabbing a weapon loaded with a "less lethal" beanbag
round, sources said, the officer fired a shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach police declined to say what the driver did to prompt
the use of force.</TE>
<TE>   Keenan said he could not comment on the beanbag weapons used by
the department because the comment would relate to the investigation
of the killing.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting is being investigated by both the Los Angeles Police
Department's Robbery Homicide Division and the district attorney's
office. Robbery homicide detectives said they would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   "We rolled on it, and it's under investigation," said the district
attorney's spokeswoman, Sandi Gibbons. A prosecutor and an
investigator went to the scene of the shooting at Imperial Highway
and Sepulveda Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach police declined Monday to identify the officer who
was involved in the shooting. Keenan said, in accordance with
department policy, the officer was removed from active patrol and was
undergoing counseling.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Steve Ijames of the Springfield, Mo., Police Department, an
expert in less-than-lethal arms, said deadly mistakes are rare.
Typically, he said, squad cars either carry two different weapons or
a single shotgun that shoots both deadly rounds and beanbag
projectiles. Departments that employ two guns usually identify them
with painted stocks or other markers, Ijames said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, a SWAT team deputy for Contra Costa County fired a
shotgun round meant to blast through door locks and bolts instead of
a beanbag round, killing a 42-year-old man.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday night's pursuit began when Redondo Beach police received a
call at 6:50 p.m. about a reckless motorist driving north on Pacific
Coast Highway in a 1992 Ford Bronco. The vehicle had been reported
stolen in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Officers spotted the Bronco headed north on Sepulveda Boulevard in
Manhattan Beach. When officers tried to persuade the driver to pull
over, he stopped momentarily and then sped away, Keenan said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver led police on a high-speed chase north through El
Segundo. He then turned west onto Imperial Highway and crashed into
the curb, leaving the SUV disabled, Keenan said. At least three
Redondo Beach police cars were involved in the pursuit.</TE>

<HD>Davis Is Accused of Accepting Improper Donation; Aide and
Alleged Witness Reject Fund Accusation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A political organization that has endorsed Republican Bill Simon
Jr.'s gubernatorial candidacy charged Monday that it gave a $10,000
donation to Gov. Gray Davis in his Capitol office four years ago,
while he was lieutenant governor. It's an allegation that, if true,
would amount to a misdemeanor for both Davis and the contributor.</LD>
<LD>   The charge elicited sharp denials from Davis' top campaign aide,
Garry South, and from the man alleged to have presented the check
from the California Organization of Police and Sheriffs. South said
the organization had presented the campaign check at Davis' campaign
office, which would have been legal, and not on state property.</LD>
<LD>   Simon raised the issue in the first and likely the only debate of
the 2002 campaign, when he asked Davis on statewide television
whether the incumbent Democrat had ever accepted a campaign donation
while in a state office. Davis said he recalled no such incident.</LD>
<TE>   "In your career," Simon asked, "have you ever accepted a campaign
contribution in the state Capitol or in any of your government
offices?"</TE>
<TE>   "I have conducted myself within the law," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon assured reporters after the debate that he had evidence of
such conduct. But the Simon campaign presented no proof Monday.
Rather, it passed out a letter from a law firm that represents the
organization to the California Fair Political Practices Commission,
which enforces campaign finance law.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, attorney Thomas W. Hiltachk, whose firm also has
represented the California Republican Party, says the group's current
leaders believe the previous executive, Al Angele and others,
"unwittingly violated" the law by "delivering a $10,000 contribution
check" to then-Lt. Gov. Davis in what at the time was Davis' Capitol
office.</TE>
<TE>   "We also believe that Mr. Garry South was present with Gov. Davis
at the time the check was presented to Gov. Davis by Mr. Angele," the
letter says. South said he recalled the meeting on Jan. 31, 1998, and
insisted it had taken place in Davis' Los Angeles campaign office,
where such political activity would have been legal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a lie," South said. "We never had meetings in the
lieutenant governor's office."</TE>
<TE>   Angele, former director of the organization, also denounced the
charge.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been in Gray Davis' [government] office," Angele said.
He said the charge comes "out of left field," adding that newspapers
"couldn't print" his true reaction.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar labeled the allegation
"categorically false," and "possibly slanderous."</TE>
<TE>   The California Organization of Police and Sheriffs represents
about 5,000 officers, its lobbyist William Hemby said earlier this
year. The group broke with Davis this year, deciding instead to
endorse Simon. At the time, its executive director, Monte Holden, was
a Davis appointee to a commission that sets standards for police
officer training. Davis did not reappoint Holden.</TE>
<TE>   The organization donated $19,000 to Davis' 1998 gubernatorial
campaign, including the $10,000 check on Jan. 31, 1998. After
assuming office in 1999, Davis appointed Angele to the Board of
Prison Terms, a post that pays $99,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   A 1978 state law says anyone who gives a campaign donation and any
official who accepts a campaign check while on state property is
guilty of a misdemeanor. A politician convicted of such a crime would
be barred from seeking office for four years.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Barankin, spokesman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, said he
doubted there could be a prosecution, even if the allegation were
true. The law says any violation must be prosecuted within four
years.</TE>
<TE>   "If this occurred in January of 1998," Barankin said, "there is no
possibility of bringing a criminal action against anyone after
January of 2002."</TE>
<TE>   Barankin noted that the Fair Political Practices Commission can
levy fines for as long as five years for violations of the Political
Reform Act. The commission declined comment.</TE>

<HD>Site Found Too Toxic for Santa Ana Unified Campus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Soil samples from a proposed school site at the former Tustin Marine
base showed unacceptably high levels of toxic substances, including
metals and cancer-causing chemicals, according to an environmental
report released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The report, first acknowledged by officials last week, puts in
doubt plans for a combined elementary and middle school campus by the
Santa Ana Unified School District for 22 acres at the corner of Red
Hill and Warner avenues.</LD>
<LD>   The land was part of a settlement reached in May between the city
of Tustin and the district after years of legal wrangling over use of
the former helicopter base, which closed in 1991. Under terms of its
deal with the Navy to redevelop the land, Tustin was required to
share some of it with other local agencies, including the Santa Ana
school district.</LD>
<TE>   Recognizing the potential for toxic hazards, the city agreed to
pay $22 million if the district deemed the land too contaminated for
a school campus.</TE>
<TE>   The new findings make it likely the district will choose the money
instead of the land. The Santa Ana school board will meet tonight to
discuss its options.</TE>
<TE>   According to the environmental report, portions of the lot have an
"unacceptable level of risk associated with the presence of metals in
soils." Consultants hired by the district also found the carcinogen
vinyl chloride and suspected cancer-causing agent tetrachloroethene
on the 22-acre lot.</TE>
<TE>   They also did a visual survey of the underground sewer drain and
found a "significant number of breaks," which increases the
likelihood of soil contamination.</TE>
<TE>   The extent of the contamination could not be determined because
the survey was only a preliminary study of a limited number of soil
samples, but it is clear the district will have to clean up the site
before building a school.</TE>
<TE>   The 62,000-student district is one of the most crowded in the
state and in desperate need of land for new schools.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin officials indicated last week that they may not be able to
issue a letter of credit to back the $22-million cash option, which
may complicate the settlement agreement. But Santa Ana school
officials Monday expressed optimism that a satisfactory arrangement
will be made.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very comfortable working with Tustin," school board
president John Palacio said.</TE>

<HD>Valley Secessionists Air First TV Commercial</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Low-budget ad is produced by a city council
candidate. Meanwhile, business leaders vow to spur redevelopment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nudging the campaign to break up Los Angeles forward on a shoestring,
San Fernando Valley secessionists on Monday began airing their first
television commercial, a low-budget cable spot that says City Hall
ignores local needs.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, a group of local business leaders who have long
pushed for secession vowed to help an independent Valley city use
redevelopment money to build industrial parks throughout the area and
expand commercial space on Ventura Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   The TV ad was produced by a secession supporter, Garrett Biggs,
who is running for a seat on the city council that would be created
if the Valley became a city.</LD>
<TE>   Biggs, who donated most of the work, cobbled the spot together
from footage of a commercial he filmed for his own campaign. He also
has produced a second spot for the secession drive, but the San
Fernando Valley Independence Committee, which is running the
campaign, has not yet decided whether to use it or one of its own.
The Independence Committee has budgeted $150,000 for one or both
spots.</TE>
<TE>   The first ad shows a Valley resident petitioning an indifferent
city council with complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "Council members, if you please, I'd like to talk to you about the
poor services we receive in the Valley. From street repairs to cops
on the streets, we're not getting our money's worth from City Hall,"
the man in the commercial says, as actors portraying council members
joke among themselves.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the ad, the Valley resident asks, "Is anybody
listening?" The camera cuts to one council member's notes, which turn
out to be a crossword puzzle with the word "Disenfranchise"
highlighted.</TE>
<TE>   The second spot shows several city council members gathered in a
small room.</TE>
<TE>   "How much can we take from the Valley this year?" one asks.</TE>
<TE>   Biggs estimated that the first commercial will reach about 200,000
homes, but said it may not be shown outside the Valley. He said there
are no plans yet to buy time on more-expensive broadcast TV stations.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-secession campaign led by Mayor James K. Hahn is
preparing to launch a multimillion-dollar ad blitz that will include
broadcast TV.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a coalition of Valley business leaders said a new city
would bring in more investment, increase sales-tax revenues and cut
business taxes in half.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lack of interest on the part of the city of Los
Angeles in attracting businesses," said Bill Allen, former president
of the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Blighted or abandoned areas should be used for industrial parks,
Allen said, with more police patrols to show potential tenants that
their employees would be safe.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be able to announce that we're open for business again
in the San Fernando Valley," said Bill Powers, chairman of the San
Fernando Valley United Chambers of Commerce. Powers and others in the
group expressed confidence that they would have enough influence with
a Valley city to see the tax-cutting, business-promoting policies
carried out.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working on this for six years," said Jeff Brain,
president of the secession group Valley VOTE. "Do you really think
that in our own city we wouldn't have any influence?"</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Hollywood secessionists announced several
endorsements that they said would help build support for their cause
among African Americans in South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The endorsements came from Daude Sherrills of Watts, who helped
negotiate a truce between members of the Bloods and Crips gangs in
1992; Eunice Carr, executive director of the Black American Political
Assn. of California, a group that claims 60,000 members; the Rev. Lee
P. James, a chaplain for the association; and the Rev. Waymon Baker
of New Pleasant Hill Church.</TE>
<TE>   Sherrills said South Los Angeles could gain from the millions of
dollars in alimony that Hollywood and the Valley would have to pay
the city if secession passes. "That could bring in much-needed
services that South Los Angeles has been crying out for," he said.</TE>

<LD>The City Council tonight is expected to approve a master plan for a
$15-million makeover of College Park.</LD>
<LD>   If approved, one of the farmhouses used by a drug and treatment
facility would be converted into a museum dedicated to the county's
agricultural history.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the Rainbow Recovery Center, which has treated women
in Oxnard for 17 years, have protested their forced relocation,
saying it will be difficult to find a new site. In the past several
weeks, city officials have been working to find another site for the
center. If the master plan is approved, the Rainbow Recovery Center
must move by January 2004, city officials said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget the hot dogs and the bagels, the chiles and the oranges.
That's way too easy. Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly and Minneapolis Mayor
R.T. Rybak have upped the ante on friendly wagers.</LD>
<LD>   Depending on the outcome of the American League Championship
Series between the Angels and the Minnesota Twins, which starts
today, one mayor will have to toss his dignity out the window.</LD>
<LD>   "Because we beat the Yankees so soundly, I told [Rybak] I thought
the Angels should be favored over the Twins. He didn't disagree,"
Daly said. "I think he'd look pretty cute in Mickey Mouse ears."</LD>
<TE>   Rybak is equally certain Daly will be wearing a Twins jersey and a
hunting cap a la Elmer Fudd. (Incidentally, the headwear must be worn
for one entire day--even to important city meetings.)</TE>
<TE>   "When the Twins win, he will not only wear a Twins jersey, but a
'Fargo'-styled hat with the ear flaps," Rybak said. "I could even
have him up the stakes because I am so confident the Twins are going
to win."</TE>
<TE>   The two mayors on Monday took to Minneapolis airwaves on WCCO-AM
radio to make their friendly wager official.</TE>
<TE>   They agreed on the usual gift baskets: chiles and oranges from
Anaheim; beer, tea and Pillsbury flour from Minneapolis. But both
agreed they should make things a little more interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Rybak complained that his bet with Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown was
"pretty lame." Brown now owes him a gondola ride though Rybak said he
doesn't plan to cash in.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Anaheim awaits its shipment of hot dogs and bagels from
New York City.</TE>

<LD>If you drive a red car, you are more likely to get cited for speeding

<LD>   If you hang a compact disc from your rearview mirror, police radar
guns won't be able to track your speed.</LD>

<TE>   For decades, such tales have been circulated by word of mouth. But
today the Internet has provided an electronic medium to transmit and

avoiding tickets and breathless warnings about horrible dangers on
the open road.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Mikkelson, who operates an Internet listing of urban
folklore (www.snopes.com), said bogus tales about cars and driving
are rampant on the Web. "It reflects what's going on in our lives,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   For police and folklore experts like Mikkelson, knocking down
driving myths can be like trying to shove toothpaste back into the
tube.</TE>
<TE>   For example, police say motorists repeatedly ask them to address
this frightening story:</TE>
<TE>   Street gangs have initiated new members by sending them into the
streets with their headlights off and ordering them to shoot any
motorist who flashes his headlights.</TE>
<TE>   "This rumor comes around every year, and has for the last several
years," said Wes McBride, president of the California Gang
Investigators Assn. "It is not true and never was."</TE>
<TE>   But don't be too quick to dismiss outlandish-sounding tales. A few
tales circulating on the Internet are based on fact. Consider the
often-heard warning that static electricity generated when a motorist
gets in or out of a car can spark a fire at a gas station.</TE>
<TE>   The American Petroleum Institute and the Petroleum Equipment
Institute issued a press release last month, alerting motorists to
the potential for fires caused by static electricity. The press
release even warned that "static season" is in the fall, when cool,
dry air is more conducive to static electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Hahn, a spokeswoman for the petroleum institute, put the
threat in perspective. She said Americans fill up with gas 11 billion
times a year and static electricity has been blamed for 34 fires in
the last three years. "It's rare but it happens," she said.</TE>
<TE>   As for the rumor that cellular phones can cause fires at gas
stations, Hahn said the institute has been unable to confirm any such
incident.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, bogus tales are passed along as legitimate news
stories.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the tale of the two hunters who were driving at night
when their headlight fuse burned out. The men discovered that they
could replace the fuse with a .22-caliber bullet. The story goes that
the bullet heated up and fired, striking one of the men in the
testicles.</TE>
<TE>   Mikkelson found this bogus story circulated on the Internet in
1996 and written to look like an article from the Arkansas
Democrat-Gazette. The newspaper ran a story that year denying that it
had ever published such an article.</TE>
<TE>   Here is one that is part truth, part bunk:</TE>
<TE>   It is true that the reflective freeway markers--known as Botts
Dots--were named for a Caltrans scientist, Elbert D. Botts. He did
not become filthy rich because of the invention, however. Botts died
in 1961, five years before the dots became a required fixture on
California freeways.</TE>
<TE>   The following myth falls under the category of a red herring:</TE>
<TE>   Red cars get more speeding tickets than cars painted other colors.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol dismisses this folklore, saying
there is no data to support it.</TE>
<TE>   "Yellow or red or other bright colors can get an officer's
attention, but it doesn't mean they get more tickets," said CHP
Officer Luis Mendoza.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of what color car you drive, police say, you cannot
deflect the radio waves from a police radar gun by hanging a compact
disc from your rearview mirror.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Kevin Custard of the Los Angeles Police Department's central
traffic division said this myth defies science.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a neat one," he said with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   Some myths are so egregiously harmful that transportation
officials have launched extensive campaigns to debunk them.</TE>
<TE>   Police say they routinely hear motorists say they don't wear seat
belts because they worry about being trapped underwater or engulfed
in flames.</TE>
<TE>   The California Driver's Handbook notes that if your car slams into
a body of water, your seat belt will keep you from being knocked
unconscious so you can unbuckle the belt and swim out.</TE>
<TE>   Your chances of being killed or injured are reduced by 45% if you
wear a seat belt, according to federal studies.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most stubborn--yet most entertaining--urban legend
regarding the car is the tale of the escaped convict who kills with a
stainless steel hook that he wears instead of a hand.</TE>
<TE>   The story goes that a young couple parked in a secluded spot hears
about the killer on the radio. The girl insists on going home,
prompting the frustrated boy to speed away. When they arrive at the
girl's house, the boy goes to open the car door for his date, and
finds a bloody hook hanging from the door handle.</TE>
<TE>   The story has made its way into several cheesy slasher movies and
was even published in a letter to Dear Abby.</TE>
<TE>   Great story except that Mikkelson, the urban folklore expert, said
there has never been a documented account of an escaped killer with a
hook for a hand.</TE>
<TE>   She suggests that the story was originally circulated as a way for
parents to keep their teens in line.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny--teens won't listen when you say don't have sex, but
they will listen if you tell them about lurking madmen," Mikkelson
said.</TE>

<HD>Man Is Guilty of Killing His Daughter, Grandson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In less than an hour Monday, a San Fernando jury convicted a
61-year-old man of two counts of first-degree murder in the fatal
shootings of his 19-year-old daughter and 8-year-old grandson last
year in his Sylmar home.</LD>
<LD>   Claude Wright, an Air Force veteran, was also found guilty of
twice discharging a firearm, causing death.</LD>
<LD>   Wright is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 28 by Los Angeles County
Superior Court Judge Warren G. Greene. Because Wright was found
guilty of multiple murders, he faces an automatic sentence of life in
prison without parole.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said Wright shot his grandson, Kyle, four times in the
chest on July 12, 2001. He also fatally shot his daughter--Kyle's
aunt--Elizabeth, who was home from college on summer break. He then
shot himself but survived a bullet wound in the head.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn McNary played a tape
of a message that Wright left for his wife. "He said he was just
tired of Kyle and Elizabeth and didn't want them in his house any
longer," McNary said.</TE>
<TE>   She also quoted Wright as saying: "I took them out and I'm going
to take myself out too. I'll see you in hell."</TE>
<TE>   In the hospital emergency room, Wright told the medical staff,
including a radiologist, that he had killed his daughter and
grandson, McNary said.</TE>
<TE>   A patrol officer captured that conversation on a tape that also
was played to jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities had placed Kyle in his grandparents' home after his
mother, Wright's other daughter, Christa, was convicted of child
abuse, McNary said.</TE>

<HD>Bush Tells Nation the Threat by Iraq Is 'Simply Too Great'</HD>
<DH>A New U.S. Policy on Iraq Built on the Horrors of Sept. 11</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When President Bush addressed the nation about Iraq on Monday night,
it took only a few moments for him to play his strongest card.</LD>
<LD>   Barely a few breaths into the speech, he linked the potential
threat posed by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to the unprecedented
losses suffered by America in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "We ... must never forget the most vivid events of recent
history," Bush declared. "We resolved then, and we are resolved
today, to confront every threat, from any source, that could bring
sudden terror and suffering to America."</LD>
<TE>   With that, Bush demonstrated how the attacks restructured the
national security debate in America--and created almost irresistible
political momentum behind his push to confront Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as if handing down an indictment, Bush on Monday night
systematically laid out for the public the most detailed inventory
yet of Iraq's progress in developing chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons, its links to terrorist organizations and Hussein's crimes
against his own population.</TE>
<TE>   But these particulars were not the core of his argument. Instead,
Bush repeatedly suggested that what is known about Iraq is less
important than what isn't known: whether Hussein might either seek to
use weapons of mass destruction directly against American interests
or provide them to terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not willing to stake one American life on trusting Saddam
Hussein," Bush insisted.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, most members of Congress in both parties now agree
with that statement, which is why a resolution authorizing the
president to use force against Iraq seems certain to pass the House
of Representatives and the Senate in the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   That's not because everyone agrees with the president.
Notwithstanding Bush's bill of particulars, there remains
disagreement in Congress about the imminence of the threat that Iraq
poses to U.S. security and the possible consequences of attacking
Hussein without broad international support.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush is in such a strong position on Capitol Hill because even
many legislators who don't believe that the threat is immediate
accept another argument the president stressed Monday night: that
after last year's attacks, the United States can no longer afford to
wait for conclusive proof of the danger from Iraq before acting.</TE>
<TE>   "Some citizens wonder: After 11 years of living with this problem,
why do we need to confront it now?" Bush said in a passage that
crystallized his argument. "There is a reason. We have experienced
the horror of Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   In a measured, unemotional tone, Bush sought to rebut the central
arguments that critics have raised against action in Iraq. Rather
than detracting from the war on terrorism, he argued, action against
Iraq is a critical component of it because of the risk that Hussein
might provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorists. Continued
measures meant to contain Iraq, such as renewed inspections under
existing U.N. rules, were inadequate, he insisted, because Hussein
has evaded all of them and has continued his biological, chemical and
nuclear programs.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the most striking passages, Bush, more than before,
tried to steel the public for the possibility that a war with Iraq
might not be as painless as the country's low-casualty engagements in
Afghanistan, Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina. "An Iraqi regime faced
with its own demise may attempt cruel and desperate measures," he
warned the public--before warning Iraq's military that it could face
war-crime prosecutions for attempting such actions.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech was an unusual use of the presidential bully pulpit.
Ordinarily, presidents use national addresses to mobilize public
support against a Congress blocking their initiatives. But, with
Congress already mostly behind Bush's course on Iraq, this speech
seemed more inclined toward solidifying support among the public for
a war that the president clearly seemed to believe was the likeliest
end point for the confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few weeks, polls have found general backing for
using force against Hussein, but enormous hesitance about doing so
without broad international support. "There is a lot of ambivalence
about doing it alone," said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press, a nonpartisan group
studying public opinion. "Almost all the polls show ... support for
the basic concept, but the big hurdle he has to jump is ... the
public doesn't want to see us do this alone."</TE>
<TE>   The contrast between the support in Congress and across the
country is striking. Over the last month, as Bush has more
emphatically pressed his case for action against Iraq, resistance has
dwindled in Congress; many observers expect virtually all Republicans
and as many as half or more of Democrats in both chambers to support
a resolution authorizing Bush to invade Iraq, with or without
international sanction.</TE>
<TE>   But public opinion hasn't grown warmer to the idea of war--and by
some measures has cooled. A CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll released just
before the speech Monday found support for sending ground troops to
remove Hussein slipping slightly to 53%, from 57% in September, CNN
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Other polls that have phrased the question slightly differently
have found higher and more consistent levels of support for war. In a
CBS/New York Times poll conducted late last week, for instance,
two-thirds of respondents--the same as in September--said they would
support "taking military action ... to try to remove Saddam Hussein
from power."</TE>
<TE>   That's a much higher level of public support for military
intervention than polls generally found before the Persian Gulf War
in 1991, when the United States intervened to remove Iraq from
Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   But, as Kohut notes, the surveys have found steady, and by some
accounts growing, concern about going to war without broad
international support. In a CNN/USA Today/Gallup survey last month,
three-fifths of Americans said they would oppose invading Iraq if the
U.S. had to act alone, or if the United Nations opposed the move.</TE>
<TE>   In the new CBS/New York Times poll, 63% of Americans said the U.S.
should give U.N. weapons inspections more time to work before
invading Iraq; that was up from 57% in September. Nearly two-thirds
also said the U.S. should wait for more support from its allies
before acting.</TE>
<TE>   Bush seemed acutely aware of those sentiments in his speech Monday
night. As he did in his address to the U.N., he declared his
intention to work through the world body if possible. And he tried to
reassure Americans that "if we have to act ... we will act with
allies at our side."</TE>
<TE>   But the driving force of Bush's argument was that after Sept. 11,
the dangers of not acting now look greater than the risks of acting.
Waiting before confronting Hussein, Bush said in a concluding
passage, is "the riskiest option of all" because it would leave open
the chance that Iraq could develop nuclear weapons or provide
biological and chemical weapons to terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "We refuse to live in fear," Bush declared in what might be the
most concise summary of why U.S. troops may soon be heading toward a
second Persian Gulf War.</TE>

<LD>Bell Labs will withdraw patent applications on work by a physicist
who was fired last month for falsifying a string of breakthrough
experiments in electronics.</LD>
<LD>   The research laboratory fired Jan Hendrik Schon on Sept. 24 after
a panel of outside experts concluded he had made up or altered
experimental data at least 16 times between 1998 and 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Bell Labs has begun notifying the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
and some foreign patent offices that it is withdrawing applications
for six patents, lab spokesman Saswato Das said in Trenton. "Bell
Labs takes matters of scientific integrity very seriously," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Schon's findings were published in about 80 scientific journals.</TE>

<HD>Bush Tells Nation the Threat by Iraq Is 'Simply Too Great'</HD>
<DH>Speech: Warning of a 'murderous tyrant,' the president
seeks to answer skepticism about why he wants to confront Saddam
Hussein now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>Courting public support for his campaign against Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, President Bush declared Monday that the Baghdad
regime "stands alone" as a threat to America because "it gathers the
most serious dangers of our age in one place."</LD>
<LD>   "The danger is already significant, and it only grows worse with
time," Bush warned as he sought to answer skepticism about why he
wants to confront Iraq now.</LD>
<LD>   He called Hussein "a murderous tyrant" with "an unrelenting
hostility" toward the United States. Asserting that evidence
"indicates that Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons programs,"
Bush said this risk "is simply too great that he will use [weapons of
mass destruction] or provide them to a terror network."</LD>
<TE>   Bush spoke slowly and deliberately to an audience at the
Cincinnati Museum Center as he summed up his case for coercing
Hussein to rid his country of its suspected weapons of mass
destruction or face a possible military attack. In his somber
address, which was televised by the cable news stations but not the
national networks, he also sought to painstakingly rebut a panoply of
what he conceded are "legitimate questions" about such an
undertaking.</TE>
<TE>   To a greater degree, Bush sought to tie the Al Qaeda network to
Hussein, noting that both "share a common enemy"--America--and that
their contacts "go back a decade." He said some Al Qaeda leaders have
fled from Afghanistan to Iraq and that "one very senior Al Qaeda
leader" received medical treatment in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   The president evoked the image of a nuclear holocaust to stress
his sense of urgency--and his determination to prevent Iraq from
getting a nuclear device. "We cannot wait for the final proof--the
smoking gun--that could come in the form of a mushroom cloud," Bush
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush conceded the possibility that a desperate Iraqi regime,
"faced with its own demise," could unleash its weapons of mass
destruction. He said Iraq has a fleet of airborne drones capable of
delivering biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   He issued an appeal to Hussein's generals, urging them to disobey
their leader should he give an order to deploy such weapons: "If they
do not refuse, they must understand that all war criminals will be
pursued and punished."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's comments came as Congress prepares to pass a resolution
authorizing force against Iraq if Bush determines that diplomatic
means to disarm Hussein's regime have been exhausted. The
administration also is pressing the United Nations to adopt a tough
resolution that would order Iraq to submit to new weapons
inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech also came amid considerable public concern in the
United States over a war with Iraq--and its potential economic and
geopolitical consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his top advisors have been aware for some time that, even
though most Americans support his goals, many also are deeply
troubled by the prospect of starting an armed conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The president delivered his speech exactly a year after his
administration launched its military attack on Afghanistan's Taliban
regime in response to last year's terrorist attacks on America.
Although the Taliban were overthrown quickly, Bush has stressed that
the worldwide war on the Al Qaeda terrorist network it supported and
other terrorist groups is ongoing. And his administration concedes it
is uncertain about the fate of Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Bush supporters in Congress hailed the speech as a powerful case
for decisive action against Iraq. "President Bush laid out the clear,
compelling and overwhelming justification for action to remove the
threat posed by Saddam Hussein's terror regime," said House Majority
Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas).</TE>
<TE>   But Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, a leading antiwar Democrat,
was unmoved: "The administration has failed to make a case for a
unilateral and preemptive strike on Iraq. War is simply a failure of
diplomacy."</TE>
<TE>   Moderate California Democratic Rep. Ellen O. Tauscher of Alamo
said: "I thought it was a speech he could and should have given six
months ago. It was a sober and serious recitation of why Saddam
Hussein is a threat to the American people. He put the focus where
the focus belonged from the beginning, which is on disarming him."</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Bush asserted that a conflict with Iraq would not
detract from the broader war on terrorism. "To the contrary,
confronting the threat posed by Iraq is crucial to winning the war on
terror," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's main goal was to answer two central questions: Why Iraq?
And why now?</TE>
<TE>   "While there are many dangers in the world, the threat from Iraq
stands alone--because it gathers the most serious dangers of our age
in one place," he said, referring to the weapons of mass destruction
widely believed to be in Hussein's arsenal. The Iraqis have denied
they possess such weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "By its past and present actions, by its technological
capabilities, by the merciless nature of its regime, Iraq is unique,"
Bush said as he reminded his listeners that Hussein previously "has
struck other nations without warning."</TE>
<TE>   The president also recounted in detail, as he did in his Sept. 12
speech to the U.N. General Assembly, the history of Iraq's violations
of U.N. resolutions that it had agreed to at the end of the 1991
Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "The time for denying, deceiving and delaying has come to an end,"
Bush said. "Saddam Hussein must disarm himself--or, for the sake of
peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him."</TE>
<TE>   Among the facilities the inspectors dismantled was the
still-incomplete Al-Furat Manufacturing Facility, near Baghdad. U.N.
reports indicate that it was being built to help mass produce
centrifuge machines and to provide facilities for the assembly of a
demonstration centrifuge cascade, a type of equipment needed to make
weapon-grade uranium.</TE>
<TE>   According to the White House, construction at Al-Furat resumed
last year "and the building appears to be operational," although a
tall section at the rear has not been completed. In conjunction with
Bush's speech, the White House released satellite photos taken in
December 1998 and last month to show the apparent work.</TE>
<TE>   Although U.S. officials do not know what is inside the building,
they have detected a large-scale Iraqi effort to illegally import
60,000 or more aluminum tubes that could be used for centrifuges.</TE>
<TE>   A CIA report issued last week said Iraq's efforts to procure the
tubes is "of special concern" because of their use in a centrifuge
enrichment program. Some CIA officials, however, say the tubes are
probably intended for a conventional weapon program.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq also has attempted to obtain other key parts of a gas
centrifuge system, including vacuum pumps, specialized magnets,
anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and fluorine gas, and filament winding
and balancing machines.</TE>
<TE>   In invoking the nuclear threat, Bush conceded that the U.S.
doesn't know how close Iraq is to having such a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   But, the president warned, "if we allow that to happen, a terrible
line would be crossed. We have every reason to assume the worst, and
we have an urgent duty to prevent the worst from occurring."</TE>
<TE>   Bush called Hussein a "homicidal dictator who is addicted to
weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   The president made clear that he is as worried about Hussein's
biological and chemical weapons as he is about the possibility of
Hussein acquiring a nuclear weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the Iraqi leader possesses "a massive stockpile of
biological weapons that has never been accounted for and is capable
of killing millions."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said U.S. intelligence has uncovered evidence that Iraq has
"a growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles" that can be
used to deliver such weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the tough rhetoric aimed at Hussein, Bush held out the
possibility of a peaceful resolution to the showdown with
Baghdad--provided that Hussein rid himself of chemical and biological
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to the resolution pending before Congress, Bush said its
approval "does not mean that military action is imminent or
unavoidable."</TE>
<TE>   That set a somewhat different tone than Bush struck in his U.N.
speech, when he said that unless the world organization enforced its
many resolutions regarding Iraq, "action will be unavoidable."</TE>
<TE>   The president was not prepared--just yet, anyway--to deliver a
speech on Iraq from the more formal, somber setting of the Oval
Office. Instead, he flew to this conservative Ohio River city Monday
evening and addressed about 500 guests of the Cincinnati World
Affairs Council, the Chamber of Commerce and the United Way.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's audience listened attentively and interrupted the president
with applause only twice--when he said, "We will prevail," and when
he said, "We refuse to live in fear."</TE>
<TE>   At the United Nations in New York, the Security Council did not
meet Monday and was not expected to take up the Iraq issue before
midweek at the earliest.</TE>

<LD>Excerpts of President Bush's address in Cincinnati:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Good evening. Tonight I want to take a few minutes to discuss a
grave threat to peace, and America's determination to lead the world
in confronting that threat.</LD>
<TE>   The threat comes from Iraq. It arises directly from the Iraqi
regime's own actions--its history of aggression, and its drive toward
an arsenal of terror.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Congress of both political parties and members of
the United Nations Security Council agree that Saddam Hussein is a
threat to peace and must disarm. We agree that the Iraqi dictator
must not be permitted to threaten America and the world.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some ask how urgent this danger is to America and the world. The
danger is already significant and it only grows worse with time. If
we know Saddam Hussein has dangerous weapons today--and we do--does
it make any sense for the world to wait to confront him as he grows
even stronger and develops even more dangerous weapons?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds
of miles ... in a region where more than 135,000 American civilians
and service members live and work. We have also discovered through
intelligence that Iraq has a growing fleet of manned and unmanned
aerial vehicles that could be used to disperse chemical or biological
weapons across broad areas.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Iraq could decide on any given day to provide a biological or
chemical weapon to a terrorist group or individual terrorists.
Alliances with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to attack
America without leaving any fingerprints.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If the Iraqi regime is able to produce, buy or steal an amount of
highly enriched uranium a little larger than a single softball, it
could have a nuclear weapon in less than a year. And if we allow that
to happen, a terrible line would be crossed. Saddam Hussein would be
in a position to blackmail anyone who opposes his aggression.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The time for denying, deceiving and delaying has come to an end.
Saddam Hussein must disarm himself--or, for the sake of peace, we
will lead a coalition to disarm him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I hope this will not require military action, but it may. And
military conflict could be difficult. An Iraqi regime faced with its
own demise may attempt cruel and desperate measures. If Saddam
Hussein orders such measures, his generals would be well-advised to
refuse those orders. If they do not refuse, they must understand that
all war criminals will be pursued and punished.... We will plan
carefully, we will act with the full power of the United States
military, we will act with allies at our side and we will prevail.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Failure to act would embolden other tyrants, allow terrorists
access to new weapons and new resources, and make blackmail a
permanent feature of world events. The United Nations would betray
the purpose of its founding and prove irrelevant to the problems of
our time. And through its inaction, the United States would resign
itself to a future of fear.</TE>
<TE>   That is not the America I know. That is not the America I serve.
We refuse to live in fear. This nation--in world war and in Cold
War--has never permitted the brutal and lawless to set history's
course.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Later this week the United States Congress will vote on this
matter. I have asked Congress to authorize the use of America's
military, if it proves necessary, to enforce U.N. Security Council
demands. Approving this resolution does not mean that military action
is imminent or unavoidable. The resolution will tell the United
Nations and all nations that America speaks with one voice and is
determined to make the demands of the civilized world mean something.</TE>

<HD>Navy Study Finds Abuse of Credit Cards by Enlisted Sailors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Navy personnel used government credit cards to hire prostitutes at
brothels, buy jewelry, gamble and attend New York Yankees and Los
Angeles Lakers games in fraudulent purchases exceeding $200,000,
congressional investigators have found.</LD>
<LD>   Enlisted personnel earning between $12,000 and $27,000 a year were
the biggest abusers, but the Navy bears responsibility for failure to
monitor the travel card program, the General Accounting Office
concluded.</LD>
<LD>   The GAO report was prepared for a House hearing today and obtained
Monday by Associated Press.</LD>
<TE>   The study shows the abuses continued months after investigators
publicly reported on problems with the cards. From October 2000
through March, the new survey found 1,180 Navy transactions for
personal items totaling $206,700.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has stepped up its efforts to control use of the
cards. About 400,000 inactive accounts that were unused have been
canceled. Those who abused the cards have had money involuntarily
deducted from their paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy study also found use of the cards to obtain cash at adult
clubs, money normally used to tip dancers, waitresses and bartenders.</TE>

latest case against Hussein.</DH>

<LD>At the close of the school day, Salvador Narez, 19, paused Monday in
the lobby of Cal State Northridge's student union. A wide-screen TV
blared President Bush's speech.</LD>
<LD>   As other students slept on upholstered chairs and checked their
e-mail from computer terminals, Narez listened to Bush present his
case to the nation for forcing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   For Narez, a political science major, the 30-minute address proved
convincing.</LD>
<TE>   "I appreciated the background about 11 years of dictatorship in
Iraq," said the sophomore. "That they say one thing and mean another,
and about the crimes against their own people. He didn't say military
action was his first goal, he said it was his last resort."</TE>
<TE>   But across the San Fernando Valley campus, the reasons laid out by
Bush--who said he would not "stake one American life on trusting
Saddam Hussein"--were met with disdain.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Perez, 27, a member of an unofficial campus group, Students
Against War, called Bush's comments coercive.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the speech was more of a tactic to instill fear than
any reasonable or logical process," said Perez, a political science
major who attended an antiwar protest in Westwood on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who is a friend of the United States and wants to use
weapons against an enemy of the United States can go ahead and build
them and that's OK?" Perez said, referring to U.S. allies. "I think
this is going to be an illegal war and the U.N. is not going to
condone this. He's still going to brush this aside and go on to war."</TE>
<TE>   In downtown Los Angeles, some workers said they would need to hear
definitive proof that Hussein poses a threat to the United States to
back any attack.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been so many contradictory things coming from the
administration, such as whether or not there is a clear and present
danger, that until the information gets sorted out, we really should
not go after this war," said Ed Templeton, a paralegal. "I'd like to
see a smoking gun before we send our own bullets."</TE>
<TE>   Echoed office clerk Takako Mizushima: "I don't support it. The
Iraqis said they're going to let the inspectors in. Bush hasn't shown
us the proof."</TE>
<TE>   Their comments came as Bush was saying from a lectern in
Cincinnati that such proof might "come in the form of a mushroom
cloud" if America waited too long.</TE>
<TE>   At American Legion Post 291 in Newport Beach, Bush appeared on
both TV sets at the bar but failed to hold the attention of veterans.
Most chose to socialize on the patio. The men outside, however,
expressed support for the president's goals.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a tough sell, but we have to stop this guy [Hussein]
now or our children will have to pay for it later," said Dave Ryan,
66, of Corona del Mar, a Korean War-era Navy veteran.</TE>
<TE>   Army veteran Bruce Vaughan, 67, of Costa Mesa, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Set politics aside," he said, "and take [Hussein] out. That's the
No. 1 priority."</TE>
<TE>   Both men said they planned to catch the rebroadcast of the speech.
As soon as the live presentation ended, an impatient vet demanded the
channel be switched to the baseball playoff game, and the bartender
quickly complied.</TE>

<HD>FAA Orders Replacement of Faulty Rudders on Boeing 737s</HD>
<DH>Safety: The directive follows two deadly crashes blamed on
the device's failure. The program will cost the company $364 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rudder systems on Boeing 737s, the world's most widely used
airliners, must be replaced by U.S. carriers under a $364-million
retrofitting program ordered Monday by the Federal Aviation
Administration.</LD>
<LD>   The order came years after two disastrous 737 crashes that were
blamed on rudder failure. The first, near Colorado Springs, Colo., in
1991, killed all 25 aboard a United Airlines flight. The second, near
Pittsburgh three years later, killed 132 on a USAir jetliner. USAir
since has been renamed US Airways.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. carriers will have six years to comply with Monday's order,
which affects all 2,000 of the twin-engine jets being flown in this
country.</LD>
<TE>   Foreign carriers, which fly an additional 2,500 Boeing 737s, are
expected to follow suit voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing said Monday that it will pay for the retrofits, which will
be accomplished during regularly scheduled maintenance. It added that
737s now on order will be delivered with the new rudder systems.</TE>
<TE>   The National Transportation Safety Board concluded last year that
both the 1991 and 1994 crashes occurred after the pilots pushed
control pedals to move the rudder in one direction, but the device
moved in the opposite direction.</TE>
<TE>   The rudder is the large, hinged slab on the vertical part of the
tail that works like the rudder on a boat--helping a plane fly
straight, turn right or turn left.</TE>
<TE>   Jetliner pilots use the rudder primarily to compensate for
crosswinds when taking off and landing.</TE>
<TE>   Full deflection of a rudder can cause a plane to roll and then
plunge; that's apparently what happened in the Colorado Springs and
Pittsburgh crashes. The NTSB said radar data and on-board recording
devices recovered from the wreckage showed that in both cases, the
jetliners banked steeply to one side before plunging nose-first into
the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing reported in 1995 that, in addition to the two crashes, its
737s had experienced rudder-related "lateral or directional problems"
187 times in the previous 15 years. None of those 187 incidents
caused a crash, but they did prompt the flight crews to make
precautionary landings or file incident reports with Boeing.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's order was the latest--and presumably the last--in a
series of FAA directives issued since the crashes. One earlier
directive mandated a simplified procedure for pilots to use if the
rudder jams. Another called for mechanical modifications designed to
reduce the likelihood of malfunctions. A third called for improved
maintenance procedures.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, a group of experts appointed by the FAA concluded
that these earlier fixes were inadequate and that a new system was
required. The FAA proposed the retrofit in November and, after months
of input from the industry and the public, issued the replacement
order.</TE>
<TE>   The new system, designed by Boeing, is fully redundant, with two
independent control mechanisms, both of which can be overridden by
the pilots.</TE>
<TE>   "This new design will increase the overall safety of the 737 by
simplifying the rudder system and eliminating a range of failure
possibilities," the FAA said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BOWIE, Md.</DL>
<LD>At school, the doors were locked. Field trips were canceled and
afternoon practices postponed. Custodians went from classroom to
classroom tilting the blinds so the students could see out but no one
could see in. Teachers stood guard at the entrances and parent
volunteers fell out to answer the phones.</LD>
<LD>   The series of sniper shootings that had killed six and wounded one
since last week crossed into another dimension Monday morning when a
child--a 13-year-old boy dropped off by his aunt at Benjamin Tasker
Middle School--became victim No. 8.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting sent school districts in the Washington area into yet
another "code blue lockdown," frightened students and moved a
characteristically composed police chief to tears.</LD>
<TE>   Principals took to their public address systems to announce in the
least graphic terms that "another incident has occurred," withholding
details of the rifle shot to the chest and abdomen that had
critically wounded the boy shortly after 8 a.m. But most students
understood the gravity.</TE>
<TE>   The sense of fear and outrage that permeated communities from
Maryland to Virginia to Washington could be read on the faces of
three husky male parents who peered balefully out the front doors of
Tulip Grove Elementary about a mile from the shooting. A small but
steady stream of parents bustled in to collect their children while
police cars circled the block.</TE>
<TE>   "It's horrible; it's a disaster," said Joan Miller, her face
swollen from crying. She loaded her daughter, Briana, into a brown
sedan outside Tulip Grove. "If they want to terrorize people, they've
really done it now. I've lived here 40 years and there's never been
anything like this."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, it was easier for teachers and staffers to mobilize
Monday, following the security precautions they learned last week. At
Westland Middle School in Bethesda, Principal Ursula A. Hermann
ordered the code blue even before the district made it official.
Teachers sat at a table near the main entrance checking IDs, file
boxes of emergency cards at the ready.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this week the staff feels more vulnerable than last,"
Hermann said, walking the halls throughout the day and poking her
head into classrooms to ensure all were well. "It's very hard to make
sense of how to help yourself, your colleagues, your children to keep
some sense of normalcy."</TE>
<TE>   It seemed incongruous, attempting to preserve a routine when
children stayed behind classroom doors locked from the inside while
78-degree weather beckoned them out.</TE>
<TE>   The bus had left Westbrook Elementary for a field trip to the
Claggett Farm nature preserve when the principal called and
instructed the driver to turn around, prompting "a large collective
moan" from the fourth- and fifth-graders on board.</TE>
<TE>   Youngsters in gym clothes could be seen running through the
windowed hall into the gym for indoor soccer at Westland Middle
School. At Bowie High, students were barred from walking the halls
without an adult escort. In a fourth-grade classroom in North
Bethesda, any time one child had to use the bathroom, the whole class
went along.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the eight shootings occurred in Maryland, but the fear
reverberated across the Potomac River to Virginia, where children at
Swanson Middle School in Arlington were summoned off the playing
field for indoor recess usually reserved for when it rains.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers held to talking points hastily distributed in some
Maryland schools Monday--"DO NOT turn on your TV or radio. DO NOT
allow students on the Internet. LIMIT SPECULATION."</TE>
<TE>   Despite all efforts, many students were upset to learn they could
be so vulnerable. "A lot of people are really worried," Angel
Caneron, 16, a senior at Bowie High said, her voice trembling.</TE>
<TE>   While some parents raced to retrieve their children, the majority
decided they were safer at school. "I'm resisting the urge to hunker
down and keep everybody at home," said Gayle Forst, who wanted to
keep her 12-year-old daughter after a morning doctor's appointment
but was persuaded otherwise. "My daughter told me the odds of
anything happening were the same as being struck by lightning. She's
more levelheaded than I am."</TE>
<TE>   Schools shifted to crisis mode with notable dispatch and minimal
confusion, officials said, following the plan used when the shooting
sites were limited to gas stations, a shopping mall, in front of a
post office, the grass behind an auto center. So when the shooter
moved to a school, everyone knew the drill, but none of it seemed
enough.</TE>
<TE>   A meeting of principals was scheduled Monday night to discuss some
sort of plan. Teachers at various schools planned to gather this
morning to assess what was working and what wasn't. For many, the
brainstorming was overshadowed by a single thought.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest thing," said Tulip Grove Principal David J.
Scuccimarra, "is trying to understand how we can live in a world
where things like this happen."</TE>

<HD>Sinatra Jr., Kevorkian Fall Short as Justices Reject 1,800
Appeals</HD>
<DH>Supreme Court: The cases had piled up over the summer. All
of them got one-line dismissals from justices, who seek new questions
of law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The born famous, the reluctantly famous and the infamous were among
those who had their cases turned down Monday by the Supreme Court.</LD>
<LD>   The justices rejected more than 1,800 appeals that piled up over
the summer, including the cases of Frank Sinatra Jr., Terry L.
Nichols, Richard Jewell and Jack Kevorkian.</LD>
<LD>   All of them got simply a one-line dismissal, with no explanations.
The justices look to decide new and significant questions of law, and
sometimes the most intriguing cases fail to meet that standard.</LD>
<TE>   Sinatra had asked the Supreme Court to revive California's "Son of
Sam" law and prevent Barry Keenan, a mastermind of his 1963
kidnapping, from profiting from a planned movie called "Snatching
Sinatra." He was 19 when his famous father paid $240,000 ransom to
free him.</TE>
<TE>   The "Son of Sam" law, one of several such laws nationwide, was
named after David Berkowitz, a serial killer who terrorized New York
City in the late 1970s, and prohibits convicted felons from cashing
in on their crime stories.</TE>
<TE>   But the California Supreme Court struck down the state law in
February on free-speech grounds, based in part on an earlier high
court ruling in a New York case.</TE>
<TE>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer joined Sinatra in arguing that
the state's law was different and deserved a second look. But the
justices refused to reconsider the matter in Sinatra vs. Keenan.</TE>
<TE>   They may have done so for a purely technical reason. The
California high court said its decision was based on the 1st
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the "liberty of speech" clause
of the state Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   The justices could reverse the 1st Amendment ruling, but they
can't change a state court's ruling on its own Constitution. In the
end, therefore, they had no power to revive the state's Son of Sam
law.</TE>
<TE>   Jewell, a security guard at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, said he
never wanted to be famous.</TE>
<TE>   But when a bomb went off on July 27, near where Jewell was
stationed, he agreed to do seven television and three newspaper
interviews describing what happened.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Jewell was transformed from hero to villain when
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported the FBI had focused on
Jewell as its prime suspect. The story also characterized him as a
publicity seeker who may have planted the bomb to get attention.</TE>
<TE>   Jewell was cleared of any wrongdoing, and he sued the paper for
defaming him. But the Georgia court of appeals said Jewell was a
public figure because he injected himself into a public controversy.
To win damages from the newspaper, he must prove the news story was
false and that the reporters recklessly ignored the truth.</TE>
<TE>   He asked the Supreme Court to reverse that decision and reclassify
him as a private figure. Under libel law, it is much easier for
private persons to win damages. They must show only that the press
was negligent in publishing false information that hurt them.</TE>
<TE>   "Voluntary participation in interviews to satisfy inquiring
reporters should never serve as a basis for converting a private
individual into a public figure," L. Lin Wood, Jewell's lawyer,
argued in his appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper's lawyers replied that Jewell's "repeated media
appearances" belie his claim that he should be seen as a private
figure.</TE>
<TE>   The justices simply turned away the dispute in Jewell vs. Cox
Enterprises, a victory for the press, but one that allows Jewell to
proceed with his defamation claim.</TE>
<TE>   Kevorkian, the notorious "suicide doctor" from Michigan, is
running out of legal claims, even though opinion polls show that many
Americans favor giving terminally ill patients the right to a
doctor's help in ending their lives.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the high court ruled that the Constitution does not give
dying people a right to defy state law and to obtain a doctor's help
in bringing about death.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Kevorkian was convicted of second-degree murder
in Michigan for helping a 52-year-old man with Lou Gehrig's disease
take a lethal dose of potassium chloride.</TE>
<TE>   Kevorkian, 74 and a retired pathologist, was sentenced to 10 to 25
years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   In his appeal, he could not argue that the Constitution gave his
patient a right to die. Instead, he tried a new tack and argued there
is "a constitutional right to be free of unbearable pain and
suffering."</TE>
<TE>   The justices turned away the case of Kevorkian vs. Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols, convicted as the co-conspirator in the 1995 bombing of
the Oklahoma City federal building, also is running out of appeals.
In his latest, he said he deserved a new trial in federal court
because the FBI failed to turn over all of the documents in its
files.</TE>
<TE>   The justices turned away his claim in Nichols vs. U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols is scheduled to a get a new trial, but not the one he
wants. Oklahoma prosecutors plan to try him on mass murder charges in
hopes of winning a death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   The justices also turned away several novel claims, such as a
right to procreate while on probation, a free-speech right to tattoo
and a gun owner's right to use human images for target practice.</TE>
<TE>   In Wisconsin, David Oakley had nine children by four women, but
had refused to pay child support. He was sentenced to prison for his
failure to pay, but a judge suspended the sentence and put him on
probation.</TE>
<TE>   But he set a strict condition: If Oakley fathered more children he
could not support, he would go back to prison.</TE>
<TE>   The Wisconsin Supreme Court, divided along gender lines, upheld
the ruling on a 4-3 vote. The four male justices described Oakley as
"totally and completely irresponsible." The three female dissenters
said procreation is a basic human right.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe appealed, saying
procreation is "at the very heart of personal rights protection by
the Constitution." The state attorney general replied that the judge
could have kept Oakley in prison, which would have kept him from
procreating.</TE>
<TE>   The justices dismissed Oakley vs. Wisconsin, leaving him free--but
not to procreate.</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina and Oklahoma have laws that make tattooing a crime.
Ronald White, a tattoo artist, became the first person prosecuted in
decades when he was shown in a South Carolina television report
performing his art. He was fined $500.</TE>
<TE>   "In a free society, this is intolerable," said White's lawyer,
Kenneth W. Starr, the former judge and independent prosecutor who led
the $60-million investigation of President Clinton. The justices
apparently disagreed and dismissed White vs. South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The Gun Owners' Action League challenged on free-speech grounds a
Massachusetts law that bans the use of human figures as targets at
shooting ranges.</TE>
<TE>   But a federal judge said the law was a reasonable step to hinder
marksmen from "becoming proficient at shooting humans with weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Justices rejected the appeal in Gun Owners' vs. Swift.</TE>
<TE>   The justices also turned away a challenge to the death penalty for
murderers who are 17 years old.</TE>
<TE>   In August, three justices said the court should declare capital
punishment unconstitutional for those under age 18 when they commit
their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   But the court is likely to wait to see if more state legislatures
outlaw this use of the death penalty.</TE>

<HD>Sniper Critically Injures Teenage Boy</HD>
<DH>Crime: Attacker's eighth victim, 13, is shot while entering
a Maryland school. As fear grows in the Washington suburbs,
investigation intensifies.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>BOWIE, Md.</DL>
<LD>The sniper taking deadly aim in Washington's suburbs struck again
Monday, critically wounding a 13-year-old boy as he stood outside the
doors of his middle school--the eighth victim in a series of
shootings that began last week.</LD>
<LD>   Forensic evidence linked Monday's attack to the earlier shootings,
which left six people dead and one wounded, police said. The latest
shooting prompted officials to intensify their investigation and
bolster security for thousands of anxious students and families from
Baltimore to Virginia.</LD>
<LD>   The gathering horror set off last week mounted again Monday with
new urgency over a long, strained day that indicated that even the
region's children were at risk.</LD>
<TE>   In suburban Maryland, where most of the shootings have occurred,
frightened parents rushed to their children's schools, police teams
stood vigil in schoolyards and public officials urged residents to
patrol their own street corners.</TE>
<TE>   "All of our victims have been defenseless, but now we're stepping
over the line. Our children don't deserve this. I guess it's getting
to be really, really personal now," said Montgomery County Police
Chief Charles A. Moose, whose eyes moistened with tears as he spoke
angrily.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday evening, Moose announced that at his request the federal
government had created a multiagency task force, which will work
under his direction with authorities in the areas where the shootings
occurred. It will include elements from the FBI, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the U.S. attorney's office in
Baltimore and other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Moose's detectives in Montgomery County were confronted Wednesday
and Thursday with five killings in less than 16 hours--victims shot
as they performed the mundane tasks of everyday life such as shopping
and pumping gas.</TE>
<TE>   Three of those fatal shootings and a similar one late Thursday
just inside the District of Columbia--as well as the wounding of a
woman about 50 miles away in Virginia on Friday--were linked to the
same variety of high-velocity .223-caliber bullet found Monday inside
the chest and abdomen of the eighth-grade Bowie middle school
student. The bullets in two of the killings were too badly mangled to
provide any forensic evidence, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, police officials in Prince George's County, where
the school shooting occurred, and federal firearm investigators said
ballistics tests performed on a fragment removed from the wounded
teenager confirmed the link with the other cases.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on circumstances and our tests, the projectile is identical
to those recovered at the other crime scenes," said Joseph M. Riehl,
assistant special agent with the Baltimore office of the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.</TE>
<TE>   The eighth-grader was in critical but stable condition at
Children's Hospital in Washington, where he underwent nearly three
hours of surgery. Dr. Martin Eichelberger, the trauma surgeon who
performed the operation, said the bullet shattered inside the boy's
chest, piercing his stomach, pancreas, spleen, diaphragm and one
lung.</TE>
<TE>   Surgeons gave a bullet fragment to a Prince George's detective,
who then turned it over to ATF agents for ballistic tests. "We were
able to find one that was simple to get to and extract it,"
Eichelberger said.</TE>
<TE>   Vowing to apprehend the rifle-wielding "bad guy," Prince George's
County Police Chief Gerald Wilson confirmed that police were looking
for a white "box truck," the vehicle already being sought by
Montgomery County police in connection with at least one of last
week's slayings.</TE>
<TE>   William Aleshire, a Bowie city councilman and retired D.C.
Metropolitan policeman, said the truck may have been carrying
temporary Virginia registration tags--a report that police officials
declined to verify. "They gave out a tag number for some sort of
white truck," Aleshire said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if police are "able to narrow down what vehicle the suspect
is driving," Wilson cautioned, the sniper "may be traveling in a
different vehicle now."</TE>
<TE>   Federal and local police officials moved Monday night to
consolidate their detective work into the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Moose said he had requested the formal involvement of federal law
enforcement officials "because of the magnitude of the investigation
and the likelihood we are going to need additional resources."</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether the consolidated effort would lead to
federal charges if a suspect is apprehended. But even before the
latest shooting, federal authorities had dramatically escalated their
involvement in the investigation over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, meanwhile, was preparing a psychological profile of the
shooter, to theorize about the person's background, possible
motivation and pattern of shooting. The FBI also deployed agents to a
command post in Montgomery County, while ATF agents performed
ballistic tests and Secret Service agents and U.S. marshals assisted
in the investigation and school security.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's high-tech "Rapid Start" computer program was being used
to track and correlate thousands of leads. "They're coming in from
all over," one official said. Moose added that more than 1,000
"credible leads" were being checked.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush also pledged federal aid and said
the nation has "witnessed a series of cowardly and senseless acts of
violence in the greater Washington area." A $50,000 reward posted for
help in cracking the case was boosted to $160,000 by dusk Monday.</TE>
<TE>   As police learned the sketchy details of the shooting at Benjamin
Tasker Middle School in the predominantly middle-class African
American community of Bowie, school officials in the region moved
swiftly to provide security to students and reassure parents.</TE>
<TE>   Classes were locked down in Montgomery and Prince George's
counties, preventing any visitors from entering. Outdoor activities
were canceled as far north as Baltimore and south into Virginia's
Spotsylvania County, where the shooting Friday occurred. And
Montgomery and Prince George's school officials beefed up security,
bringing in police and, in some cases, even using Secret Service and
Maryland State Police officers to patrol school grounds.</TE>
<TE>   At nightfall, Montgomery County Executive Douglas Duncan urged
parents to act as "safety patrols" outside schools and at bus stops
to protect their own families. "This community is in a state of
fear," he said. "We need everyone to do their part to bring this
killer to justice."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day Monday, Prince George's school officials urged
parents not to remove children from "locked-down" classrooms. "We
don't need to panic," said Iris Metts, chief executive of the
county's public schools.</TE>
<TE>   But in both affected Maryland counties, there were isolated
reports of adults trying to pick up their sons and daughters. Metts
said only parents at Tasker were being encouraged to get their
children because the school had become a crime scene. Detectives
continued interviewing some teachers late into the day.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, other detectives aided by gunpowder-sensitive search dogs
combed a wooded area several hundred yards away and across the street
from the school--a considerable distance from where the single shot
was apparently fired.</TE>
<TE>   A military marksman in camouflage reenacted the shooting in a low
crouch position from near the shooting scene. Investigators said some
brush may have been moved by the gunman.</TE>
<TE>   Dropped off by his aunt half an hour before the start of school,
the critically wounded boy crumpled to the ground just yards from the
school door, crying out after he was struck, police said. Officials
said the boy's aunt, a registered nurse, rushed to his side and
helped him into her car, then drove him to a nearby hospital. But
later, several Tasker instructors said that a seventh-grade teacher
was the first to reach the victim.</TE>
<TE>   The wounded boy "actually stood up" and "tried to get into the car
himself," said Prince George's County Councilwoman Audrey Scott. "He
was conscious the whole time."</TE>
<TE>   Inside, students were kept in their classrooms, uncertain what was
going on outside. "They really didn't know what happened," said
Damaris Ramos, 13, an eighth-grader. "Some people were crying because
they thought [the sniper] was going to come into the school."</TE>
<TE>   "You think you send your kids off to school and it's a safe place
to be," echoed her father, Johnny Ramos, grasping for words.</TE>
<TE>   Seventh-grader Jill Heizer was nearly mute in horror. "I was like,
'Oh my God,' " she said. "I was so scared."</TE>
<TE>   She and three friends were leaving with another girl, Erika
Prichard, who was being guided firmly away from the building by her
mother, Sandra.</TE>
<TE>   "Come on, girls," said the mother. "We've got to go."</TE>

<HD>2 Suspects in Oregon Terrorism Case Indicted</HD>
<DH>Courts: Former Army reservist and his ex-wife plead not
guilty to federal charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Two of the suspected terrorist cell members arrested last week on
charges of trying to lend aid to Al Qaeda and Taliban forces were
formally indicted Monday in Oregon on four federal counts, including
one of conspiring to "levy war against the United States."</LD>
<LD>   Former Army Reserve member Jeffrey Leon Battle, 32, and October
Martinique Lewis, 25, Battle's former wife, pleaded not guilty in
U.S. District Court in Portland.</LD>
<LD>   Dressed in blue prison garb, the two spoke only to say that they
had understood the court's instructions while their attorneys entered
pleas on their behalf. Lewis appeared in the courtroom without the
head scarf pictured in photographs released by the government last
week.</LD>
<TE>   A third suspect, Muhammad Ibrahim Bilal, 22, under arrest in
Michigan, is expected to be brought to Portland to hear the charges
against him.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth suspect, Patrice Lumumba Ford, 31, pleaded not guilty
to charges at a hearing in Portland on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   A fifth suspect, Ahmed Ibrahim Bilal, 24, has been arrested in
Malaysia and faces deportation within days, an official said today in
Kuala Lumpur.</TE>
<TE>   Bilal had been in hiding but turned himself in on Sunday to
security officials at an Islamic university where he had been
studying, a police official told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   The university turned him over to Malaysian authorities who were
preparing to send him back to the United States, the official said,
speaking only on condition he not be identified by name.</TE>
<TE>   Although Malaysian officials had said earlier that Bilal had not
broken any laws here, they said the United States had revoked his
passport, making him an illegal immigrant who could be easily
deported.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining suspect, Habis Abdulla Al Saoub, 36, a Jordanian
citizen, remained at large. FBI officials have refused to discuss his
whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   The six face charges that they conspired to fight against the
United States, to provide material support and resources to Al Qaeda
and to contribute services to Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Battle, Ford,
Al Saoub and Ahmed Bilal also face firearms charges.</TE>
<TE>   The trial is expected to start in December.</TE>

<HD>Justices Allow Switch on N.J. Ballot</HD>
<DH>Politics: Supreme Court won't block Democrat Lautenberg
from a run for Senate seat. Lawyer for GOP concedes the legal battle
is over.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court refused Monday to block the New Jersey Democrats
from switching candidates in a key U.S. Senate race.</LD>
<LD>   The move cleared the way for former Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg to
appear on the Nov. 5 ballot, and it increases the odds that the
Democrats will retain a narrow majority in the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   In weekend polls, Lautenberg, 78, held a slight lead over the
Republican candidate, Douglas R. Forrester, 49.</LD>
<TE>   "Certainly we're disappointed. The litigation is over," said
William E. Baroni Jr., one of the GOP lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the high court turned away Forrester's appeal, a
federal judge in Trenton, N.J., dismissed a GOP lawsuit brought on
behalf of two overseas residents of New Jersey who feared their votes
would not be counted. The judge said there was ample time to see to
it that all the absentee voters had their ballots counted.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court justices gave no hint of whether they saw any
merit in the GOP appeal.</TE>
<TE>   They issued a one-line order in Forrester's appeal, saying, "The
application for stay presented to Justice Souter and by him referred
to the Court is denied."</TE>
<TE>   The court rarely intervenes in pending cases, and it takes five
votes to issue a stay order.</TE>
<TE>   However, the parallels to the presidential election dispute
between George W. Bush and Al Gore in Florida were apparent--and
cited by the GOP lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   They argued that New Jersey's state justices had changed the rules
in the midst of the election contest by allowing the Democrats to put
Lautenberg's name on the ballot 33 days before the election. Sen.
Robert Torricelli, the scandal-plagued incumbent, quit the race a
week ago.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey law describes the procedure for filling a vacancy that
occurs 51 days before the election. It does not say what happens if a
vacancy occurs later.</TE>
<TE>   In a 7-0 decision, the state justices upheld the switch to
Lautenberg in the interest of giving the voters "a full and fair
ballot choice."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the similarities, many legal experts predicted the
justices would be wary of intervening in another election dispute on
behalf of the GOP. After the 5-4 ruling in the Bush vs. Gore case,
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy told friends they
were surprised by the harsh criticism they received for what was
derided as a partisan ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, a single Senate race in New Jersey did not have the
same national significance as the contest for the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   The hastily drafted GOP legal appeal had an apparent flaw that
might have persuaded the court to dismiss it.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican lawyers based their appeal on the Constitution's
statement that "the times, places and manner of holding elections for
Senators ... shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature
thereof." And they argued that the state's court ruling ignored the
state law.</TE>
<TE>   However, they failed to make this argument in the New Jersey
courts, and the justices almost never take up an appeal unless the
lawyers have first made the claim in a lower court.</TE>
<TE>   Until last week, GOP strategists saw New Jersey as their best
chance for taking away a Democratic seat in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   One of the statewide polls made public Monday, by Quinnipiac
University in Hamden, Conn., gave Lautenberg a lead of 49% to 45%.
However, the respondents--by a 54% to 40% margin--said it was unfair
for the Democrats to switch candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's up to Forrester to try to tap voter outrage [over the
Democrats' switch] if there is any," said Stuart Rothenberg, an
independent political analyst. "The numbers tell me there is still a
race there."</TE>
<TE>   Rothenberg, who earlier had considered the country leaning toward
electing a Republican-led Senate, now says the Democrats could
prevail, although the race appears so close across the country that
it could swing either way.</TE>
<TE>   Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University in New
Jersey, said the GOP's failure in court puts the Democrats "back in
the game and then some."</TE>
<TE>   "What the court was saying by not buying the Republican argument
was that the letter of the law notwithstanding, there is a higher
interest: Giving the voters a choice between two real candidates and
not a candidate [who is] a phantom, which is what Torricelli would
have been."</TE>

<HD>Bush Wins Key GOP Support on War Measure</HD>
<DH>Congress: Armey says he's convinced of the threat by Iraq.
Lugar drops plans to back a bipartisan alternative to president's
resolution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congressional resistance to a possible attack on Iraq eroded further
Monday as two influential Republican skeptics fell in line behind
President Bush's push for a resolution authorizing the use of
military force against the Baghdad regime.</LD>
<LD>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, who had been the
highest-ranking GOP leader questioning Bush's policy, announced
Monday that he had been convinced by administration officials that
the threat posed by Saddam Hussein justified backing the resolution.
And Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), a senior member of the Foreign
Relations Committee, dropped plans to cosponsor a bipartisan
alternative to the Bush-backed measure.</LD>
<LD>   The dwindling ranks of GOP fence-sitters and critics of Bush's
policy marks a striking shift. Just a few weeks ago, it was mostly
Republicans who were expressing qualms about the wisdom of military
action against Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   The quick closing of GOP ranks demonstrates, in part, the enormous
pressure on members of Bush's own party to swallow any reservations
and rally behind the president. It also reflects Bush's willingness
to back a more narrowly focused resolution than he initially
sought--one requiring him to certify that diplomatic means had been
exhausted in confronting Iraq and to report to Congress if he resorts
to military attack.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a leading Democrat who has backed Bush's get-tough
stance toward Baghdad on Monday criticized aspects of Bush's
approach. Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, a potential 2004
presidential candidate, said Bush's failure to secure broader global
backing for his Iraq policy amounted to "gratuitous unilateralism."</TE>
<TE>   "We seem determined to act alone for the sake of acting alone,
which may be the easy way to achieve our short-term ends but will
never result in long-term security," Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), another Iraq hawk and
potential presidential candidate, on Monday urged Bush to do more to
prepare for the aftermath of toppling Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "The ultimate measure of a war's success is the quality of the
peace that follows," Lieberman said.</TE>
<TE>   The two Democrats made their points in speeches to separate
Washington think tanks.</TE>
<TE>   Debate over how to deal with the perceived threat posed by Iraq
will dominate Capitol Hill this week. The House takes up the
Bush-backed resolution today, with a final vote expected Thursday.
The Senate also could wrap up as early as Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The structure of the House debate took shape Monday as Republican
leaders agreed to allow votes on two Democratic amendments. Neither
is expected to pass.</TE>
<TE>   The first, proposed by Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. (D-S.C.) and eight
other Democrats, would condition the use of force on passage of a new
U.N. resolution authorizing the forcible disarmament of Iraq. Failing
U.N. action, it would ask Bush to come back to Congress. Rep. Robert
T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) was among its backers.</TE>
<TE>   The second amendment was proposed by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland),
who was the only lawmaker last year to oppose a use-of-force
resolution in response to the Sept. 11 attacks. Lee's amendment would
urge the U.S. to work for Iraqi disarmament through peaceful means
using U.N. diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's Senate debate was dominated by those supporting Bush's
aggressive stance, including Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.), one of several
Democrats who face tight reelection contests in conservative states
this fall. "I believe it is imperative that we now speak with one
voice to Saddam Hussein, to the entire international community and to
our servicemen and women," Cleland said.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who has already announced
his opposition to the president's Iraq policy, said a preemptive
military attack would strip the United States of "the moral
legitimacy necessary to promote our values abroad."</TE>
<TE>   Armey, the House GOP leader, for weeks has expressed similar
reservations, saying a preemptive strike would be a departure from
long-standing U.S. policy.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing his support for Bush on Monday, Armey said the
administration had provided him with convincing evidence that Hussein
posed an urgent threat to the U.S. and to Israel. He also concluded
that an attack on Iraq would not be preemptive, but a justified
reaction to Hussein's flouting of U.N. resolutions for the last
decade.</TE>
<TE>   "In these extraordinary times, an extraordinary shift in national
security is necessary," Armey said.</TE>
<TE>   Top administration officials also worked hard to bring Lugar back
into the fold after he recently teamed up with Senate Foreign
Relations Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) in proposing an
alternative to the Bush-backed resolution. The Biden-Lugar proposal
would put more emphasis on exhausting diplomatic options and seeking
U.N. support before resorting to force. It also would allow the use
of force only to disarm Iraq--not to change its regime.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials worked hard to convince Lugar that many of
his concerns had been addressed by the changes Bush agreed to last
week in the resolution--changes that won support from House Minority
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and other senior Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Lugar has not yet said how he will vote, but a Capitol Hill source
close to him said the senator is likely to support the Bush-backed
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Only a handful of Republicans in either the House or Senate remain
uncommitted or are opposed to Bush's policy.</TE>
<TE>   One fence-sitter is Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), who took to the
Senate floor Monday to air his ambivalence. "If we do require U.N.
multilateral action [before attacking Iraq], we do put ourselves
subject to the veto of France, China and Russia, which is
undesirable," he said. "And if we authorize the use of force
unilaterally, then we may well be setting a precedent, which could
come back to haunt us with nations like China going after Taiwan."</TE>
<TE>   Although no Senate Republican has come out firmly against Bush,
Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-R.I.) is leaning toward supporting an
alternative resolution that seeks to force the United States to act
in concert with the United Nations, according to a Chafee spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Also undecided is Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio), according to his
spokeswoman, Amanda Flaig.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, only two of the 223 House Republicans can be counted
as firm opponents of Bush's resolution: Reps. Ron Paul of Texas and
James A. Leach of Iowa, who voted against it in the House
International Relations Committee. Leach said he feared that a U.S.
attack on Iraq could trigger a catastrophic sequence of events in the
Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only would we be the potential precipitating actor, but our
troops could be caught in crosswinds and cross-fire," Leach said.
"This is a circumstance we should step back from."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Constance A. Morella (R-Md.), who voted against the 1991
Persian Gulf War resolution, has "very serious concerns" about the
administration's strategy for a postwar Iraq if Hussein is toppled,
said spokesman Jonathan Dean.</TE>

<HD>Nobel Laureate's String of Successes</HD>
<DH>Career: Scientist came to La Jolla from South Africa via
Oxford and contributed to research on DNA, the human genome and cell
life.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>Most scientists are fortunate to be involved in one major discovery
during their lifetime. Sydney Brenner, who received the 2002 Nobel
Prize in physiology or medicine, has been involved in at least three.</LD>
<LD>   One, for which he received this year's prize, was the idea to use
the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as an experimental subject to
study the birth and death of cells in living organisms.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1950s and 1960s, the La Jolla scientist played a key role
in determining how the genetic information encoded in DNA was
converted by cellular machinery into proteins. Working with molecular
biologist Francis Crick--DNA's co-discoverer--he deduced that the
genetic information of DNA was encoded in triplets, groups of three
chemicals that determined the identity of each amino acid in a
protein. He also discovered messenger RNA, which is a key
intermediary in converting genetic information into proteins.</LD>
<TE>   More recently, he has advocated the use of the puffer fish, Fugu
rubripes, as a model to study the human genome. The puffer fish has
one of the most compact genomes known among vertebrates. Researchers
studying it thus do not have to deal with the large quantities of
so-called noncoding or extraneous DNA that are present in the human
genetic blueprint.</TE>
<TE>   Those are not bad achievements for the son of an illiterate
Lithuanian cobbler.</TE>
<TE>   Brenner was born in Germiston, South Africa, in 1927. He first
developed an interest in biology from a book called "The Science of
Life," which he borrowed from a library then reported missing because
he couldn't afford to purchase it. Another influential book was "The
Young Chemist," which spurred him to buy chemicals from the local
pharmacist and experiment in his garage.</TE>
<TE>   At 14, he entered the University of the Witwatersrand in
Johannesburg, intending to become a physician. He also met renowned
paleontologist Raymond Dart, whom he often accompanied on digs to
nearby Sterkfontein. Those experiences gave him a lifelong interest
in anthropology, but he remained drawn to biology.</TE>
<TE>   A fellowship took him to Oxford University, where Crick and James
D. Watson were deciphering the structure of DNA. He quickly became
friends with Crick, and the pair spent hours on end discussing
scientific questions.</TE>
<TE>   After he received his doctorate, he returned to South Africa, but
his strong opposition to apartheid made the situation untenable and
Crick helped him return to the Cavendish Laboratory at the Medical
Research Council in Cambridge, where he spent the next 26 years. His
work there on triplets and messenger RNA "might be his greatest
achievement," according to Roger Brent of the Molecular Sciences
Institute in Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Brenner played a key role in the 1974 Asilomar Conference in
Pacific Grove, when molecular biologists gathered to consider the
ethical implications of recombinant DNA and genetic engineering
experiments that were just beginning in many laboratories. Many
scientists feared that the experiments could unleash deadly and
uncontrollable organisms.</TE>
<TE>   Brenner strongly supported such research, but he argued at the
conference that scientists should develop their own guidelines to
regulate experiments before the government stepped in and preempted
them. His arguments ultimately helped carry the day, and the
conference marked one of the first times that researchers began
independently regulating potentially dangerous experiments.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from Cambridge in 1992, he authored a paper in the
journal Nature arguing for use of the puffer fish as a surrogate for
the human genome. That paper has triggered a raft of new research. In
1998, he came out of retirement to help establish the Molecular
Sciences Institute in Berkeley. He retired from there in 2000, only
to come out of retirement again earlier this year to rejoin Crick at
the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences in La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   As he said at the time: "I don't want to retire to play golf.
Science is one's hobby and one's work and one's pleasure."</TE>

<HD>'Suicide Cell' Work Earns Trio a Nobel</HD>
<DH>Science: Biologist at Salk Institute in La Jolla shares
prize in medicine/physiology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A La Jolla scientist and two colleagues from MIT and Cambridge
University who used the simple roundworm to unravel the complex
processes controlling the birth and death of cells in humans on
Monday received the 2002 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.</LD>
<LD>   Working separately, the two Britons and an American discovered how
living organisms dispose of cells they no longer need, a process that
is crucial in shaping the brain, for example, and that may ultimately
provide ways to fight cancer and other diseases.</LD>
<LD>   British biologist Sydney Brenner, 75, of the Salk Institute for
Biological Sciences in La Jolla, biologist John E. Sulston, 60, who
is retired from Cambridge University's Sanger Centre, and molecular
biologist H. Robert Horvitz, 55, of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology will share the prize, worth nearly $1 million.</LD>
<TE>   The three showed for the first time that each cell carries suicide
instructions within its own DNA blueprint, allowing it to
self-destruct when the body no longer needs it. Subsequent work has
demonstrated that failures in following these instructions lead to
many types of diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Cancer, for example, represents a failure of cells to die when
they are proliferating uncontrollably, while Alzheimer's and similar
diseases are caused by the premature death of crucial cells in the
brain. The three laureates' work has opened the door to new ways to
combat both types of failures.</TE>
<TE>   Their discoveries "are important for medical research and have
shed new light on the pathogenesis of many diseases," the Nobel
Assembly in Sweden said in the award citation.</TE>
<TE>   Horvitz learned of the win while vacationing in the Alps. "It was
quite enjoyable to have champagne before lunch in France," he said in
a telephone news conference. "I would find nothing more gratifying
than to learn that one or more of my discoveries led specifically to
pharmaceutical treatments and cures for human diseases."</TE>
<TE>   Sulston, who retired from the Sanger Centre in 2000, said he was
"surprised and obviously delighted." He minimized his own
contributions, but noted that "clearly it has been the foundation for
a great deal more, and that's extremely delightful."</TE>
<TE>   Brenner was in Munich, Germany, on Monday and made no statement to
the media.</TE>
<TE>   His prize "was well overdue," said molecular biologist Francis
Crick of the Salk Institute, who worked with Brenner in England in
the 1950s and 1960s. "If a Nobel Prize were given for an outstanding
body of work, Sydney would almost certainly have been awarded one
years ago."</TE>
<TE>   "Sydney was often referred to as 'the brightest person not to have
won a Nobel Prize,' " neurobiologist Greg Lemke of Salk added. "With
today's news, he no longer holds this distinction."</TE>
<TE>   Brenner played a crucial role in the 1960s in developing our
understanding of how DNA and genes work. Once that problem was
solved, his interests turned to issues of development--how an
organism grows from a single-cell egg to a multicellular organism.
His key insight was recognizing that researchers in the field needed
their own "laboratory rat," something simpler than the fruit fly but
more complicated than bacteria and protozoa.</TE>
<TE>   After several years, he concentrated on nematodes, a family of
tiny, ubiquitous worms. His ultimate choice was Caenorhabditis
elegans, a transparent nematode 1 millimeter long--about the size of
Lincoln's nose on a penny.</TE>
<TE>   Brenner "broke new ground" in 1974, according to the Nobel
Assembly, when he demonstrated that specific gene mutations could be
induced in C. elegans and linked to specific structural mutations in
organs that could be seen under a microscope.</TE>
<TE>   His work "laid the foundation" for everything that has
subsequently been achieved in the field, the citation says.</TE>
<TE>   Sulston mapped the individual cells of the nematode as it grew
from a fertilized egg to an adult. He found that the egg produced
1,090 cells, but that 131 were pruned during the course of
development, leaving only 959 cells in an adult.</TE>
<TE>   He eventually demonstrated that the fate of each cell was
determined at its birth and that the same cells are killed as every
nematode matures. Under the microscope, he said Monday, "we could
actually see programmed cell death in action, so beautiful, so clear
and so reproducible."</TE>
<TE>   He also demonstrated the first mutations of the genes
participating in this programmed cell death, which is called
apoptosis.</TE>
<TE>   Horvitz studied this process on the molecular level and identified
the first two bona fide "death genes," called ced-3 and ced-4. In the
mid-1980s, he demonstrated that functional copies of ced-3 and ced-4
were necessary for programmed cell death to occur.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he showed that another gene, called ced-9, protects against
cellular death by interacting with the first two genes. He has
subsequently found other genes that direct how the dead cells are
eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers now know that most of these genes identified in C.
elegans have human counterparts. Ced-9, for example, is similar to a
human gene called Bcl-2 that is important in the development of
B-cell follicular lymphoma, a type of leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies and academic laboratories are searching for ways to
manipulate these genes. A drug that could induce apoptosis in cancer
cells, for example, would theoretically have far fewer side effects
than currently used chemotherapy agents.</TE>
<TE>   And drugs that block apoptosis might prevent brain deterioration
in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.</TE>

<HD>What's Round and Reflective? Maybe It's a Planet, Maybe Not</HD>
<DH>Science: The group charged with deciding such things has
never had a formal definition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's a planet anyway?</LD>
<LD>   The International Astronomical Union, the group charged with
coming up with definitions and names for astronomical objects, has
never had a formal definition for "planet." It's never really needed
one. Many textbooks and encyclopedias don't even formally define the
word. Why should they? It's always been so simple.</LD>
<LD>   For centuries, planets were considered to be big, round objects
that orbited a sun and reflected light but did not give off light of
their own. And we knew of only nine: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.</LD>
<TE>   But after the discovery of several strange, rule-breaking objects,
the old definition was clearly inadequate. The first planet outside
of our solar system was found in 1995. Scientists have now found 100
extrasolar planets. They have found nearly 20 objects that look just
like planets, but float free in space.</TE>
<TE>   They have found tiny, failed stars called brown dwarfs that
resemble Jupiter a lot more than they resemble stars. Pluto, once
alone in its neighborhood, now has several objects nearby that
approach it in size and behave much more like planets in the way they
orbit the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Some people now call comets and asteroids "minor planets." And
small bodies that may one day coalesce into planets go by the moniker
"planetesimals."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that easy anymore," said astronomer Brian Marsden, an
International Astronomical Union director who wrangles with such
issues.</TE>
<TE>   A few scientists have tried to come up with some scientific basis
for determining what is or isn't a planet. A theory by the Southwest
Research Institute's Alan Stern suggests that anything big enough to
become round through gravitational forces is a planet.</TE>
<TE>   By that measure, anything more than about 185 miles
across--including Quaoar--would be deemed a planet. UC Berkeley's
Gibor Basri suggests that any spherical object not capable of nuclear
fusion--a "non-fusor"--circulating around an object like a star that
is capable of fusion--a "fusor"--should be called a planet.</TE>
<TE>   Confused? You're not alone. The IAU spent months trying to perfect
the definition of a planet. In the end, it came up only with what
they call a "working definition" that it will revise as needed. A
planet: "Any non-fusor object that orbits a star."</TE>

<HD>Pluto's Not So Alone Out There, It Appears</HD>
<DH>Astronomy: The distant, icy sphere dubbed Quaoar is said to
be too small to be a planet, although it is planet-like.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Caltech astronomers using an aging telescope to scan the fringes
of the solar system have found an object half the size of Pluto--a
distant, icy sphere they have dubbed Quaoar.</LD>
<LD>   The scientists say the dark, reddish object is the largest body
discovered in the solar system since Pluto was spotted in 1930.
Although precise measurements are impossible to make from Earth,
Quaoar (pronounced KWA-wahr) is estimated to be about 780 miles
across, the size of Pluto's moon, Charon. It dances near the edge of
the solar system 1 billion miles beyond Pluto, 4 billion miles from
Earth.</LD>
<LD>   The find by Mike Brown and Chad Trujillo, two Caltech astronomers
who have worked in relative obscurity to survey the outer reaches of
the solar system, was announced Monday at a meeting of planetary
scientists in Birmingham, Ala.</LD>
<TE>   Quaoar joins a handful of other strange, large objects recently
found in Pluto's neighborhood, the Kuiper Belt, a swath of icy cosmic
residue that extends from Neptune to the solar system's outer limits.</TE>
<TE>   Its discoverers say Quaoar is too small to be a planet, although
they note it is quite planet-like in its behavior and acts far more
like a planet than Pluto--the smallest planet in the solar system,
with a diameter of 1,400 miles. That finding immediately revived a
simmering debate among astronomers about whether Pluto should be
stripped of its designation as a planet, and is forcing astronomers
to reconsider even basic notions about the solar system as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a whole zoo of things out there that we ought to be
exploring but haven't even been able to fit into our conceptual
framework," said David Jewitt, an astronomer at the University of
Hawaii who with Jane Luu discovered the first object in the Kuiper
Belt in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Other Plutonian peers found in recent years include Varuna, a
550-mile-across object named for the Vedic god of the oceans; Ixion,
an object estimated to be nearly as large as Quaoar, named for the
mythical Greek king who fathered the Centaurs; and Rhadamanthus, a
smaller object named for one of three judges of the underworld in
Greek mythology.</TE>
<TE>   Quaoar takes its name from the creation myth of the original
inhabitants of the Los Angeles Basin, the Tongva Indian tribe, also
known as the Gabrielenos. According to tribal elder Mark Acuna,
Quaoar is the formless, genderless creation force that sang into
existence the other deities--Sky Father, Earth Mother and Grandfather
Sun.</TE>
<TE>   In this age of eagle-eyed space telescopes that can locate some of
the most distant objects in our universe, the discovery of these
startlingly large objects so close to home is something of a wake-up
call. Even veteran astronomers are calling it "awesome,"
"spectacular" and "cool."</TE>
<TE>   Quaoar orbits in a region of space so cold and dark that our
blindingly bright sun appears there only as another star in the night
sky. Until recently, most astronomers thought the region was a boring
stretch of emptiness containing only Pluto, its moon and a
long-sought entity called Planet X, whose theorized existence
eventually was disproved.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Billions of Objects</TE>
<TE>   "People didn't study [the area] because they didn't know anything
was there," Jewitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Astronomers since have realized that the Kuiper Belt is swarming
with unexpected objects. In the 10 years since Jewitt's discovery,
scientists have found about 600 Kuiper Belt objects, or KBOs. Models
suggest that there could be 10 billion of the objects there.
Depending on the vagaries of their orbits and the linguistic
predilections of astronomers, they are called "plutinos,"
"trans-Neptunian objects," "scattered objects" and "cubewanos" for
the first KBO, a 175-mile-diameter object officially cataloged as QB1
despite Jewitt's proposed name of "Smiley."</TE>
<TE>   The objects are a motley collection that defy stereotype. Some
objects have such distant, looping orbits that they remain invisible
from Earth for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. Except for Pluto
with its reflective ice surface, the objects found so far are all
dark, their carbon-rich surfaces scorched by a constant bombardment
of cosmic rays. Some give off a faint, reddish glow. At least seven
waltz with satellites nearly their own size. None appear to have
atmospheres. And as large as Quaoar is, scientists expect it will
soon be surpassed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is spectacular," said Alan Stern, an astronomer at
the Southwest Research Institute who leads the Pluto-Kuiper Express,
a NASA mission proposed to start journeying toward the Kuiper Belt in
2006. "But I would not be surprised if we found objects substantially
larger than Pluto--the size of Mars or even Earth."</TE>
<TE>   None of this bodes very well for Pluto's status as a planet.</TE>
<TE>   Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh and quickly deemed
a planet. But with the discovery of so many other denizens in its
neighborhood, its status has declined. Pluto is not like other
planets in our solar system. Its orbit is not circular, but fiercely
eccentric, at some points cutting in front of Neptune during a
248-year cycle. It is the only planet that does not lie in the same
plane as the others.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Pluto has become the Rodney Dangerfield of
planets. New York's Hayden Planetarium demoted Pluto when it included
only eight planets in its depiction of the solar system. And now
comes this latest blow.</TE>
<TE>   "Quaoar definitely hurts the case for Pluto being a planet," said
Brown, the Caltech astronomer, who argues that if Pluto was
discovered today, it would go down in history not as a planet, but as
one whopper of a Kuiper Belt object.</TE>
<TE>   Quaoar behaves far more like a planet than Pluto does. Its orbit
is nearly as circular as Earth's and it lies in the same plane as all
the other planets--except Pluto.</TE>
<TE>   Pluto's defenders already are bristling. "You shouldn't say
Pluto's not a planet because it's surrounded by other things," Stern
said. "We don't say Earth's not a planet because it's surrounded by
asteroids."</TE>
<TE>   Stern has run calculations showing that any object up to 180 miles
across is large enough to become round by gravitational forces and
thus should be called a planet. He suggests that Pluto should remain
in the pantheon of planets and Quaoar should be invited in too.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to sound politically correct," Stern said, "but we need to
be inclusive."</TE>
<TE>   The International Astronomical Union, a group charged with naming
and cataloging astronomical objects, created a cosmic stink several
years ago when it quietly tried to assign Pluto to the ranks of the
"small bodies orbiting the sun."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dual Status Proposed</TE>
<TE>   "People get quite upset about Pluto," said Brian Marsden, an
astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and one
of the IAU's directors. He now proposes that Pluto enjoy "dual
status" as a planet and a Kuiper Belt object.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of Pluto's status, astronomers believe the little
planet and its brethren within the Kuiper Belt hold a host of answers
to the origins of our solar system. The region is a kind of
refrigerator, holding in deep freeze the ancient dust, ice, rock and
organic material, such as carbon, from which all planets formed.</TE>
<TE>   Discovering the secrets of the Kuiper Belt is not easy, given that
it is billions of miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what they know about Quaoar: It takes 288 days to orbit the
sun. It completes one rotation every nine hours. It's not much
brighter than a piece of charcoal and is somewhat red. It's a
magnitude 18.5 object--less than 1/100,000 the brightness of the
faintest star visible to the human eye. One side is brighter than the
other. It's composed of some still unidentified dark material and
water ice. It has no satellites.</TE>
<TE>   Although it sounds basic, this is hard-won information. Distant
objects that do not give off their own light are difficult to study,
or even find, from the vantage point of Earth. The objects are so
faint, they yield few clues even when studied by more powerful
telescopes like the Hubble. Only the biggest objects yield much
meaningful information at all.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, astronomers had to scan by eye large photographic
plates of the night sky to look for distant objects. They sought
faint dots of light that changed position in the sky over the course
of the night. Computers now do most of the nastiest work, crunching
through digital images looking for objects that have moved.</TE>
<TE>   Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers such as Trujillo do
the rest, peering at images the computer has selected, to see if
there is indeed anything interesting there. "It's tedious," admitted
Brown, an associate professor of planetary astronomy at Caltech who
has been scanning the Kuiper Belt for five years using the Palomar
Observatory's 48-inch Oschin telescope in northern San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Before computers, objects such as Quaoar were easy to miss. Quaoar
itself was missed. After finding it in June, Brown went back to
photos former Caltech astronomer Charlie Kowal took in 1982 in his
search for Planet X. Quaoar was right there. Rather than a discovery,
astronomers call a find like Quaoar, whose existence was recorded but
not detected, a "precovery."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers' tentative starting lineup for tonight's exhibition
opener against the Lakers at Bakersfield looks nothing like the one
Coach Alvin Gentry envisioned when training camp began last week.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers are battered and bruised.</LD>
<LD>   Andre Miller and Eric Piatkowski will start at guard, as Gentry
expected. The rest is a worst-case scenario that has left Gentry
angry and frustrated since players began dropping at the College of
the Desert in Palm Desert.</LD>
<TE>   Sean Rooks will start at center, replacing Michael Olowokandi,
whose sore left knee was examined Monday by team physician Tony Daly.
Olowokandi has tendinitis and his status is day to day, according to
Daly.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Maggette will start at small forward, filling in for Lamar
Odom, who figures to be sidelined until December because of a
chronically sprained right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Cherokee Parks will be the power forward, taking Elton Brand's
place. The All-Star underwent arthroscopic knee surgery that may keep
him out until November.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven of the 19 players on the training-camp roster have
injuries, ranging from minor to serious, that could keep them out of
tonight's game. Several probably will play anyway. Brand, Odom,
Olowokandi, Keyon Dooling (ankle) and Quentin Richardson (knee)
definitely will not.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson's condition was upgraded after an MRI exam to a
sprained right knee from a partially torn ligament, Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my 15th year of coaching in the NBA and I've never
experienced anything like it," Gentry said as the Clippers broke
camp. "We're going to have to play our young guys. We want to see
[draft picks] Chris Wilcox and Melvin Ely in the preseason, but I'm
not going to play guys 40 minutes a game in the preseason. I'm not
going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Ely has tendinitis in the big toe of his left foot and Wilcox a
strained right thigh. Each is questionable for tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott Teaford</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker rookie Kareem Rush has a small place in Venice, where he
lives with his brother (and former UCLA player) JaRon and a trainer.</TE>
<TE>   He hangs out with some of the other young players at Laker camp,
Jannero Pargo for one, but said he mostly tries not to overextend
himself in the first weeks of his NBA career.</TE>
<TE>   Many days, Rush arrives for work and immediately goes about
defending Kobe Bryant, because they play the same shooting guard
position, and that's a lot to ask from a guy whose head has been in
assistant coach Tex Winter's little red book about offense all
summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to get stronger," Rush said of defending the thicker
Bryant. "I've always been the bigger guard. I've never had guards
post me up before."</TE>
<TE>   Rush is 6 feet 6 and 215 pounds, statistically about Bryant's
size, but he doesn't look it.</TE>
<TE>   "I figure everybody else isn't going to be as tough to defend," he
said. "I mean, he's scoring on me, but he's not killing me."</TE>
<TE>   The coaching staff has been pleased enough with Rush, who seems to
have an easy demeanor, a nice sense about the game and, of course, a
very accurate jump shot. "We're hopeful," Coach Phil Jackson said.
"If he's talented enough, he's going to play. But, we can't expect
anything from him. We have to give him an opportunity to learn."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox and Slava Medvedenko sat out Monday's practice because of
back spasms. Fox might not accompany the team to Bakersfield for the
exhibition game against the Clippers.... Bryant on Medvedenko, in his
third camp with the Lakers: "As far as Slava, he's been in this
offense for two or three years and still doesn't know it." He also
chided Medvedenko for missing practice "with a scratch on his back."
... Robert Horry banged knees with Nick Sheppard as practice wound
down. Horry's right knee seemed to take the worst of it.... Jackson
claimed Shaquille O'Neal has lobbied to accompany the team to Little
Rock, Ark., on Thursday: "He thinks former President Clinton is going
to be down there. They can exchange some Po' Boys or something. Do
they have Po' Boys in Arkansas?"</TE>

<HD>Surprise, Surprise</HD>
<DH>Angels and Twins both proved harder to eliminate than
anyone expected</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The owner wants to sell the team. The team qualifies for the
playoffs. The community rallies around the team. The team stuns the
baseball world with an upset in the first round in the playoffs,
advancing within four victories of the World Series. And, yes, the
owner jumps on the bandwagon, drenched in champagne.</LD>
<LD>   This is a team of destiny.</LD>
<LD>   This team is not the Angels.</LD>
<TE>   Any other October, the team founded by a singing cowboy, the team
with that mischievous monkey mascot, the team that cast aside four
decades of frustration by winning a postseason series for the first
time in franchise history, the team that knocked the big, bad Yankee
bullies out of the playoffs, would be America's sweethearts.</TE>
<TE>   This October, however, the Minnesota Twins are the sentimental
favorites, for one simple reason: Their owner, and his fellow owners,
conspired to kill the team last winter. "We proved to a lot of people
that you couldn't get rid of us," Minnesota closer Eddie Guardado
said.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels and Twins open a most improbable American League
championship series tonight, fans can argue for either team as a team
of destiny. On that basis, Anaheim pitcher Scott Schoeneweis
suggested his team should prevail.</TE>
<TE>   "We're named the Angels. That gives us the edge," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels weren't supposed to be here, not after finishing 41
games out of first place last year.</TE>
<TE>   But, said Minnesota center fielder Torii Hunter, "We weren't
supposed to be here, literally."</TE>
<TE>   And so, 11 months after Minnesota owner Carl Pohlad volunteered
his team for elimination, sending Twin fans scurrying to collect 2002
pocket schedules as souvenirs in case the team really did fold, the
Twins are alive and well. All but one of their American League rivals
have gone into hibernation for the winter, and the Angels are the
lone remaining obstacle between the Twins and the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't us here," Angel pitcher Jarrod Washburn said, "I'd
probably be pulling for them."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn grew up watching the Twins play, a two-hour drive from
the family home in Wisconsin. Angel center fielder Darin Erstad piled
into the car to catch the Twins, too, a six-hour drive from his home
in North Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins could use a new ballpark, sure. The attendance isn't the
greatest. But the team belongs to the people of the Upper Midwest, a
point driven home in a corny jingle played before each game that
encourages fans to "shout out hip, hooray, cheer for your Minnesota
Twins today."</TE>
<TE>   So Pohlad, who put his hand up when Selig asked for volunteers for
the so-called contraction plan, became a villain here. So did Selig,
who announced the plan to kill the Twins and then asked why anyone
would consider it a sad day.</TE>
<TE>   But the good folks here discovered heroes too--Terry Ryan, the
general manager who vowed to go down with the ship rather than
interview for other jobs; Harry Crump, the judge who ruled that the
Metrodome lease required the Twins to field a team rather than just
write a rent check; Gov. Jesse Ventura, the former wrestler whose
oratory in the halls of Congress embarrassed Selig.</TE>
<TE>   Contraction failed, and the Twins lived to play another day. They
won the AL Central by 13 1/2 games. They beat the supposedly
invincible Oakland Athletics in the first round of the
playoffs--Pohlad joined in the clubhouse celebration, somewhat
awkwardly--and their team plane was greeted here by 1,500 fans,
screaming outside in 38-degree weather.</TE>
<TE>   "We pretty much showed the world the last thing they need to do is
contract," said Kirby Puckett, Minnesota's Hall of Fame outfielder.</TE>
<TE>   "And Oakland had 31,000 people for two games. We had 56,000. Who
are you going to contract?"</TE>
<TE>   Selig insisted Monday that he is happy for the Twins, for their
survival and prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great story," he said. "It adds to the excitement of the
playoffs. I give all the credit in the world to the Twins. As it
turned out, the story had a happy ending."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins are not so willing to forgive and forget, not with the
delicious possibility that they could win the World Series and Selig
would have to walk into their clubhouse to present the championship
trophy.</TE>
<TE>   "That," infielder Denny Hocking said, "is something everybody in
here has talked about.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to be rated G."</TE>
<TE>   If the Twins do not advance to the World Series, they promise to
cheer for the Angels. While the owners approach getting rid of the
team in different ways--Disney never considered taking the money and
folding the team--the Minnesota players appreciate the Angels and
their special season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's phenomenal for baseball, the fact that us and the Angels are
the last two teams standing in the American League," Hocking said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever wins, it's going to be a good story--contraction to
champions, or the end of all those years of frustration."</TE>
<TE>   Said first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz: "As much a feel-good story
as we are, they are too. Regardless of who goes, it's awesome that
one of us will represent our league in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone's destiny is going to be ended. We just hope it's not
ours. But, whoever wins the series, you've got to feel great about
it.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's not us, I'm glad it's not the Yankees."</TE>

<HD>No Fly Ball Routine in Dome</HD>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Angels saw the division series highlights of Oakland first
baseman Scott Hatteberg losing a popup in the Metrodome roof and A's
second baseman Mark Ellis crashing into Hatteberg on another popup
because the two couldn't communicate over the crowd noise.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight, it's their turn to get thrown into the din of the dome,
where every fly ball seems to be an adventure. Even Torii Hunter, the
Twins' Gold Glove center fielder, said he lost track of five fly
balls in the dingy gray roof in Game 4 of the division series before
recovering to catch them.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to be tough," Angel left fielder Darin Erstad said.
"You just hope, either way, that the game isn't decided on a play
like that."</LD>
<TE>   Erstad, who wears amber-colored glasses in hopes of creating more
of a contrast between the ball and the roof, has had a tough enough
time tracking fly balls when the stadium is empty, much less doing
that with 56,000 fans screaming at the top of their lungs.</TE>
<TE>   The key, Erstad said, is to remain aggressive yet calm, to know
what territory you're responsible for, and to rely on hand gestures
instead of your voice to communicate with teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be waving like a mad man out there," Erstad said.
"The biggest thing is you can't take your eye off the ball. You have
to get to a spot where you want to catch it early and trust your
read.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lose it, you can't panic. You've got to stay calm, be
patient, and it will come out."</TE>
<TE>   On drives in the gaps, Erstad needs to be the commander-in-chief.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to understand not only your range, but the guy next to
you," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "And it's going to be natural
territory where you know a ball's hit that Darin is going to catch or
Garret [Anderson, Angel left fielder] is going to catch.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to rely on your instincts and go back to the premise of
basic defensive baseball, where the center fielder has priority in
the outfield and any outfielder has priority over an infielder on a
popup."</TE>
<TE>   Angel second baseman Adam Kennedy has been trying to visualize the
conditions, an ear-splitting capacity crowd waving white hankies, but
there is no substitute for the actual experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it will be crazy," Kennedy said. "You won't be able to
hear. You'll have to start looking for people. That's hard, because
you don't want to take your eye off the ball."</TE>

<TE>   Tickets for possible World Series games at Edison Field will go on
sale Wednesday at 9 a.m., at the ballpark, via the Ticketmaster
charge line at (714) 663-9000 and online at www.angelsbaseball.com.
Tickets will not be sold at Ticketmaster retail outlets.</TE>
<TE>   Prices range from $60 to $175 per ticket. If the Angels beat
Minnesota, they would play host to the first two games of the World
Series Oct. 19-20 and, if necessary, the sixth and seventh games Oct.
26-27.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, gambling that Ramon Ortiz can control his emotions and
his fastballs, set up a starting rotation in which he could pitch two
games within a caldron of noise in a stadium nicknamed the Homerdome.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz, who led the majors in home runs allowed, gave up six runs
in 2 2/3 innings in his division series start against the Yankees. In
the first inning, he threw 10 balls in 11 pitches at one point and
failed to cover third base on one play, allowing Derek Jeter a free
base.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Appier starts here tonight and Ortiz follows Wednesday, with
ace Jarrod Washburn starting Game 3 Friday in Anaheim and rookie John
Lackey starting Game 4. That would set up Washburn to start a
potential seventh game.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins will start Joe Mays and Rick Reed in the two games here,
followed by Eric Milton and Brad Radke. Mays did not face the Angels
this season, but Reed pitched a three-hitter in a 5-1 victory at
Anaheim. Milton no-hit the Angels three years ago; Radke is 11-5 with
a 1.72 earned-run average against the Angels.</TE>

<TE>   After major league owners consolidated the administrative
functions of the National and American leagues three years ago,
abolishing the league presidencies in the process, Commissioner Bud
Selig decided that tradition demanded each league have an honorary
president.</TE>
<TE>   As honorary president of the American League, Selig appointed
Jackie Autry, a former member of the owners' executive council and
widow of the Angels' original owner, Gene Autry. Jackie Autry joined
in the clubhouse celebration after the Angels' division series
victory over the Yankees. If the Angels beat Minnesota, her duty as
honorary president would be to present the league championship trophy
to the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Dennis Cook, told he would not be added to the playoff
roster, underwent arthroscopic surgery Friday to repair a torn labrum
and rotator cuff in his pitching shoulder.... Although teams can make
changes on their playoff roster between rounds, the Angels made none.
The Twins removed infielder Denny Hocking and reliever Tony Fiore and
added infielder David Lamb and reliever Bob Wells. Hocking was spiked
during the Twins' victory celebration Sunday, losing the nail and
suffering a gash on the middle finger of his right hand; Fiore had a
20.25 ERA in the first round.... The Angels are trying to get Nolan
Ryan, who threw four no-hitters during his eight years in Anaheim, to
throw out a ceremonial first pitch when the series moves to Edison
Field this weekend.</TE>

<DH>Television: Fox executive believes a riveting Angel-Twin
series is better than simply having big-name team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not about the New York Yankees, as much as it's about the story.</LD>
<LD>   On the eve of an Angel-Minnesota Twin American League championship
series that lacks the drawing power of sports' most powerful dynasty,
Fox Sports President Ed Goren argued Monday that this showdown
between the Southland's second-favorite team and contraction's
escapees provides numerous selling points that foretell a ratings
winner.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been talking in our promos about October's magical
matchups. Well, Cinderella has showed up in both of these very
compelling teams," Goren said. "Late in an Angels' game, how many of
those guys have dirty uniforms? They play the game like it should be
played. The Twins weren't even money to make it to spring training,
much less the World Series."</LD>
<TE>   Goren contends the elements are in place for the series to help
Fox improve upon its 2001 championship series rating of 7.0--11.2
million households. A network source expressed an Angel-Twin ratings
goal of 8.0--12.8 million households.</TE>
<TE>   The two dynamics that would help Fox's cause most are a lengthy
series of close games. Dan Bell, Fox Sports' director of
communications, noted that the Yankees' World Series sweep of the San
Diego Padres in 1998 drew a 14.1 rating on Fox, while the seven-game
1997 World Series between the Florida Marlins and Cleveland Indians
had a 16.7 rating on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever wins Game 1, I tend to root for the other team in Game
2," Goren said. "I don't care if it's the Yankees and Dodgers, a
series sweep negatively affects ratings. You always want the drama to
play out to the max. That's what makes this the best time of year in
sports television."</TE>
<TE>   For baseball viewers, the worst of the best is over. Fox will
broadcast all championship series and World Series games.</TE>
<TE>   The mishmash of networks that televised the four division
series--ABC Family, ESPN, Fox, FX--made for a frustrating, confusing
journey with the remote. An ABC Family spokeswoman said her
first-year company received several complaints regarding Major League
Baseball's decision to designate Game 1 of the St. Louis-Arizona
series as an 8 p.m. start (10 p.m. in St. Louis) on an obscure cable
network that broadcast no regular season games.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's networks, which include ABC Family, were assigned up to
12 division series games by Major League Baseball, which also
directed the scheduling. As a result, those who channel-surfed
through DirecTV on Sunday might have missed Game 5 of the
Twin-Oakland A's division series on ABC Family. A program listing
incorrectly identified the game as "Till Dad Do Us Part," a TV comedy
marking a reunion of former "Night Court" co-stars John Larroquette
and Markie Post.</TE>
<TE>   Although ABC Family (formerly Fox Family) enjoyed a significant
ratings boost with baseball--Friday night's Yankee-Angel game drew a
3.8 rating during a time slot that otherwise averages 0.8--network
President Angela Shapiro told Daily Variety on Monday that she would
prefer to halt playoff broadcasts in the future. "They just don't
speak to the brand and sensibility [of the network]," Shapiro said.
ABC Family has contractual rights to broadcast division series games
through 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Fox spent $2.5 billion to win exclusive broadcast rights to the
championship series and World Series through 2006, an investment
strengthened, Goren said, by riveting games.</TE>
<TE>   "This [Angel-Twin] series puts us in two stadiums that might be
the loudest indoor and outdoor stadiums in baseball," Goren said. "I
haven't seen a louder stadium than Anaheim's the other night. One of
the things I've told my announcers and producers for this series is,
'Less is more. We can't sell the game more than allowing the crowd to
lay out its emotion.' "</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Goren said the Los Angeles market is not treating
the Angels as the Dodgers' unattractive stepbrother. Los Angeles
viewers displayed significant interest in the division series by
producing more viewers than in New York and helping lift Saturday's
clincher to a 6.4 rating that was 49% better than a Seattle-Cleveland
game of similar importance in 2001.</TE>

<LD>Steve Kelley from the Seattle Times has a warning for NBA fans, if
they haven't already figured out Utah Jazz guard John Stockton:</LD>
<LD>   "Don't let John Stockton fool you. Don't be fooled by his soft
features. Or his low-to-the-ground game. Or his short, old-school
shorts. Or the flecks of gray in his close-cropped IRS agent's
haircut.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't be fooled by Stockton's appearance or his game. At 6 feet
1, he is as intimidating as a Shaquille O'Neal elbow, still as
difficult to figure out as Jason Kidd in the open court. Even now at
age 40, Stockton, who is beginning his 19th season at Utah, is the
gold standard of point guards ...</LD>
<TE>   "Ask any opponent about his favorite John Stockton moment and most
will tell you there are none. It's like asking a favorite story about
a root canal."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NFL record for most consecutive games
scoring touchdowns?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angels to the rescue: Thomas Boswell in the Washington Post: "The
Anaheim Angels, so lost in the baseball wilds that Disney has tried
in vain to find a sucker to buy them, did the whole sport a favor by
both licking the Yankees and exposing basic vulnerabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "A few days ago, it was noted here that Yankee pitching, the core
of Joe Torre's creation, was finally starting to look old.</TE>
<TE>   "But New York's weakest link showed up one series sooner than many
dared to hope. The 103-win A's didn't deliver the knockout; the
Angels, who lost 87 in '01, did."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mixed feelings: Steve Jacobson in Newsday: "I'm sorry to see Bobby
Valentine gone from the Mets. Then again, I'm not so sorry to see him
gone. He's a very complex person, which will make him a difficult
hire for some other club. He's been around so long that he must have
an enemy in a lot of organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very smart and very broad, which makes him so much more
interesting than most managers. Then again, he's not always smarter
than everyone else, which makes him dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perspective: David Justice of the Oakland Athletics, a veteran of
baseball playoffs, on dealing with postseason pressure: "The thing to
remember is, no matter what happens, three days after the World
Series, everyone will be talking about football."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chew on this: Dwight Perry in the Seattle Times: "According to
court documents from Mike Tyson's latest divorce proceedings, the
former heavyweight champ rang up $230,000 in cell phone and pager
charges from 1995 to 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "Even more shocking, those figures don't include the tab for
Evander Holyfield's earpieces."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1910, USC defeated Chaffey High,
65-6. USC was coached by Dean Cromwell, who later became one of the
best track coaches in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Lenny Moore of Baltimore, 18, 1963 to 1965.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Philadelphia Eagle Coach Andy Reid says on NFL.com
that the size of the hand is a big factor to being a great throwing
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   "You're generally looking for a hand that measures in the 7 1/2-to
10-inch-area from the tip of the little finger to the tip of the
thumb when the hand is spread out. Anything more than 10 inches is
icing on the cake."</TE>
<TE>   Reid says the Eagles' Donovan McNabb and the Packers' Brett Favre
are among the best big-hand quarterbacks in the game.</TE>

merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, heard, observed,

<LD>   What: "Beg, Borrow &amp; Deal"</LD>
<LD>   Where: ESPN, today, 5 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Don't know why, but this reality show, sort of a sports game show
version of "Survivor," is addictive. The premise is so dumb that
somehow it works.</TE>
<TE>   Two teams of four members each--two males, two females--are trying
to cross the country with no money, no credit cards, no cell phones,
and no change of clothes. They have to beg, borrow and deal their way
across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Today's show is the fourth of eight shown Tuesdays at 5 p.m. on
ESPN and repeated throughout the week.</TE>
<TE>   To make things a little more difficult--actually a lot more
difficult--each team has to complete 10 sports tasks from a list of
40. For example, catch a 35-yard pass from an NFL quarterback. Both
teams have already done that.</TE>
<TE>   In today's show, one of the teams, which moves out to a
considerable lead, achieves its fifth task when each member scores
against an NHL goalie.</TE>
<TE>   The contestants, picked from some 1,500 who were interviewed,
can't tell people exactly what they are doing--only that they are on
an adventure and the TV cameraman is there to document it.</TE>
<TE>   The show is produced by a Hollywood company, Neil and Michael
Mandt's Broken Twig Productions.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the eight contestants are Southern Californians. Our
favorite is Juliet Rogulewski, a USC graduate and a likable brat.</TE>
<TE>   On today's show, Juliet's team ends up at her parents' house in
Chicago. Actually, it's a mansion. Meanwhile, the other team sleeps
on the ground at a trailer park in Richmond, Va.</TE>

<DH>Hockey: Anaheim turns to new coach, general manager,
marquee players and even fan-friendly policies in makeover bid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A large banner draped on the Arrowhead Pond has a not-so cryptic
message for Mighty Duck fans.</LD>
<LD>   "A New Decade Begins," is what it says.</LD>
<LD>   "Under New Management," is what it means.</LD>
<TE>   Certainly team officials, with their "A Mighty Decade" sales
pitch, are going to great lengths to convince people that life is
going to be different at the NHL's emptiest arena. In fact, they are
so eager to present the "new Ducks" that they are ready to call it a
decade after only nine seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Math aside, there are stirrings from a franchise that finished
last in the Pacific Division, last on the power play and last in
attendance last season.</TE>
<TE>   On the ice, General Manager Bryan Murray, who replaced the deposed
Pierre Gauthier last spring, got the attention of the remaining fans
by retooling the Ducks on the fly. He made marquee moves, signing
Adam Oates and Fredrik Olausson and trading for Petr Sykora. He also
hired Mike Babcock as coach, showing enough confidence to entrust
these changes to a man who has never coached or played in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   In the front office, Murray did Bob Villa-like work in renovating
the organization's infrastructure, from the Disney Ice training
facility to the computer system to the scouting department.</TE>
<TE>   At the fan front, Doug Moss, hired as the senior vice president of
business operations, reduced some season-ticket prices and has
installed a fan-friendly environment not experienced at the Pond in
years.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, these changes will mean so much more should the Ducks
actually win a few more games. That quest begins Thursday at St.
Louis in the regular-season opener. Without on-ice improvement, the
off-season becomes little more than a new coat of paint on a
tumbledown shack.</TE>
<TE>   Still, after a mighty painful decade, Duck fans can look to one
important addition: hope.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a whole new attitude here," center Matt Cullen said.
"Guys aren't walking around nervous, looking over their shoulder.
There has been a commitment to the team."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's a long-term commitment or merely a little spit and
polish to lure a buyer is unknown. The Ducks, like the Angels, are
being shopped around and the price has been reduced to the red-tag
area of $100-million, hockey sources say.</TE>
<TE>   A run for a playoff spot would certainly attract attention, as it
did with the Disney-owned Angels. Disney CEO Michael Eisner, mum for
more than two years about the hockey team he founded, may even agree
to be digitally added to the team photo, as he did in every season
after the first until disappearing after the 1995-96 photo.</TE>
<TE>   But, before fiddling with Eisner's image, the Ducks have to work
on their own. Since digitally adding themselves to the playoffs was
impossible, the Ducks had to change.</TE>
<TE>   That started with the firing of Gauthier and then kept coming,
from the signing of Oates to the hiring of a full-time strength
coach, Shawn Skahan, to bringing in Moss, who has spent the summer
trying to mend fences with apathetic fans and unhappy sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   The fans have made their message clear. The Ducks had the 21
smallest crowds in franchise history last season. Moss' first
response after being hired last spring was to cut season-ticket
prices on 9,053 seats in the 17,174-seat Pond. The team also gave the
Pond's standing-room-only areas to the adjacent suite owners.</TE>
<TE>   There have also been minor, but unprecedented, policy changes.
Fans now are allowed to bring signs into games, providing the
messages fall within the boundaries of good taste. They are also
permitted to watch pregame warmups and to tailgate in the parking lot
before games. Practices are open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the home-ice advantage," Moss said. "What we are trying
to tell the fans is, we appreciate them. We want to go above and
beyond to show them that."</TE>
<TE>   The tinkering on hockey's ultimate fixer-upper was extensive, with
Disney providing the home-improvement loan. The Ducks' player payroll
tops $40 million for the first time in franchise history but the
spending went beyond on-ice talent.</TE>
<TE>   Murray added five scouts and hired Chuck Fletcher as director of
hockey operations. The Ducks arranged an exclusive arrangement to run
minor league Cincinnati, which they shared with Detroit the last six
seasons. Disney also spent $250,000 modernizing the team's training
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Moss was brought in to run the business side in Disney's
two-headed approach to sports franchise management. He hired 10 new
staffers and is hiring a marketing director to work for the Ducks
exclusively. Since buying the Angels in 1996, Disney has used one
marketing director for both teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to show the players we really cared and were not
satisfied," Murray said. "That Disney was not satisfied and wanted to
do things to make the team better."</TE>
<TE>   There certainly was room for improvement. The Ducks finished 26
points out of a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt there had be changes made, period," Murray said. "When a
team doesn't perform to a level, making changes stimulates a lot of
interest in players and provides motivation."</TE>
<TE>   Murray, the team's coach last season, knew all too well the Ducks'
weaknesses and went to work. The Ducks lost 21 one-goal games, the
most in the NHL, and failed to score a power-play goal in 14 of those
losses.</TE>
<TE>   So Murray set out to fix the league's worst power play. He signed
Oates, eighth all-time on the NHL assist list, and Olausson, a
blue-line specialist who is in his third tour of duty with the Ducks.
Murray also picked up a sniper in Sykora, part of a six-player deal
that cost the Ducks two unhappy players, defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky
and right wing Jeff Friesen.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be a little better at moving the puck, but with the
players we have, we can have a great power play," team captain Paul
Kariya said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks also have a deeper talent pool. Murray signed prospects,
among them the talented Stanislav Chistov and Alexei Smirnov.
Gauthier had been reluctant to bring in the team's higher draft
picks, hockey sources said, because his bonus was tied to the budget.</TE>
<TE>   The talent upgrade has been obvious, as is the change in
philosophy. Veterans Jason York and left wing German Titov, the
team's top free-agent signings the last two summers, were sent
packing last week, even though the Ducks still owe $5.5 million on
their contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "We been through good things here and, seen some not-good things,"
center Steve Rucchin said. "There is no question now that good things
are on horizon. I like the way the organization is making a stand and
trying to become a competitive team in this league."</TE>

<TE>   2001-02 record: 29-42-8-3, 69 points; 5th in Pacific Division</TE>
<TE>   The coach: Mike Babcock, first season (coached Cincinnati in AHL

<TE>   Who's gone: Oleg Tverdovsky, Jeff Friesen, Steve Shields, General

<TE>   What's new: Petr Sykora, Adam Oates, Fredrik Olausson.</TE>

<TE>   Projected goalie rotation: Giguere 60-65 games, Gerber the rest.</TE>
<TE>   Keys to the season: Power play, which ranked last in NHL, must
improve significantly. Olausson and Rucchin must avoid injuries. Some
help from younger players would be nice. Basically, a perfect season
from everyone is needed to make playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Franchise is better now than a year ago, on the ice and

<LD>Youth over experience is the Mighty Duck plan, at least as they start
the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   Samuel Pahlsson, who began last season centering the Ducks' top
line, was reassigned to minor league Cincinnati on Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Veterans Jason York, Denny Lambert and German Titov were shipped
out last week.</LD>
<TE>   Rookie forwards Stanislav Chistov and Alexei Smirnov made the
team. So did Jason Krog, a center who has played 26 NHL games.</TE>
<TE>   "We're keeping the young players to see how they are," General
Manager Bryan Murray. "But they got to get playing time. If they
appear not to be getting the minutes, we'll make a decision at that
time."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are left with only one immediate roster decision, which
will depend on the availability of defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski. If
Vishnevski, who has tendinitis in his right knee, can play in
Thursday's opener, then either Josh DeWolf or Chris O'Sullivan will
be sent to Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Pavel Trnka (strained groin) has resumed skating, but
is expected to start the season on injured reserve.</TE>
<TE>   He may be ready for the Ducks' home opener against Detroit on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Pahlsson began last season on the first line, along with Paul
Kariya and Timo Parssinen, who was let go and is back in Finland.
Pahlsson appeared in 80 games last season and was a solid defensive
player who scored only six goals.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Pahlsson was a victim of the higher level of talent in the
organization or merely had a so-so training camp, Coach Mike Babcock
would not say.</TE>
<TE>   "It might be that [there's more talent]," he said. "It might say
something about training camp. One would say that was the state of
the organization, a pessimist would say that's what training camp
showed."</TE>
<TE>   Krog, meanwhile, went to camp as a longshot. He is generously
listed at 5 feet 11, but outworked others to earn a spot as a
fourth-line center. Marc Chouinard, the line's center last season,
will split time at center and the wing.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Chistov and Smirnov fit there remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "You got to ask yourself how many kids can you play?" Babcock
said.</TE>
<TE>   He will play one, in defenseman Kurt Sauer, coming from juniors to
the NHL. Sauer will be paired with veteran Keith Carney, the Ducks'
top defenseman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   York, one of three veterans pushed out during camp, was also
reassigned to Cincinnati. He is owed $4-million over the next two
seasons, which played into his minor league assignment.</TE>
<TE>   The fates of Lambert and Titov are still to be determined. They
could be reassigned to another minor league team or a buyout could be
negotiated. Titov is owed $1.5-million this season. Lambert is owed
$550,000 this season and $600,000 in 2003-04.</TE>

<HD>Defense Is Unsung Hero of Galaxy</HD>
<DH>Soccer: L.A.'s offense has come alive in playoffs, but
defenders have been dominant too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seemingly lost in the Galaxy's recent offensive burst has been the
suffocating play of the Western Conference champion and top-seeded
team's defense.</LD>
<LD>   But that's OK with the Galaxy's back line players. They're used to
it, even after limiting the opposition to two goals in the last two
playoff games.</LD>
<LD>   "Anytime you're going for a championship and you score a lot of
goals, the emphasis is always on the guys that score goals, so it
comes with the territory," Galaxy defender Danny Califf said with a
grin. "As a defender, you grow up knowing that you're not going to be
the guy that gets your name in the paper or anything like that and
it's kind of what you expect.</LD>
<TE>   "You just put your head down and you know that you're not
necessarily going to get the respect or the notoriety, but you know
that your job is just as important as the guys that put the ball in
the back of the net."</TE>
<TE>   In the Galaxy's most recent victories--a 5-2 blowout of the Kansas
City Wizards in the deciding game of a first-round series and a 4-0
spanking of the Colorado Rapids in Game 1 of the semifinals--the
Galaxy defense and counterattack have sparked the offense.</TE>
<TE>   "What's really improved ... is the defending in the more advanced
parts of the field," Coach Sigi Schmid said. "I think our forwards
have done a better job helping us out defensively. We've gotten
tighter to people."</TE>
<TE>   Alexi Lalas, who was retired two years ago but is now a candidate
for Major League Soccer's comeback player of the year, has thrived in
his role as the Galaxy's sweeper behind man markers Califf and Tyrone
Marshall, who sat out Monday's practice because of flu.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're [a defender] to get headlines and to have girls
screaming at you, you're playing the wrong position," Lalas said with
a laugh. "You take your pleasures, and most of them are unseen. If
you've done your job correctly as a defender, people don't notice
you. So it could be lonely."</TE>
<TE>   Especially since a defender is rarely a hero, mostly a goat, in
the eyes of the uninitiated.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll be the first to run that replay over and over again when
you miss a tackle or you screw up a clearance or you take somebody
down with a penalty kick," said Lalas, who has picked up yellow cards
in each of the last two games. "It's a different mentality playing
defense. You can play well 99.9% of the time but that .1% that you
screw up, that's the one that could cost the game. You recognize that
responsibility and understand that that's your bed."</TE>

<HD>Big Swing for Bonds</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He scores twice, including homer, in Giants' 3-1
win in deciding game of NL division series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>They flew into the wee hours Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   And they danced into the wee hours Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Giants, who trailed the Dodgers by 4 1/2 games
in the National League wild-card race in late August, who lost two of
their first three games in the division series against the Atlanta
Braves, came back to win the last two games on opposite ends of the
country, beating Atlanta, 3-1, Monday night to advance to the league
championship series against the Cardinals, beginning Wednesday in St.
Louis.</LD>
<TE>   And nobody was happier about it than Barry Bonds, the Giant
outfielder, whose regular-season slugging feats have always been
counterbalanced by his postseason failures. He may be a modern day
Babe Ruth in the regular season, but he was Ernie Banks in the
postseason. Banks, the slugging shortstop of the Chicago Cubs, never
played in a World Series. Neither has Bonds, who had been on the
losing side in all five of his previous preliminary-round series.</TE>
<TE>   And how did he feel about Monday's victory?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," he said. "I've never been past the first round.
I'm shocked. I have seen a lot of celebrations by other teams."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds couldn't be sure he'd be celebrating himself until the final
out was made. The Braves had runners at first and third with no outs
in the ninth. But Giant reliever Robb Nen struck out Gary Sheffield
on 96-mph fastballs.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart was going 100 miles an hour," said Giant Manager Dusty
Baker. "I was saying, 'Be lucky.' And to be lucky, you've got to
think lucky."</TE>
<TE>   After Sheffield's strikeout, Chipper Jones hit a grounder to
first. First baseman J.T. Snow stepped on the bag for the second out
and then flipped to shortstop Rich Aurilia, who was blocking runner
Julio Franco's path to second.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere to run, no way to avoid elimination.</TE>
<TE>   Aurilia applied the tag, and the coup de grace, finishing the
double play that sent the Giants to St. Louis and Atlanta home to
ponder another frustrating ending to yet another division-winning
season.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, who had a hand in two of the Giants' three runs, will
gladly turn the postseason hex over to the Braves. They may have won
11 consecutive division titles, but only one World Series, in 1995,
over that frustrating span. They were last in the World Series in
1999, losing to the New York Yankees. The Braves lost in the division
series to the Cardinals in 2000 and in the NLCS to the Arizona
Diamondbacks last season.</TE>
<TE>   With a chance to wrap up this series Sunday night San Francisco,
the Braves fell behind, 7-0, and lost, 8-3.</TE>
<TE>   The clubs flew to Atlanta, arriving near dawn for the finale of
the best-of-five series. But neither home-field advantage nor the
constant din of the tomahawk chant nor a pitching staff that was
supposed to be the superior of the two, nor Sheffield, who was
supposed to supply added punch after being traded from Dodgers, was
enough to turn back the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Sheffield finished one for 16 in the series and is sure to receive
some of the blame for another disappointing finish.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Gary Sheffield is a great baseball player," said Bonds,
his close friend. "There should never be pressure on one player. They
have a team of All-Stars over there, so if the media comes down on
Gary Sheffield, they should watch their language."</TE>
<TE>   Was this loss among the toughest for Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox?</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a real professional and care about your sport," Cox
said, "they're all tough. We wanted to win as bad as anybody in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' single in the second led to the Giants' first run. He went
to second a groundout and then scored on Reggie Sanders' single to
center.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds led off the fourth with a towering home run that landed 417
feet from home plate in the left-center field seats.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago Monday, Bonds hit his single-season record 73rd home
run off the Dodgers' Dennis Springer.</TE>
<TE>   Did this one rival it in terms of vindication? Bonds wouldn't say.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't compare," he said. "The World Series is what it's all
about. I won't be satisfied until we win a World Series."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta pinch-hitter Mark DeRosa singled in a run in the sixth,
but the Giants' Kenny Lofton got it back with a sacrifice fly in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Ortiz hung in there long enough Monday to get the Giant
victory, with Nen getting the save. Atlanta starter Kevin Millwood
took the loss.</TE>
<TE>   And for once, Bonds didn't have to take the heat.</TE>

<LD>A year ago, professional golf paid little attention to Rich Beem.
Now, it seemingly can't get enough of him.</LD>
<LD>   Since fending off a charge by Tiger Woods and winning the PGA
Championship in August, Beem has become golf's personality du jour.</LD>
<LD>   His journey from car stereo salesman to major championship winner
has fascinated the media. His carefree attitude and tales of beer
drinking until dawn has won over blue-collar fans.</LD>
<TE>   This side of Woods, he's now among golf's most sought-after
celebrities. Everyone wants Beem in their tournament--including
Woods, who chose Beem among his four sponsor exemptions for the
Target World Challenge, Dec. 5-8, at Sherwood Country Club in
Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   It's one of six events that has filled Beem's off-season schedule,
starting with the Wendy's Three-Tour Challenge, Nov. 5, in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "December 9 is the day I don't have to do anything for anybody,"
Beem said. "That's when I get a little vacation."</TE>
<TE>   Not that Beem is complaining. Each event means a guaranteed
paycheck--$130,000 goes to the golfer who finishes last in the Target
event.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an O.K. trade-off," Beem said. "It could be a lot worse ...
I mean, I remember watching these things on TV and being jealous. Now
I'm playing in them."</TE>
<TE>   That's not all that has changed for Beem, who also won the Sprint
International this season. He now routinely plays before large
galleries in the premier pairings at tournaments, instead of in the
obscurity of early-morning or late-afternoon tee times.</TE>
<TE>   And because his picture is in newspapers, magazines and on
television, he has chosen to tone down his life in the fast lane,
where all-night benders were the norm.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little more recognizable now so I gotta watch myself," he
said. "I can't go light my hair on fire anymore."</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Sara, has helped. She gives him a companion on the road
so he won't be tempted to call up his buddies.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a good match for me," Beem said. "She's smart and beautiful
and I'm dumb and ugly."</TE>
<TE>   No matter how famous Beem becomes, he said his life hasn't changed
all that much. He's still living out of suitcases and playing
golf--just on a larger scale.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the Rolling Stones," Beem said. "If they're playing at
small clubs in front of 50 people or in front of 75,000, it's still
the same."</TE>
<TE>   One concern Beem has is living up to his success. He fears being
viewed as a failure if he doesn't have another good year, but can't
understand why reaching the pinnacle once isn't enough to satisfy the
fans or the media.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wants to know if I'm going to be the next Nick Price or
the next Wayne Grady," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Grady won the 1990 PGA Championship, but hasn't won since.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to think about that right now," he said. "I'm
just going to be the next Rich Beem, how's that?"</TE>

<HD>Gretzky's Favorite Forum</HD>
<DH>Hockey: At dinner celebrating upcoming jersey retirement,
he says he misses former home of the Kings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wayne Gretzky's retired jersey will hang in Staples Center, but part
of him wishes the familiar No. 99 could hang in the Forum, where the
all-time scoring leader played his eight seasons with the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, absolutely," Gretzky said Monday before a dinner in his honor
at Staples Center. "That was a special place, very unique. But you
know what? Time moves on and this building is spectacular....</LD>
<LD>   "But the atmosphere in the Forum, I'm not sure anybody can ever
replace that."</LD>
<TE>   The mood was light in Staples Center as Gretzky's family, former
teammates, coaches and friends gathered to salute The Great One at a
charity event hosted by KCBS sportscaster Jim Hill and comedian Alan
Thicke.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky's trade to the Kings from Edmonton in 1988 changed the
hockey landscape in the Southland, turning the sad-sack Kings into
Stanley Cup contenders. They never won it, but they reached the
finals in 1993 before losing to the Montreal Canadiens.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, it's a really exciting night for not only myself but
my whole family and friends," said Gretzky, who still calls Thousand
Oaks home although he is a 20% owner and managing general partner of
the Phoenix Coyotes. "I always felt honored to be part of the
National Hockey League. Everything I have in my life is because of
hockey, and to get your jersey retired in any city is something
special.</TE>
<TE>   "But here in L.A., to be part of this hockey team and this sports
city, as I've said before, this is home for us now. We love living
here."</TE>
<TE>   NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman flew in for Monday's program, as did
former teammates Paul Coffey, Jari Kurri, Kelly Hrudey, Rob Blake and
Tony Granato, among others.</TE>
<TE>   The current Kings and Coyotes, who will meet in Wednesday night's
season opener at Staples Center, were also among the guests.
Gretzky's jersey will be retired in a pregame ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   The guest of honor's guest of honor was Bruce McNall, who as owner
of the Kings made the trade that brought Gretzky to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky, who was traded to the St. Louis Blues in 1996 and retired
as a member of the New York Rangers in 1999, had made it clear that
he wouldn't attend a King ceremony honoring him until McNall was out
of prison.</TE>
<TE>   McNall, who served nearly four years on two counts of bank fraud
and one each of wire fraud and conspiracy, was touched by Gretzky's
generosity.</TE>
<TE>   "It means a lot to me, more than you can imagine," McNall said.</TE>
<TE>   Joked Gretzky: "It's a lot better visiting you here than in
Lompoc."</TE>

<HD>Stabilizing Their Kingdom</HD>
<DH>Hockey: As their opponents added players and changed
coaches, Kings go into season with many familiar faces and few
changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Andy Murray is aware of the hockey axiom that says a coaching
honeymoon in the NHL lasts no longer than three seasons. In the
fourth, according to conventional wisdom, his players start tuning
him out.</LD>
<LD>   The King coach, who has guided an ever-evolving team to three
consecutive 90-point seasons, also is aware of the perception that he
has changed his style because of it, that he has eased up on the
reins and stopped riding so hard.</LD>
<LD>   He doesn't buy it.</LD>
<TE>   If he has not publicly challenged any players this fall, as he did
a year ago with Glen Murray before the winger was traded to the
Boston Bruins, he said the reasons have more to do with familiarity
and trust than with timidity.</TE>
<TE>   His veterans know what to expect and have adjusted accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   "The players have created a different environment where I haven't
had to get after as many guys individually," Murray said. "But I
don't think the message has really changed as to how we do business.
We stay after it every day....</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried to put the onus on the players, and I think our
players know that we're going to be well-prepared for the games. And
so, when the puck is dropped, we turn it over to them to let them
make the determination for us."</TE>
<TE>   That philosophy has produced three consecutive playoff berths for
a franchise that had qualified only once in the six seasons before
Murray's arrival in 1999 from Shattuck-St. Mary's Academy in
Faribault, Minn., so the coach has spent little time worrying that
his players might turn a deaf ear.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably would have been easier to tune the coach out the
first year," said Murray, a former NHL assistant and Team Canada
coach. "I was a guy coming out of a prep school ... and didn't have a
lot of credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we've had three pretty good years. Why should you tune
somebody out that has delivered a bit of a message that if we play
this way, we can be successful?"</TE>
<TE>   Tuned in or not, the Kings would seem to be facing a crossroads
season. Other than a first-round upset of the Detroit Red Wings two
seasons ago, their regular-season achievements have not translated
into playoff success. They have advanced beyond the second round only
once in their 35 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, they overcame the deaths of scouts Ace Bailey and
Mark Bavis in the World Trade Center attacks, Murray's near-fatal
auto accident and one of the worst starts in franchise history to put
together the NHL's best record over the season's last 4 1/2 months.
In Jason Allison, acquired in the October trade that sent Glen Murray
and Jozef Stumpel to the Bruins, they added one of the league's
dominant centers. They compiled a franchise-best 2.29 goals-against
average, led the league in power-play goals and conversion percentage
and ranked third in penalty killing.</TE>
<TE>   But they had little to show for it after a 4-0 Game 7 loss to the
Colorado Avalanche in the opening round of the playoffs, their second
consecutive season-ending Game 7 loss to the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   And then, while nearly all their Western Conference rivals
strengthened themselves over the summer, the Kings did little to
upgrade their roster, failing to address their need for a top-six
forward while also losing their top two unrestricted free agents,
Philippe Boucher and Kelly Buchberger.</TE>
<TE>   So this could be Murray's most challenging season yet, considering
that the success of his first three has raised expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "No one will feel sorry for us if we don't get it done," says
Murray, who still suffers memory lapses but otherwise has recovered
from his February accident.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that other than Boucher, an offense-minded
defenseman whose absence will be felt even more acutely during the
opening month while Aaron Miller rehabs from abdominal surgery, the
core of the team remains.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings will again suit up one of the league's most dangerous
top lines in Allison, Ziggy Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh. They'll send
out a stingy corps of defensemen, led by Miller, captain Mattias
Norstrom and Mathieu Schneider, and a dedicated group of
defense-minded forwards. And in net most games they'll position a
workhorse goaltender in Felix Potvin, whose 71 appearances last
season were a club record and 2.31 goals-against average was the best
of his career.</TE>
<TE>   It's a strong team, but one with a thin margin for error and a
still-glaring need to find secondary scoring to support Allison,
Palffy and Deadmarsh.</TE>
<TE>   "Realistically, we're going to have to play our best all year to
be where we want to be," said Allison. "If we don't achieve at our
highest level, we're going to be in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Allison, Palffy and Deadmarsh combined for 80 goals last season,
nearly 40% of the Kings' total. Steve Heinze, with 15, was the only
other King to score more than 13. But Heinze didn't score any after
Jan. 15, leading to his demotion Monday to the minors and a possible
trade. Bryan Smolinski also slumped during the second half, scoring
only two empty-net goals after Jan. 5, and finished with 38 points,
the least productive season of his career.</TE>
<TE>   In their search for offense, the Kings signed four 20-year-old
forward prospects, but only Russian right wing Alexander Frolov
remains on the roster. Erstwhile checker Eric Belanger, meanwhile,
moves up to the second line and into an expanded role. He'll center a
line that probably will also include Frolov and Smolinski, whose
motivation could peak in his final season before unrestricted free
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Other newcomers have been added to provide depth but mostly this
is the same team that flew dejectedly out of Denver last April, one
that drew inspiration last spring from the Carolina Hurricanes'
surprising run to the Stanley Cup finals.</TE>
<TE>   Continuity and stability, they hope, has to count for something.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at that as a positive," Norstrom says. "Instead of saying,
'We didn't do this, we didn't do that,' I don't see a problem. We
have good chemistry on this team. I think we've proven in the past
that this is a good core group.</TE>
<TE>   "The grass is not always greener on the other side."</TE>

<TE>   Just the Facts</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 40-27-11-4, 95 points, 3rd in Pacific Division</TE>
<TE>   The coach: Andy Murray, fourth season (117-82-36-11, three playoff
appearances)</TE>
<TE>   Who's gone: Defenseman Philippe Boucher and forwards Kelly
Buchberger, Nelson Emerson, Adam Mair, Cliff Ronning and Steve
Heinze, who was demoted to the minors. Dave Tippett, a respected
assistant, is now coach of the Dallas Stars.</TE>
<TE>   What's new: Except for Boucher, the team's most disappointing
off-season loss, the nucleus of a strong team returns intact and
looks for offensive support from Eric Belanger, who moves up to the
second line, and rookie Alexander Frolov. John Van Boxmeer, former
coach of the Long Beach Ice Dogs, replaces Tippett.</TE>
<TE>   Projected lines: Deadmarsh-Allison-Palffy; Smolinski-E.
Belanger-Frolov; Johnson-Rasmussen-K. Belanger;
Eloranta-Chartrand-Laperriere.</TE>
<TE>   Projected defensive pairings: Norstrom-Lilja; Modry-Visnovsky;
Schneider-McAlpine.</TE>
<TE>   Projected goalie rotation: Felix Potvin might not make 70 starts
again, but don't be surprised if he makes at least 60. Jamie Storr
continues to wait in the wings.</TE>
<TE>   Keys to the season: Weathering the early absence of defenseman
Aaron Miller, who could be sidelined through October after abdominal
surgery; ability to play well defensively and finding secondary
scoring to support Allison, Palffy and Deadmarsh.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: After standing pat over the summer, the Kings remain a
middle-of-the-pack team in the top-heavy Western Conference, far
better than the conference's weak sisters but not yet among the
elite. Qualifying for the playoffs won't be easy.</TE>

<HD>Heinze, Flinn, Armstrong Are Demoted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Making decisions like the ones he made Monday is never easy for Coach
Andy Murray, who assigned veteran Steve Heinze and youngsters Derek
Armstrong and Ryan Flinn to Manchester in the American Hockey League.</LD>
<LD>   "The very, very hard decisions are the ones that bother you as a
coach," said Murray, who called Monday's 90-minute practice one of
the best since the Kings' opened training camp last month. "But if I
stopped caring and it stopped bothering when I cut players like this,
then I'm going to have to do something else."</LD>
<LD>   Heinze's days seemed numbered when the Kings left him unprotected
for last Friday's waiver draft. Signed to a three-year, $6-million
contract as an unrestricted free agent in July 2001, Heinze, 32,
scored 15 goals last season, ranking fourth on the team; but he had
none after Jan. 15. He ended the season with a 27-game goal-scoring
drought and was used sparingly late in the season and during the
playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   "He's done everything we've asked of him in training camp," Murray
said of Heinze, an 11-season veteran who has two years remaining on
his guaranteed contract which will pay him $2 million this season and
$2.25 million in 2003-04. "He's worked harder than he's ever worked
for us.... We simply feel at this time that we have some players who
have stepped ahead of him."</TE>
<TE>   The better youngsters Alexander Frolov and Jaroslav Bednar played,
the more expendable Heinze became. Murray talked to both Heinze and
Armstrong before the Kings took the ice for their morning workout.</TE>
<TE>   "They were both very professional about it and said they will work
hard to get back into the NHL," he said. "This is a difficult
time.... Ask me in April whether I'm happy or not [with the Kings'
final roster decisions]."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong, who was picked up in an off-season trade from the New
York Rangers, played well during the exhibition season but the Kings
are deep at center. Flinn, who impressed the Kings as an enforcer for
10 games last season, suffered a disk injury in his lower back early
in camp and will be sidelined indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With defenseman Aaron Miller expected to be put on injured
reserve, the Kings still have one roster move to make before their
regular-season opener against Phoenix Wednesday night at Staples
Center. With 14 forwards, eight defensemen and two goaltenders,
Murray hasn't decided whether the final cut will be up front or on
the blue line.</TE>
<TE>   "We like the dynamics of our team," Murray said. "The
multi-faceted ability that we have.... We're a little quicker,
stronger and bigger than we were last season and we're coming off the
best preseason that we've had in four years. I like our team but we
still have a lot of work ahead of us."</TE>

<HD>Ward Backs Women</HD>
<DH>Golf: USOC official states that he will 'aggressively work'
from within to open Augusta's doors to female members.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lloyd Ward, chief executive officer of the U.S. Olympic Committee and
one of the few African American members of Augusta National Golf
Club, pledged Monday to "aggressively work" for reform from within,
saying he was committed in the coming weeks to "breaking down
barriers which exclude women from membership at Augusta."</LD>
<LD>   In a letter sent Monday to Martha Burk, chair of the National
Council of Women's Organizations, which has been pushing Augusta
National to admit female members, Ward said he is "working with
others who are members of Augusta National Golf Club who share the
belief that the organization should include women in its membership
ranks."</LD>
<LD>   Ward also said in the letter that the USOC stands on a platform of
inclusion, fair play, sportsmanship and a "level playing field for
our athletes," and that platform "is also the cornerstone of my own
values and ideals."</LD>
<TE>   The letter, coming just days after Citigroup chairman Sanford I.
Weill became the first Augusta National member to publicly offer the
women's group his guarded support, provides added evidence of a push
for change within the club's locker room. Augusta National, site each
April of the Masters, has about 300 members, including chief
executives of some of the country's best-known companies. A few black
men are members, the first invited to join in the 1990s. A woman has
never been a member. Women can play at Augusta as guests.</TE>
<TE>   Burk welcomed Ward's letter, saying late Monday, "I'm gratified
Mr. Ward has come out so strongly in favor of change at Augusta and
in favor of fairness. I'm confident his stand will empower other CEOs
to follow his lead."</TE>
<TE>   But the timing and content of Ward's letter also underscores just
how delicate are the sensitivities, and how keen the risks, for a
public figure who has opted to remain a member of a private club that
has a long history of exclusionary membership policies.</TE>
<TE>   The four-paragraph letter clearly marks the strongest formal
statement to date from within club membership about the possibility
of change. The issue has been percolating for months, intensifying
since Aug. 30 when, in a bid to avoid pressure to admit female
members, Augusta National announced it would forgo commercial
television sponsorship--from Citigroup, IBM and Coca-Cola--for the
April 2003 Masters.</TE>
<TE>   But the letter does not say how Ward--or others--intend to effect
change. Nor does it lay out a timetable.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Ward has prided himself on being an aggressive,
out-front advocate for bold leadership, citing his own story as a
model of what is possible to achieve in the United States. He was a
Fortune 500 CEO, with the Maytag Corp., before becoming the USOC's
chief executive officer last year.</TE>
<TE>   But Ward has apparently dared not go so far as to even speak with
Burk. She said, "I have not talked to him personally." As he has
consistently in recent weeks, Ward declined Monday a request for
comment on the topic of Augusta National.</TE>
<TE>   And by releasing the letter on Monday, not beforehand, Ward
allowed himself the relative safety of following the lead of not only
one but two other high-profile executives--both of whom plunged
before him back into the public debate over Augusta National's
policies.</TE>
<TE>   After the release of the Citigroup statement on Weill's behalf
late last Friday, former Ford Motor Co. president Harold A. Poling
said on Saturday he expects Augusta National to invite a woman to
join and would prefer it be "resolved shortly." The Citigroup
statement was first reported in the New York Times, which also quoted
an anonymous Augusta member as saying that "maybe 20 members" were
working for change. Poling's remarks were first reported in the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   It's far from clear whether resolution is forthcoming in the near
future.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Ward's letter adds little to remarks he made in April,
when he told USA Today: "I want to have influence from the inside. I
want to talk to members of Augusta and say, quite frankly, that's
[admitting African Americans] simply not enough. You've got to have a
broader membership, and that includes women."</TE>

<PH>AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES: ANGELS VS. MINNESOTA</PH>
<KH>Ross Newhan ON BASEBALL</KH>
<HD>At Least He Tries to Do Right Thing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Kevin Appier certainly isn't the first pitcher to be described as a
left-hander trapped in a right-hander's body. After all, as Jarrod
Washburn, a pitcher and left-hander, puts it, "all successful
starting pitchers are a little goofy, and Kevin is a little more so.
It's not a bad thing."</LD>
<LD>   Appier, of course, hopes not and really doesn't think he's "weird
and strange" at all, and even Washburn, his Angel teammate, has
trouble coming up with specific examples other than saying, "Most
starting pitchers are goofy four of five days. Kevin is probably
goofiest one of five."</LD>
<LD>   Washburn meant that while most pitchers retreat into a cocoon on
the day they start, "it's like Kevin can't shut up. I mean, he's more
talkative than usual, more antsy than usual. It's fun to watch."</LD>
<TE>   Considering he is starting Game 1 of the American League
championship series against the Minnesota Twins tonight, Appier is
hopeful of providing more fun than usual, confident--as a 13-year
major league veteran--he knows how to leave the clubhouse chatter and
angst behind and attain the same "optimum" adrenaline level that he
did in his Yankee Stadium start in Game 2 of the division series.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels won that game, 8-6. Appier's three walks and 91 pitches
were more than he wanted to deliver, but two bloop singles
contributed to two of three runs he was charged with, and he
disengaged two Yankee threats to keep the Angels close in a win that
set the tone for the two that followed.</TE>
<TE>   If Yankee Stadium is aura and mystique, the Metrodome is
decibel-piercing noise and a gray canopy that is tantamount to the
Bermuda Triangle for fly balls.Or as second baseman Adam Kennedy
said, "All you can do is have everybody run toward where you think
it's coming down and hope you're right."</TE>
<TE>   The 34-year-old Appier has a 4-1 record and 2.34 earned-run
average in six games at the Metrodome, although he lost his only
start here this year and he produced that previous 4-0 record before
the Twins became as good as they now are, as good as they are in the
dome (54-27) and as good as they are against right-handed pitchers
(71-38).</TE>
<TE>   "We have our work cut out," Appier said. "I have my work cut out.
I know the noise is going to be pretty intense because I've never
heard it louder than it can get in here but I feel like I can block
that out pretty easily, that it won't be a factor in the way I pitch.
The biggest problem is for our fielders on fly balls."</TE>
<TE>   In the process, as the former Antelope Valley High and Antelope
Valley College pitcher makes this important start for the team that
was his favorite as a youngster ("this is definitely cool," he said),
viewers and listeners are likely to learn a little more as to why
some consider him a left-hander in a right-hander's body, why
Washburn leans to describing him as goofy.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they will be told about the time in Kansas City, struggling
with the Royals, that he took his uniform, cap, spikes and glove into
the shower area and burned them, or how he and former UCLA pitcher
Mike Magnante, a Royal teammate, would sit in a clubhouse corner and
talk about the speed of particles in space, or how former Kansas City
teammate Mark Gubicza described him as "Outer Space Bob, one of the
Jetsons."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they will be told about how the young Appier, although he
didn't grow up on a farm, always dreamed of having one and now lives
on a 270-acre spread in Paola, Kan., where he grows corn and beans
and has about 100 head of Angus cattle in a menagerie that includes
two camels that he gave his wife Laurie ("she's a female Dr.
Doolittle," he said) for Christmas last year because "she has always
been obsessed by camels." (A friend had located a Missouri breeding
farm on the Internet.)</TE>
<TE>   "Actually," Appier said, "I gave her one camel but it didn't get
along with our llama, so I had to get a second camel so that the
first camel would have a buddy."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they also will be told how Angel pitching coach Bud Black
called his former Kansas City teammate, George Brett, to find out
what kind of guy Appier was after the Angels obtained him from the
New York Mets in December for Mo Vaughn and Brett told him, "Well,
Bud, he's out there a little bit. He's a guy who knows how clouds are
formed, and how many pitchers do you have who can tell you how clouds
are formed? But first and foremost he's a competitor and you're going
to enjoy him."</TE>
<TE>   Appier sat on the Angel bench during a workout Monday and laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, he said, he's looked on as being a little different because
he's into things a lot of players aren't. Rather than playing golf,
for instance, he enjoys the Discovery channel and scientific journals
and repairing tractors and other machinery on his farm.</TE>
<TE>   "Does all that mean I'm pushing the extremes of normalcy?" he
asked.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels don't care.</TE>
<TE>   Appier gave them a 14-12 record, 188 1/3 innings and a clubhouse
free of Vaughn's whining about the merits of East Coast baseball over
West Coast baseball, and what does Mo think now?</TE>
<TE>   Appier also provided mentoring for Washburn and the other young
pitchers through what Black called his "old-school work ethic" and a
mound presence "in which he relentlessly throws every pitch as if
it's his last."</TE>
<TE>   Said Washburn: "There wasn't one aspect of pitching that we
haven't approached Kevin and Aaron Sele about."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, of course, it's Appier who approaches his biggest start
since the last one. The Angels are carrying the same 10 pitchers in
this best-of-seven-game series that they did in the best of five with
the Yankees, resisting the temptation to add Sele to the roster,
which places an even greater emphasis on the starters and means Scot
Shields will move into the long relief role that John Lackey, who
will start Game 4 in this series, filled so well in Game 3 of the
division series.</TE>
<TE>   Lost amid the offensive onslaught against the Yankees was the fact
that Angel pitching wasn't exactly flawless. The Angels had a 6.17
ERA, and now Appier goes to work having allowed 26 hits and 17 runs
in the 19 2/3 innings of his last four starts, including the division
series.</TE>
<TE>   It's a new season on top of a new season, however, and everyone
knows that a left-hander trapped in a right-hander's body isn't going
to be caught up worrying about what came before.</TE>

<LD>Michael Vick's sprained right shoulder hurt so much Monday that he
struggled to get dressed.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't put socks on," Vick said. "I really can't do anything
with it. It's just that sore and it's just that stiff. I feel like
I'm handicapped right now."</LD>
<LD>   A day after leaving in the third quarter of Atlanta's 20-6 loss to
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Falcons' quarterback agreed with Coach
Dan Reeves' decision to list him as doubtful for Sunday's game
against the Giants at New York.</LD>
<TE>   Vick fell on his nonthrowing shoulder when he was sacked by Simeon
Rice. Vick underwent several treatments Monday, but still felt sore
and stiff. X-rays were negative.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just going to take it day by day and see how it feels as
the week goes on," Vick said.</TE>
<TE>   If Vick can't play, the Falcons will start Doug Johnson. Johnson
was 13 of 25 for 150 yards and three interceptions against Tampa Bay.</TE>

<TE>   Seattle Seahawk linebacker Marcus Bell plans to appeal a $25,000
fine from the NFL for knocking down umpire Carl Madsen during a Sept.

<HD>League's Best Defense Will Be Good Offense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every few years, when enough players have complained that hooking,
holding and grabbing are smothering their creativity, NHL executives
decide to purge obstruction.</LD>
<LD>   But as soon as players begin parading to the penalty box, coaches
whine, referees back off, and what was a penalty in October isn't a
penalty in April. By the start of the playoffs, obstruction is worse
than ever, forcing skill players to fight through the defensive
tactics that have dramatically reduced scoring over the last decade.</LD>
<LD>   The NHL has targeted obstruction again this season, and NHL
Commissioner Gary Bettman insists this crusade won't fall short.
There's a reason for his confidence.</LD>
<TE>   During similar efforts in 1995 and 1998, referees worked alone.
This time, two referees will be on the ice to police each game. NHL
supervisors will evaluate referees' enforcement of the obstruction
rule, especially regarding the use of the free hand and the stick to
check when the opposing team has the puck. In addition, general
managers, coaches and on-ice officials will confer every 20 games to
help maintain consistency.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, the NHL has the backing of the executives,
coaches and referees it consulted before it introduced its latest
endeavor to clean up the game and capitalize on the world-class
skills of its players.</TE>
<TE>   "The part about laziness, the part about locking on and just
grabbing ahold of a guy, is just out," said Philadelphia Coach Ken
Hitchcock, adding that he's excited by the prospect of forechecking
becoming an offensive tool instead of merely a defensive tactic.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be called much stricter, and that way, it's going
to reward people who are hard-working offensive and hard-working
defensive teams.... The game will be played on the ice with more than
just the one-on-one or two-on-two taking place. The people away from
the puck, the working people away from the puck, are going to be
rewarded now."</TE>
<TE>   The NHL faces many difficult issues as it prepares to open its
86th season Wednesday. Its Canadian teams still face inequities
caused by the currency disadvantage. The league is operating the
Buffalo Sabres until a buyer can be found for the franchise, which
was orphaned by the financial fall of the Rigas family. Dallas Stars'
owner Tom Hicks is exploring selling his club, and the Mighty Ducks,
lauded a decade ago for bringing Disney into the ownership ranks, are
also on the block.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN will televise fewer games this season, an offshoot of
ABC/ESPN having bought the rights to NBA games. And with the
resolution of baseball's labor problems, the NHL stands next in line
for a work stoppage when its collective bargaining agreement with the
players' union expires on Sept. 15, 2004.</TE>
<TE>   But of all its concerns, none go to the heart of the game itself
as do the edicts to banish obstruction and adopt the "hurry-up" line
changes that sustained momentum and streamlined games during the Salt
Lake City Olympic hockey tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Few other changes seem as important to the future of the NHL. Its
national TV ratings remain low, and although its teams played to more
than 91% of capacity last season, hockey isn't as widely or deeply
entrenched as baseball, basketball or football. Giving
offense-oriented strategies better odds against the defenses that
have blighted the game might be the NHL's best marketing strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "Something had to happen," said Duck forward Paul Kariya, who
figures to benefit from the crackdown. "Scoring's down every year,
and that's what attracts fans. You want to have exciting, offensive
hockey, and it's tough to do that when you have 200-pound guys on
your back."</TE>
<TE>   The elimination of obstruction will challenge coaches who, whether
by choice or lack of scoring power, have resorted to defensive
schemes to slow superior teams. It will also challenge gifted players
to reinvigorate the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I really believe the smart players defensively have already
gotten onto it," San Jose Coach Darryl Sutter said. "If you're smart
and you can skate, it's not a problem. I think it'll be really good."</TE>
<TE>   The changes ask a lot from a lot of people. But nothing
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "I think these rules are good for our team," King Coach Andy
Murray said. "I don't think there's a lot wrong with the NHL game
now, and if this makes it better, we're in for a real treat."</TE>
<TE>   Said Duck General Manager Bryan Murray, "I believe if you demand
it of someone, the players will adapt. And by the time the season
starts, we'll be in better shape than we have been for a while. None
of us like 10 penalties a game, and that's where coaches come into
play. They have to warn players that if a guy takes a lot of
penalties, he's got to do something about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they have a great chance of succeeding with this.
Everyone wants it to happen to make the game better, and I'm sure it
will."</TE>
<TE>   King General Manager Dave Taylor said defending players must be
more aware of body position and must avoid one-handed reaches with
their sticks, but that other possibilities will open.</TE>
<TE>   "You might see the goalkeepers be a little more active," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Lowe, general manager of the Edmonton Oilers, anticipates
less body contact in the neutral zone but no drop in hitting in the
end zones.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we'll see a return to teams scoring 400 goals,
although it would be nice," he said. "I think there's still excellent
coaching in this league, and there's still players that are much more
aware defensively than they were a decade ago or two decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   "But this will allow for a little more freedom of movement, which
will enhance the product."</TE>
<TE>   All of which sounds great--as long as the rule is enforced evenly
and consistently.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they call it. That would be great for the game," said
speedy forward Tony Amonte of the Phoenix Coyotes. "You'll see a lot
more three-on-twos and you'll see people really skate.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're going to stick with it, great. Don't do it in camp and
then lay off. And in the playoffs, it seems like everything goes out
the window."</TE>
<TE>   Kariya is also skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll believe it when I see it," he said. "Even in the first two
exhibition games [at the Pond], I don't think they were strict enough
about it. I can just see that over the season, it's going to get
worse and worse."</TE>
<TE>   Kariya said knowing that former referee Andy van Hellemond, now
the NHL's director of officiating, was involved in the planning gave
him reason to hope this might take root.</TE>
<TE>   "Still, there are tendencies [to relax]," Kariya said.</TE>
<TE>   Not if Bettman has his way.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that the way the standard has been articulated and how
it's being implemented, we can hold it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what we have is a process that everybody is buying into."</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock singled out the Oilers, Colorado Avalanche, Kings and
Detroit Red Wings as teams most likely to benefit because they cycle
the puck well and throw players into the offense. Sutter included his
San Jose team in the mix.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a lot of really good skating teams that will be
helped, and most of the teams in the Western Conference," he said.
"Look at our [Pacific] division: all the clubs can really skate."</TE>
<TE>   The hurry-up line changes, popular at the Olympics, forbid players
to dally before faceoffs. Visiting teams will have five seconds to
make a line change after a stoppage and the home team will have eight
seconds. A team that tries to make a change after the referee gives
the stop sign will get a warning on the first offense and a bench
minor for subsequent offenses.</TE>
<TE>   The linesman conducting the faceoff will blow his whistle after
the referee has lowered his hand for the line changes, to indicate
all players must be in position and onside for the faceoff within
five seconds. Players who delay getting to the faceoff spot or line
up in an offside position will get warnings, then will be penalized
for any repeat violations. The last two provisions won't apply in the
last two minutes of regulation time or in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "It will dress up the game more and make players much more
conscious of line changes and getting the game going and not standing
there arguing with the linesman," Bryan Murray said. "They'd go out
and take the tape off their stick, talk to the linesman and then
skate back out to the circle. Sometimes it would take a good
half-minute or more to get it going. Now, we'll have a chance to get
momentum and have a chance to play more players."</TE>
<TE>   Said Andy Murray, "I wouldn't have wanted to have that rule right
after I came back from my concussion [the result of car accident last
season] because you have to be aware all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Bettman is aware that a lot is riding on these changes.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the best hockey being played every night, and if that
means some teams win a little more and some teams losing a little
more, so be it," he said. "And that's why I think it will improve the
flow, open up the game in ways that we've talked about, but I don't
think it will dramatically alter the standings. And if it does, so be
it."</TE>

<HD>Favre Better Than Average Bears</HD>
<DH>Pro football: Packer quarterback passes for 359 yards and
three touchdowns in 34-21 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHAMPAIGN, Ill.</DL>
<LD>One of the attractions in this college town--temporary address of the
Chicago Bears--is an 18-wheel fuel tanker that someone has converted
into an enormous barbecue. It is, without question, the NFL's longest
grill.</LD>
<LD>   But it's not to be confused with the NFL's longest grilling.</LD>
<LD>   That's what the Bears are enduring, and Green Bay quarterback
Brett Favre is turning the spit. He has beaten them nine consecutive
times on the road, and did so in grand style Monday, throwing for 359
yards and three first-half touchdowns in a 34-21 victory before a
sold-out--and shivering--crowd at Memorial Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   Looking as if he spent last week in Chicago's defensive meetings,
Favre repeatedly found gaping holes in the coverage and zipped
pinpoint passes through the cool night air.</TE>
<TE>   "That's one of the most impressive displays I've seen from a
quarterback," Packer cornerback Darrien Gordon said. "It was just fun
to sit back and watch that."</TE>
<TE>   The victory gave the Packers (4-1) a two-game lead over the
second-place Bears (2-3) in the NFC North, and improved Favre's
record to 17-4 against Chicago in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   As Favre jogged to the locker room after the game, Green Bay fans
serenaded him with chants of "MVP! MVP!" an award he earned three
times from 1995 though '97.</TE>
<TE>   "You've just got to give him credit," Packer center Frank Winters
said. "He's a guy that gets pumped up to play the Bears. He's just a
great player."</TE>
<TE>   The Bears made things interesting, partly because Packer kicker
Ryan Longwell missed two field goals in the second half, and a third
was blocked.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago quarterback Jim Miller orchestrated a nine-play, 62-yard
drive midway through the fourth quarter that he capped with a 21-yard
touchdown pass to John Davis, the tight end's second score of the
night. That gave the Bears hope and cut the lead to 34-21.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears tried an onside kick and failed, but got the ball back
when Longwell missed a 50-yarder with 3:22 remaining. Needing two
touchdowns to pull out a victory, Miller hooked up with David Terrell
for a 52-yard gain to the Packer seven. But on the next play, with
2:26 on the clock, his pass for Anthony Thomas was intercepted in the
end zone by linebacker Nate Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the crowd of 63,226 started streaming for the exits.
There was no denying they got their money's worth, at least in seeing
a tremendous performance by Favre.</TE>
<TE>   "He was into this game, and his leadership and his performance
were a big part of our victory," Packer Coach Mike Sherman said. "He
was pretty close to playing about as good a game as you can play. He
was extraordinary."</TE>
<TE>   On the first play of Green Bay's second possession, Favre rolled
left and heaved a pass that flew 60 yards before landing softly in
the hands of Donald Driver, who made the catch at the 25 and glided
into the end zone for an 85-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The next time the Packers got the ball, Favre complemented Green
Bay's solid ground game with surgically precise passing, finally
zipping one to tight end Tyrone Davis for a 19-yard score. Next, it
was a five-yard touchdown toss to Bubba Franks.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Favre lived up to the advance billing of Bear defensive
coordinator Greg Blache, who called him "the chairman of the board,
the best of the best, the Mac Daddy of football."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Packer defensive end Joe Johnson was the game's Smack
Daddy. When the Bears were threatening to score midway through the
third quarter, Johnson flattened Miller and sparked a huge defensive
play. The ball popped out of Miller's hands and was plucked out of
the sky by defensive end Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila, who dashed in the
other direction for a 72-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   On another night that could have been the knockout blow, but the
Bears kept things fairly close for much of the game, even when their
offense was sputtering.</TE>
<TE>   Safety Mike Brown, who scored a pair of game-winning touchdowns in
overtime last season, and scored at Buffalo last week, almost struck
again Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the second quarter, he scooped up a fumble by Driver and
weaved his way 35 yards to the Green Bay four.</TE>
<TE>   Three plays later, Miller found Davis with a one-yard touchdown
pass.</TE>
<TE>   But the star of the night was Favre.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got to start a franchise, that's the guy I would start
with," Blache said. "The guy's worth eight, nine wins [a season]
himself. He's probably the scariest guy in the league."</TE>

<HD>As Angels' Victories Mount, Three of Them Mourn Losses</HD>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Joe Maddon's father pitched batting practice to him, in the driveway,
with the garage as the backstop and their apartment as the target.</LD>
<LD>   "Every time I broke a window, he thought that was great," Maddon
recalled. "That meant my swing was coming around."</LD>
<LD>   Ron Roenicke's father taught him his swing, driving him to the
high school field after work, fastening his fingers around the bat,
day after day, giant hands over little ones.</LD>
<TE>   "Everything I know about hitting came from my dad," Roenicke said.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Black's mother didn't play baseball, didn't even drive, but
that didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   Before every game, she ironed his Little League uniform.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever heard of that before?" asked Black. "Somebody
ironing a Little League uniform?"</TE>
<TE>   He smiled and dabbed his eyes. These three Angel coaches do that a
lot these days, and it's not because they are blinking away
champagne.</TE>
<TE>   While reveling in an accomplishment forged partly with their
knowledge, the three coaches are mourning those who helped them gain
it.</TE>
<TE>   On April 13, Helen Black died. She was pitching coach Black's
mother.</TE>
<TE>   On April 15, Joe Maddon died. He was bench coach Maddon's father.</TE>
<TE>   Last Wednesday, Floyd Roenicke died. He was third-base coach Ron's
father.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother always said that bad things come in threes," noted
Maddon, shaking his head.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, when the Angels begin the American League championship
series against the Minnesota Twins, they hope to show that good
things also come in threes.</TE>
<TE>   They will scheme. They will shout. They will lead. They will hurt
too, but they will do that quietly, so as not to disturb this
possible championship in the making.</TE>
<TE>   The players will notice. The effect will be powerful.</TE>
<TE>   "We're impressed that our coaches are so close, and that they
never panic," said Tim Salmon. "You'd have to think that rubs off on
us."</TE>
<TE>   But the rub has often been raw.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, when the Angels defeated the New York Yankees to win
the first playoff series in club history, the three coaches mixed
grief with their bubbly.</TE>
<TE>   Roenicke, whose aggressiveness has led to countless Angel runs,
wandered aimlessly, back and forth from the clubhouse celebration
into a quiet back room, his face drawn, his shirt dry.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a little champagne on me but it just didn't feel right," he
said. "We had played really well and beat the Yankees ... but I know
my dad wasn't there."</TE>
<TE>   Black, whose calmness has steadied a young pitching staff, waited
until he reached his car before breaking down during a phone call to
his sister.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked about how proud Mom would have been," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maddon, who has bridged the gap between the old and new Angels,
found a back room and left a message for his mother.</TE>
<TE>   "I know my father was there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This week, in Minneapolis and Anaheim, they will all be there.</TE>
<TE>   In each of the three coaches, one can see the traits passed down
by the three parents.</TE>
<TE>   In looking around the Angel clubhouse, one can see how these
coaches have passed these traits on to the players.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels love to take chances. Some of that comes from the
windmill-imitating Roenicke. All of that came from his father.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd Roenicke was a baseball coach at Covina High who raised two
major leaguers, Ron and brother Gary.</TE>
<TE>   Ron said his father's faith taught him about honor and respect. He
said his father's ballpark blood taught him about sending a runner
from second.</TE>
<TE>   "We would talk all the time about how the only way to get players
to reach their potential is to let them go," Roenicke said. "If you
make a mistake, well, that happens. You just keep trying."</TE>
<TE>   Roenicke followed that rule last week when he returned to work
only one day after learning of his father's death.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he would have wanted me there," Roenicke said. "But it was
really hard."</TE>
<TE>   When Roenicke missed Monday's workout here to bury his father, the
other coaches did what they have done all year.</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo Griffin threw Roenicke's batting practice. Orlando Mercado
hit Roenicke's fungoes.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody chipped in. Nobody said a word.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody kind of shares the load around here," Maddon said.</TE>
<TE>   Understanding that the load is never too much, that is another
Angel trait. Some of that comes from Black. All of that came from his
mother.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a homemaker; she was home," Black said.</TE>
<TE>   His father Harry was a former USC athlete and pro hockey player.
His mother gave Black a sense of balance that he quietly tries to
give to his young pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   "From my mom, I learned that no matter what happened, you should
hang in there and keep your head up," he said. "No matter how I did
in Little League, no matter what time I got home, it was always, 'Can
I get you something to eat? What do you need? It's OK.' "</TE>
<TE>   The young Angels also have a certain steadiness that supports that
sense of self. Some of that comes from Maddon, and all of that came
from his father.</TE>
<TE>   "A simple, patient man," Maddon said.</TE>
<TE>   His father was a plumber. He lived and died in the apartment above
the plumbing and heating company founded by Maddon's grandfather in
northeastern Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   "We were never subscribers to the grass-is-greener theory," Maddon
said. "We believed that no matter where you worked hard, you would
get your reward."</TE>
<TE>   So as his father never left his shop, Maddon never left the
Angels. He has 28 years in the organization, 59 games as interim
manager.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the players have known him longer than they have known any
other coach. They trust him implicitly. He is fiercely loyal to both
them and Manager Mike Scioscia. He is, in all ways, his father's son.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that is why, before every game since his father's death,
Maddon looks up into the stands and picks out an empty seat. In that
seat, he imagines his father as a 22-year-old man.</TE>
<TE>   "From a picture I once saw," Maddon said. "Black hair, smiling,
happy, no pain. That's the way he'll always be."</TE>
<TE>   Maddon buried his father in an Angel cap. Last week his mother
sent him another Angel cap, the one his father wore in the last year
of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Between innings of the final three playoff games against the
Yankees, the roaming Maddon walked into the clubhouse and touched the
cap.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the Twins. Nobody will see the coaches' grief. Nobody will
see anything from these three coaches but the mound visits, the bunt
signs, the fungoes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the way it works, the way we have to be," said Black, his
smile firm, his uniform pressed.</TE>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Ron Gardenhire will be 45 in two weeks. His hair is stately white.
But watch out. Mr. Gardenhire is not above pulling the exploding golf
ball trick on Twin utility infielder David Ortiz. He also likes to
put peanut butter in guys' underwear.</LD>
<LD>   Gardenhire is the Twins' manager, a position of responsibility, of
serious purpose, yet he ran off the field Sunday after a brief
workout shouting "Boys, that's a wrap."</LD>
<LD>   A little jab at the Disney-owned Angels? Maybe not, but it would
be a good line if Gardenhire had intended it, wouldn't it?</LD>
<TE>   "Sure would," Gardenhire says.</TE>
<TE>   On the day after the Minnesota Twins upset the Oakland Athletics
in an American League division series, Gardenhire sits in his office
and says, quite frankly, he wouldn't be there if the league didn't
require him to fulfill media obligations.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm running on fumes," Gardenhire says. "But that's OK. We're
here for you."</TE>
<TE>   And, really, tired though Gardenhire and the Twins were after
arriving home from Oakland in the middle of the night, they wouldn't
have been anywhere else, not after a heart-wrenching ninth inning
Sunday in which they took a 5-1 lead and then endured an A's rally
that ended one run short with the tying run on first.</TE>
<TE>   That was better than great.</TE>
<TE>   Last winter, the situation was more like the standard good news,
bad news. Gardenhire had been named the Twin manager.</TE>
<TE>   It was a thrill for a baseball lifer who had seemed destined to
spend his life as the man behind the man, the good soldier who might
never get his big chance.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it appeared that the job was for a team that couldn't make
trades, that couldn't sign free agents, that Major League Baseball
Commissioner Bud Selig very much wanted to erase from existence.</TE>
<TE>   So here are the keys to the big office, Ron. Don't get too
comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, it might have seemed like a tough situation, but I never
looked at it that way," Gardenhire said. "There were times I wondered
if I'd ever get this chance. When I got it, I couldn't let myself
think I'd never get the chance to do the job. Just couldn't think
that way."</TE>
<TE>   If it seemed Gardenhire was the sacrificial lamb, the guy thrown
the job because everybody knew he'd never get to do it, Twin General
Manager Terry Ryan said that is simply wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "In his years with us, what we knew was that Ron was a great
leader," Ryan said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a loyal employee. He had worked with and developed many of
our young players in the minors. He understood our organization, our
philosophy, our budget, what we are about. He understood the
community and its relationship to this team. He obviously understands
the game and knows how to motivate players.</TE>
<TE>   "And let me say, contrary to how it might seem, Ron was not the
only man interested in the job. Our situation may have been
uncertain, but people who know baseball understood the group of
young, talented players we had. If we survived, somebody was going to
get a very good job."</TE>
<TE>   And so the chance of a lifetime went to a man who had played in
Lynchburg, Jackson, Tidewater, Portland and four brief times with the
New York Mets, a man who had managed in Kenosha and Orlando, a man
who had been a bench coach, first base coach and third base coach for
the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   His players say Gardenhire has earned their respect because of his
background.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a man who has always gone about his business in the best
way, learning his job, understanding the players, knowing what it is
we do," catcher A.J. Pierzynski said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of us, then he coached a lot of us. I can tell you
that everybody in our clubhouse couldn't have been happier when Gardy
got the job.</TE>
<TE>   "He kept us loose through the turmoil. He's treated guys fairly.
He says what needs to be said, he isn't a pushover. But he's not
above playing the prank, keeping things fun."</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire speaks to his players, owners and Twin fans, with
uncomplicated honesty.</TE>
<TE>   Was he nervous in Game 5 Sunday, in the bottom of the ninth, when
his closer, Eddie Guardado, seemed to be falling apart?</TE>
<TE>   "I remember I had said something on the airplane Saturday night.
'OK, boys, I am going to bring a bunch of extra barf bags in case
anybody needs one for tomorrow's game.' I promise you," Gardenhire
said, "on my desk there are barf bags."</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire was not afraid to admit what many Twin fans were
thinking Sunday afternoon, after Oakland rookie Mark Ellis hit a
three-run home run off Guardado and Randy Velarde carved out a
pinch-hit single.</TE>
<TE>   "I was torn whether I should go get him," Gardenhire said. "I have
left him out there, he has been our guy and you get to that
situation, should you go get him? I said, 'He has got to get Ray
Durham out,' and it was the hardest decision I have had all year and
it was very tough, but I wanted that young man out there."</TE>
<TE>   For both Gardenhire's faith and honesty, Guardado was grateful.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't make it easy on Gardy, but he makes it easy on us,"
Guardado said. "That's what's great about him. He doesn't sugarcoat
anything, but he also has faith in his players."</TE>
<TE>   If the Twins' previous manager, Tom Kelly, had not retired; if the
Twins had been contracted, if Gardenhire hadn't been given this
chance, does he wonder if he ever would have been a major league
manager?</TE>
<TE>   "More and more, guys who've had much better playing careers than
I've ever had are wanting to become managers," Gardenhire said. "I
would have had to face it that my time might have passed. But it
didn't, thank goodness."</TE>

<HD>Hocking Is One Athlete Who Isn't Tough as Nails</HD>

<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is only thing one thing that keeps me from winning a Pulitzer
Prize.</LD>
<LD>   I refer you to Denny Hocking, born in Torrance, married to a
die-hard Angel fan and about to move into a new home in Orange. He
plays baseball for the Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<LD>   Hocking did his very best Sunday, collected two hits, one run
batted in and caught the ball for the final out to send the Twins
into the American League championship series. As an added bonus, he
earned a chance to play against the Angels, a team he cheered for as
a teenager.</LD>
<TE>   And so in celebration like the rest of the Twins, Hocking joined
his teammates in a pileup near the mound after beating Oakland. A
teammate came along in metal spikes and stepped on his right hand,
splitting the nail on the middle finger and knocking him out of the
ALCS.</TE>
<TE>   Hocking refused to identify the teammate, telling the media, "He
was someone I'm feuding with, that's why I won't name him."</TE>
<TE>   Now you know why I write the way I do, and why I can never allow
myself to get better and win the Pulitzer Prize, writers and fellow
columnists piling atop me to celebrate, my two typing fingers
somewhere down below, and sports editor Bill Dwyre standing somewhere
above.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOR ALL we know Hocking might have won his own Pulitzer Prize by
now--had it not been for Dwyre.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago this week a Denny Hocking byline appeared in The
Times atop his football story on Palisades' 33-0 victory over Los
Angeles, just one of a number of stories he wrote for the City Times,
while ultimately answering to Dwyre.</TE>
<TE>   "I never heard of the guy," Dwyre shouted, and I wonder if Patton
said the same thing when first told he had slapped some
battle-fatigued private.</TE>
<TE>   I can only imagine what Mr. Inspiration said to Hocking to make
him turn to baseball full time. We've all been there, ready to quit
and become professional athletes after listening to Dwyre's
criticism, but if everyone left the newspaper, that would leave Dwyre
writing all the stories.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOCKING SOUNDED depressed when I talked to him by telephone. I
told him, "Don't worry, they'll never allow Dwyre to write all the
stories."</TE>
<TE>   That seemed to pep him up, and when I said it's a shame he became
a utility player when he could've had Bill Plaschke's job as sports
columnist, I got the feeling he knows what a utility player makes and
what a columnist is paid.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people worse off than me," Hocking said, and
of course Plaschke has written about most of them. "All I ever asked
for was the chance to play in the postseason, and I got it in a
pivotal game, and if that winds up being my professional postseason
career, so be it."</TE>
<TE>   Infielder David Lamb will take Hocking's place on the roster,
while the hand masher remains a mystery. (We'll probably learn it was
Dwyre.) Hocking said Monday it was Jacque Jones, but late in the day
said it wasn't Jones.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was joking when he told reporters, "it was
premeditated" when someone stepped on his hand. But he said, it's
true, he had words with a teammate a month ago, and so there was a
feud, "but it was blown way out of proportion."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happened, Hocking will once again be a spectator when the
Angels return from Minnesota and play as many as three games in
Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up a Dodger fan, but as soon as I got my driver's license
my mom liked the idea of me driving to see the Angels play instead of
driving to Chavez Ravine, so I became an Angels' fan," Hocking said.
Most sportswriters are Dodger fans, because no one wants to drive to
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DWYRE JUST called from the golf course with some more of his
inspiration. "Why don't you write a meaningful column for a change,
and suggest they stop all this stupid champagne partying after a team
wins four games. I'm so sick of seeing them do that, and it's only
for the benefit of ESPN."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins and Angels needed to win only three games each to start
spraying each other with champagne, and this is one more reason why
Dwyre will never be allowed to write all the stories. As for the
champagne baths, I think that's a lot better than having them drink
the stuff and get arrested while trying to drive home.</TE>
<TE>   As for TV, I'm going to appear daily on ESPN beginning Oct. 28 in
a new show, "Around the Horn." So if the champagne parties are being
staged just for the benefit of ESPN, I would think that's a good
thing just as long as the players understand I can't have my hair
messed up if I'm about to go on air.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GIVEN YOUR choice right now, how would you vote? 1) We'll take the
Chargers; 2) We'll take the Colts; 3) We'll take no one.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EAST COAST bias, or clueless in the West? In the Associated Press
top 25 poll, 73 of the 74 voters selected Miami No. 1, while the
football expert from the Los Angeles Daily News picked Texas No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DODGERS named Joe Thurston minor leaguer of the year after he
had 196 hits in 136 games.</TE>
<TE>   Note to Mark Grudzielanek: Thurston is a second baseman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from John Ward:</TE>
<TE>   "What a [jerk, rotten guy, dummy] you are. I seem to remember a
self-centered, arrogant [jerk, rotten guy, dummy], who referred to
the Angels as a 'joke' last February."</TE>
<TE>   You're the first person to say something I wrote was memorable.</TE>

<LD>A change of leadership proved Club America's undoing over the weekend
as the Mexican league's defending champion lost for the first time
this season in Coach Manuel Lapuente's first game back in charge.</LD>
<LD>   Lapuente had taken a two-month medical leave, during which time
interim Coach Mario Carrillo led the team to an 8-0-2 record. But on
Sunday, Club America was upset, 2-1, by Toluca at Azteca Stadium in
Mexico City.</LD>
<LD>   Pavel Pardo gave the home team the lead in the ninth minute, but
Club America squandered the chance to take a two-goal advantage when
striker Cuauhtemoc Blanco slammed a penalty kick against the
crossbar.</LD>
<TE>   Toluca's Jose Cruzalta tied the score in the 25th minute, and
Toluca earned the victory three minutes from the end when Paraguayan
forward Jose Cardoza scored his league-high 14th goal.</TE>
<TE>   Diallo Leaves MLS</TE>
<TE>   Mamadou "Big Mama" Diallo, the Senagalese striker who scored 47
goals in 74 games for three Major League Soccer teams over the last
three seasons and was a two-time all-star, was sold by the New
York/New Jersey MetroStars to Al Ahli of Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Terms were not revealed, but Nick Sakiewicz, the MetroStars'
president, said the move would free a foreign roster spot for the
team and also ease its salary cap problems.</TE>
<TE>   Before joining the MetroStars this season, Diallo, 31, had played
for the Tampa Bay Mutiny and the New England Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Howard to Feyenoord</TE>
<TE>   Tim Howard, the MetroStars and U.S. national team goalkeeper who
led MLS in saves for the second consecutive season, has flown to the
Netherlands, where he will train with UEFA Cup holder Feyenoord of
Rotterdam for the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Court Rejection</TE>
<TE>   The United States Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by
eight MLS players in their class-action lawsuit against the league,
effectively ending a five-year legal battle.</TE>
<TE>   The players had claimed that the league's single-entity structure
was designed to keep player salaries down and that a conspiracy
existed between MLS and U.S. Soccer to eliminate competition from
other leagues.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge dismissed the first claim in a summary judgment
and a jury decided against the players on the conspiracy. The U.S.
Court of Appeals had affirmed both decisions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Firing Line</TE>
<TE>   Sunderland, U.S. team captain Claudio Reyna's English Premier
League club, dismissed former England national team player Peter Reid
as coach. Reid, 46, had been the team's coach since March 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "Nearly a quarter of the season has gone and we are at the wrong
end of the table and can't wait any longer for performances to
improve," said Bob Murray, Sunderland's president.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Asian Games</TE>
<TE>   The Asian Games move to the quarterfinals today when defending
champion Iran plays Kuwait in Busan, South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The other quarterfinals feature China against Japan, South Korea
against Bahrain and Thailand against North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Iraq Pursues Stange</TE>
<TE>   Bernd Stange, the 54-year-old former coach of East Germany, is
close to reaching an agreement to become Iraq's national coach, the
German newspaper Bild reported.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been out of work for over a year now, and you don't receive
many offers at my age," Stange told Bild.</TE>
<TE>   "With Iraq, I would have a chance of taking part in the 2006 World
Cup in Germany."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maradona Loses Appeal</TE>
<TE>   Diego Maradona's appeal of a two-year prison sentence was rejected
by Argentina's highest appellate court.</TE>
<TE>   But the former World Cup star, now 42, will not have to spend time
in jail for his 1994 air-rifle attack on journalists unless he is
sentenced for another crime in the next 10 years.</TE>

<PH>AMERICAN LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES: ANGELS VS. MINNESOTA</PH>
<KH>SPOTLIGHT</KH>
<HD>Looking at History From Inside Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These were the very early days of Wally World--Wally Joyner's rookie
season--and on April 26, 1986, the Angels faced not only the
Minnesota Twins but Mother Nature's curveball, too. Play was halted
in the eighth inning when that wonderful architectural monument, the
Metrodome, developed a hole in its fiberglass roof because of winds
of 80 mph gusting through the Minneapolis area.</LD>
<LD>   Wind shear brought the outdoors, well, indoors. Torrents of water
doused spectators. And suddenly, the cables holding the heavy
speakers and light standards appeared unstable. Fans headed for the
tunnels, and the players evacuated the field. The game was stopped
for about eight minutes.</LD>
<LD>   "Amazing," said Reggie Jackson. "Unbelievable. Those kinds of
things, when I'm out of the game, I'm gonna miss. You can't get those
kinds of highs anywhere else."</LD>
<TE>   Having survived that, the Angels rallied and won, 7-6, on two-run
homers by George Hendrick, Ruppert Jones and Joyner.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Gene Mauch, naturally, had the line of the night. "If one
of those speakers fell on Joyner, he would've hit it in the
right-field seats," Mauch said, joking.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That's the Way</TE>
<TE>   the Cookie Crumbled</TE>
<TE>   The rarely boring managerial career of Cookie Rojas included 153
games with the Angels before one fateful day against the Twins at
Anaheim Stadium. His 154th game on Sept. 22, 1988, was his last.</TE>
<TE>   The score line: Twins 6, Angels 2, Rojas 0.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh inning, Rojas visited the mound to talk to reliever
Rich Monteleone, not intending to remove him from the game. There was
one small problem: Pitching coach Marcel Lachemann had already made
the trip earlier in the inning. The rules require the pitcher's
removal upon the second visit in an inning, and Rojas had to make a
change without a replacement having warmed up. Headlines in the
newspapers the next day gave these reviews:</TE>
<TE>   "Cookie Loses Count, Angels Lose Game."</TE>
<TE>   "Once Again, Rojas Keeps Them Off Balance as Twins Get Past
California."</TE>
<TE>   The Rojas era ended before lunch the next day. Moose Stubing, the
Angels' third-base coach, was named interim manager for the final
eight games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Six Degrees of Separation</TE>
<TE>   for Owner Bob Short</TE>
<TE>   The late Bob Short didn't have anything to do with the Minnesota
Twins--though he did make a futile run at purchasing them in the
mid-'70s. There is room for confusion, however, because he owned the
Washington Senators, Part II. That franchise later became the Texas
Rangers and, incidentally, the Rangers beat the Angels, 7-6, in their
first game at Arlington Stadium, on April 21, 1972. The first version
of the Washington Senators was the one that moved to Minnesota in
1961 and became the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Short does have a strong link to both Minnesota and
Southern California, having moved the Lakers from Minneapolis to Los
Angeles in 1960. He sold them to Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for the
then-whopping price of $5.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Homer Hanky</TE>
<TE>   vs. Rally Monkey</TE>
<TE>   There are many creative uses for the Homer Hanky. Got a cold?
Well, there's the hanky.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins bring forth tears of joy or despair? Again, the hanky
solves the problem.</TE>
<TE>   We have one other idea. How about using the Homer Hanky to
strangle the Rally Monkey?</TE>
<TE>   There will certainly be no shortage of the hankies at the
Metrodome. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported that 35,852 Homer
Hankies were sold at the Metrodome on Friday for the first home
playoff game in 11 years for the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   As for the omnipresent monkey, regular readers of this newspaper
are more than familiar with tales of the primate, seemingly told on a
weekly basis. It started to reach theater-of-the-absurd levels when
even the Yankees' Derek Jeter was asked about the Monkey before Game
3.</TE>
<TE>   "You're talking about that damn monkey," Jeter said. He did laugh
about it. But last season Angel pitcher Jarrod Washburn said
management was "making a mockery of the game" when a real monkey was
brought onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angels and Twins,</TE>
<TE>   Trading Places</TE>
<TE>   There's a long list of players who have worn both Angel and Twin
uniforms. The players the teams have in common could have made up a
fairly decent All-Star team.</TE>
<TE>   Catchers: Butch Wynegar, Brian Harper.</TE>
<TE>   First base: Rod Carew.</TE>
<TE>   Second base: Rob Wilfong.</TE>
<TE>   Third base: Gary Gaetti.</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop: Leo Cardenas</TE>
<TE>   Outfield: Lyman Bostock, Dave Winfield, Tom Brunansky.</TE>
<TE>   Designated hitter: Chili Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Pitchers: Dean Chance, Bert Blyleven.</TE>

seven seasons.</TE>

<HD>Ryan Put Fast One by Twins</HD>

<LD>If it hadn't been for Jim Holt ...</LD>
<LD>   Who knows what would have happened if Nolan Ryan hadn't struck out
the right fielder Holt of the Minnesota Twins on Sept. 26, 1973, at
Anaheim Stadium? Ryan may not have eclipsed Sandy Koufax's season
strikeout record of 382. The other option would have been trying to
pitch the last game of the season on two days' rest. "It was going to
be my last start," Ryan said of the legendary game against the Twins
in a 1989 interview with The Times.</LD>
<LD>   He needed 16 strikeouts to do it, and manager Bobby Winkles nearly
pulled him once a wild Ryan fell behind, 3-0. Winkles opted to let
him pitch to one more batter, Holt, according to "Nolan Ryan
Fireballer," by Bill Libby. Ryan stuck out Holt ... and the rest was
history.</LD>
<TE>   Not exactly. History wasn't that smooth in one of the most
memorable Angel-Twin games. Facing a lineup that featured Rod Carew,
Harmon Killebrew and Tony Oliva, Ryan started to tire by the seventh
inning. He had 14 strikeouts through seven--including three against
Carew--and needed one to tie Koufax, and two to pass him. Ryan tied
the record by striking out Steve Brye in the eighth inning but came
down hard off the mound and suffered what was later diagnosed as a
torn calf muscle. The team trainer and doctor worked on his right leg
in the dugout between innings.</TE>
<TE>   Then came another incongruous development. With the score tied,
4-4, it became clear that most of the crowd didn't want the Angels to
score to win because it would have meant the worst-case scenario--no
record that night for Ryan. The ninth and 10th went by with no Ryan
strikeouts. Finally, in the 11th, a weary and wounded Ryan left
Koufax behind, striking out Rich Reese for his 16th strikeout and No.
383 of the season. The crowd gave Ryan a five-minute standing
ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one time," Ryan said, smiling, "where not scoring runs
paid off for me." Oh yes, there was the matter of the final score.
The Angels won it in the 11th, 5-4, almost as though they had
permission to score once Ryan made history.</TE>

<HD>Sprewell Takes Another Big Hit</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Knicks' star fined $250,000 for failing to
disclose broken hand reportedly suffered when he threw a punch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Latrell Sprewell, who has a flair for the spectacular, especially as
it regards punishment, was fined $250,000 Monday and this time he
hadn't even hit anyone.</LD>
<LD>   Sprewell, who lost $6.4 million while under suspension during the
1997-98 season for choking Golden State Warrior Coach P.J. Carlesimo,
was fined by the New York Knicks for failing to report a broken bone
in his right hand.</LD>
<LD>   It is believed to be the largest fine assessed a player by an NBA
team. In addition, the Knicks said Sprewell would remain banished
from their camp in Charleston, S.C., until he could make what team
President Scott Layden called "a positive contribution."</LD>
<TE>   Players are seldom--if ever--fined for failing to make timely
reports on their physical conditions. The team's hard line was even
more surprising, since Sprewell had rehabilitated his image since the
Carlesimo incident, having become a popular team leader in four Knick
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The fine was announced at a news conference in New York by Layden,
reportedly trembling as he delivered the edict.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, we've tried other things and we're going to try
something different this time," Layden said. "He's a member of this
organization and we want to get it right, OK? We have not been able
to get it right so far."</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell left without comment and his agent, Robert Gist, said he
would contest the fine.</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks opened camp last week with a media day at their
training facility in Purchase, N.Y., then were embarrassed to learn
that Sprewell would need surgery, would miss the entire exhibition
season and perhaps as much as a month of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The same day, they also learned that starting center Kurt Thomas
had been arrested by police in Greenwich, Conn., and charged with
assaulting his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Even for the Knicks, this was a bad start, made worse by a New
York Post report--denied by Sprewell--that he hadn't just "banged"
his hand, as he told the team, but had thrown a punch at a guest on
his yacht during a cruise off New York and had hit a wall.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell has not said what happened. He said he hadn't notified
the team until Sept. 29, the day before camp opened, only because he
hadn't realized until then that the injury was serious .</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks were sympathetic or noncommittal at first.</TE>
<TE>   Said Coach Don Chaney, "You've got to understand who we're dealing
with. We're dealing with probably the toughest player on our team. So
he's not going to complain about anything."</TE>
<TE>   Layden, however, barred Sprewell from joining his teammates, even
if only to watch, as camp moved to Charleston.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, a week after camp had opened, Sprewell met with Layden,
Chaney and Madison Square Garden executive Steve Mills for about 20
minutes in New York. The Knicks then announced the fine.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell then called players' union director Billy Hunter, who
told the Associated Press the player was upset.</TE>
<TE>   "He feels he's being scapegoated for the problems that are
confronting the Knicks," said Hunter, citing "the diminished value of
Cablevision stock, the offloading and sale of Cablevision's assets
and resources, the issue of season-ticket holders and the depletion
of the 6,000-name waiting list, and the fact that they weren't able
to make significant trades to upgrade the team."</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell often is late, arriving 60 minutes before games rather
than the prescribed 90. However, he was never disciplined as he
developed into one of the team's stars. He became a particular
favorite of the press corps for his blunt assessments of the scene,
which for the Knicks has been deteriorating.</TE>
<TE>   For all four seasons as a Knick, the 6-foot-5, 190-pound Sprewell
has played forward in small lineups to accommodate the presence of
another shooting guard, Allen Houston. However, the Knicks spent the
off-season trying to add size, acquiring Denver's Antonio McDyess.
They also reportedly shopped Sprewell but got no takers.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter said the union would appeal. In 1998, he backed Sprewell
and an arbitrator cut several months off the suspension levied by
Commissioner David Stern.</TE>
<TE>   With or without his $250,000, Sprewell's days in New York seem
numbered.</TE>

<HD>Ante Up</HD>
<DH>Twin players remember what it was to pay their dues;
whether ownership will reward them remains a question</DH>

<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>What Minnesota Twin first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz remembers most
about the 1999 season, which he refers to as "the most miserable year
of my life," is the silence.</LD>
<LD>   The Metrodome may be the loudest place on earth tonight, when the
Twins and Angels open the American League championship series before
a Homer Hanky-waving sellout crowd of 56,000, but three years ago the
place was as lifeless as a morgue.</LD>
<LD>   "You could hear someone buying a hot dog in the upper deck,"
Mientkiewicz said. "If someone yawned in the stands, you heard it."</LD>
<TE>   Those yawns weren't limited to the bleachers. The small-market
Twins went to a total youth movement in 1999, paring their payroll to
$15 million on orders from owner Carl Pohlad and carrying 16 rookies,
their lineup filled with anonymous kids such as Mientkiewicz,
outfielders Torii Hunter and Jacque Jones, infielders Corey Koskie
and Cristian Guzman and pitcher Joe Mays.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota was overmatched from the start, going 63-97 and
finishing 33 games out of first place in the AL Central. ESPN analyst
Peter Gammons called the Twins "the best triple-A team in the big
leagues," and he was right; most of these guys had no business being
here.</TE>
<TE>   They had some skill, some athleticism, some potential. But they
were force-fed into the big leagues, chewed up and spit out by
opponents. They were outscored, 845-686. They hit 105 homers and
allowed 208. They were, in a word, "boring."</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest with you," said Rick Stelmaszek, the Twins' longtime
bullpen coach, "I fell asleep a few times during games."</TE>
<TE>   From those humble origins rose the core of a team that won the AL
Central by 13 1/2 games this season, upset the Oakland Athletics in a
five-game division series and is four wins from reaching the World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   You thought the 1969 Mets were Amazin'? From a leap of faith, the
Twins are now a hop, skip and a jump away from the Fall Classic.</TE>
<TE>   "We always said in 1999 that we're going to take our lumps, but
we're eventually going to return the favor," Mientkiewicz said. "My
hat goes off to [Manager] Ron Gardenhire, [former manager] Tom Kelly
and [General Manager] Terry Ryan. They kept the group together. They
knew we could win. We just needed to learn how to win on the
big-league level."</TE>
<TE>   The growing pains were sharp, the scars deep. Mientkiewicz hit
.229 that season and was sent back to triple-A Salt Lake for most of
2000. Guzman hit .226 with one homer and 90 strikeouts in 1999.
Hunter hit .255. Mays went 6-11. The group had won together in the
minor leagues but crashed into a wall in the big leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just too much too soon for most of them," Kelly said.
"Most of them skipped triple A and went right to the big leagues.
When you strap 16 rookies onto a roster and throw them against the
New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox and Cleveland Indians, you're going
to take your lumps, and we did."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't so much the physical aspects of the game that
overwhelmed the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us were scared," Mientkiewicz said. "T.K. kept putting us
out there, and we all struggled. Geez, we must have put 25 years on
T.K. in one year. There were too many guys trying to feel their way
through the big leagues without worrying about whether we won or
lost."</TE>
<TE>   The toughest part of that season?</TE>
<TE>   "Every day at 7 p.m.," Mientkiewicz said. "Not knowing what you're
gonna get."</TE>
<TE>   The volatile Twins were just as likely to blow a six-run lead in
the seventh inning as they were to throw a no-hitter, which
left-hander Eric Milton did against the equally woebegone Angels on
Sept. 11 of that year, the highlight of Minnesota's season and the
lowlight of a 70-92 Angel season in which manager Terry Collins and
general manager Bill Bavasi resigned under duress.</TE>
<TE>   While the Angels rebuilt under a new regime with General Manager
Bill Stoneman and Manager Mike Scioscia, the Twins injected some more
youth in 2000, adding catcher A.J. Pierzynski, second baseman Luis
Rivas and pitcher J.C. Romero to the mix.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, after a torrid 55-game stretch in triple A, where he hit
.368 with 18 homers and 61 runs batted in, improved his major league
average to .280. Guzman jumped to .247, Jones hit .289, and
Pierzynski and Rivas each hit over .300.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we had a lot to learn, we had our ups and downs, and a
lot of guys were sent out and brought back," Hunter said. "After a
while you start to figure out what pitchers are doing to you."</TE>
<TE>   The kids seemed to be maturing, and though their record (69-93)
wasn't much better in 2000, they began to come of age in the last
week of the season, when they won two of four over the Indians to
deny Cleveland a playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know how to maintain leads, to finish games--we were
waiting to lose rather than trying to win," Jones said. "That changed
at the end of 2000. We made that series against Cleveland our
playoffs. If we weren't going, they weren't going either. That rolled
into 2001 and set the tone. We started taking it to teams."</TE>
<TE>   Mientkiewicz returned in 2001, motivated to prove he belonged, and
a pitching staff that included starters Brad Radke, Milton and Mays
and reliever Eddie Guardado lowered its earned-run average from 5.14
in 2000 to 4.51 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Mientkiewicz, who helped the U.S. win an Olympic gold medal in
2000, hit .306 with 15 homers and 74 RBIs in 2001. Hunter hit .261
with 27 homers and 92 RBIs and won a Gold Glove. Koskie hit .276 with
26 homers and 103 RBIs, Guzman hit .302. To athletic ability and
potential, the Twins added heart, character, some personality.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins were 64-51 and led the division on Aug. 10 before an
eight-game losing streak dropped them 4 1/2 games back. They finished
85-77, six games out, and Kelly, who guided Minnesota to World Series
titles in 1987 and '91, retired.</TE>
<TE>   After surviving a brutal winter, in which Commissioner Bud Selig
tried to eliminate the franchise, the Twins roared back behind
Gardenhire in 2002, going 94-67, running away with the division and
becoming a model for small-market teams who want to build from
within.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter emerged as an MVP candidate, and Koskie is considered one
of baseball's best third basemen. Guardado made a successful
transition from setup man to closer, and Romero, who struggled as a
starter, developed into one of the nastiest left-handed relievers in
the league.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan made several shrewd moves along the way, acquiring Guzman and
Milton from the Yankees for Chuck Knoblauch, pitcher Kyle Lohse from
the Cubs for Rick Aguilera, Mays from Seattle for Roberto Kelly,
designated hitter David Ortiz from Seattle for Dave Hollins, and
reliever Johan Santana from the Marlins for Jared Camp. All but one
starter--Ortiz--was drafted and developed by the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   "Terry Ryan and Tom Kelly took a lot of hits for this team in 1999
and 2000," Pierzynski said. "The organization did a great job
teaching us how to win games. We were on the low end of the payroll,
but they never took money away from development."</TE>
<TE>   The question now is, will the Twins spend what it takes to keep
this group together? Minnesota still has the third-lowest payroll in
baseball ($40 million), but the team is for sale, and the future of
the franchise is still in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "If they keep us together ... we should win for a long time,"
Jones said. "It's hard to mix and match, get a guy from this team and
another from that team. When you have a winning chemistry, you have
to keep it together, even if that means spending money. We've put up.
Now someone has to put up for us."</TE>

<HD>Hungry to Win</HD>
<DH>UCLA's Seidman craves food and a championship</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The appetite of a massive tight end is bound to be prodigious.</LD>
<LD>   So Mike Seidman's daily diet of mountains of chicken and rice,
forests of broccoli and rivers of protein drinks is familiar terrain.</LD>
<LD>   But as the UCLA senior learned in the human behavior classes
required for his sociology degree, deeper hungers exist.</LD>
<TE>   Belonging, fulfillment, that type of thing.</TE>
<TE>   He's even added to the syllabus--a longing for the football and a
yearning for a bowl game someplace more exciting than El Paso.
Seidman's definition of belonging is getting featured in the passing
game. His idea of fulfillment is for the Bruins to win a
championship.</TE>
<TE>   "The year before I got here, UCLA won the Pac-10 title, and I've
missed out on all that," he said. "I want to win. The Sun Bowl [in
2000] was OK, but I want to go to the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "And I believe a way to get there is for me to catch passes and
make things happen with the football."</TE>
<TE>   In the last two games, Seidman's cravings were satisfied. He had
14 catches for 272 yards and two touchdowns in victories over San
Diego State and Oregon State, the on-field equivalent of his daily
intake of eight chicken breasts, six eggs, a steak and assorted
carbohydrates, fruit and veggies.</TE>
<TE>   The breakout occurred shortly after he'd spoken out. After UCLA's
loss to Colorado on Sept. 21, Seidman said he was tired of being a
sideshow.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't what I expected," he had said. "The only time I
complain is when we lose, and if I'm not getting the ball, I can't
contribute as much. Give me a shot. I'll make a big play if they give
me a chance."</TE>
<TE>   The results were so immediate, it was as if quarterback Cory Paus
was following the leader in a game of Seidman Says.</TE>
<TE>   In UCLA's 43-7 victory over San Diego State, the tight end had six
catches for 134 yards, one for 64 yards and a touchdown. He broke
several tackles and gained 29 yards on a key third-down play, one of
four catches that resulted in first downs.</TE>
<TE>   In the Bruins' 43-35 victory over Oregon State, he had eight
catches for 138 yards, both career highs. It was the most catches by
a Bruin tight end in 39 years.</TE>
<TE>   The attention was four years in the making. Seidman's 21
receptions are one more than he had his first three years combined.
Maybe he should have spoken up sooner, but it goes against his
nature.</TE>
<TE>   "Like any great player who can contribute, he wanted to win,"
Coach Bob Toledo said. "It's not that we weren't trying to get him
the ball. We've called a lot of plays for him and for whatever reason
the ball wasn't thrown to him."</TE>
<TE>   Paus is finding the 6-foot-5, 260-pound tight end now. It's no
coincidence that the last two games have been the best back-to-back
performances of the senior quarterback's career.</TE>
<TE>   "Cory and Mike Seidman have some kind of telepathic
communication," said Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti, whose team plays
UCLA on Saturday. "On film I saw Seidman break a route, and the ball
got to him. So there is something there. He is as impressive a tight
end as I've seen this year."</TE>
<TE>   NFL scouts are noticing too. Seidman is projected to be the first
Bruin drafted.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of tight ends think the only way to get recognized is to
catch passes," Toledo said. "Mike Seidman will get his chance at the
NFL even if he doesn't make another catch because he is an excellent
blocker. He's one of the best tight ends in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Seidman appreciates the praise but says there'll be no more
begging for the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Letting opponents know he is a receiver to be reckoned with is
another story. Against Oregon State, he hung onto a ball down the
middle for a 32-yard gain despite getting sandwiched by safeties
Mitch Meeuwsen and Lawrence Turner.</TE>
<TE>   Seidman bounced to his feet, handed the ball to Turner, pointed to
each defender and said, "I caught that on you, and on you."</TE>
<TE>   Later, he once again felt sheepish for drawing attention to
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "They had been saying some things to me and I was fired up at that
moment," Seidman said. "I have a hard time explaining some of the
things I do on the field."</TE>
<TE>   So he looks to those human behavior classes to shed light on the
apparent contradiction between his reserved nature and narcissist
outbursts.</TE>
<TE>   He recalls spending time at the school for severely disabled
children where his mother teaches, seeing 6-year-olds unable to
swallow and 20-year-olds requiring constant care.</TE>
<TE>   He thinks about the 8-year-old girl he befriended after her mother
died of cancer, how he carried her on his shoulders through the Bruin
locker room, how her voice brightens when he calls on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   He thinks about the heart attack his father had last spring and
how their weekly dinners this fall have strengthened their
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to make Seidman curb that ravenous appetite for the
football, to appreciate who he is and what he's done.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm lucky even if I never catch another pass," he said.
"Sometimes, I stop and remind myself of that. I try to be modest. I
don't want to stand out. I just want our team to win. I want to
finish my UCLA career the way all seniors do, with our best season
yet."</TE>

<HD>Start for Ebell Is a No-Brainer</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The decision to start Tyler Ebell at tailback against Oregon on
Saturday ahead of the more experienced Akil Harris was not difficult.</LD>
<LD>   "It's real simple, [Ebell] rushed for 200 yards," Coach Bob Toledo
said.</LD>
<LD>   Coaches were impressed that Ebell, who gained 203 yards in three
quarters against Oregon State, was prepared from the moment he
replaced the injured Manuel White.</LD>
<TE>   "He hasn't got a lot of reps in practice, yet he got his
opportunity and played very well," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   White started at fullback for four games and performed so well he
earned a start at tailback against the Beavers. However, the
hamstring injury he suffered in the first quarter probably will keep
him sidelined Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell is ready for a reprise.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have to show I'm not a one-game wonder," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Rodney Leisle will have surgery today on his
right foot and will be out at least four weeks. A screw will be
inserted to stabilize a stress fracture.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll miss him on the pass rush more than anything," Toledo said.
"He is such a force."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Boschetti, a junior college transfer, will start in Leisle's
place. Boschetti has 10 tackles, including one for a loss.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff for UCLA's game at California on Oct. 19 has been set for
4 p.m. The game will be televised on TBS.</TE>

<LD>Thousand Oaks High may have to forfeit football victories over
Ventura Buena and Crescenta Valley if an internal investigation
reveals that transfer student Chris Owens is ineligible to compete
for the Lancers.</LD>
<LD>   Owens, a junior quarterback, transferred from Simi Valley Grace
Brethren last spring. Officials from a Marmonte League school raised
questions last week about where Owens was living, spurring Thousand
Oaks to launch an investigation and bar Owens from playing in
Friday's league opener against Simi Valley, according to Coach Mike
Sanders.</LD>
<LD>   Thousand Oaks is expected to have injured quarterback Brad Sievert
back in the lineup this week. Sievert missed the first four games
because of a broken collarbone. The Lancers won't have Arizona
State-bound kicker Jesse Ainsworth, who must sit out a game after
being ejected for a flagrant hit.</LD>

<TE>   San Gabriel Gabrielino fullback Andrew Castillo remained in
critical condition Monday at Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in

suffered during a football game. Castillo was still in a coma in the
hospital's critical care unit, hospital spokesman Dan Boyle said.</TE>
<TE>   The player's family requested that no further information be
released.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo has undergone two surgeries to remove a blot clot on the

Gabrielino's nonleague game against Burbank on Friday..</TE>

<HD>On a Roll</HD>
<DH>Practice, especially on his putting, has taken Han to new
heights</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To Seung Su Han, it seemed like a pretty good deal at the time.</LD>
<LD>   Han's father, Mun Sug, said earlier this year he would quit
smoking if Seung Su practiced putting every day. Han, 16, had been
thinking about working more on his putting anyway.</LD>
<LD>   So Han, a sophomore at Chino Hills Ayala High, went to work. Every
day, he practiced putting balls into a cup on the artificial grass
surface covering his backyard patio. Shortly thereafter, it was Han
who was smoking. He won a national junior tournament, then another.</LD>
<TE>   By the end of the summer, Han had four victories in national
tournaments, including two in junior major championships. The torrid
stretch put him in select company: Only Tiger Woods and Phil
Mickelson had ever won four American Junior Golf Assn. tournaments in
one calendar year. Han vaulted from No. 190 to No. 10 in the Golfweek
Magazine junior rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the AJGA selected Han national boys' player of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   All because of a deal with his father.</TE>
<TE>   "I never practiced at home, ever," Han said. "Now I practice every
day."</TE>
<TE>   The thought of working on his putting first came to Han after he
played in the AJGA Thunderbird International at the end of May. Han's
partner in the first round, Casey Wittenberg, shot a 65 by
consistently making putts.</TE>
<TE>   Han, who shot 75 and ended up tied for 14th after the three-round
tournament, couldn't get Wittenberg's putting display out of his
head.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked," Han said. "He was making every putt. He hits it
and it goes in, every time. It made me want to practice putting."</TE>
<TE>   Don Brown, Han's private coach, has seen this sort of thing
before. Brown, who teaches at Harbor Golf Center in Torrance, said
most young players dwell on adding distance and working on perfecting
their swings. Putting is often an afterthought, but those who
discover the importance of mastering the short game often find
immediate results.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what happened with Seung Su," Brown said. "Now when he
goes to a tournament, I kind of expect him to play well."</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after the Thunderbird tournament, Han made a 30-foot
birdie putt on the final hole to win the Chrysler Boys championship
at Cardinal Golf Club in Greensboro, N.C., a major championship.
After opening with a 76, Han shot 65, 68 and 66. He made 17 birdies
in four rounds, including three on the last four holes.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, he had 18 birdies in three rounds, shot 66-67-69
and set a tournament scoring record at the ClubCorp Junior at Mission
Hills. The following week, he shot 68-71-71-66 with 20 birdies in
four rounds to win his second major title, the EDS Boys Championship
at Oakmont Country Club in Corinth, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Han made nine birdies in 16 holes and defeated James
Vargas, the top-ranked junior in the nation, in a Canon Cup singles
match at Conway Farms Golf Club in Lake Forest, Ill. He capped the
summer on Aug. 23-25 with a 16-birdie performance in rounds of
69-69-67 to win the Ping Phoenix Junior at Karsten Golf Course in
Tempe, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   "I played way better than I expected," Han said. "This summer was
a surprise to me."</TE>
<TE>   Not a total surprise, however.</TE>
<TE>   Han, who moved to Chino Hills from South Korea two years ago and
has been playing golf for about 4 1/2 years, qualified for the 2001
U.S. Amateur at 14. He won a 16-and-under AJGA tournament last
November.</TE>
<TE>   "He hits the ball extremely straight," Brown said. "His swing
fluctuates. He knows how to get the club square at impact, no matter
what."</TE>
<TE>   Han went by the name Steve when he moved to the United States, but
switched back to using his Korean name after South Korea made the
semifinals of the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Becoming the first Korean to win the AJGA player of the year award
is a far greater honor to Han than sharing a record with Woods and
Mickelson. School remains his top priority. He moved from Korea for
more opportunities in golfand, he said, because the education system
for top athletes in Korea is not up to par.</TE>
<TE>   "There, you either play sports or go to school," Han said. "Not
both."</TE>
<TE>   He said he has no plans to turn professional until he finishes
college and will take up to a month at a time away from the golf
course when his school workload gets heavy.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people are scared that if they don't practice, they're going
to lose their swing," Han said. "I used to be like that, but
sometimes I feel like I just don't want to play, so I don't."</TE>
<TE>   Except for those putting sessions on the patio.</TE>
<TE>   Han said he'll keep his end of the deal, even if his father
hasn't. Mun Sug was able to quit smoking for only two months.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I'll make another deal with him," Seung Su said. The rest
of the junior golfers sure hope not.</TE>

<HD>State Football Playoffs No Sure Thing</HD>

<LD>A proposal for a statewide playoff system for high school football
will be discussed next month at the California Interscholastic
Federation council meeting.</LD>
<LD>   While there's nothing wrong with debating the merits of an
intriguing idea that would require radical restructuring of the
present playoff system, no one should reserve the Rose Bowl, Edison
Field or 3Com Park for a championship game.</LD>
<LD>   There's no clamoring for a state tournament in football. In fact,
there are more reasons to keep the status quo of section
championships than to enter a statewide playoff system that would
surely widen the disparity between powerful programs and weak ones.</LD>
<TE>   As long as the top schools keep playing each other, there's no
real need to hold a state playoff system. Concord De La Salle, which
has won 129 consecutive games, and Long Beach Poly met last season
and play again Saturday at Berkeley to determine the mythical
Division I state champion.</TE>
<TE>   With national and state polls, section and division championships,
there are plenty of opportunities for football teams in California to
receive recognition without having to add two more weeks to the
schedule just so someone can hang a banner that reads, "State
Champions."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, that great state of Texas, where people like to say they have
two seasons--football and spring football--has had a state playoff
system since 1910. Its football season begins the final week of
August and lasts 16 games, ending the week before Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   But Texas separates public and private schools for its playoffs
and devises playoff brackets based on enrollment rather than strength
of programs, making it difficult for California simply to copy the
Texas model.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego Section, under Commissioner Dennis Ackerman, made
the proposal for a state football</TE>
<TE>   playoff system.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure it will be a hotly debated idea," Ackerman said. "It's
not a unanimous thing, but there is some interest in it."</TE>
<TE>   Among the obstacles to overcome are coaches, administrators and a
whole lot of other folks who think the current football season is
long enough at</TE>
<TE>   14 weeks, plus another month of</TE>
<TE>   practices.</TE>
<TE>   One coach who understands the challenge of an extended season is
Sylmar High's Jeff Engilman. His team competed in the 1992 Reebok
Bowl, a regional championship game matching the best of the City
Section against the best of the Southern Section that was televised
live from Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   From Engilman's perspective, it turned out to be a negative
experience as La Puente Bishop Amat won, 31-14, to finish 15-0. "The
biggest problem we had was our whole focus was on beating Carson for
the City [Section] title," he said. "It was a tremendously long
season for our kids. I'd vote against a state tournament because of
the length of time."</TE>
<TE>   Another reason not to push for a state playoff system is that it
would increase the pressure on football coaches to win, which,
inevitably, would lead to the abuses so prevalent in basketball,
where recruiting and player transfers run rampant.</TE>
<TE>   However, CIF officials might be in favor of a state playoff system
if it means adding money to their coffers. Still, there are no
guarantees of sellout crowds in the middle of December, when the
weather is unpredictable and the public's focus begins to shift to
basketball and other sports. The Reebok Bowl drew a crowd of only
8,132.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to ask yourself what can you get out of it?" said Jim
Staunton, commissioner of the Southern Section.</TE>
<TE>   State championships are presently held in basketball,
cross-country, track and field, wrestling and girls' volleyball.
There are also proposals for state championships in golf and
softball.</TE>
<TE>   Let the discussions begin on the value of a state playoff system
for football. Perhaps someone can come up with a workable plan.</TE>
<TE>   But remember, Californians are different from Texans.</TE>
<TE>   Californians love high school football, but not so much that they
will give up time for playing other sports or for pursuing other
interests.</TE>

<HD>Kicker Now Takes Blame for Miss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC kicker Ryan Killeen said Monday that he was at fault for missing
a critical extra-point attempt against Washington State that let
potential victory--and his lock on the position--slip away.</LD>
<LD>   "Everything was going my way ... I think I took it for granted,"
Killeen said. "I'm kind of glad the competition is on again. I need
that."</LD>
<LD>   Killeen's miss prevented the Trojans from taking a four-point lead
with 4:10 remaining and allowed Washington State to tie the score
with a field goal and send the game into overtime.</LD>
<TE>   After the Trojans lost, 30-27, Killeen said holder Tom Malone
placed the ball in a spot he was not expecting. Malone and Killeen
were paired by Trojan coaches only a day before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I jumped the gun on that," Killeen said. "After seeing the film,
it was my fault. I didn't get the job done."</TE>
<TE>   Malone, who worked almost exclusively with left-footed kicker
David Davis this season, will remain Killeen's holder this week.
Left-handed quarterback Matt Leinart will hold for Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Killeen supplanted Davis two weeks ago against Oregon State, but
he said his performance against Washington State opened the door for
Davis to reclaim the position.</TE>
<TE>   Davis did not travel to Washington State after suffering a
contusion and aggravating a nerve in his left leg when he was hit in
practice Thursday. But he worked out Monday and looked strong.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All-American safety Troy Polamalu did not practice because of a
high ankle sprain that sidelined him for much of the game against
Washington State, but he said he hoped to be ready for Saturday's
game against California.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if it's only having me play a certain defense to get three
plays in the game, I'll dress and be ready to play," Polamalu said.
"Time will tell."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Leach will probably start in Polamalu's place at strong
safety with freshman Mike Ross as the backup. However, Carroll said
DeShaun Hill could be moved to strong safety and redshirt freshman
John Walker to free safety, if needed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With defensive end Omar Nazel still nursing a sore shoulder, Van
Brown took reps with the first unit defense and is expected to backup
Nazel against California. Nazel played every down against Washington
State.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't be fully aggressive," Nazel said. "It hindered me."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, a 6-foot 5, 255-pound transfer from Pasadena City College,
was slowed during training camp by injuries and has played sparingly.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to get the opportunity," Brown said. "I just have to
take advantage of it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC's game against Washington Oct. 19 at the Coliseum will begin
at 12:30 and be televised by ABC. Gary Klein</TE>
