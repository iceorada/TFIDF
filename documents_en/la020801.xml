<HD>Questions for the LAPD in Death of a 'Perfect Son'</HD>

<LD>It has been four years since Marc Fitzsimmons was shot to death by
two policemen on a dark corner of South-Central L.A., but to his
mother, it could have been last night.</LD>
<LD>   Every detail of the incident is as clear in the memory of Donna
Dymally as if it had just occurred. Part of the reason is the thick
stack of documents she fidgets with in the South Normandie home her
family has occupied for 50 years.</LD>
<LD>   As we sit in her dining room surrounded by the dolls she makes and
collects as a hobby, she offers the documents one by one, selecting
them automatically from the file: police reports and follow-up
investigations, the coroner's conclusion, court filings, newspaper
and magazine stories and the report of a private investigator.</LD>
<TE>   All chronicle the death of Dymally's "perfect son" who, at age 28,
was brought down by police bullets after he allegedly assaulted an
elderly woman with a meat cleaver and then charged the officers while
brandishing the same weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "Not my son," Dymally says to me, emphatically shaking her head.
"He was a wonderful man. He never had a record or used drugs. He
graduated from Fairfax High at 15 and was a gifted child."</TE>
<TE>   She holds up a photograph of him. It's a handsome, open face,
hiding nothing, an eager face, on the brink of the future--and the
face of another young African American killed by police.</TE>
<TE>   "They had the wrong man," Dymally says, staring at the picture as
though she might bring him to life again. "He wouldn't have done
that."</TE>
<TE>   Clearing her son's name has become her life's work. On the day we
met, she talked about him at an anti-police rally at the street
corner where Fitzsimmons was killed on July 2, 1998. She has been
involved in protests against police brutality and at one time had
filed a suit against the Los Angeles Police Department, which she
dropped for lack of witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Dymally is divorced from Mark Dymally, son of Mervyn Dymally, the
former lieutenant governor and congressman. A schoolteacher and
community activist, she once served as a member of then-Mayor Richard
Riordan's Neighborhood Initiative Project.</TE>
<TE>   All of her passion on this warm summer afternoon is directed
toward telling the story of her son. The videotaped police assault of
16-year-old Donovan Jackson is in the news this day, in an incident
that has fired Dymally's anger and memory as she talks about
Fitzsimmons.</TE>
<TE>   "On July 2nd, 1998," she says, staring me straight in the face,
"my son left home to go to the Bank of America to get his sister some
spending money for a trip she was taking to Cleveland, Ohio. Little
did we know that we would never see him again."</TE>
<TE>   What happened, according to voluminous police reports, was that
two officers responded to the call of a woman being attacked by a man
with a meat cleaver. The woman wasn't seriously injured. Searching
the area, the officers came upon Fitzsimmons, who was allegedly
identified as the attacker by witnesses at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   A police report chronicles the final moments of the young man's
life in precise, almost distant terms: "Fitzsimmons ultimately
stopped, turned to his right in a clockwise direction, and faced in
an easterly direction." "The armed suspect began to sprint in an
easterly direction toward Officer [Daniel] Russell." "Officer
Russell, in fear of his life ... fired one round in a westerly
direction." "Officer [Malcolm] Thomas, in fear for Officer Russell's
life ... fired one round in a northwesterly direction
...."Fitzsimmons was pronounced dead at the UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Dymally challenges every aspect of the killing, including the
time, the location and accounts of witnesses. The man they were
looking for was described as older and larger than her son, she says,
and wore different clothing, and at the time of the attack on the
woman, her son was several blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   She resents that she was never notified by police of his death,
but rather heard of it five days later from her parents in Ohio, whom
police had notified. Fitzsimmons, who had lived in Ohio up until the
previous year, carried a driver's license from that state.</TE>
<TE>   "He had eight pieces of Los Angeles identification on him too,"
she says, in obvious anguish. "Why wasn't I notified?" She pauses,
hurting. "They wouldn't even let me identify him before he was
cremated. I never had a chance to say goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   A local organization called the Power Pack Center for Social and
Economic Justice investigated and accused the LAPD of a cover-up. A
report was sent to then-U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, but, Dymally
says, her office never responded.</TE>
<TE>   Police documents are thick with justification for the killing of
Fitzsimmons. The officers were certain they got the right man.
Dymally is just as certain that they didn't. She swears that one day
she will prove that her son, her perfect son, was innocent.</TE>
<TE>   It would do little good for me to debate the veracity of any of
the claims. But the accusations of Dymally thicken the dark clouds
already hovering over Southern California's law enforcement
community, and the issue cries out for another look. A last review by
a neutral source might finally lay to rest questions involving
Fitzsimmons' fading moments on Earth and ease the anguish of
survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Although the record shows that his death occurred four years ago,
to his mother it will always be just last night.</TE>

<LD>THE SECRET HISTORY</LD>
<LD>   OF MODERNISM</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<TE>   By C.K. Stead</TE>
<TE>   Harvill</TE>
<TE>   230 pp., $24</TE>
<TE>   Midway through C.K. Stead's finely wrought novel, "The Secret
History of Modernism," two young devotees of literature, the
narrator, Lazlo Winter, and his friend, Samantha Conlan, get to meet
one of Sammy's literary idols: novelist Christina Stead. It's a
disillusioning moment for the two young people, dismayed by Stead's
unregenerate Stalinism.</TE>
<TE>   But it may well be a clarifying moment for any reader who might
have been conflating two excellent, but very different writers from
the Antipodes: the Australian Christina Stead (1902-1983), author of
(among much else) "The Man Who Loved Children," and the New Zealand
poet, critic, editor and novelist C.K. Stead, born in 1932
and--judging from this, his latest novel--going from strength to
strength.</TE>
<TE>   As a critic, Stead has specialized in Modernism as practiced by
Ezra Pound, William Butler Yeats and T.S. Eliot: His 1964 study, "The
New Poetic," established his reputation in this field. But those who
worship at the Modernist shrine must also consider the ramifications
of embracing a movement whose leading lights included anti-Semites,
fascists, reactionaries and racists. This problem is at the crux of
Stead's new novel.</TE>
<TE>   "The Secret History of Modernism" opens at the turn of the
millennium, with Lazlo, a middle-aged novelist suffering from
writer's block, coming to a realization about his own life and the
century that's just ended:</TE>
<TE>   "There was a century of history I carried within myself which in
some sense was myself. Half of it ... I'd lived through with an adult
consciousness. Half I'd learned from ... parents, grandparents, older
friends, old soldiers; and from reading.... This narrative, or myth,
or fairy-tale, this history of the century just finished, had been
the story I knew best, went on learning, and had to tell myself over
and over in my writing, each time with a different emphasis. It was
in a way my dreamlife ... And strangely, it was the second half of
the story, the half I'd been part of, that could sometimes seem less
significant, less interesting, less momentous--a long aftermath
rather than a denouement. It was as if the twentieth century had
ended with the bullet in Hitler's brain, the opening of the Nazi
death camps, and the dropping of two atomic bombs. Since then, we'd
all been in school, trying to learn the lessons, squabbling about
what it all meant and where to go next ... "</TE>
<TE>   A New Zealander who came of age in the 1950s, Lazlo feels twice
removed--by distance and timing--from the century's worst cataclysms.
"How," he marvels, "had I lived through two thirds of the appalling
century just concluded without once dodging a bullet, hearing a bomb
explode, experiencing hunger, being execrated for my skin-color or
persecuted for my penile surgery?" He is struck by a sense of his own
inadequacy to tell stories shaped by a history he hasn't experienced
firsthand yet cannot stop thinking about.</TE>
<TE>   A chance encounter sparks memories of student days in London in
the late 1950s, when the mystique of Modernism was at its height.
Here, Lazlo and a band of his fellow "colonials"--brilliant,
mysterious Margot, also a New Zealander; the sprightly Australian
Sammy; and scholarly, spiritually questing Rajiv from India--come to
seek out the elusive center of the literary world that had enchanted
them from afar. Sammy is working on a project she calls "The Secret
History of Modernism." Indeed, it proves an exceedingly well-kept
secret, for its contents are disclosed only toward the novel's end.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy is particularly sensitive to the fate of European Jewry
because she has fallen in love with a Jewish journalist, Freddy
Goldstein, one of the few members of his family to survive the
Holocaust. Already married, Freddy has made it clear to Sammy that he
will never abandon his wife and child, not only for the usual
reasons, but also from his sense of responsibility to his people.</TE>
<TE>   With a deft, sure touch, Stead interweaves three strands of
narrative: the reflections and peregrinations of middle-aged Lazlo;
the mildly comic adventures of young Lazlo and friends in mid-century
London; and the harrowing story of the Goldsteins: Freddy's father,
who perceives the unwelcome truth and flees Europe in time, and
Freddy's uncle and family, who become trapped in the nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, through the device of Sammy's secret project, Stead
also poses this question: What role, if any, did the aesthetic
doctrines of Modernism play in contributing to a cultural climate
conducive to the merciless "hardness" exhibited by the Nazis in their
pursuit of racial "purity"? To some extent, Stead seems to be
engaging in a thoughtful critique of his own work as a critic who has
been a consistent champion of Modernism.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the poignancy of this novel resides in the contrast
between the leisurely, cultivated lives of Lazlo and his friends and
the brutal, unthinkable realities that the equally cultivated
Goldsteins were forced to confront just one generation earlier. Like
Lazlo, Stead recognizes that his ability to comprehend the century's
history is limited by the sheltered life he's been lucky enough to
lead. But in this novel, he has found a way to elucidate those
aspects of the story that he knows best.</TE>

<HD>Memorial for Diana a 'Puddle'?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET STOBART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>After nearly a year of acrimonious wrangling, a U.S. designer
Wednesday won the hotly contested competition to design a fountain
commemorating the late Princess Diana, in what one judge called "an
appropriate memorial" and another called "a puddle."</LD>
<LD>   As their memorial to the people's princess, killed in a car crash
almost five years ago, Kathryn Gustafson of Seattle and her London
partner, Neil Porter, propose a landscape feature of two ribbons of
water running in an oval stone trough down a hill into a wide shallow
pool.</LD>
<LD>   The final decision on the $4.5-million-dollar memorial on the
shores of the Serpentine lake in the middle of London's Hyde Park
came after months of squabbling over the 58 finalists.</LD>
<TE>   The judging committee of eight friends and fellow charity workers
of the princess, chaired by close companion Rosa Monckton, was
divided over the Gustafson-Porter design and that of British
architect Anish Kapoor, who proposed an avant-garde, dome-shaped
fountain.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell stepped in to resolve
the standoff and, in what she termed a "judgment of Solomon," chose
the quieter, more child-friendly of the two ideas.</TE>
<TE>   The ribbon of water will encompass an area of about 300-by-160
feet as two shallow streams of varying widths, inviting children to
splash about in hot weather or grown-ups to wander in calm
contemplation.</TE>
<TE>   In the words of Porter, the design reflects the character of the
princess: "The oval is to show the qualities of reaching out and
letting in--Diana's qualities of being able to pull people toward
her."</TE>
<TE>   The committee, appointed by the government last September, had
agreed that an outdoor water feature near the princess' former home
of Kensington Palace, rather than a more impersonal statue, was the
best way to commemorate the volatile, well-loved princess.</TE>
<TE>   Opinions were divided as to whether the final structure should be
a modern, groundbreaking work or have more traditional mass appeal.
The Gustafson-Porter idea, which the winning team described as "a
necklace across the existing contours of the site," was deemed most
appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Gustafson, once a fashion designer in Paris, has been doing
landscape architecture for the last 20 years. Her American work
includes a garden and bridge at Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza.
Porter is an architect who also works on outdoor designs and is
planning a Garden of Forgiveness in Beirut to commemorate the civil
war there.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, the Princess Diana memorial design has its critics.
While Monckton called the design "an appropriate memorial," Vivienne
Parry, longtime friend and charity worker colleague of the princess,
told the BBC, "It's very disappointing.... Here is a woman who was
the most celebrated Briton of the last quarter-century, and we've
remembered her with a puddle."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever opinions are, however, the project is expected to be
finished by the end of August 2003, in time for the sixth anniversary
of Diana's death.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it rumbled onto the market in 1999, the Ford Excursion instantly
and breathtakingly symbolized the ever-expanding girth of American
excessiveness. Seven feet tall and 19 feet long, it held nine people
and looked like a Range Rover on steroids. It didn't fit into most
parking spaces, or garages, but it slid right into a world order
fueled by dot-com millions, CEO worship, Martha-mosaiced swimming
pools and triple-shot lattes.</LD>
<LD>   Three years later, many pillars of that world have buckled under
the weight of their own excesses, and the Excursion, it seems, may
now be joining corporate double-dipping, 24-year-old Internet
billionaires and Martha Stewart in the cultural deleted-items basket.
Triple-shot lattes remain fairly popular.</LD>
<LD>   Ford, which will not confirm or deny reports out of Detroit that
it will discontinue the manufacture of its $45,000 uber-SUV, would
not pull the Excursion just because some people thought it was
ridiculous or, at 10 miles per gallon, scandalously wasteful. Ford
would pull the Excursion only because it wasn't profitable. Which
means perhaps not enough people are buying it. Which means that in an
arena often considered a bellwether of the economy, the question of
"How much is too much?" has finally been answered. Half a city block,
for a car, is too much.</LD>
<TE>   Americans finally are pushing away from the table in other areas
as well. Like the pilot whales dying on Cape Cod, big business is
beached and blowing hard. The CEOs of Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia, Tyco
and Rite-Aid have gone from titanium-card members to social pariahs,
as a Republican president, flanked by Democrats, on Tuesday signed
legislation to bring the corporate sector back into the realm of
American jurisprudence. Larger-than-life personalities have suffered
more than minor deflation--Alan Greenspan has misplaced his
omnipotence, Colin Powell is tidying up his resume, Martha Stewart
bared her teeth on TV and Mike Ovitz, once considered the most
powerful man in Hollywood, is "spending time with his family" in the
wake of a series of failed business deals and a bout of foot-in-mouth
disease.</TE>
<TE>   On a more individual level, the gleaming, fat stock portfolio,
which loomed large in public priority and imagination during recent
years, is, in most cases, withering along with many grandiose dreams
of early retirement and large lives of leisured luxury.</TE>
<TE>   During the past several years many pundits and economists have
commented on the supersizing of the American Dream. Ever since Lewis
and Clark noted to then-President Thomas Jefferson that, hey, there
might be a lot more there there than we first thought, Americans have
prided themselves on thinking big. Anything not originally available
in extra-extra large--cows, corn, breasts, profit margins, pickup
trucks--we are more than happy to genetically alter, augment, inflate
or redesign.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone likes this character trait. Internationally, it is
said to have contributed to the hatred that felled the World Trade
Center--perhaps the most visible symbol of our size-matters
psychology. Domestically, we fret over side effects ranging from
spiritual emptiness to obesity in children.</TE>
<TE>   But now it would seem that Americans are reconsidering the
importance of size. The possible loss of the Expedition is just part
of a post-SUV trend toward smaller luxe autos--precious versions of
Mercedes and squeezed Cadillacs race around with the Mini Cooper and
the Toyota Matrix like so many high-priced Matchbox cars, while the
"biggest" development is the new Bentley GT coupe, which seats four.</TE>
<TE>   But it goes way beyond wheels. The fast-food industry, which
invented the term "supersize," is being publicly blamed for the
excess weight that contributes to 300,000 deaths each year and costs
the country $117 billion in health care. Critics are calling for
legislation that would require restaurants to cop to the often
quadruple-digit calorie count of every meal.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, individually packaged, single-serving snack and
breakfast foods, developed for children on the go, have expanded into
adult fare and become the fastest-growing segment of the food
industry. Many restaurants now offer half-portions as a remedy for
the 2-inch growth of the average restaurant plate.</TE>
<TE>   As the housing market booms, buyers find themselves forced to
settle for fewer square feet. Which is often how a scaling-down trend
begins.</TE>
<TE>   "Houses will probably get smaller," says Linda Castrilli, a trend
director at Consumer Eyes in New York. "People get less and so they
assume they need less."</TE>
<TE>   All trends are cyclical, says Castrilli, so it isn't surprising
that after the pumped-up '90s, a new trend favoring the sleek and
compact would follow. Big, statement-making purchases like SUVs were
popular for a while, she says, but convenience is the new buzzword,
and "people are realizing that those big clunkers are just hard to
get around in."</TE>
<TE>   There is a backlash against big, she says, a swing to the smaller
end of the stick. "In things like cell phones and stereos and makeup,
it's always been, 'How small can you get it?' "</TE>
<TE>   We've pared down culturally, too. Grim, if slightly manipulated,
reality has replaced the over-the-top nighttime soap opera on
television--glitzy "Knots Landing" is out, low-budget "Big Brother"
is in. The new version of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" is
MTV's "Cribs," a look at the often less-than-palatial digs of rock
stars.</TE>
<TE>   Money, of course, is at the bottom of everything. Consumer
confidence dropped precipitously as the economy, perhaps the biggest
whale on the beach, threatens to go from relapse to terminal. Faith
in the power of MBAs to steer the ship is waning, and the public is
returning to more traditional, less highflying symbols of success.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of simplicity have always provided an undercurrent to
the living-large trend, but lately their murmuring has gained volume.
Even Oprah Winfrey, who is not so much a captain of industry as her
own industry, promotes simpler living. In a landscape less littered
by enormous SUVs, inflated expectations and oversized personalities,
that message might become even more clear.</TE>

<LD>It might not feel like gardening weather, but August does provide
opportunities. The days are long and evenings warm, so there is
plenty of time and even a few hours at the beginning and end of the
day when it's cooler. Watering remains job No. 1.</LD>
<LD>   As unlikely as it may sound, this month is one of the best to
start plants from seed. For seed to germinate quickly, it must be
warm, and there is no shortage of warmth now. It takes about six
weeks for seeds to sprout and grow to a size where they can be
planted in the garden. Six weeks from now, it will be
mid-September--the best time to plant all sorts of things. In flats
or packs, sow spring annuals and winter vegetables, hard-to-find
perennials and even trees and shrubs.</LD>

<LD>A Suitcase of Dreams</LD>
<LD>   Did you know that you are making history? You do it every day when
you go to school, take a vacation, or even when you play with your
friends. When your family members tell you about the schools they
attended or what kinds of clothes they used to wear, or foods they
used to eat, they are telling you about their history, which is also
your history--your "family history."</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes family histories are forgotten, but you can keep that
from happening. Help your parents gather family pictures in a box or
photo album. Write down what you can remember about each one. Keep
the information where your family can see it. Be sure to add stories
and pictures as new things happen. Soon, you will have a history
album full of interesting photos and facts about your family!</LD>
<TE>   Lots of families came to America from other places. "A Suitcase of
Dreams: Immigration Stories From the Skirball Cultural Center," is a
book published by the Skirball that tells the histories of many
Jewish families who came to the United States, sometimes with not
much more than a suitcase full of dreams.</TE>
<TE>   One young girl, Marion Stiebel Siciliano, left Germany in April
1938. Her mother told her that they were going on a vacation to
Italy, but they were really coming to America to escape from the
Nazis. Marion packed things she thought she would enjoy on vacation
like her tennis racket and harmonica.</TE>
<TE>   These objects tell a story about her immigration to America. Her
tennis racket is now part of the permanent exhibit at the Skirball
Cultural Center.</TE>
<TE>   To learn about other family histories, visit the Skirball. You can
also read about them in the book, "A Suitcase of Dreams," available
at the museum. For more information, call (310) 440-4500 or visit

<HD>Modern Redux</HD>
<DH>A firm that restores homes by mid-century architects also
strives for striking original projects</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MORRIS NEWMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is difficult to walk down the aisles of the Santa Monica
architecture firm of Marmol Radziner &amp; Associates without being
blocked by half-completed pieces of furniture. In one corner is an
unfinished chair based on a prototype by Rudolph Schindler, the
celebrated Modernist who died in 1953. A few feet away, resting on a
drafting table, is an original design by the firm for a teak-topped
table mounted on stainless-steel legs, still wet from a recent coat
of oil.</LD>
<LD>   If furniture building might seem an odd sideline for an
architectural firm, managing principal Leonardo E. Marmol says the
work is a logical outgrowth of the firm's practice in restoring homes
by legendary mid-century Modernists such as Schindler, Richard
Neutra, Harwell Harris and others.</LD>
<LD>   The furniture represents the latest new line of work for a firm
that already juggles restoration, original architectural design and a
small construction company. The furniture may also help the firm's
partners accomplish a long-sought goal to increase attention to
themselves as designers, rather than simply as restoration
architects.</LD>
<TE>   Founded 15 years ago, the firm got its first taste of
international attention in 1998 when the two architects restored
Neutra's Kaufmann House, a Palm Springs residence designed in 1947.
Since that time, Marmol and partner Ronald M. Radziner have worked on
at least 20 other historical projects, including such treasured
buildings as the Schindler House in West Hollywood and Frank Lloyd
Wright's Millard House, also known as La Miniatura, in Pasadena.
Nevertheless, doing just historical projects is not enough for the
pair. "If we only did the restorations, I think we would not feel
fulfilled," Marmol said.</TE>
<TE>   Recent work clearly shows the firm's designs are influenced by,
but not imitative of, the Modernist masters they venerate. Like those
mid-century predecessors, Marmol and Radziner are interested in
simplified shapes and minimized gestures that convey the basic
organization of buildings without superficial flashiness. They like
to display the actual construction materials in the facade, and,
unlike some Modernists, they hold a high value on a close
relationship between buildings and landscape.</TE>
<TE>   In their most personal work they strive for a subtlety intended to
reveal itself over time. "Our work does not shout," Radziner said.
Sometimes, however, the work needs to shout a little, as in the new
San Francisco offices for TBWA/Chiat/Day, which fills a century-old
warehouse with wooden walls that curve in extravagant shapes
resembling ship hulls in some places and billowing sails in others.</TE>
<TE>   Less flamboyant, but no less elegant, is their design for the
Accelerated School of South Central Los Angeles, which straddles the
thin line between being an open and friendly school and a protective
fortress. A streamlined exterior wall of translucent panels provides
plentiful natural light to the interior, while shielding students
inside from being visible from the street.</TE>
<TE>   Outwardly different, these two projects are united by the firm's
preoccupation with construction. As a means of fully controlling the
process, the firm has created its own construction firm, which builds
about two-thirds of its projects, an unusual commitment to the whole
process of designing and building for a mid-sized architectural
office of just 60 people; such a full-service practice is far more
common among much larger architectural firms.</TE>
<TE>   Yet construction is central to Marmol Radziner's design concept,
they say. As architects, "we are not looking to do some pretty
drawings and then stop," Marmol said. "This office is looking to see
a project through to completion."</TE>
<TE>   "In an age of computer-driven design, [Marmol and Radziner] are
old-fashioned craftsmen," said Sam Hall Kaplan, an architectural
critic and television news commentator.</TE>
<TE>   While not literally craftsmen themselves, the architects place a
high value on detail. In Chan Luu, a recently completed jewelry shop
near Beverly Hills, much of the store consists of display cases, made
of steel and sand-blasted wood, that the firm built in its own
cabinetry shop.</TE>
<TE>   "The raw feeling of the interior complements the jewelry, which
has an organic and earthy feeling," Radziner said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are perfectionists, but perfectionists who know how to have
fun," said Ranee Katzenstein, a federal prosecutor for whom the firm
restored a house in the Pacific Palisades, designed by the late A.
Quincy Jones, a Los Angeles architect active in the 1950s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   As in many architectural partnerships, the team of Marmol and
Radziner is a study in contrasting but complementary personalities.
Marmol, 41, is a nattily dressed bachelor with large, expressive
features and a gentle voice ideal for soothing nervous clients. He is
clearly the salesman and the rainmaker of the two.</TE>
<TE>   Radziner, also 41, a slender, intense man with straight,
shoulder-length hair who is the lead designer, is just as likely to
draw as to speak. From early childhood, he said, "I always wanted to
be an architect." Married with one child, he recently moved into a
house he designed in Venice.</TE>
<TE>   The roles of the two architects are different but overlapping. "We
both are involved in all of our projects, we both design and both of
us generally like to be at client meetings," Radziner said. Radziner
sketches out initial concepts and then passes the drawings to Marmol
to critique them. This process continues until both men are satisfied
with the design concept.</TE>
<TE>   "Ron can take a very large number of issues and coalesce them down
to a clear goal and a clear vision," Marmol said. His own role, he
added, was to manage the construction process.</TE>
<TE>   Radziner claimed the men have had few ego clashes, primarily
because they agree about the firm's basic values. "We both are so
interested in work that is conceptually clear ... from the earliest
concept to the time we hand the building over to the client," he
said. "That is why we build so much of our own work ourselves and why
we want that much control," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One possible source of kinship is that both men's parents were
refugees. Radziner is the child of Dutch Jews who hid from the Nazis
during World War II and emigrated to America shortly after. Marmol's
parents were foreign students from Cuba studying in the U.S. when
Castro came to power, and chose not to return.</TE>
<TE>   The two met in the mid-1980s as architecture undergraduates at Cal
Poly San Luis Obispo and became friends. Marmol took seven years to
finish his five-year bachelor's degree in architecture, in part
because he was working part time to support himself and in part
because of his diverse interests, including philosophy and theater.
"I always saw [the extra studies] as part of architecture," Marmol
said.</TE>
<TE>   After finishing graduate studies--Marmol at Cal Poly and Radziner
at the University of Colorado at Boulder--the future partners worked
briefly in other offices before forming their own office while still
in their 20s. The move was unusual in a profession in which young
architects typically serve long apprenticeships prior to going out on
their own.</TE>
<TE>   The big break came in 1993 with the commission from Brent and Beth
Harris, owners of Neutra's Kaufmann House, to meticulously restore
the residence, which had been severely damaged through neglect and by
the intense heat of the Coachella Valley. The project was
particularly challenging because Neutra's original plans no longer
existed; the only surviving documentation of the original project was
a list of materials and letters between the architect, his
contractors and his clients. With an undisclosed budget said to run
into millions of dollars, the multi-year project eventually won a
fistful of design awards, and led eventually for commissions for
further historic work.</TE>
<TE>   The leading academic expert on Neutra, Thomas Hines of UCLA,
pronounced the restoration work on both the Kaufmann House and the
recently completed Elliot House, an early work by Schindler in Los
Feliz, as "excellent."</TE>
<TE>   However he expressed reservations about other restoration projects
by the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "At times," said Hines, who declined to name specific cases, "I
wonder whether they had not over-restored and renovated too much of
the texture of the old buildings," which sometimes end up "looking
like new buildings, built de novo."</TE>
<TE>   In Hines' view, older buildings "should be allowed to look old."</TE>
<TE>   Radziner said the firm tries to preserve original materials
whenever possible, and when new work is combined with the old, "I
like to express the difference." New concrete flooring in the
Kaufmann House, for example, is distinct in color from the original
concrete floors that survive elsewhere in the house. Notwithstanding,
the firm made some purists raise their eyebrows when they added
structural reinforcements to portions of the sagging, leaking roof of
the Kaufmann residence.</TE>
<TE>   Radziner defended the practice of reinforcing or otherwise
altering the original construction details of projects, "if that
allows the building to survive."</TE>
<TE>   "If buildings cannot adapt to change," Marmol added, "they either
become museums or get demolished."</TE>
<TE>   Although Marmol Radziner has shown itself capable of free-flowing
inventiveness, as in the TBWA/Chiat/Day interior, Radziner said the
firm's best projects are often those that are outwardly simple.</TE>
<TE>   His personal favorite is a small, two-level house in Rustic Canyon
that consists of a redwood cube that rests atop and slightly askew to
a concrete block cube serving as the ground floor. The simple form is
in fact a complex solution to create a small house of 1,400 square
feet on a hillside that combines a garage and living space on the
first floor, a home studio on the second and a rooftop deck above
them both. The skewed angle of the second level maximizes the view
from the studio of the backyard garden.</TE>
<TE>   Upon first seeing the design, "it felt like, 'Aha! You solved a
difficult problem!' " said the home's owner, Santa Monica businessman
Michael Guttentag.</TE>
<TE>   Radziner said the project is at odds with the prevailing fashion
in architecture for attention-grabbing buildings. "A lot of recent
architecture already looks old," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He expressed admiration for "timeless architecture" such as a
group of houses designed in the 1950s by architect Ray Kappe in
Rustic Canyon. "Those houses were done maybe 50 years ago," he said,
"but they still have something to say today."</TE>

<HD>A Welcoming Light</HD>
<DH>With a skylight and glass staircase, a new store is all
sunshine and Apples</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET EASTMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three Apple loyalists, unaccustomed to the sun, waited outside for
seven hours recently to be the first customers inside the computer
company's new store at the Grove shopping center in the Fairfax
district.</LD>
<LD>   Someone's sympathetic remark, "Well, at least the weather's nice,"
was met with an incredulous, "Do we look like outside people?"</LD>
<LD>   Well, guys, you better find some shades because there's something
new in this Apple store: natural light. A skylight, about the size of
a four-car garage door, dominates the two-story space, spraying
sunshine onto software libraries, product pods and the store's
centerpiece, a mesmerizing glass staircase.</LD>
<TE>   The skylight and the staircase, which match the translucent and
metal look of Apple's computers, are part of a new, two-story design
for the company's stores that recently debuted here and in New York's
SoHo.</TE>
<TE>   The light-reflecting, see-through staircase that hangs between the
first and second floors and floats a few inches off the ground is
designed to entice people upstairs, say Apple retail space designers.</TE>
<TE>   The staircase's six 5-by-19-foot glass panes are suspended from
the second floor and hold five tons of laminated-glass treads. Made
in Germany to sway with California quakes, the staircase occupies
about one-tenth of the 8,000-square-foot store. It is illuminated by
the skylight during the day, and at night, a dozen floodlights
embedded in the floor make it look like a lighted jewelry box.</TE>
<TE>   No commercial messages or products cling to the glass sides,
adding to the sense that the staircase serves only two functions: to
transport you safely between floors and to look good.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of simple practicality and attractiveness is mirrored in
Apple's approach to product design and packaging. Empty space, either
on product boxes or in stores, helps people focus on what's
important: the product.</TE>
<TE>   The first floor is spartan, in an inviting way. Boxes of inventory
are kept in a storeroom, cash registers are tucked in the back of the
store, and the minimal soft-gray signage is attached to the ceiling
to guide shoppers without overwhelming them.</TE>
<TE>   Prominent on the floor are 50 Apple computers, including the iMacs
that resemble desk lamps with their white, rounded hard-drive bases,
metallic swivel arms and flat-panel screens. The sleek computers
share counter space with add-ons used to record music, edit movies,
publish magazines or whatever interests the shopper.</TE>
<TE>   In the photography area, a white wavy table holds a Minolta DiMage
X digital camera, which is the size of a cigarette case, and an
iBook. Nearby is an Epson printer, all plugged in and waiting for
shoppers to touch and try.</TE>
<TE>   The first floor follows the standard store model created by Apple
Chief Executive Steve Jobs and his retail design team, who spent 15
months making sketches, building models and experimenting with
full-size store layouts in a Cupertino warehouse before opening the
first Apple stores in Glendale and McLean, Va., in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "The store is bright and clean, and looks like a giant G4
cube"--Apple's distinctive acrylic cube of a computer--says Clint
Stevenson. The 17-year-old Malibu resident and his friends, Justin
Holguin, 17, also of Malibu, and Matt Van Horn, 18, of Pacific
Palisades, were the Apple die-hards who held a vigil to see the store
first when it opened July 26.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than sterile and lifeless, it just feels pure and happy,"
says Stevenson.</TE>
<TE>   The second floor is devoted to after-the-sale services, where
customers and their children can learn how to use computers. A cheery
kids' zone has been mapped out by red rugs encircling two white
Corian tables.</TE>
<TE>   On the 2-foot-high tables are a ring of eMac computers, desktop
models designed for education, which are loaded with children's
computer games and connected to the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Opposite the children's area is a theater with a rear-projection
screen where composers, film editors and other professionals
demonstrate how they use Apple's Mac products.</TE>
<TE>   Near the theater area is the modestly named Genius Bar, staffed by
Apple experts. The wooden help desk has 10 black bar stools designed
by Alvor Alto, and a 34-inch-high pull-out table that, like the
product display tables, is low enough to be wheelchair-accessible.</TE>

<LD>Every day for three weeks Jason was at Mrs. Crabb's door right after
breakfast.</LD>
<LD>   "Dust the dining room, polish the silver," she said. "Sweep the
front porch and weed the rose garden. If there's time, you can run to
the market and get me a quart of milk."</LD>
<LD>   It was hard work, but Jason kept thinking about what would come
afterward and he always said, "OK, Mrs. Crabb." He never thought of
her as Old Crabby any longer.</LD>
<TE>   "Time's up," she would call finally. "Wash your hands and I'll
meet you at the piano in five minutes."</TE>
<TE>   He always played "Chopsticks" once or twice to get warmed up, then
some scales to limber his fingers. Only then would he take a look at
the sheet music on the stand.</TE>
<TE>   At first the little black dots and all the lines were a confusing
hodgepodge. They made sense after he learned that each dot meant he
should press a certain key on the keyboard. When he did it right he
could play real music.</TE>
<TE>   "Good work," Mrs. Crabb said. "That was lovely."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, after his lesson, she would play for him. She promised
that one day, if he kept practicing, he'd be able to play just as
well.</TE>
<TE>   This was the way it was until Pete got home from camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Jason," Pete shouted outside Mrs. Crabb's window that first
morning. "What'cha doing in there? I got a new bike. Want to see?"</TE>
<TE>   Sitting at the piano, Jason hit a wrong key, then another. "Pay
attention, Jason," Mrs. Crabb said. "Your friend can wait."</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Jason," Pete yelled again. "I got tons to tell you about
camp. Are you coming out or not?"</TE>
<TE>   Jason lifted his hands from the keyboard. "I'm sorry, Mrs. Crabb.
Pete's my best friend." He edged off the piano bench and stood up.</TE>
<TE>   "I see," Mrs. Crabb said. She looked sad. "Will I see you
tomorrow?"</TE>
<TE>   Jason could not meet her eyes. "I dunno," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Will Jason continue with his piano lessons now that his
friend Pete is home from camp?</TE>
<TE>   Mary Louise Downer agrees with the Scottish historian and essayist
Thomas Carlyle, who said over 100 years ago, "Music is well said to
be the speech of angels." This story will be on The Times' Web site
at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<LD>Country singer Toby Keith's "Unleashed" album leads a flurry of new
releases entering the Top 15 of the nation's sales chart this week,
according to Nielsen SoundScan.</LD>
<LD>   Keith's collection sold 338,000 copies last week, giving it a
50,000 lead over the runner-up, volume 10 of the "Now That's What I
Call Music" hit compilation series.</LD>
<LD>   The other newcomers in the Top 15 are rapper Lil' Wayne (No. 6),
teen R&amp;B singer Mario (No. 9), vocal group Boyz II Men (No. 10) and
rockers TRUSTcompany (No. 11).</LD>
<TE>   The other spots in the Top 10 are held, in order, by Nelly, the
Dave Matthews Band, Eminem, Avril Lavigne and the Red Hot Chili
Peppers. Meanwhile, the big question is how Bruce Springsteen's new
"The Rising" will fare on next week's chart. Geoff Mayfield, director
of charts for Billboard magazine, says it is a certain No. 1 album,
"easily eclipsing Springsteen's highest first-week total since
SoundScan began monitoring U.S. record sales a decade ago." That was
the 250,000 registered by "Greatest Hits" in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   On the singles chart, Wyclef Jean's "Two Wrongs" is No. 1.</TE>

<LD>   The opening night at SummerFest La Jolla 2002 is a genuine
embarrassment of riches. The players include violinists Cho-Liang Lin
and Leila Josefowicz, violist Michael Tree, cellists Ralph Kirshbaum
and Ronald Leonard, and pianists Leon Fleisher, John Novacek and
Christopher O'Riley. The program? Schubert's F-minor Fantasy, Samuel

<TE>   Director and writer M. Night Shyamalan ("The Sixth Sense,"
"Unbreakable") weaves a suspenseful tale about an ordinary farmer
whose life is interrupted by the mysterious appearance of crop
circles in his fields. In "Signs," the farmer, played by Mel Gibson,
attempts to find the meaning and cause of the curious swaths cut
through his cornfields. But what he discovers might change forever
the lives of his brother (Joaquin Phoenix) and children (Rory Culkin,
Abigail Breslin).</TE>
<TE>   "Signs," rated PG-13 for some frightening moments, opens Friday in
general release.</TE>
<TE>   all day Movies</TE>
<TE>   Steven Soderbergh ("sex, lies and videotape") returns to his
low-budget roots with "Full Frontal," a comedy about people, love and
relationships: Linda would love to be loved. Carl loves his wife,
Lee. Lee is looking to be loved by Calvin. Calvin plays Nicholas, who
discovers he's in love with Catherine. Catherine, who is really
Francesca, finds true love. And Gus loves himself. Totally lost?
Well, a fine ensemble cast--David Duchovny, Nicky Katt, David Hyde
Pierce, Julia Roberts and Blair Underwood--leads the way through. See
related story, Page 34.</TE>
<TE>   "Full Frontal," rated R for language and some sexual content,
opens Friday in selected theaters.</TE>

<TE>   The 1973 film "Enter the Dragon" was Bruce Lee's debut as an
English-language action movie star. He made only one more film before
dying that year, at 32. Robert Clouse directs this, the classiest and
shiniest of all of Lee's vehicles, which features some of the best
martial arts fight scenes ever filmed. And it is these sequences,
along with Lee's intense, glaring presence, that have made "Dragon" a
cult favorite. John Saxon and Jim Kelly co-star, with Kien Shih and
Ahna Capri.</TE>

<LD>   A senator's wife finds herself on a life-changing journey as she
struggles to reconnect with her unfulfilled dreams in "When Grace
Comes In," a world premiere drama by Heather McDonald, co-produced by
La Jolla Playhouse and Seattle Repertory Theatre. Seattle Rep's
artistic director, Sharon Ott, will direct the show.</LD>
<LD>   "When Grace Comes In," La Jolla Playhouse, La Jolla Village Drive
and Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, 7 p.m. Regular schedule: Tuesdays to

<TE>   2pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   Most people would use the word "improvisation" to describe what
choreographer Loretta Livingston and composer Robin Cox are
performing with their four-member ensembles in the Central Library
under the title "Move/Let Us Listen." But Livingston and Cox aren't
most people, so they call it "live composition," a manner of working
in which the performance space and the performing relationships
inspire in-the-moment choices within set choreographic or musical
structures. Cox's score will use marimba, vibes, clarinet and violin,
while Livingston's dances not only will have to work well with those
instruments but, in her words, "be shaped for the specific container
(the room) and carefully planned to occupy the right amount of time
(one hour)." The collaboration went splendidly in "Dances for White
Rooms" at Cal State L.A. last year, so hopes are high for this second
creative encounter.</TE>
<TE>   Loretta Livingston and Dancers and the Robin Cox Ensemble in
"Move/Let Us Listen," Mark Taper Auditorium, Central Library, 5th and
Flower streets, downtown L.A., 2 p.m. $5. (213) 228-7025.</TE>
<TE>   all day Art</TE>
<TE>   Tithu are dolls that play a major role in a Hopi girl's rite of
passage and are believed to be created from the appearance of spirit
beings known as katsina. Often incorrectly referred to as "kachina,"
these dolls and their depictions are imitated and appropriated for
tourist kitsch, commercial advertising, political iconography and
fine art. Original tithu from the 19th century and later will be on
view in "Katsina/Kachina: Tradition, Appropriation, Innovation," at
UCLA's Fowler Museum. The exhibition will explore the pervasive
presence of katsina and "kachina" on the Southwestern landscape
through gallery paintings and sculpture, toys, clothing, non-Hopi
copies and souvenirs.</TE>
<TE>   "Katsina/Kachina: Tradition, Appropriation, Innovation," UCLA
Fowler Museum of Cultural History, UCLA campus, Westwood. Wednesdays

recitations from his journal to offbeat sonic accompaniment.</TE>

<HD>Spunky 'Sylvia' Is a Thoughtful Romp</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OK, so A.R. Gurney's "Sylvia" may not be the pick of the theatrical
litter when it comes to probing the depths of the human soul.
Nevertheless, this breezy 1995 hit comedy about a man who finds
solace from his midlife crisis by adopting a stray mutt can still
charm its way past the most cynical defenses.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura's Rubicon Theatre Company revival smartly applies
heavyweight headliners to extract considerable substance from a
lightweight romp, without overburdening its good-natured appeal.</LD>
<LD>   Kristi Lynes, who took over the title role from Sarah Jessica
Parker on Broadway, sports her impeccable pedigree and training to
fine effect as the endearing anthropomorphized manifestation of the
spunky canine who converses freely with her new owner, Greg (Joe
Spano). Spano's finely nuanced Greg, a disillusioned investment
broker at loose ends since his children flew the nest, is
convincingly transformed by Sylvia's unfiltered emotional purity.</LD>
<TE>   Despite their hilarious and often touching exchanges, this play is
about more than an ageless boy and his dog. Director James O'Neil
skillfully sustains the underlying contrast between the unconditional
love one experiences with animals and the compromises of complex,
adult human relationships.</TE>
<TE>   To clarify this distinction, the character of Greg's wife, Kate
(Laurie Walters), is pivotal. The easy choice would have been to let
her increasing frustration with Greg's doting on Sylvia turn Kate
into the jealous villain of the piece. Instead, Walters keeps Kate
sympathetic enough to reveal her antagonism as a defensive reaction
to protect a marriage she not only believes is threatened, but also
feels is worth fighting for.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the cast in a trio of supporting roles, Marc Cardiff,
shines as a fellow dog owner who bonds with Greg during their park
walks, but proves less convincing as a fussy socialite, and his turn
as a smarmy, androgynous therapist can't salvage a pointless scene
later that caters to silly laughs instead of paving the way for
Greg's abrupt change of heart.</TE>
<TE>   Unfazed, this "Sylvia" wags away any logistical lapses, its
boundless energy offering welcome uplift for the dog days of summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Sylvia," Laurel Theatre, 1006 E. Main St., Ventura.
Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Aug.
18. $33-$38. (805) 667-2900. Run time: 2:25.</TE>

<LD>Club Make-up is going out in a blaze of glammed-up glory with a
celebration of the 30th-anniversary of David Bowie's "Ziggy Stardust"
album Saturday at the El Rey Theatre. The monthly L.A. dance club,
which ushered in a new era in fashion and music, is saying sayonara
with the Bowie blowout. But promoter Joseph Brooks says it's the
first of many farewell shows, with plans in the works for periodic
mega Make-up parties. We sure hope so.</LD>
<LD>   Daddy's/Well owner Craig Trager has gotten his hands on Jolly
Jack's, a Santa Monica bar he's transforming into a new spot called
the Last Call, which is scheduled to open in September. He also
leased the old Olive location, with plans to reopen it as the Fairfax
in early 2003. Business at the Well's been swell. In recent weeks,
the Sunset Boulevard bar's attracted rockers such as Incubus and the
Flaming Lips. And speaking of flaming lips, we also spotted actor
Colin Farrell sucking face with a sexy model at the Well.... Former
House of Blues talent buyer John Pantle has signed on with the
Knitting Factory, which should mean good things for the Hollywood
nightclub....</LD>
<TE>   Jeepers creepers! Siousxie and the Banshees play the Hollywood
Palladium on Aug. 11, and we hear the Garden of Eden's getting jiggy
with a new Wednesday night jazz series.... Liquid Kitty's gonna purr
this Sunday as rockabilly blues crooner Jake LaBotz lights up the
swanky Westside bar.... Gary Richards, the host of the Downtown LA
Standard's Sunday Service (see Club Review, this page) says he's got
plans to promote a Thursday night dance club at Ivar, a new club
being renovated by the folks behind Nacional (formerly Fuel) and
Tengu.... And scenestress Pamita Neptuna tells me her all-girl Cheap
Trick cover band, Cheap Trix, is making its debut at the Garage in
Silver Lake on Aug. 31. We surrender....</TE>

<HD>A Hotel Parties on the Roof</HD>
<DH>Downtown LA Standard takes advantage of city views with a
cheeky, over-the-top setting for happy hour and dancing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEIDI SIEGMUND CUDA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's much to be said for the whimsical new Downtown LA Standard
hotel, but we recommend heading straight for the roof. Like an oasis
in a sea of concrete, the hotel's colorful rooftop setting is a Pop
art gem. Maybe it's the Space Age waterbeds with the vibrating
cushions that really put it over the top, but the roof scene is so
cheeky, you feel as if you're in a Peter Sellers cocktail comedy and
everyone's in on the joke.</LD>
<LD>   Capitalizing on the beauty of downtown from its rooftop vantage
point, the 10-week-old hotel--which is located in the 1950s-era
Superior Oil building--offers a groovy setting for guests to gather
at sunset and dance. Those familiar with the Standard on Sunset
Boulevard will find the primary colors and true-blue Astroturf
familiar. But this downtown version includes a rooftop patio with a
ridiculously warm pool--perfect for an evening dip--and a multitude
of cozy lounges and beds. The nightly happy hours have been packed
since the hotel made its debut with a splashy slumber party and owner
Andre Balazs' christening bash, which included such guests as Spike
Jonze, Sofia Coppola and actress Gina Gershon.</LD>
<TE>   The hotel's spacious rooms and inexpensive prices ($125 and up)
have already made it a popular hang for Angelenos looking to get away
without the hassle of a drive. It also offers a nice respite from the
Hollywood shuffle. Because it's downtown in the evening, it's oh so
quiet. Except on that roof, where people are getting down nightly.
Throughout the week, anyone can pay 20 bucks to get up there and be
treated to DJs spinning smooth international sounds and R&amp;B.</TE>
<TE>   The real capper is the Sunday Service, an all-day party hosted by
Gary Richards, a music exec who's been throwing downtown parties for
years. The Sunday Service begins at 1 in the afternoon and continues
until 9 p.m.--and for many, it continues indefinitely as guests
decide to check in rather than check out.</TE>
<TE>   For some reason, everyone looks remarkably good during the day, as
the fresh-faced crowd dresses in rainbow shades, a nice match with
the roof's burgundy carpet, yellow chairs and smashing orange
benches. And the backdrop is truly stunning. The surrounding 20th
century monoliths such as the California Bank and Trust, MCI,
Citigroup and First Business Bank buildings feel close enough to
reach out and touch. As it gets later, things get splashy and the
pool party begins.</TE>
<TE>   Those interested in checking out any of its rooftop party scenes
may want to note that you don't have to wait for the single elevator
on the roof. You can walk down a flight of stair, and do a horseshoe
around to a set of four elevators on the floor below. Trust me,
you'll be glad you took the advice. But on your way out, do yourself
a favor and take a leisurely route.</TE>
<TE>   There's much to see at the new hotel. The building, which was also
a Bank of California in the '70s, is a historic landmark, so designer
Shawn Hausman couldn't touch certain features; the original elevator
interiors and marble floors stayed as-is. But the combination of new
and old minimalism adds up to a warm experience. Although
brand-spanking new, it feels old and already broken in.</TE>
<TE>   The front desk clerks wear '60s-style stewardess outfits, which
look smashing with the fuchsia-colored couches in the lobby. The
men's and women's restrooms are connected, too, so you really never
know who'll be washing their hands next to you. Again, it's cheeky,
yet appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Other notable spots include the fire-pit pond in the outside
first-floor patio and its lemonade-colored, 24-hour diner, which
shows Hausman's work at its finest. It's so sunshine sweet it looks
like a '70s cafeteria on acid.</TE>
<TE>   With the Downtown LA Standard, Balazs has made a remarkable
contribution to an area that clearly desired it. There goes the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown LA Standard, 550 S. Flower St., downtown L.A., (213)
892-8080. Rooftop happy hours, 21 and older; $10-$20 cover. Sunday

<HD>No Fusion Confusion Here</HD>
<DH>Zicca in Beverly Hills has an Asian-based menu and a
seamless and sensible blending of styles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zicca is a stylish place of glass and chrome and white walls, a
sweet, dainty place with a serene Asian feel. Above all, it's a very
intimate place, and when I say intimate, I mean it has about five
tables.</LD>
<LD>   The whole effect is so charming that it goes a long way to make up
for the accumulated sins of fusion cooking. That's right, Zicca's
full name is Zicca Fusion Cuisine. But have no fear; this is not
Zicca Flashy Lunatic Cuisine. What fusion there is mostly takes place
within the family of Asian cuisines, with just a few careful European
elements.</LD>
<LD>   For an appetizer, you can get Vietnamese wokked ribs, which are a
bit like the familiar lacquered Cantonese barbecue ribs but with a
particularly attractive scent of star anise. Endive filled with
minced chicken is a sensible variation on the familiar
lettuce-wrapped chicken deal, because an endive leaf is a sturdier
thing to wrap with. It comes with same sort of sweet bean sauce that
you'd expect on moo shu pork. Shrimp spring rolls include some green
leaf (spinach?) and are served with a green salad.</LD>
<TE>   To tell the truth, the rest of the appetizers are so far from
being flashy that they're too plain for my taste. Firecracker chicken
is bits of white meat stir-fried with sweet peppers, not hot ones.
The green papaya salad is just some shrimp and julienned green papaya
in lime dressing.</TE>
<TE>   After that, though, there's scarcely a dud. Five-spice beef is a
big bowl of noodles in a meaty broth, topped with sliced beef and
fried onions. Even chow mein is worth ordering here. It comes with a
mixture of plum sauce and hot sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Sichuan spiced smoked sea bass is delicately cooked but good and
smoky--some of its smoke flavor is picked up by the matchsticks of
sliced zucchini that it comes on (like several other entrees). Seared
salmon filet comes with an Asian ratatouille of tomatoes and
eggplant; the menu refers to a Thai curry sauce, but as I had it, the
excellent salmon was covered with whole-seed mustard.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best dishes is Chinese spice-crusted lamb chops--sweet,
delicate chops accompanied by corn kernels, cherry tomatoes, braised
daikon and a faintly sweet rust-red sauce fragrant with fresh ginger
and star anise.</TE>
<TE>   Here comes the fusion part. The sauteed duck breast rubbed with
tapenade seems totally European, with the flavor of black olives and
capers as a nice, subtle match for the dark meat. Sliced filet of
beef comes with a richly aromatic ragout of mixed dried mushrooms
that might have a whiff of bean sauce in it. In any case, it's a very
meaty effect, and not at all the crazy sort of fusion.</TE>
<TE>   There, that wasn't so hard, was it?</TE>
<TE>   Dessert, the weak suit of most Asian restaurants, is actually one
of Zicca's best parts. One night it was a cream puff--one big cream
puff with some sweet spices in the filling, surrounded with chopped
fruit (which play the same decorative role here as the greens that
ornament a lot of the entrees). Another night there was a
yellow-orange mango custard, which lacked a little variety--it was
all one flavor the whole way through, but a very pure mango flavor.</TE>
<TE>   The best was the strikingly handsome red-bean cheesecake, marbled
with purplish red beans. I suppose it was a cheesecake--it had a bit
of tart frosting like a cheesecake--but what I really tasted were the
sweet beans. Of course, if you don't like this stuff, there's an ice
cream and candy shop in the same mall.</TE>
<TE>   This location has seen a million eateries over the years, from Hot
Dog USA to L.A.'s only heart-healthy Albanian restaurant, and they've
all had to wrestle with its parking problem. Any restaurant on this
spot has to share its mini-mall lot with several other businesses,
the side streets have parking restrictions, and there's no parking on
Olympic Boulevard until 7 p.m. If you get there at the stroke of 7,
of course, there's parking aplenty. And it's just a short walk down
Olympic to a large liquor store, which will be handy for dealing with
Zicca's other problem, until it gets its wine license.</TE>
<TE>   Zicca Fusion Cuisine, 9123 Olympic Blvd., Beverly Hills. (310)
246-9178. Lunch, 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday; dinner,
5 to 10 p.m. daily. No alcohol. Small parking lot. MasterCard and
Visa. Dinner for two, $29-$35.</TE>
<TE>   What to get: Vietnamese wokked ribs, endive with minced chicken,
Sichuan spice smoked sea bass, Chinese spice-crusted lamb chops,
filet of beef with mushroom ragout, red bean cheesecake.</TE>

<HD>It's a Mall World After All</HD>
<DH>Indoors or out? High-rent or lowbrow? With movies or
without? Decisions, decisions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD>Leslee Komaiko is a Los Angeles-based freelance writer
and frequent contributor to Calendar Weekend.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is almost 4 p.m. on a hot afternoon. The sun is harsh. You'd think
people would be snapping up sunglasses at $14 a pop. But Mike
Stickney's ledger tells another story: four sales all day.</LD>
<LD>   Stickney, 24, works at one of those ubiquitous boutiques on wheels
that dot area shopping malls. Sometimes he's at Hollywood &amp; Highland.
Today he's at Paseo Colorado in Pasadena, the open-air,
Mediterranean-inspired center a few blocks east of Old Town that
replaced the much-maligned, dark-brick behemoth Plaza Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been slow," he says, setting down his Tolkien paperback.
Weekends aren't much better. "I think L.A. has too many malls," he
offers. "They flooded the market."</LD>
<TE>   Nor is the economy helping the sunglasses trade. Despite a few
recent uplifting swings, consumers are still keeping their
pocketbooks shut. Many go to malls with little intention of buying,
resisting the seemingly irresistible: a pair of Banana Republic denim
cargo shorts, for example, discounted from $45 to $9.99. Going to the
mall has become an all-take, no-give, fun-for-the-entire-family free
activity, like an afternoon at the beach or the park. Show me what
you've got and I'll maybe show you the money at some future date,
when the economy's a bit more sunny.</TE>
<TE>   California leads the nation in terms of mall square footage, with
Florida a distant second. And if bigger is better, we're ahead there
too, with three of the 10 largest malls in the country right here in
Southern California, according to the International Council of
Shopping Centers. (Del Amo Fashion Center, Lakewood Center Mall and
South Coast Plaza, for those keeping score.)</TE>
<TE>   To get a sense of our mall mania, start at the beach and head
east, and there's Santa Monica Place and Third Street Promenade,
Westfield Shoppingtown Fox Hills, the Promenade at Howard Hughes
Center, the Westside Pavilion, Westfield Shoppingtown Century City,
the Beverly Center, the Grove, Hollywood &amp; Highland, Paseo Colorado,
the Glendale Galleria, plus the Calabasas Commons, the Sherman Oaks
Galleria, Fashion Square, Del Amo Fashion Center, the Galleria at
South Bay. And this list doesn't include the many Beverly
Connection-style strip malls scattered around Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The trick for Angelenos is knowing how to best use this largess,
to mall intelligently. And no, that's not an oxymoron. Do you want a
Macy's or a manicure, or both? A movie or a toy store? A greasy
burger or a steak? Do you want to scope chicks? Indoors or outdoors?
(While outdoors is the current trend, in Sherman Oaks in August,
refrigerated Fashion Square has special appeal.) Do you want an
experience?</TE>
<TE>   "Experience," according to Tim Magill of the Jerde Partnership, a
Los Angeles-based architecture and urban design firm whose projects
have included Universal Citywalk, San Diego's Horton Plaza and
Fashion Island in Newport Beach, is the buzzword of the day in mall
concepts. It is what distinguishes newcomers like the Grove from
malls like the Beverly Center, which at 20 now seems oddly quaint,
practically vintage.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of people dig the experiential onslaught, the
Imax-ing of the mall experience. Plain-wrapped life is clearly not
enough. Over and over in conversation, people name the Grove their
favorite among the rookie malls. "The Grove has every bell and
whistle you can jam into a project," says Magill, including a dancing
fountain and a working, life-size, double-decker trolley to convey
patrons from one end of the two-block center to the other--perhaps
the ultimate symbol of Angelenos' allergy to perambulation. "It's the
Christmas tree of retail," says Magill. "It's got a lot of trim."</TE>
<TE>   If all this sounds a bit Disneyland-ish, it is. And not everyone
is eager to don mouse ears. Some prefer their shopping unadulterated.
Generally, this is the same group that resents those television
screens in the supermarket checkout line and occasionally envies the
Amish. Call them purists. Call them old-fashioned. Call them
curmudgeonly. In any case, you aren't likely to find these folks at
the Grove, or Hollywood &amp; Highland for that matter. If you did,
they'd look, well, shellshocked.</TE>
<TE>   "I like everything about it," says 12-year-old Amir Gholizadeh of
the Grove, as the shiny green trolley, packed with parents and
children, passes by. "It's big like a city. It has nice shops and
nice transportation. It's clean. You get to enjoy the fresh air and
see birds. Inside the Beverly Center, you can't really enjoy the day.
I like this more than any other mall."</TE>
<TE>   Gholizadeh and his mom are such fans, in fact, that today they
have brought their house guests from Kansas. "We wanted to show them
what L.A. is and all the nice things that are here, like Ripley's
Believe It or Not," he says.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't only kids enjoying what Magill, with professional
appreciation, calls "a thematic Beverly Hills." Los Angeles' usually
harried adult populace seems a bit more at ease here. People look
happy wandering the winding walkways, past stained-glass streetlights
and Easter-colored facades that are neither French nor Spanish but a
low-volume Every Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's that sanitized feel. But it reminds me of my childhood,"
says Bill Gucwa, 38, a writer from Sherman Oaks, parked on a bench
outside Anthropologie while his girlfriend browses inside. "I like
this place, but I'm almost ashamed to admit it. It's a strange
appeal. Maybe it's a fantasy." It's also the "mix," the combination
of stores and restaurants and how they are laid out.</TE>
<TE>   "The mix is very important," says Margaret Crawford of Harvard
University's urban planning department. "It is fundamental to
attracting the right demographic." It is fundamental to attracting
anyone at all.</TE>
<TE>   Paseo Colorado for example, while a nice shell, designed to
harmonize with the older surrounding buildings, has a so-so mix that
includes fuddy-duddy boutiques like the Yankee Candle Company and
Harry &amp; David, and that helps to explain the quiet. (No one goes to
the mall for Pepper &amp; Onion Relish.) Yes, there's a Macy's, a Border
Grill and a P.F. Chang's Chinese Bistro. But there's no Banana
Republic, no Gap, no Pottery Barn. It's like Playboy without the
centerfold. And handsome planters and decorative fountains,
particularly those that aren't working half the time, can't make up
for this deficiency. Nor is it easy to woo people away from nearby
Old Town, which is more or less a mall disguised as a street.</TE>
<TE>   One strategy is to deliver a tightly focused mix. At the brand-new
Costa Mesa center called the Camp, where the theme is nature and the
great outdoors (arguably the most unlikely mall theme ever), every
tenant, from A16 to Billabong, has an active or outdoorsy slant.
(They even pipe in the Zen sounds of wind, waves and chirping birds
throughout the center.) The more common tactic, however, is to hit
'em with the familiar favorites.</TE>
<TE>   The Grove--designed by Dave Williams, senior vice president of
architecture for the mall's developer Caruso Affiliated Holdings--has
a Banana Republic, a Gap that Gucwa proclaims the mother of all Gaps,
and a Pottery Barn Kids as well as a Nordstrom and the largest Barnes
&amp; Noble in all of California. To a mall junkie, this is some good
stuff. To a mall developer too. "Every mall in the world wants these
stores," says Magill. That said, the Grove isn't everyone's first
choice for hard-core shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "If I wanted to hang out, I'd go to the Grove," says Erika
Esbensen, a 34-year-old financial analyst. "If I wanted to go
shopping, I'd go to Fashion Square."</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a serious shopper, the Grove is too small," concurs her
friend and colleague, Elizabeth Cho, 30.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, Esbensen and Cho, dismissed from their Glendale
office due to a bomb scare, are lunching at the Sherman Oaks
Galleria, which unveiled it's renovated self last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The Galleria used to be a classic mall along the lines of the
Beverly Center. A teenage girl's dream, it was memorialized in songs
like Moon Zappa's "Valley Girl" and the movie "Fast Times at
Ridgemont High."</TE>
<TE>   Today, it's an urban entertainment center, or UEC, to borrow from
those in the business. The anchor is a multiplex theater, which is
surrounded by a handful of restaurants and fast-food eateries that
are heavily used by area office workers. In fact, the place resembles
a giant corporate cafeteria around noon on a weekday, with many of
the younger workers in particular sporting their necklace security
badges while they lunch. (For the record, this is not a good look.)
There's also a gym and a Burke Williams spa and aisles and aisles of
available parking spots, at least during the workday.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a shopping center," says Brandy Brandshagen, 54,
a social worker visiting from Guam who had wandered over from his
nearby hotel in search of a belt, which he forgot to pack. Like
others, Brandshagen took the escalators up to the top level of the
central concourse, a sharp, modern, concrete structure, looking for
that elusive store. Then he turned around and came back down. The
visit wasn't a complete wash, however. He had lunch at the Cheesecake
Factory and picked up a Ravi Shankar CD at Tower Records.</TE>
<TE>   The unfortunately named Promenade at Howard Hughes Center--it's
too long and confusing to boot, given Santa Monica's established
Third Street Promenade--is another one of these newfangled urban
entertainment centers, though there's a bit more retail at this
complex along the 405 Freeway north of LAX, including a Nordstrom
Rack, Borders Books and Music, as well as the requisite water
element.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the sound of water has a liberating effect on the
pocketbook. The main draw, however, is the Bridge Cinema De Lux,
which offers stadium-style seating.</TE>
<TE>   "We mainly shop at the South Bay Galleria. But we hate that
theater because there are too many people," says Sylvia Hill of Los
Angeles, a teacher taking in a movie and lunch with her graphic
designer husband Richard in honor of their anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   "The only time it was mobbed here was for 'Star Wars.' " Hill, who
is in her 40s, adds she likes the openness of the center, which is
theme-free and done up in muted mauves and grays for an overall
effect that is inoffensive but also forgettable.</TE>
<TE>   Compare this with Hollywood &amp; Highland. It's like putting the
school librarian next to Gwen Stefani. Hollywood &amp; Highland is big
and brash and loud and proud of it. It is very Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   In Babylon Court, there's a curious Egyptian motif. Two giant
elephant sculptures tower overhead. Presumably the elephants are a
nod to D.W. Griffith's memorable set for the 1916 film "Intolerance,"
but it feels more like Luxor leftovers. Rock music blares from the
speakers. And every few feet, there's a quote underfoot from an
unnamed actor or producer. It's a cute idea. But clearly the lawyers
weren't around when they made the decision to continue the quotes on
the main stairway entering the court: reading + stairs = broken ankle
= lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The critics have had a field day. And no question: The place is
not especially user-friendly. Stairways lead to nothing, and getting
from A to B requires advanced algebra, or at the minimum, an
instructional video. In technical terms, "the circulation armature is
not conducive to seeing all the tenants," offers Magill. Maybe this
is why Build-A-Bear Workshop, a popular attraction that allows
children to "build" a stuffed animal for about 35 bucks (talk about a
do-it-yourself premium) has little bears and arrows pointing the way
to their storefront.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, says Magill, "the main conceit of the project is you
ascend these stairs and see the Hollywood sign. But once you do that,
it's like, I've done that. Then people leave."</TE>
<TE>   Talk to actual users, though, and you'll hear something different.
"I love it," says Anthony Montoya, a 20-year-old student from Sylmar
checking out the place with three friends. "I usually go to the
Glendale Galleria. But this has an artsy feel. And the
people-watching is great."</TE>
<TE>   Tourists line up in front of the Kodak Theatre for snapshots. It's
not quite as good as spotting Pamela Anderson or Arnold and Maria.
But it qualifies as a brush with celebrity for most. As for the
shops, it's a mixed bag. There's Louis Vuitton and a Swarovski
crystal boutique. The chichi Celine store, however, is already gone.</TE>
<TE>   There's also Hot Topic and Burger King. Either someone's slumming
or Eliza Doolittle is getting a new dress. But at least you can get a
decent meal before catching whatever blockbuster is playing at
Grauman's Chinese Theatre next door. In addition to California Pizza
Kitchen, there's the Grill on Hollywood, sister to Beverly Hills'
Grill on the Alley, and a very chic Wolfgang Puck place called Vert.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these new centers' attempts to offer something beyond the
latest in designer denim, some Angelenos remain adamantly anti-mall.</TE>
<TE>   "I stay away from them," says Mitch Moshe, a 25-year-old student
from Thousand Oaks. "The stores are completely played out. I feel
like a robot, like a sheep being herded to Old Navy." Then again, he
says, "There are a lot of good-looking women at the Grove."</TE>
<TE>   Some experiences are harder to resist than others.</TE>

<DH>Here's a look at four new, or newly remodeled, malls and
what they offer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslee Komaiko</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Grove</LD>
<LD>   The Experience: Somewhere between small-town European charm and
highly processed Vegas-style schlock.</LD>
<LD>   Beyond the Gap: The usual suspects, plus a few notable lures
including an Apple computer store and Sur La Table.</LD>
<TE>   Sustenance: Farmer's Market, just a short trolley ride away, gives
"fast food" a good name.</TE>
<TE>   Parking: A digital readout at the garage entrance shows how many
spaces are available on each level. Do the folks on the Nobel
committee know about this?</TE>
<TE>   Worth trying? Valhalla for families and a good alternative to the
Beverly Center.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks Galleria</TE>
<TE>   The Experience: Sleek and stylish. Not the "omigawd!" Galleria of
yore.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the Gap: Dude, this place could so use a Gap. Tower Records
and a jewelry store do not a mall make.</TE>
<TE>   Sustenance: Since you can't shop till you drop, might as well
splurge on calories. The obvious choice: the Cheesecake Factory.</TE>
<TE>   Parking: Awesome, though beware the elevator doors. They're
programmed for speed.</TE>
<TE>   Worth trying? If there's nothing on cable. But leave your Vans at
home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paseo Colorado</TE>
<TE>   The Experience: Despite the brochure's claim that this is "the
place to get back your groove," ours stayed firmly in check. It's
just so very beige.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the Gap: Most of the big-name retailers--J. Crew, Barnes &amp;
Noble and Crate &amp; Barrel--are down the street in Old Town.</TE>
<TE>   Sustenance: Tacos two ways: budget at Rubio's or designer at
Border Grill.</TE>
<TE>   Parking: Prepay computer stations appeal to techies. We prefer the
human touch.</TE>
<TE>   Worth trying? Dinner or a massage at Amadeus Spa is your best bet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood &amp; Highland</TE>
<TE>   The Experience: Cacophonous and confusing. Tinseltown meets Vegas
with a dash of King Tut.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the Gap: Swarovski, Planet Funk, Build-A-Bear Workshop--the
shops here are all over the map, which by the way, you'll need to
find anything.</TE>
<TE>   Sustenance: Plenty to satisfy both lowbrow and highbrow appetites,
from Burger King to pizza king Wolfgang Puck's stylish Vert
Brasserie.</TE>
<TE>   Parking: Better since fees were lowered to $2 with validation in
May. But still dungeon-like. Worth trying?: If you're in the 'hood.
But bring your compass.</TE>

<HD>Way Up the Freeway, There's Something Cooking in Valencia</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chefs with fine-dining restaurants have it tough. Overhead is high,
labor costs are even higher, and all that foie gras, caviar, lobster
and truffles add up--not to mention the considerable costs of
dressing up the table in crystal, porcelain, silver and linens. With
the economy uncertain and reservations slow during the middle of the
week, what's an ambitious chef to do?</LD>
<LD>   Open another, more casual place, one where people can afford to
eat more often. It's nice if you can do it right next door, or at
least in the neighborhood (like Fred Eric with Vida and his 24/7
diner Fred 62), or even down the freeway (like Piero Selvaggio, who
commutes from Valentino in Santa Monica up the 405 to Posto in
Sherman Oaks).</LD>
<LD>   Josiah Citrin, however, has gone all the way to Valencia to open
Cafe Melisse, an upcountry spinoff of his Santa Monica
French-California restaurant Melisse. When I called for directions to
Cafe Melisse, the perky voice at the other end of the line explained
that the cafe is in the "town center." I immediately pictured the
quaint charms of Monrovia's old downtown and figured it would be a
cinch to find. Instead, Valencia Town Center turns out to be another
mall, this one with a "downtown" theme.</LD>
<TE>   Old-fashioned street lamps, empty wooden bus benches and streets
lined with familiar chain stores give it such a Las Vegas gloss that
I began to wonder if the sky is real or painted. And those shoppers,
are they bona fide or alien look-alikes?</TE>
<TE>   But where in all this sprawling mall is Cafe Melisse?</TE>
<TE>   "This must be it," our driver piped up. Where? "There--the one
with the 'sensitive' plants," he said, gleefully. Nonsense, I was
about to tell him, when we turned the corner. Good spotting: He was
right.</TE>
<TE>   Cafe Melisse is, in fact, no demure little cafe, but quite a big
operation, which seats up to 280 and includes a large bar and a
takeout section. Designed by Ralph Gentile and Sophie Harvey, it has
enough polished brass, etched glass and banquettes to easily play the
part of a grand Parisian cafe or brasserie.</TE>
<TE>   Couples snuggle in booths, savoring the moments before they have
to get back to the kids. Weeknights, friends socialize after work at
the bar or grab a quick supper before heading home. It's not often
that a name-brand chef will venture this far from L.A., and the
neighborhood is turning out to see what Citrin and chef de cuisine
Mario Perez are cooking.</TE>
<TE>   The cafe's menu delivers with a mix of classic bistro dishes and
current California favorites. Starters include oysters on the
half-shell, steamed mussels served with a fiery rouille and
house-cured salmon with warm potato salad.</TE>
<TE>   The kitchen sometimes tries too hard to dazzle the locals with
startling, fussy presentations. Chilled leeks vinaigrette, for
example, arrive as a vertical sculpture sprouting from a deep lake of
sauce.</TE>
<TE>   My Idaho trout is stuffed to bursting with spinach, tomato and
chunks of preserved lemon. The whole thing is wrapped in pancetta and
browned, making an ungainly package.</TE>
<TE>   The best thing I tried was a perfectly lovely roasted chicken
served in its juices with mashed potatoes. Those same fine spuds come
with braised-beef short ribs too.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, since this is a French cafe, steak frites is a given;
in this case it's a decent rib-eye with bearnaise sauce.</TE>
<TE>   There's even a menu pour le petit gourmet, i.e., kids. The little
ones can dine on pizza, spaghetti with meatballs or deep-fried
chicken tenders with French fries and corn on the cob.</TE>
<TE>   For dessert, no contest: Dip your spoon into the classic creme
brulee.</TE>
<TE>   Cafe Melisse, Valencia Town Center, Valencia; (661) 255-2233.
Dinner appetizers, $3 to $12; main courses, $13 to $23; children's
menu, $5 to $6. Open for dinner daily and for lunch Monday through
Friday.</TE>

<HD>'Gatsby' Revisits a Stormy Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Considerable local interest may well greet "Gatsby in Hollywood,"
receiving its world premiere at the MET Theatre. Author Joshua Rebell
traces the turbulent love affair of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sheilah
Graham against the studio politics and media influence surrounding
them, deliberately drawing allusions to current-day industry
practice.</LD>
<LD>   In 1937, Fitzgerald (the admirable Jeff Benninghofen) met
London-born gossip columnist Graham (A.K. Benninghofen, blending
Myrna Loy and Kate Mulgrew) at one of the parties thrown by Robert
Benchley (the fine Ben Davis) at his Garden of Allah bungalow.</LD>
<LD>   Fitzgerald was a shadow of the golden boy who rocketed to fame
with "This Side of Paradise" in 1920. Near-destitute from the
combined weight of wife Zelda's institutionalization, the Vassar
education of daughter Scottie (the effective Beth Kirkpatrick) and
clinical alcoholism, Fitzgerald--along with Benchley and fellow
transplanted Algonquin Round Table habitues--had become an indentured
servant to the studios. .</LD>
<TE>   Graham had her own demons, an orphaned ex-chorine hiding her
casting-couch rise beneath a veneer of soignee acerbity. Her
determination provided Fitzgerald with what stability his decline
possessed, even as his erudition spurred her higher education, a
"college of one" as she put it.</TE>
<TE>   Movie audiences may recall this pair from Gregory Peck and Deborah
Kerr's portrayals in "Beloved Infidel," the 1959 film adaptation of
Graham's heavily laundered memoirs. The actual dynamic, as Graham's
son Robert Westbrook recounted in his 1995 book "Intimate Lies," was
far more complex, and "Gatsby in Hollywood" ambitiously attempts to
do it justice.</TE>
<TE>   Dave P. Moore's direction is aptly cinematic, using the realistic
pieces that dot his and co-designer Gillian Morris' stylized Art Deco
canvas to near-seamless effect. Robert Hensley's period attire,
Brenda Vargas' sound and Brian Fletcher's lighting are all assets.</TE>
<TE>   So is the proficient ensemble, with Kara Keeley, Silas Weir
Mitchell and Deena Rubinson standouts in multiple roles. Davis
suggests George Brent more than Benchley, but he displays great
flair, as do Shirley Anderson's Dorothy Parker, Richard Gustafson's
Eddie Mayer, Andrew Friedman's Ogden Nash, Quinn Sullivan's Anita
Loos, and so on.</TE>
<TE>   The Benninghofens are married in real life, having met in this
show's workshop, and their affinity is evident. This is fortunate, as
his alcoholic desiccation relies more on technique than essential
quality, nor does her innate classiness quite convince of the lowbrow
concealed therein.</TE>
<TE>   This is scarcely their fault. Rebell has perhaps overdone the
research, overloading the narrative with expository dialogue more
detailed than any "Biography" episode. The excess dilutes the nuances
of the relationship's development in attempting to cover all bases,
creating a tonal imbalance, not to mention over-length.</TE>
<TE>   For example, while Graham's radio sequences with Ann Adams (Linda
Eve Miller) are giddily entertaining, they seem stylistically
detached from Fitzgerald's Odets-like Act 1 curtain rampage, or the
surreal tableau of the finale. This doesn't prevent "Gatsby" from
sustaining interest, but a reevaluation of priorities seems
advisable.</TE>
<TE>   "Gatsby in Hollywood," MET Theatre, 1089 N. Oxford Ave.,
Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Aug. 31.
$20. (323) 957-1152. Running time: 2 hours, 20 minutes.</TE>

<HD>At San Diego Zoo, Well-Wishers Bid a Fond Farewell to Hua
Mei</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL MILLER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Diego's No. 1 celebrity has been in the spotlight all year. A
surveillance camera broadcasts her on the Internet, 24 hours a day.
Her face lines billboards across California. A few feet away from her
residence, strangers stand in front of a video camera and wish her a
safe trip back to China.</LD>
<LD>   Probably the only one who hasn't been touched by the hype is the
star herself: Hua Mei, the 3-year-old panda born at the San Diego
Zoo.</LD>
<LD>   "Their responses to people are like so many other captive wild
animals," Don Lindburg, the zoo's giant panda team leader, says about
pandas. "After a while, they get pretty blase about it. She would be
aware if there was something really new, but body movements of
people--they see such a variety of them, nothing in particular
attracts their attention."</LD>
<TE>   So maybe as hundreds of visitors pass by her cage every day, Hua
Mei has no idea that they're waving to her. But that hasn't stopped
her fans--both kids and adults--from thinking of her as a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Hua Mei, who was born at the San Diego Zoo in 1999, will be
heading back to China sometime after Labor Day, when her contract
with the zoo expires. Until then, her handlers are seeing to it that
she receives a fond farewell.</TE>
<TE>   At the videotaping booth next to Hua Mei's cage, well-wishers from
all over stop to record their goodbyes. A pair of Londoner sisters
chime in unison, "We came all the way from England just to say
goodbye to Hua Mei!" Later, a Canadian woman and her 5-year-old son
offer their message in French. "The out-of-state ones are good," says
cameraman Adam Klarer. "They say things like, 'We'd take her over to
Mrs. Wilson's house and take her swimming.' "</TE>
<TE>   For an adult, saying goodbye to a panda may be bittersweet, but
kids may take it more seriously. According to Karen Anderson, a
psychologist at the Center for the Family in Santa Ana, young
children see animals less as critters than as peers. "I'm sure it was
an adult that came up with the notion that animals don't have souls
and people do," Anderson says. "Kids see animals as having feelings,
as having concerns, as having preferences like us. There's also
something about the shape and fur on a panda--it's a big, stuffed,
cuddly animal. So if you took a child and didn't give them any info
about the panda and said, 'Would you like to go in the cage with the
panda?', they wouldn't think about the fact that the panda could be
dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   When children reach about the age of 7, Anderson claims, they can
understand that not all species are friendly or humanlike. Before
then, however, the family cat may seem no different than another
brother or sister, and losing a pet can be especially difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Learning to say goodbye--even to a panda at the zoo--is an
integral part of any child's development. "It's hard to explain to
them," said Rod Jiu, a San Diego high school counselor who recorded a
farewell message with his two small kids. "I told them, maybe there's
a zoo in China that doesn't have a panda. They're taking it all
right, but they're sad."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Zoo, Park Boulevard, Balboa Park, San Diego. Giant
pandas can be viewed daily, 9 a.m.-7:30 p.m. Call hotline for viewing
updates: (888) MY PANDA. Zoo open daily, 7:30 a.m.-9 p.m. $19.50;
children 3-11, $11.75.</TE>

<KH>MY FAVORITE WEEKEND</KH>

<LD>* The food critic is host of "Feed Your Face" on KLSX-FM (97.1)
Saturdays and Sundays, 5-7 p.m. He is also an author of several
cookbooks and co-editor of the Zagat Survey.</LD>
<LD>   Absolute Favorite: The place I would go as much as possible if I
could afford to would be Matsuhisa on La Cienega in Beverly Hills.
Every time I go there, it's like I've never eaten before. They do
uni, which is sea urchin, wrapped in a shiso leaf and then tempuraed,
which is unique and seemingly impossible. Yet it comes out perfectly.
The shrimp in pepper sauce is amazing. Basically, I put myself in the
hands of the chef and say, "Surprise me," and they always do.</LD>
<LD>   Slippery Shrimp: Consistently, the Chinese place that I eat at the
most often is Yang Chow in Chinatown. I love the slippery shrimp,
which is a dish of battered, deep-fried shrimp in a sweet and peppery
sauce. I think everyone at Yang Chow gets it. I don't think there is
a table that doesn't have slippery shrimp. I also like the cold
noodles with sesame and chicken. It's a taste that's so unique that
you never tire of it.</LD>
<TE>   Amazing Apples: Just about every Sunday, I am at the Santa Monica
Farmers Market on Main Street. My daughter goes there for the pony
rides, and I go there for the lady who sells the amazing Fuji apples.
Actually, my all-time favorite stall, which is only around part of
the year, is at the Saturday morning Organic Farmers Market, the one
on Arizona in Santa Monica. There's a tomato guy named Ed who sells
heirloom tomatoes and they are amazing.</TE>
<TE>   Not Your Usual Waffle: My favorite old coffee shop diner is
probably Uncle Bill's Pancake House in Manhattan Beach, a great beach
dive. They serve a waffle with cheddar cheese and bacon baked into
the waffle. I've had that so many times over the years, I'm not even
sure what else they serve. Sometimes, one gets into ordering the same
dish over and over again, because you can't believe how good it is.</TE>
<TE>   The Middle of Nowhere: In the town of Olancha on the way up to
Bishop along the 395 Highway is a placed called the Ranch House,
where the food is basically corn bread and beans. It's wonderful. The
atmosphere is like a dive or a dump. But I love the place. It's a
ritual stop when I'm heading up to Mammoth.</TE>
<TE>   Homey American Grub: A recent discovery is a place up in La Canada
Flintridge called Dish that is as American as can be. It's like an
old pair of jeans, it's incredibly comfortable, the prices are low,
the service is good and the food is just perfect. They make a great
classic Cobb salad up there.</TE>
<TE>   A Town for Dining: When I want to have some fun, I say, "Let's
head to Monterey Park and see what we can find," and I always find
something amazing. I look for places that are busy. If there's a
crowd there, I figure the public knows what's going on.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The 1962 reunion of the once-popular Calendars, a Weavers-like folk
trio sundered by the anti-communist hysteria of the 1950s, is a tense
one. Fervent political and social activist Fred and his loyal wife,
Kathy, haven't seen estranged partner Curly since the pair's
blacklisting by the House Un-American Activities Committee.</LD>
<LD>   They've met in a New York City rehearsal room to prepare for a
three-song Calendars spot on Curly's national TV show--if they can
agree on the songs.</LD>
<LD>   The Fremont Centre Theatre is celebrating its fifth anniversary
season with a reprise of its 1997 inaugural hit, William Mesnik's
"Three Songs," and what could be a dusty, albeit tuneful, history
lesson has even deeper resonance with today's debate over national
security measures.</LD>
<TE>   Seamlessly staged by original director Michael Canavan, Mesnik's
drama is infused with passionate immediacy by actors Stephen
Rockwell, Jennifer Hetrick and Kim Story, who sing with stirring
conviction; Story and Rockwell also provide deft acoustic
accompaniment on guitar, banjo and harmonica. (Mesnik, who serves as
musical director, was the original Fred. He will reprise his role
this weekend and on Aug. 9 and 10.)</TE>
<TE>   Musical integrity is vital: It is the 10 folk songs--workers'
anthems, a bawdy ballad, hymns, laments, a breathtaking a cappella
rendition of "Shenandoah"--that reveal each sharply defined
character's past and present, and the love, passion, anger and regret
that connect and separate them.</TE>
<TE>   Uncompromising Fred (Rockwell) pushes for hard-hitting protest
songs. His stiff-necked zealousness, rooted in hard truths, defies
easy sympathy, even as Rockwell offers subtle glimpses of the softer,
less driven man Fred can't afford to be.</TE>
<TE>   Hetrick's poignant Kathy, still committed to the struggle but
weary of the hard life, is eager for the opportunity to recapture old
times, avoid conflict and reclaim the spotlight. Curly (Story), who
avoided the HUAC censure that kept his former partners scraping for
gigs by parlaying good ol' boy charm and a willingness to please into
big-money success, wants to keep things light and fun.</TE>
<TE>   As Curly draws Fred into a mournful miners' lament from their
early days together, however, it is Story, revealing the grief
beneath Curly's down-home affability, who reveals most achingly the
high price for choices made.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Spaulding's fine sound design and Carol Doehring's
expressive lighting enhance the production; Lois Tedrow's costumes
and Evan Bartoletti's full set, a much-used rehearsal room, add to
the authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   "Three Songs," Fremont Centre Theatre, 1000 Fremont Ave., South
Pasadena. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends Sept. 1.
$18. (626) 441-5977. Running time: 90 minutes.</TE>

<LD>Theater</LD>
<LD>   Noise--Alex Jones' slashing 1997 drama of the perils of economic
depression frequently suggests a latter-day "Look Back in Anger." It
begins with teenage factory worker Dan (Damaso Rodriquez) bringing
pregnant bride Becky (Vonessa Martin) to their new home, a shoddy
Black Country government housing flat (strikingly designed by Shawn
Lee). The grimy comic atmosphere soon darkens, as blaring techno
music from next door awakens the couple on their first night and
thereafter. An official appeal to the authorities brings their
neighbor, dashing slacker Matt (James C. Leary), in search of
rapprochement while Dan is at work. This leads to harrowing
developments symbolizing the lost innocence of post-Margaret Thatcher
England</LD>
<LD>   Director Sara Hennessy marshals her forces with assurance. Besides
Lee, the solid design roster features notable contributions from
Christie Wright's lighting and Eric Pargac's sound, and the cast is
estimable, managing the Birmingham dialects without sacrificing
intelligibility.</LD>
<TE>   Rodriguez and Martin, wisely avoiding teen mannerisms, have an
easy chemistry that renders their plight doubly poignant. Leary
conceals his imbalance beneath layers of roughhewn charisma,
recalling the young Terrence Mann. Jones' impressive architecture
occasionally tips the sociological hat, and the intermission is
questionable, halting the accelerating tension. These are quibbles,
though, as the nail-biting intensity of the disturbing climax
demonstrates the acute impact this haunting work achieves.</TE>

up on menus all over town.</LD>
<LD>   Campanile: Here you might find a cool, refreshing gazpacho made
with Early Girl tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, fennel and sweet
peppers, seasoned with olive oil, vinegar, cayenne and jalapeno. To

tomatoes in oregano vinaigrette and combines them with cucumbers, red
onion, feta, Kalamata olives and olive bread croutons. (Gazpacho, $6;
Greek salad, $15.) Campanile, 624 S. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles, (323)
938-1447.</LD>

summery salad made with heirloom tomatoes such as Zebra and
Brandywine. They're tossed with steamed asparagus in a tarragon
vinaigrette and topped with crabmeat ($9). Madame Matisse, 3536 W.
Sunset Blvd., Silver Lake, (323) 662-4862.</LD>
<TE>   Max: At this new Sherman Oaks restaurant, Andre Guerrero whips up
a beautiful heirloom tomato salad dressed with a fig balsamic
vinaigrette. It's accompanied by a dainty quesadilla made with
mozzarella, feta, Gorgonzola and a sprinkle of Parmesan. The soft,
sweet tomatoes are perfect with the crisp, gooey quesadilla ($8.95).

<TE>   Rockenwagner: Here's a colorful appetizer--green, purple, yellow
and red heirloom tomatoes set out in a circular pattern and drizzled

garnished with eggplant caviar flavored with yogurt, fresh dill,
garlic and shallots. The dish comes with fresh ciabatta bread studded
with olives ($11). Rockenwagner, 2435 Main St., Santa Monica, (310)
399-6504.</TE>
<TE>   Wild Artichoke: Fresh tomatoes feature in a Provencal tomato tart

<LD>   Unions Get Help on Age-Bias Claims</LD>
<LD>   Getting old in Hollywood has never been easy. The Screen Actors
Guild recently released statistics indicating that only 35% of the
roles in film and TV go to people over 40. And two years ago, a group
of 28 screenwriters filed a $200-million lawsuit accusing TV
networks, studios, production companies and talent agencies of a
"systemic pattern" of age discrimination.</LD>
<TE>   Now government is joining the battle. The California Commission on
Aging has teamed up with actors' unions to form the Industry
Coalition for Age Equity in the Media. The group is holding its first
news conference today.</TE>
<TE>   On hand will be state Sen. John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), who
has authored a bill on aging that refers to Hollywood's obsession
with youth. The legislation would require that the state "work with
the entertainment industry to change cultural attitudes toward older
adults and make the work force more responsive."</TE>
<TE>   'Millionaire' Winner Charged With Cheating</TE>
<TE>   A British army officer who won $1.56 million on the TV quiz show
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" in Great Britain last fall was
charged Wednesday with deception and conspiracy. Scotland Yard
detectives had been investigating claims that he cheated on the
program.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Charles Ingram denied wrongdoing and was released on bail
until a court hearing on Aug. 7. His wife, Diana, and Tecwen
Whittock, a 52-year-old South Wales college teacher, also face
charges of obtaining a reward by deception and conspiring to do so.
They were taken into custody in November and released on bail. An
unidentified man was arrested in April.</TE>
<TE>   Ingram won the show's top prize in September but the check was
withheld because of suspicions of cheating, and the episode never
aired. According to news reports, investigators believed that someone
in the audience relayed correct answers to questions by coughing.</TE>
<TE>   Fox News Edges Out CNN and MSNBC</TE>
<TE>   Fox News Channel won the cable news ratings race in July for the
seventh-consecutive month, with an average of 640,000 viewers--more
than double its audience from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   CNN was second with 537,000 viewers on average, a jump of 64%.
MSNBC, which has overhauled much of its schedule this month, had
277,000 viewers on average, up 21%.</TE>
<TE>   Although still a distant third, MSNBC did make gains
percentage-wise in prime time, up 42% thanks to the addition of Phil
Donahue and Chris Matthews. CNN, which recently added Connie Chung to
its evening lineup, was up 39% in prime-time viewers compared with a
year ago. Fox's evening numbers were up 69%.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Diana Ross has canceled all performances in her coming California
tour, including dates at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts
on Aug. 9 and Aug 10. Her agent said that the singer's health makes
it impossible for her to fulfill her commitment, though no details
were provided. Refunds: (800) 300-4345.... Comedian Rosie O'Donnell
is working on a musical version of her bestseller "Find Me," a
two-woman play in which she'd star, according to USA Today.... Film
composer David Raksin, whose credits include the scores for "Laura,"
"The Bad and the Beautiful" and "Will Penny," turns 90 on Sunday, so
KCRW-FM (89.9) plans to broadcast an hourlong documentary on his
career at 3 p.m. today.</TE>

<LD>* Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band, "The Rising," Columbia.
Springsteen sees this album as a return to the "center of the
dialogue" he has had through the years with his fans in such landmark
albums as "Born to Run," "Darkness on the Edge of Town," "The River"
and "Born in the U.S.A." The moods range from the somberness of
"Nothing Man" and "Empty Sky" to the party-time zest of "Mary's
Place." Inspired by the events of 9/11, "Into the Fire," and the
album's title track illuminate the need to live up to one's
responsibilities--even in the face of life-threatening danger.</LD>

<LD>* New this week: A souped-up romantic tale of longing for contact
beyond the grave, "Dragonfly" stars Kevin Costner as Joe Darrow, the
head of a Chicago emergency room who loses his pregnant wife in a
landslide. It would be churlish to begrudge anyone's receiving
whatever consolation can be found in the film, yet it is impossible
to find the film to be anything but appalling, shamelessly
manipulative, contrived and lacking in conviction. There's nothing
wrong in Costner's performance but, fevered to the point of
foolishness, "Dragonfly" is Hollywood hokum.</LD>

<DH>On the verge of ending a tour, the Radar Brothers and their
L.A.-rooted, mind-expanding folk rock sound are making noticeable
musical contact</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like the country-rock freakouts of Beachwood Sparks or the sprawling
psychedelia of the defunct Grant Lee Buffalo, the Radar Brothers'
moody, vivid music is deeply rooted in hidden parts of Los Angeles
and its surroundings. Some have labeled the band's austere,
impressionistic folk-rock depressing, but leader Jim Putnam doesn't
see it that way.</LD>
<LD>   "To me, ballads are uplifting," says the
singer-songwriter-guitarist, who will join bandmates Senon Williams
(bass) and Steve Goodfriend (drums) tonight at the Knitting Factory
to wrap up a U.S. tour supporting their third album, "And the
Surrounding Mountains."</LD>
<LD>   How's it been going?</LD>
<TE>   "We've had some trouble with our vehicle," he says. Neatly
mirroring his music, Putnam's deliberate, almost languid way of
speaking belies a deeper intensity as he nonchalantly describes the
kind of incident that's frighteningly routine for bands on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "We were driving from Lawrence, Kan., to Denver, and the hood
flipped up," he says. "I was driving, doing 75 miles an hour. It
totaled the windshield."</TE>
<TE>   He emits a low, wry chuckle. "The cruise control was on, so I had
to think, 'OK, turn off the cruise control. OK, now, look over to the
side and watch the lines [and pull over].' It was pretty scary."</TE>
<TE>   Putnam seemingly handled the ordeal with the same methodical calm
that informs his music. He founded the Radar Brothers eight years ago
after stints as a guitarist in Brad Laner's melodic noise-rock group
Medicine and its tripped-out spinoff Maids of Gravity.</TE>
<TE>   His current sound is more subtly mind-expanding, drawing from Neil
Young as much as Pink Floyd, with vibrating guitars, naked vocals and
sometimes surreal lyrics blurring vivid sonic brush strokes across
the songs' broad melodic canvases.</TE>
<TE>   The band's rootsy, dreamlike music earned critical acclaim from
its earliest recordings--a self-released, self-titled 1995 EP and a
1996 album, also self-titled, on Restless Records. Spin magazine
called 1999's "The Singing Hatchet" "a perfect desert island disc for
a vacation with God," and the group was nominated this year for an
L.A. Weekly Music Award. Like so many unconventional local acts, the
Brothers also have devoted followings in Europe and the U.K., where
they recently finished touring with the Breeders.</TE>
<TE>   As he did for "The Singing Hatchet," Putnam produced "Surrounding
Mountains" in his home studio in Atwater Village. His organic
approach to recording tends to humanize the music, which might feel
more remote with a slicker treatment.</TE>
<TE>   He's been around knobs and meters since childhood, as his
producer-engineer father, Bill Putnam Sr., recorded such luminaries
as Frank Sinatra and Count Basie, and founded the Hollywood studio
that is now Ocean Way Recordings. Indeed, Putnam and his brother
recently revived their dad's business making sound recording
equipment under the name Universal Audio.</TE>
<TE>   Living in Los Angeles has also shaped his music, Putnam says. "You
do a lot of driving. You're just kind of watching things go by. I
think of a lot of stuff while driving, and watching TV, too, which is
kind of funny."</TE>
<TE>   Tunes such as "Still Evil" and "Morning Song" do feel partly like
overheard conversations or snapshots of moments.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually [I'm inspired by] funny things I see people do, or funny
situations," Putnam says. "Like, I'll drive by someone's house and
see the family in the front, barbecuing or something. Then I'll start
thinking, 'Well, what's their world like?' But it all kind of
connects with me personally, too."</TE>
<TE>   His music has a passive element that telegraphs this tendency to
spy on everyday life, but Putnam also finds it easier to write when
he's distracted in familiar surroundings. Like at the mall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's where a lot of humans congregate," he says, so there are
many moments to be mined. "Also, it's just sort of the tragic world
of the desperate consumer or something. But also, I grew up in
shopping malls, so maybe it's like a weird nostalgic thing. It's
depressing, but it's also comforting."</TE>
<TE>   So perhaps there's a trace of melancholy in his music, after all.
Putnam just doesn't want that to be the only thing people hear.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zinc Is Good for You: Since Heidi Gresko took over as executive chef
at Le Petit Zinc in May, the bistro items have been fading into the
background, and her numerous light, wholesome California/French
specials have become the items to order. "I try to make everything as
up to the minute as I can," she says. "Did you know that a cut orange
loses half its vitamin C if you let it sit for half an hour?" On the
basis of her principle that "food can be healthy but still exciting,"
Le Petit Zinc's management says business is up 25%. "People come in
asking for the specials they had the day before," Gresko says. The
specials? Things like blackened wild king salmon served on a bed of
Bibb lettuce, shaved fennel and red onion, all in a yogurt sauce
flavored with cilantro, cumin and lime juice. Or a tart filled with
figs caramelized in balsamic vinegar and blended with a little creme
fraiche. Though Gresko trained in France and has been a sous-chef
under two James Beard award-winning Southwestern chefs (Vincent
Guerithalt and Christopher Gross), this is her first executive-chef
gig.</LD>
<LD>   * Le Petit Zinc, 11829 Wilshire Blvd., West L.A., (310) 575-3777.</LD>
<TE>   Mako Retools: Mako Tanaka, whose resume includes being the
longtime executive chef at Chinois on Main, has revamped the whole
style of his restaurant, Mako. Now you order from a menu that you
hold onto throughout the meal, adding choices from among over 40
small and family-style items until you feel completely sated. The
dishes come to the table with additional plates so you can assemble
an assortment of flavors and textures. How about a jumbo soft-shell
crab, tuna tataki salad and some half-moon lobster with angel hair
pasta in coconut saffron curry sauce?</TE>
<TE>   * Mako, 225 S. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills, (310) 288-8338.</TE>
<TE>   Silvio's Back: Perhaps you remember Silvio de Mori from Mimosa
restaurant in the '90s (he's since left), or maybe you remember him
from one of his earlier restaurants: Pane Caldo, Silvio's or Tutto
Bene. He's a restaurateur who keeps reinventing himself, and now he's
back with a Beverly Hills place with his own name, de Mori. With the
help of his mother (who is still working in the restaurant's kitchen
at 76), he's fashioned a menu that features dishes from the Veneto
region of Italy, where he grew up. Its food is heavily influenced by
its Austrian neighbors. "Simple, basic," he says of his cuisine. "I'm
not trying to compete with sophisticated cuisine, it's not me."
Though Mama de Mori has no formal training, she draws from years of
experience and, of course, her lengthy repertoire of old and new
family recipes. The only hitch may be de Mori's location in the
doomed Rodeo Collection, where no restaurant has survived long.
Silvio doesn't seem fazed, though: "I love the space. The patio is
fantastic; it reminds me of places I had in Italy, hidden away from
the hustle of the city. It's a bit of what I call the civilized
Italian life."</TE>
<TE>   * de Mori, 421 N. Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills, (310) 274-1500.</TE>
<TE>   A New Kind of Supper Club: There was a time when the supper club
was a popular place for an evening out, but it went the way of
fedoras and evening gloves. Now David Dickerson, Kimberly Hermann and
Errol Roussel have decided to resurrect the notion with Cinespace, a
"digital supper club-lounge" in Hollywood. There you will dine on
California comfort food by chef Monica May (formerly executive chef
at north) while watching new independent movies. The large space has
a sleek, futuristic interior that includes a bar, dining room and
lounge, all equipped with thin plasma screens for viewing. There's
also a roomy patio overlooking the lights of Hollywood Boulevard. The
programming includes shorts, classics, animation and music videos.
Instead of nibbling on popcorn, you watch a movie eating a duck, wild
mushroom, caramelized onion, arugula and Gorgonzola grilled pizza.
Cinespace opens in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Small Bites: Chef Tim Goodell has just opened Whist restaurant in
Santa Monica's snazzy new Viceroy hotel. Reservations: (310)
451-8711....Mimosa is now offering a "family table" dinner for five
to 16. If you want, you can bring your own wine (no corkage fee);
just inform the restaurant and it will plan a menu around your wine
selection. Call (323) 655-8895....Hans Rockenwagner's latest
restaurant, Ballona Fish Market, has opened at 13455 Maxella Ave.,
Marina del Rey.</TE>

<LD>The American Cinematheque's "Andy Warhol Does Hollywood," presented
in cooperation with the Museum of Contemporary Art, continues through
Aug. 28 at the Egyptian with screenings every night through Sunday,
some teamed with vintage Hollywood movies starring the actresses
being emulated, parodied or celebrated--or all three--in the
corresponding Warhol film.</LD>
<LD>   In the prophetic, split-screen "Lupe" (1965), which screens Friday
at 7 p.m., the ill-fated Edie Sedgwick is simultaneously seen lolling
about an elegant apartment in the Dakota, applying makeup and
chatting with Warhol stalwart Billy Name, and in the other scene,
beautifully gowned but alone and drinking away her dinner in a formal
dining room. Both episodes culminate in conjoining images in which
Sedgwick is seen as dead in a bathroom in emulation of the real-life
fate of movie star Lupe Velez. The waif-like Sedgwick couldn't have
been more different from the "Mexican Spitfire," yet she too was to
die at an early age. It will be followed by the 1939 Velez movie "The
Girl From Mexico." Sedgwick is also featured in "Poor Little Rich
Girl" (1965), screening Friday at 9:30 p.m. and followed by the 1936
Shirley Temple film of the same name.</LD>
<TE>   Some of Warhol's best-known features will screen over the next
week, among them "Lonesome Cowboys" (1967-68), Saturday at 8:45 p.m.
The outrageous parody of the western is frequently hilarious--and
often tedious. It has the usual Warhol Factory ingredients: sex,
nudity and four-letter words. Who but Warhol would portray a cowboy
as a Times Square hustler, a sheriff as a transvestite and recommend
ballet as a good exercise for sharpshooting?</TE>
<TE>   With "Bike Boy" (1967-68), screening Sunday at 7 p.m., Warhol
moved beyond camp to tragedy as he follows a footloose, hunky biker
(Joe Spencer), presented as a sort of Rousseau-esque last natural
man, in a series of encounters with typically decadent Warhol types.
"Kitchen" (1965), screening Sunday at 4 p.m., is another of Warhol's
early collaborations with Theater of the Ridiculous playwright Ronal
Tavel, a 66-minute sendup of kitchen-sink realism. Sedgwick plays a
beautiful but self-absorbed young wife who's brought her makeup kit
into the kitchen, where she wrangles with her anguished husband
(Roger Trudeau) while working on her face. The plot thickens with the
arrival of unannounced visitors and, throughout, a relentless set
photographer snaps away, adding to the film's quality of humorous
travesty.</TE>
<TE>   Screening Wednesday at 7 p.m. will be "The Chelsea Girls" (1965),
which marked the beginning of Warhol's collaboration with Paul
Morrissey, soon to become the true auteur of the Warhol pictures.
"The Chelsea Girls" is surely Warhol's most significant film, a
darkly compelling three-hour, 20-minute, guided tour through Warhol's
Inferno, in which an array of decadent types, purported residents of
Manhattan's landmark hotel, dominate a split screen with monstrously
self-indulgent, indolent misery. The film's split-screen technique,
which was Morrissey's idea, helps create a demented world of its own.
(323) 466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LACMA's "William Wyler and the Tradition of Excellence" continues
Friday at 7:30 p.m. with the screening of "Dodsworth" (1936), Wyler's
handsome, intelligent film of the Sinclair Lewis novel, which surely
has a different impact today than was intended when it was released
in 1936. Walter Huston, re-creating his stage role, plays a
middle-aged Midwestern car manufacturer who retires so he and his
wife (Ruth Chatterton) can take off for an extended vacation in
Europe. Although determinedly unpretentious, Dodsworth is no hick,
but a knowledgeable appreciator of the European culture he's eager to
drink in.</TE>
<TE>   For his substantially younger wife, however, travel represents a
new freedom that leaves her giddy enough to be vulnerable to the
overtures of such debonair types as David Niven and Paul Lukas. Wyler
and writer Sidney Howard, drawing from the novel and Howard's own
play, convey that the wife dutifully endured a suffocating small-town
social life while her husband was meeting the challenge of becoming a
captain of industry. They have also endowed her with considerable
self-awareness.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the film's conclusion, praised for remaining true to
its source, ironically now seems false, a betrayal of the film's most
likely unconscious feminist spirit. What's more, Chatterton is such a
brilliant actress and has made the wife so human in her
frailties--indeed, a 20th century Madame Bovary--that one feels she
is unjustly punished for a foolish display of bravado that masks an
understandably wounded pride.(323) 857-6010.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By coincidence an earlier and far rarer Wyler film, "The Love
Trap" (1929) screens Sunday at 7 p.m. In Melnitz Hall's James Bridges
Theater as part of the UCLA's 11th annual Festival of Preservation.
It's been said that Wyler, who swiftly became one of Hollywood's most
prestigious directors with the advent of sound, would rather his
earliest films, mainly westerns and made in the late silent era,
remain forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   Yet "The Love Trap," adapted by various hands from a story by
Edward J. Montaigne, is a Roaring '20s romantic comedy that's lost
none of its fizz. Since it is like lots of other movies of the
era--poor girl lands rich guy and trouble ensues--that it holds up so
well surely owes much to the already evident painstaking
craftsmanship that was Wyler's hallmark. (That it has a racy pre-code
sensibility helps a lot.)</TE>
<TE>   "The Love Trap" is also fascinating as a part-talkie, one of the
group of films that were made during the chaotic transition from
silents to talkies. So eager were the studios to make the changeover
that they hyped up some of their silent productions already under way
with sound sequences.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, from frame one Wyler directs his actors conversing
in a natural manner even if we cannot hear them and have to rely on
intertitles until the film takes a dramatic turn near its halfway
point and becomes a talkie.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the actors' switch from mime to speech is far
smoother than in most part-talkies. ("The Love Trap" has a
sound-effects track throughout, and its first half is sustained by a
jazzy score.)</TE>
<TE>   Laura La Plante, Universal's lovely and versatile blond star in
the late silent era, plays Evelyn, a small-town Illinois girl so
klutzy that she's fired from a Broadway chorus line only to arrive at
her walk-up apartment to find all her possessions on the sidewalk due
to overdue rent. Then it starts raining, but when a girl is as pretty
as Evelyn, it's only fitting that within 10 minutes a handsome young
man, Peter (Neil Hamilton), stops by in a cab to rescue her. Almost
the next thing we know is that Evelyn and Peter are blissfully happy
newlyweds ensconced in a swanky duplex apartment.</TE>
<TE>   The hitch comes with the return from Europe of Peter's snooty
mother (Clarisa Selwynne) and sister (Rita La Roy), who make it
crystal clear that the sweet, adoring Evelyn is not good enough for a
filthy-rich aristocrat like Peter. Evelyn is devastated, of course,
but what makes "The Love Trap" such fun is how she handles this
insult, which in similar instances is usually treated as an occasion
for a lot of heart-tugging on behalf of the heroine.</TE>
<TE>   But "The Love Trap," which in some aspects foreshadows '30s
screwball comedy, is too smart and sophisticated for that.</TE>
<TE>   La Plante proves to be a sharp, resourceful comedian in one of her
most delightful performances, and Hamilton is an ideal leading man
for her. There's lots of late Jazz Age atmosphere, and some knockout
Art Deco decor.</TE>
<TE>   The second feature is "Sweethearts and Wives" (1930), a comic
murder mystery starring Leila Hyams and Clive Brooks and directed by
Clarence Badger. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>

<HD>Last 3 El Portal Subscription Shows Canceled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The final three shows in the main-stage subscription series at El
Portal Theatre in North Hollywood have been canceled by producer Stan
Haberman, leaving 2,030 subscribers in the lurch.</LD>
<LD>   Haberman said he doesn't have the funds to continue the series and
does not plan to offer refunds, which would amount to about $80 to
$90 per subscriber, because the tickets originally were purchased for
a series that would have been produced by the defunct El Portal
Center for the Arts.</LD>
<LD>   Haberman, who was on the board of the nonprofit El Portal Center,
offered to produce the shows with his own Shadow Box Productions when
the El Portal organization became insolvent earlier this year. He
produced the first announced show, "70, Girls, 70," in May but lost
more than $100,000 on it, he said. The next scheduled show was
"Vamps" in September, with "Nunsense" and "Ain't Misbehavin'" also
slated.</LD>
<TE>   El Portal Theatre officials are beginning efforts to arrange for
subscribers to receive credit for the canceled shows at other area
theaters with subscription seasons, but no agreements are set.</TE>
<TE>   The cancellation does not affect other shows scheduled for the El
Portal complex.</TE>

<HD>Nicky Katt, a Go-To Guy With a Can-Do Attitude</HD>
<DH>In 'Full Frontal,' the actor even gives Hitler a comic
twist, his latest scene-stealing part.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Likening himself to a chameleon, actor Nicky Katt says he tries to be
so different in every role--the displaced detective in "Insomnia,"
the cutthroat stockbroker in "Boiler Room," the insensitive boyfriend
in "One True Thing"--that people who know him and see his films
sometimes don't even realize he was in them.</LD>
<LD>   "That happened with 'A Time to Kill,' " Katt says. "I had a very
small part (as a racist rapist). People said, 'I'm sorry you got cut
out of the film.' I said, 'No, I was the fat guy!' "</LD>
<LD>   That kind of anonymity could change with Steven Soderbergh's film
within a film, "Full Frontal." Katt, 32, steals scenes with a
particularly knowing and funny performance of an egomaniacal actor
playing Hitler as an ordinary guy with commitment issues in an
experimental Los Angeles stage play, "The Sound and the Fuhrer."
Katt's character bullies his director (Enrico Colantoni), doesn't
bother learning his lines and teaches Pilates on the side.</LD>
<TE>   For Soderbergh, the backstage antics between the self-absorbed
actor and director represented "a comic exploration of a director's
worst nightmare.... I knew I wanted Nicky for this," says Soderbergh,
who had directed him as a hit man in "The Limey." "He's absolutely
fearless. No idea is too outrageous. He'll try anything."</TE>
<TE>   Katt has built a career on his dark good looks and what Soderbergh
calls "dangerously out of control" but rigorously prepared
performances. For "Full Frontal," a low-budget film with a bushel of
big-name actors (Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Catherine Keener, Blair
Underwood, David Hyde Pierce, David Duchovny), Katt filled a notebook
with his ideas about his character and improvised much of the part,
which was basically shot in one day.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he understood that there's no way to treat Hitler as
anything but an abstraction. So the humor is in attempting to
humanize him, because it's impossible," Soderbergh says.</TE>
<TE>   Katt says he started fleshing out his character with the costume.
Soderbergh required the ensemble cast to be responsible for their own
makeup and wardrobe. "Once I got the sense we could do whatever we
wanted, I started to go off on this tangent," Katt says. He scrapped
original plans to imitate surrealist painter Salvador Dali, who once
wore scuba gear to an art exhibit opening. Eventually, he pulled
himself back and decided to order Hitler uniform accessories with
help from New Orleans historical costumer Tim Pickles. He had them
applied to a tuxedo.</TE>
<TE>   "I also went to a martial arts supply place and got a ninja
outfit. I took some of the extra armbands and Hitler SS things and
put it all over this outfit. I was a 'Ninjazi,' " he says. The
costume survives in some scenes on the upcoming DVD when Hitler works
out at the gym. In other scenes, Katt supplied his own dog, a pit
bull/boxer named Tuddy, who wore a studded collar. And in a scene
where his character tap dances at a birthday party, he contributed
his own dance steps, recalled from childhood tap and jazz classes.</TE>
<TE>   As an actor, Katt has found steady work in films, won prizes on
the festival circuit and now co-stars as a teacher in the TV drama
"Boston Public." Still, he says it was liberating to step back from
his profession and channel all the frustration, desperation and
inspiration he finds in Hollywood into his role as an actor.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much desperation in the air, in Los Angeles
especially. You don't notice it in New York as much," he believes.
"Everybody plays it a little cooler there and people have a lot more
interaction with each other. I think Stanley Kubrick called the vibe
in L.A. a 'low-level malevolence.' It eats away at you at some
point."</TE>
<TE>   Even if they're not desperate, most actors are frustrated, he
says. "There's that quote from Agnes DeMille about how a true artist
never feels any sense of satisfaction. The closest they get is some
sort of divine dissatisfaction." Like his "Full Frontal" character,
Katt salts his observations about the acting life with quotes he's
picked up from theatrical personalities, Kubrick and DeMille, and
with references to actors Klaus Kinski and Jerry Lewis and directors
Richard Lester and Robert Bresson.</TE>
<TE>   "You should never name-drop," he jokes. "De Niro told me that."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting outside on a hot morning, Katt smokes on the dusty,
peeling back porch of his friend Monte Hellman's home. In ill-fitting
rolled-up jeans, T-shirt and cap, he looks more Bakersfield than
Hollywood. A tattoo on his neck recalls one of his idols, Roy Rogers;
another shows two hands around a wrench, symbolizing, he says, the
Zen-like nature of motorcycle maintenance, his only work experience
besides acting. Unmarried, he maintains one home nearby in the
Hollywood Hills and another in Austin, Texas, where he hosts local
premieres of his movies, including events for the Austin Film
Society. This week, he and Colantoni will present "Full Frontal."</TE>
<TE>   He says he's heard rumblings that some people find "Full Frontal"
confusing, that they're upset because to them, Soderbergh's latest
effort seems rushed and jumbled.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what? It's a $2-million comedy," Katt says. "I don't
know what anybody's problem is. If anybody has the right to
experiment with film, it's him, and I think we're really in big
trouble if people like that aren't allowed to do what they want to
do. If people get misled and think it's "Notting Hill" or something,
it's their problem."</TE>
<TE>   Katt admires actors who don't wait for the phone to ring. He says
he hopes to harness the momentum his career is generating to produce
some projects of his own. He's acquired rights to three books and
also wants to make a movie with Hellman, an aging but little-known
director ("Two Lane Blacktop").</TE>
<TE>   He's aware that he doesn't carry much clout around town.
"Sometimes I think if I did more sit-ups and went to the tanning
salon, I could have a lot more power than I do now. At the end of the
day, you do what your gut tells you to do."</TE>

<DH>The irrepressible James Galway brings a rare modern
concerto to the Bowl, but you wouldn't have known it was written
specifically for him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To get a new or newish concerto performed at the Hollywood Bowl
takes, at the very least, a determined superstar soloist. Yo-Yo Ma
managed it a few years ago with John Tavener's "The Protecting Veil"
but he can pretty much write his own ticket, the work happened to be
hugely popular with the New Age crowd, and the cellist had a new
recording of it coming out on Sony. Gidon Kremer, on the other hand,
told me that in the early '90s he got nowhere when he wanted to
perform Philip Glass' Violin Concerto at the Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Now James Galway has entered the rarefied company of the
successful new-concerto givers and adds a statistic of his own. Not
only did he perform William Bolcom's Lyric Concerto for Flute and
Orchestra on Tuesday night in the amphitheater, but he will also
repeat it tonight. The Los Angeles Philharmonic and its associate
conductor, Miguel Harth-Bedoya, are his willing accomplices.</LD>
<TE>   And accomplices they surely must be. Bolcom's concerto, written in
1993 for Galway, is a canny score--a sound portrait of a big
personality, a carousing vehicle for a cheeky virtuoso. A frisky
first movement, "Leprechaun," mixes flamboyant skittishness with
beery sentiment. A merry-go-round waltz in the second movement
unravels as if by an American Ravel. In the slow, third movement, an
elaborate solo line with the stuttering complexity of a cool
improvisation surrounds the shimmering ice of high strings. The last
movement, jazz-tinged, hints at bebop but is ultimately a sweet
seduction with swing.</TE>
<TE>   It all seems pure Galway (there is even a wink or two at the Irish
shtick he so loves). But maybe it isn't. The performance was
surprisingly understated. With his head buried in the score, Galway
seemed mainly intent on mastering the technical challenges. Certainly
the music is difficult, and his playing was not unimpressive. But
there was little sense that the soloist had made this music his own,
let alone that he was the concerto's subject. The last movement was
particularly stiff. What swing and joy there were came from
Harth-Bedoya and the Philharmonic players, who actually seemed to
enjoy themselves more than Galway.</TE>
<TE>   With four encores, Galway was, once more, Galway, ever the
entertainer offering his bad jokes, recklessly fast Bach and "Flight
of the Bumble Bee," and "Danny Boy," sopping with tremulous
sentimentality. In the end, Galway's is a poor message--that new
music, even new music as friendly as your favorite comedian, is work;
the fun comes later.</TE>
<TE>   Bolcom's concerto was preceded by an ardent performance of Richard
Strauss' "Don Juan" (though "Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks" might
have been a more apt preface for the trickster concerto). After
intermission, Harth-Bedoya returned to Dvorak's Seventh Symphony,
which he had conducted with the Philharmonic during its winter season
at the Music Center. This time, there was not as much of the curious
but beguiling bloom Harth-Bedoya earlier gave to this otherwise
stormy symphony, but then the current state of overstated Bowl
amplification makes such bloom unlikely. Even so, the lilt and
lyricism were, if anything, more engaging.</TE>
<TE>   Given the limited rehearsal time at the Bowl, repeating some works
from the winter season makes sense. But if the Philharmonic really
wants to turn on its audiences, why not repeat Harth-Bedoya's
smashing performance of Osvaldo Golijov's irresistibly tango-drunk
"Last Round"?</TE>
<TE>   The program by James Galway and the Los Angeles Philharmonic will
repeats tonight at 8, Hollywood Bowl, 2301 N. Highland Ave.,
Hollywood. $1-$76. (323) 850-2000.</TE>

<LD>Just in time to break up the monotony of rerun season comes ... a
show in which an ensemble troupe reenacts old sitcoms.</LD>
<LD>   "The Rerun Show," premiering tonight at 9:30 on NBC before
shifting to Tuesdays, plays like a pair of tiring "Saturday Night
Live" sketches. Each episode condenses two "word-for-word" scripts
from 1960s, '70s or '80s sitcoms into 11-minute skits, using a
talented newcomer cast that earns a few chuckles but can't overcome
the strained premise.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's episode brings "The Partridge Family" and "Diff'rent
Strokes" back to life. Guest Danny Bonaduce reprises his Danny
Partridge role, crafting a jealousy scheme to woo a transfer student.
In the "Diff'rent Strokes" skit, Arnold (Candy Ford walking on her
knees, in the Gary Coleman role) and Willis (Don Reed in the Todd
Bridges part) vie for the heart of a schoolmate (Daniele Gaither).</LD>
<TE>   "The Rerun Show" tries for easy laughs with fat jokes, height
jokes, enough innuendo for its TV-14 rating, and winking nods to the
downfalls of former child stars such as Bridges (mug shots adorn the
"Diff'rent Strokes" house, for example). What it lacks is the ease
and simple incongruity of that bit on "The Late Show With David
Letterman" in which two of Dave's gruff, stone-faced stagehands read
snippets of "Oprah" transcripts.</TE>
<TE>   Different strokes, indeed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The special two-disc edition of the 1994 action-thriller "Speed"
(Fox, $27) is a mixed bag. The problem is that the second disc isn't
very exciting. Several mini-documentaries on the making of the Keanu
Reeves-Sandra Bullock hit are OK but nothing special. A multi-angle
look at several of the film's hair-raising stunts is the best feature
on the second disc, but the cast interviews and extended scenes are a
snooze.</LD>
<LD>   It's best concentrate on the first disc, which includes a nice
wide-screen edition of the film and interesting commentary from Jan
DeBont, who discusses how he made the leap from cinematographer to
director and how he got Reeves to star in his first action flick.
Writer Graham Yost and producer Mark Gordon supply a second and
equally entertaining commentary track. The two discuss the various
changes that were made in the script before it went before the camera
and just how many directors turned down the film before DeBont came
on board.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Based on the popular video game, "Resident Evil" (Columbia
TriStar, $28) is a confusing blood fest starring Milla Jovovich and
Michelle Rodriguez as members of an elite group of commandos trapped
in an underground complex run by an evil organization and surrounded
by a group of hungry zombies who look like they stepped out of the
old Michael Jackson "Thriller" video. The DVD includes the
wide-screen version of the film, a music video by Slipknot, three
featurettes on the making of the film and inane commentary from
director Paul Anderson, Jovovich and Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Arnold Schwarzenegger thriller "Collateral Damage" was one of
several feature films delayed last fall because of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. It eventually opened in the spring and makes its
DVD debut this week (Warner, $27). Though nearly 11 months have
passed since the tragic destruction of the World Trade Center,
"Collateral Damage" is still difficult to watch.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger plays a Los Angeles fireman who witnesses his wife
and young son being blown to bits in a terrorist bombing. When he
doesn't get satisfaction from the FBI regarding the case, he smuggles
himself into Colombia to track down the guerrilla terrorist who
killed his family.</TE>
<TE>   "Collateral Damage" is slightly better than Schwarzenegger's other
recent films, primarily due to the fast-paced direction of Andrew
Davis (of "The Fugitive" fame). The digital edition features
additional scenes, an HBO behind-the-scenes documentary and another
documentary in which Schwarzenegger and Davis discuss the film in
light of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After creating the enormously popular marionette sci-fi series
"Thunderbirds" and "Captain Scarlet," British producer Gerry Anderson
came up with "UFO," his first series starring real actors. Broadcast
in the United Kingdom in 1970 and in the U.S. two years later, this
camp delight focuses on a secret military branch called S.H.A.D.O.
(Supreme Headquarters Alien Defense Organization) that was created to
protect the Earth from alien invaders. The organization is located
under a film studio in London.</TE>
<TE>   A&amp;E is releasing the first 13 episodes of this kitschy classic on
a four-disc DVD set ($80). Included are outtakes, production stills,
talent files and commentary from Anderson on the premiere episode. He
discusses the genesis of the series, the cast, the then-cutting-edge
special effects and the psychedelic costume and production design.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese anime feature "Escaflowne" is based on the popular TV
series that aired here and in Japan. The romantic fantasy chronicles
the adventures of an ordinary high school student who has no meaning
in her life and suddenly finds herself in a secret world. Those not
familiar with the TV series will find the movie more than a bit
confusing. The three-disc DVD (Bandai Entertainment, $55) includes
the Japanese-language and English-dubbed versions, a production art
gallery, staff and cast interviews with English subtitles, a poster
gallery, isolated music score and Anime Expose premiere footage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Emmy-nominated ABC miniseries "Dinotopia" lumbers into DVD
(Artisan, $20) in a two-disc special edition. Based on the
best-selling books by James Gurney, "Dinotopia," which also is a new
fall series on ABC, tells the story of a lost continent where
dinosaurs and humans live together in harmony. The digital edition of
the six-hour miniseries features a standard making-of featurette,
some challenging DVD-ROM games and a clever, interactive dinosaur
encyclopedia.</TE>
<TE>   It's very difficult to describe "Mad Monster Party," which
recently made its DVD debut on Anchor Bay ($30). Produced by
Rankin/Bass, the team behind the "animagic" TV classics "Rudolph the
Red-Nosed Reindeer" and "Frosty the Snowman," this feature-length
animated horror comedy from 1967 features Boris Karloff, giving voice
to Baron Von Frankenstein, who decides to hold the ultimate horror
party on his Isle of Evil. He invites every monster in the world to
the festivities so he can announce his retirement. Phyllis Diller
also lent her vocal talents to this rather surreal motion picture.
Previously only available on video from a 16-millimeter print, this
version features a digitally restored transfer from the original
35-millimeter negative.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   King is a gorgeous, intelligent and talented German shepherd, but
even his antics can't save "K-9: PI" (Universal, $20 for both VHS and
DVD), a hideous made-for-video sequel to the 1989 film "K-9." This
time around, detective Thomas Dooley (James Belushi) and his trusty
canine partner Jerry Lee (King) retire from the police force and
become private detectives. The jokes are tired and the whole affair
is tasteless. King deserves better and so does the audience.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What's Cinderella without her wicked stepmother, fairy godmother or
pumpkin coach?</LD>
<LD>   A hoot.</LD>
<LD>   Children's theater versions of the tale are often Disneyesque in
nature; "Cinderella!," at the Falcon Theatre in Burbank, springs from
a different source: the 19th century Rossini comic opera "La
Cenerentola." Smoothly adapted and directed by Dimitri Toscas, this
is a rollicking "Cinderella!," a fresh, funny blend of classical
singing and sly buffoonery.</LD>
<TE>   Its operatic core--plot-advancing recitative, arias, duets and
spirited choruses--might seem challenging for young children, but
Toscas' astute balance of spoken dialogue and visual humor makes it
comfortably accessible for ages 5 and older. There were only a few
restless exceptions at a recent performance, where even preschoolers
were caught up in the tale.</TE>
<TE>   Adults, too, will appreciate the professional adult cast's vocal
strengths and comic talents. Jeanine Pacheco is Cinderella, pure of
heart and resigned to playing servant to her mean stepsisters. Tall,
lanky Clorinda (Karen Schnurr) and stocky Tisbe (Roberta B. Wall),
posture and bicker in pantaloon-revealing hoop-skirt frames and wacky
conical wigs.</TE>
<TE>   Foppish, rotund stepfather Don Magnifico (Peter Vogt) is another
walking sight gag, with painted-on mustache and ruffled pants,
although it's going a bit over the top that he is greedy enough to be
willing to marry the prince himself.</TE>
<TE>   The handsome Prince (Eric Meyersfield), meanwhile, disguised as
his own servant, counts on the audience to keep his secret. Audience
members also stand in for the missing fairy godmother, helping
Cinderella wish for a pretty dress and shoes to wear to the ball. The
wished-for items obligingly descend from high overhead.</TE>
<TE>   More visual comedy works are a treat as the Prince fools the vain
and silly sisters and the greedy Don Magnifico into thinking that a
flat, cutout puppet is the real prince, even though Meyersfield can
plainly be seen pulling the puppet's strings. There is a glass
slipper, but this Prince knows exactly to whom it belongs. With the
help of the audience, he reveals his secret identity and true love
prevails.</TE>
<TE>   Toscas and Tony Leondis are credited with the comical production
design. Pianists Brian O'Halloran, Greg Schreiner and Ron Snyder
alternate in providing live accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   "Cinderella!," Falcon Theatre, 4252 Riverside Drive, Burbank,
Saturdays, 1 and 3 p.m.; Sundays, 1 p.m. through Sept. 1. $10. (818)
955-8101. 1 hour, 10 minutes.</TE>

<LD>Just in time for the season when youths are getting restless and in
need of diversion, the Cabrillo Music Theater brings the musical
"Peter Pan" to the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, ending its 2001-02
season with a blast of whimsy and piracy. The stuff of "lost boys"
and "never-never land" will grace--and sometimes fly over--the stage
in a production directed by Gary Gardner, with music direction by
Nick DeGregorio.</LD>
<LD>   Melissa Lyons stars as Peter, Steve Vinovich plays Captain Hook
and Kelly Stables is Wendy, the voice of reason in a world gone
deliciously tipsy.</LD>
<LD>   * "Peter Pan," Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza Kavli Theatre, 2100
Thousand Oaks Blvd. Today through Saturday at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2
p.m. $15-$35. (805) 449-2787.</LD>
<TE>   Sublime Light: It's always good news when the widely acclaimed
Ojai-based painter Michael Dvortcsak has a show in the area. After
exhibitions at the Carnegie Art Museum in recent years, he has moved
south to the idyllic compound of Camarillo's Studio Channel Islands
Art Center.</TE>
<TE>   Dvortcsak's paintings look great in the large main gallery of the
center. Two huge, enveloping works are "Anamenhis" and "Great Stone,"
whose monumentality is tempered by his typical gracefulness of
brushwork. Also included are his familiar light-bathed vessels,
nearly life-size portraits of female subjects and rocks that split
the difference between painting and sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   He calls the show "Painting: Noun and Then," a pun relating to his
interests in the dualities of material and ephemeral in life and in
art. This translates into art that can be at once forceful and
vaporous. He shows unusual still-life studies of vegetables against
mysterious dark backgrounds and "Vessel for a Nocturne," with its
delicately gradated light illuminating the form and, at its brightest
point, with paint built up into a tactile, almost ceramic state.</TE>
<TE>   An older painting, "Stone for a Prayer," finds a large stone,
beatifically lighted and ritualistic, and irrationally situated in
some mystery ocean. Its beauty can't quite be explained away, and
that's precisely the point.</TE>
<TE>   * Michael Dvortcsak's "Painting: Noun and Then," Studio Channel
Islands Art Center at Cal State University Channel Islands,
Camarillo, ends Aug. 31. Thursdays-Saturdays, noon-3 p.m. (805)
383-1368.</TE>

<HD>British Court Rules Against Amgen</HD>
<DH>Drugs: Earlier victory in patent infringement suit against
Transkaryotic over a product to treat anemia is reversed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An appeals court in Britain on Wednesday reversed Amgen Inc.'s
victory in a patent infringement suit over its anti-anemia drug.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by an appeals court in London means Amgen could face
competition from Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. before the European
patent on the drug expires in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   At stake is a European market worth more than $800 million, with
Britain representing 8% to 10%. Although the court decision affects
only Britain, analysts said it could influence the outcome in other
countries.</LD>
<TE>   Amgen said it is considering an appeal to the House of Lords.
However, Thomas J. Dietz, an analyst with Pacific Growth Equities in
San Francisco, said the House of Lords rarely hears patent appeals.</TE>
<TE>   The case involves Amgen's patents on genetically engineered
erythropoietin, a protein that spurs red blood cell production. Amgen
sells the protein under the name Epogen in the U.S., where it
accounts for $2 billion in annual sales.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks-based Amgen doesn't market the drug in Europe.
Johnson &amp; Johnson sells it there under the name Eprex through a
licensing deal with Amgen. The drug is marketed to dialysis patients
because their damaged kidneys do not produce enough erythropoietin.</TE>
<TE>   The case is significant to Amgen in two ways: The company receives
a licensing fee on sales by Johnson &amp; Johnson; and last summer, Amgen
launched a second-generation anti-anemia drug in Europe to reclaim
revenue it had lost to Johnson &amp; Johnson, the company's estranged
business partner. Called Aranesp, the drug had worldwide revenue of
$56 million in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Transkaryotic's drug, called Dynepo, closely
resembles Eprex and is a greater threat to the Johnson &amp; Johnson drug
than it is to Aranesp.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Johnson &amp; Johnson has had a rash of serious illnesses
and one death linked to its drug in Europe, making it vulnerable to
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Dietz said profit on Dynepo is high so that Transkaryotic and its
marketing partner, Aventis, could use price as a weapon against Eprex
and, to a lesser extent, Aranesp. "This are 95% gross-margin
products," he said. "You don't necessarily want to use price, but you
can."</TE>
<TE>   Cambridge, Mass.-based Transkaryotic and Aventis this year
received approval from the European Union to market Dynepo. But
Transkaryotic Chief Executive Richard F. Seldon said that French drug
maker Aventis does not want to launch the drug in Europe until there
is a ruling in a similar patent infringement case in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   A federal district court in Boston last year ruled that
Transkaryotic infringed three Amgen patents.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit heard arguments
in the case in May, and Transkaryotic said a decision is not expected
until early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Elise Wang, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in New York, said
the hurdles are higher for Transkaryotic in the U.S. patent case.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen, as part of its lower-court victory, obtained an injunction
that prevents Transkaryotic and Aventis from manufacturing Dynepo in
the United States for export markets. That ruling could make it
difficult for the companies to supply the European market, because
its Dynepo manufacturing facilities are in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Transkaryotic spokeswoman Justine Koenigsberg said Aventis "is
developing manufacturing options," but she would not be more
specific.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen shares Wednesday closed up 15 cents at $45.64, while
Transkaryotic shares fell 35 cents to $38.55, both on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>AOL Is Target of Criminal Probe</HD>
<DH>Media: U.S. investigators appear to be focusing on
accounting practices at the firm's Internet unit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc.'s accounting woes worsened Wednesday as the
Justice Department opened a preliminary criminal probe amid
allegations that its Internet division fudged revenue numbers.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based media giant staunchly defended its practices
and portrayed itself as a victim of the recent spate of corporate
scandals, which have made regulators more aggressive in cracking down
on accounting gimmicks and investor fraud.</LD>
<LD>   "In the current environment, when anyone raises a question about
accounting, it's not surprising that the relevant government agencies
will want to look into the facts," the company said. The Justice
Department investigation, first reported by USA Today, was confirmed
by the company Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. But a Justice
Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
characterized the investigation as a criminal matter in the early
stages.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Chief Executive Richard D. Parsons and other
executives declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Leonsis, vice chairman of the troubled America Online unit,
defended the company's practices during a television appearance
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We were approached today and we are cooperating fully," Leonsis
said. "We have looked at our accounting practices. We feel very
comfortable there....We are very anxious to get all this behind us."</TE>
<TE>   The company announced last week that the Securities and Exchange
Commission had launched a "fact-finding inquiry" into questions
raised by a Washington Post article.</TE>
<TE>   The July 18 article said AOL used "unconventional" accounting
practices to increase its advertising revenue by about $270 million
from July 2000 to March 2002.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner said it stands by its accounting practices, which
it noted have been twice blessed by its outside auditors at Ernst &amp;
Young.</TE>
<TE>   The company also noted that the advertising deals represented less
than 2% of the company's overall revenue during the period in
question.</TE>
<TE>   The government agencies appear to be focusing on the Dulles,
Va.-based AOL Internet unit, whose sluggish performance this year
pushed the parent company's stock price down 65%.</TE>
<TE>   The company's financial problems have triggered a massive
management restructuring in recent months, including the departures
of Chief Executive Gerald M. Levin, Co-Chief Operating Officer Robert
W. Pittman and America Online unit chief Barry Schuler.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is increasingly cracking down on accounting
practices--even those involving relatively small dollar amounts--if
they are used to disguise problems, artificially meet Wall Street
expectations or hide negative trends from investors.</TE>
<TE>   The Post article suggested that AOL used the deals to disguise a
slowdown in ad revenue during the crucial period in which it was
awaiting government approval to buy Time Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating matters is AOL's history of aggressive accounting.
The SEC fined the company $3.5 million in 2000 over the way it had
accounted for the cost of mailing software discs to consumers in the
mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   It's not unusual for the SEC and the Justice Department to
investigate allegations of corporate wrongdoing or accounting
problems, particularly after they are disclosed in the media.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts and former prosecutors warn that once a government
investigation begins, it is impossible to know where it will lead. It
could uncover unrelated problems in other AOL Time Warner units.</TE>
<TE>   "The investigation creates a level of uncertainty," said Merrill
Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen, who urged investors to hold back
Wednesday, despite the low stock price.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know yet what the focus is. We don't know how long it
will take. Is this just about the AOL unit or the whole company?
There's been no announcement."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AOL Time Warner fell 7% on Wednesday to $11.50, down 90
cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading.</TE>
<TE>   The corporate backlash in Washington, triggered by the meltdowns
of Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd., also is
fueling a more aggressive approach by federal prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   The recent arrest of Adelphia Communications Corp. founder John
Rigas, who was taken away in handcuffs in front of television
cameras, was widely viewed as an attempt by the Bush administration
to show that it is getting tough on white-collar crime.</TE>
<TE>   "For law enforcement, some of these calls are in a gray area,"
said former Justice Department attorney David Turetsky. "In the
current environment, they are looking at gray areas differently. And
Congress has certainly let it be known that it wants enforcement to
be as strong as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, Jon Miller, a former USA Interactive Inc.
executive, emerged as a candidate to take over the AOL Internet unit.</TE>

<HD>FERC Pushes Conversion to a National Power Grid</HD>
<DH>Energy: Plan would replace 'obsolete patchwork' of regional
and state systems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Trying to revive competitive electricity markets after the debacle in
California, federal regulators Wednesday proposed sweeping changes to
speed the creation of a national power grid and encourage investment
in new transmission lines and generating plants.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission unanimously approved a
controversial 600-page plan to transform how the power grid is
operated, imposing one set of rules on an "obsolete patchwork" of
regional and state systems.</LD>
<LD>   The plan would require traditional utility companies to transfer
control of transmission systems to independent regional entities,
which would then open the power grid to any qualified seller.</LD>
<TE>   Proposed safeguards would ensure that each region of the country
retains enough electricity supply to meet its own needs, and that
efforts to manipulate markets are blocked.</TE>
<TE>   The vision of a national power grid was endorsed by the Bush
administration in its energy strategy last year. Carrying it out may
prove trickier than imagined.</TE>
<TE>   "At 600-plus pages, the devil's in the details," said Bill Brier,
a spokesman for Edison Electric Institute, a utility trade
association.</TE>
<TE>   FERC Chairman Patrick H. Wood III said the plan would benefit
California by making it easier for the state to import power during
periods of high demand. Nationally, he predicted that the new system
could reduce wholesale electricity prices 5% to 10% by the end of the
decade.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike what happened in California, we don't want to make people
worse off," Wood said.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Wood also said some of the trading strategies employed
by Enron Corp. during the California energy crisis were based on
"fraud and misrepresentation." Wood's comments were stronger than he
has made in the past, but he also said that FERC had not yet reached
any conclusions in its probe of market manipulation in the West.</TE>
<TE>   FERC's new market proposal brought a sharp rebuke from several
state regulators, including California Public Utilities Commission
Chairwoman Loretta Lynch, who blasted the plan as an attempt by
Washington to usurp authority and undermine consumer protections.
National rules would take away much state jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   "They are taking away the job of 50 states to figure out how to
run their electricity systems and giving it to folks in Washington
who have serious problems running their own show," Lynch said. "They
have taken a one-size-fits-all Cinderella shoe and are trying to
shoehorn everybody's feet into it. Well, the West's feet are too big
to fit."</TE>
<TE>   Lynch said the PUC would file a challenge to the plan with FERC.
Gov. Gray Davis was also critical, saying in a statement that "FERC's
one-size-fits-all approach--does not offer a solution to California's
problems."</TE>
<TE>   But Mark Cooper, an energy analyst with the Consumer Federation of
America, said some of the principles of the plan could be valuable
for homeowners and businesses. "A transmission grid that is adequate
and open is important," Cooper said. "Just like a good interstate
highway system is good for consumers, a good interstate transmission
system is good for consumers."</TE>
<TE>   The plan proposed by FERC would not become final until the end of
the year, at the earliest, and then would take two more years to put
into practice.</TE>
<TE>   The power lines that deliver electricity to communities were built
to serve local needs and have never been part of a national system.</TE>
<TE>   In some areas, such as the West, the connections between states
and regions are dicey, with different rules and pricing systems
making it difficult to transmit power over long distances.</TE>
<TE>   The transmission infrastructure is widely acknowledged to be
inadequate for the future needs of the country, but investment in
improvements has been slow in coming.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the control of much of the system by utilities has been
controversial. The government has found that utilities discriminated
against independent generators by impeding their access to the
electric wires.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of change believe that the combination of one set of
national rules, impartial operation of the grid and better
connections among states and regions will spur a wave of investment
in power plants and transmission lines that ultimately will benefit
consumers. Abundant, cheap power in one part of the country could be
funneled to areas of greater need, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "The status quo is not in the public interest, and a sharp change
is necessary," said FERC Commissioner William Massey, who was one of
California's strongest advocates in Washington during the state's
power crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Under the FERC plan, prices would rise and fall according to
supply and demand.</TE>
<TE>   But there would be a price cap of $1,000 per megawatt hour, as is
now in effect in New York and Texas. Market rules would prevent
Enron-type manipulations based on strategies that artificially
created congestion on the California grid.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more of a restructuring, or a different type of
regulation--it's not deregulation," said Alice Fernandez, a FERC
specialist who worked on the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Some aspects of the proposal resemble the system now in place in
California. Long-term fixed-price contracts would supply most of the
power in any given region of the country. The independent operator of
the power grid--akin to the California Independent System Operator,
or Cal-ISO--would supervise short-term needs to cover day-to-day
fluctuations in supply and demand.</TE>
<TE>   Segments of the power industry that are traditionally at odds
responded favorably to the plan. Both independent marketers and
utilities said they hoped it would help restore confidence in their
scandal-racked industry.</TE>

<HD>GE Will Treat Stock Options as an Expense</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Bellwether company's move could prompt others
to adopt the practice. Profit for 2002 would be reduced by about 1
cent a share.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The backlash against employee stock options, the perk that made
executives fabulously rich during the stock market bubble, gained
momentum Wednesday when General Electric Co. said it would count them
against earnings for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   GE, the nation's most valuable company, said it would start
treating options as a cost this quarter to bolster the integrity of
its accounting, and some analysts said GE's stature could prompt
waves of other companies to follow suit.</LD>
<LD>   Coca-Cola Co. two weeks ago became the first major company to
count options as a normal business expense in reaction to the
corporate bookkeeping scandals sweeping the country. A few others
adopted the practice, including Amazon.com Inc., but most companies
balked at the idea, saying it would significantly reduce their
profits. Before July, Boeing Co. and Winn-Dixie Stores Inc. were the
only members of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 that did so.</LD>
<TE>   With powerful GE expensing options, however, "the dam should break
at this point" in terms of other companies matching the move, said
Robert Friedman, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "That's because GE is in so many different business lines, and
they're in finance as well as manufacturing," he said. The
conglomerate, with a total stock market value of $314 billion, also
stands as a benchmark company whose management practices are often
emulated by other enterprises, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Arthur Bowman, editor of trade publication Bowman's Accounting
Report, said GE by itself probably would not be able to make the
practice widespread. Technology companies, the most aggressive in
granting incentive options as compensation in the last decade, are
particularly reluctant to treat options as a cost and lower profits.</TE>
<TE>   Giant companies such as Intel Corp. and Oracle Corp. have defended
current practices, arguing that the volatility of tech stocks makes
it hard to place a future value on options. Semiconductor equipment
maker KLA-Tencor Corp. went so far as to consider removing Coca-Cola
vending machines from its San Jose campus "as a symbolic gesture" of
disapproval of Coke's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if the change is adopted by more major U.S. companies in
the weeks ahead, "then maybe investors will pressure the rest of them
to do the same," Bowman said.</TE>
<TE>   Employee options give holders the ability to buy a company's stock
at a set price in the future. The hope is that the stock's market
price will not only reach the option price but go even higher so the
options are more valuable.</TE>
<TE>   Executives are the major recipients of options, enabling them to
collect tens of millions of dollars in profits in some cases, though
many companies issue them to employees across the board in lieu of
bonuses or raises. But the grants are under attack for contributing
to the scandals, on the premise that wayward executives tried to
boost share prices with accounting tricks to enrich themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfield, Conn.-based GE, which earned $13.7 billion on revenue
of $126 billion last year, said expensing options would shave this
year's profit by about $30 million, or a penny per diluted share. The
company--which makes power turbines, medical equipment, appliances
and jet engines and owns a huge financing arm and the NBC television
network--expects to earn about $1.65 a share this year.</TE>
<TE>   The company said the cost would rise to 3 to 4 cents a share over
the next three to four years as the options' total cost is phased in.
After the announcement, GE shares rose 60 cents to $32.20 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   GE, under new Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt, is sensitive about
accounting matters these days. After the Enron Corp. debacle, GE was
criticized for not providing enough information about its
far-reaching activities. GE responded by releasing much more
financial data and holding its first conference call with analysts.</TE>
<TE>   GE said Wednesday that Immelt and Chief Financial Officer Keith
Sherin also signed sworn statements certifying GE's results--as
government regulators now require--and GE took other steps to
"further align senior management's personal interests with the
long-term interests of shareowners."</TE>
<TE>   Among them: GE will require senior officers to hold stock they
have bought under its option program for at least one year before
they can sell those shares on the open market.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the accounting industry's rule-making body said it
would consider whether companies that adopt the options-as-expense
method should also restate financial results for options granted
since 1995. The proposal will be considered at the meeting Wednesday
of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, though no decision is
expected, said spokeswoman Sheryl Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   The board applauds companies such as GE and Coke because treating
options as a cost, it said, "is the preferable approach" to showing
investors the effect of options on financial results.</TE>

<HD>Global Deal May Benefit Subsidiary</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A deal for the assets of fiber-optic network builder Global Crossing
Ltd. also could solve the cash crunch at its troubled majority-owned
subsidiary, Asia Global Crossing Ltd., according to sources familiar
with late-developing efforts to bail out both operations.</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing, which is close to picking a winning bid for its
assets, is trying to emerge from bankruptcy reorganization as an
independent company. Asia Global, which ran into deep trouble when
its parent company reneged on a promised $400-million cash infusion
last fall, is trying to avoid a bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., which had been part of an early bid, now
withdrawn, for Global Crossing, is back in the hunt for the company's
assets, sources said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Hutchison, controlled by billionaire Li Ka-Shing, also is believed
to be one of three companies interested in taking over Asia Global,
which is 59% owned by Global. Hutchison partnered with Asia Global in
three overseas ventures until earlier this year, when Hutchison
bought out Asia Global's stakes for $120 million.</TE>
<TE>   Only China Netcom Communications Group Corp., that nation's
second-largest fixed-line telephone company, has acknowledged that it
is bidding for Asia Global.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchison joins two other companies in the Global Crossing bidding
process, each pushing deals that value the company at $1 billion to
$2 billion, sources say.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles buyout firms Gores Technology Group and Platinum
Equity, run by brothers Alec and Tom Gores, have submitted a joint
bid for Global's network, which connects more than 200 cities in 27
countries. And David Walsh, a former Global president and chief
operating officer, is leading a group that includes One Equity
Partners, the venture capital unit of Bank One Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, rival telecommunications firm Level 3 Communications
Inc., which last month received a $500-million investment backed by
billionaire investor Warren Buffett, has submitted a bid for a large
portion of Global Crossing's business. All parties are refusing to
comment on their roles in Global's bidding process.</TE>

<HD>Retailers Have High Hopes for Men's Low-Rise Jeans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Youth-oriented retailers reported disappointing sales trends
Wednesday--the latest sign that shoppers may be slowing their
spending just as the important back-to-school shopping season
launches.</LD>
<LD>   Retailers blame some of the problem on the lack of "must-have"
items for men, a trend they hope to reverse by marketing a male
version of the low-rise jeans so popular with young women.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based Guess Inc. said it had expected to sell the
jeans for men only in top markets, such as L.A., New York and Miami.
But the pants also are selling in Middle America, said Erik Joule,
general merchandise manager for men's clothing at Guess.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a big thing for back-to-school," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the back-to-school shopping season depends on more than jeans
alone, and so far youth-oriented retailers are seeing troubling
signs.</TE>
<TE>   Counterculture favorite Hot Topic Inc. said Wednesday that July
sales were slower than expected and August sales also might fall
short of expectations. Apparel retailer Gadzooks Inc., based in
Carrollton, Texas, also said this week that July sales were running
"significantly lower" than expected.</TE>
<TE>   And footwear maker Genesco Inc., based in Nashville, Tenn.,
lowered its earnings expectations after sales slowed last week at its
Journeys stores.</TE>
<TE>   Hot Topic and Genesco's stock prices got hammered. Hot Topic's
share price lost $6.90, or 31%, closing at $15.55 in Nasdaq trading.
Genesco's stock hit a 52-week low of $15 in Wednesday's trading
before closing at $15.15, down $6.13, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Gadzooks stock closed at $8.90, off 14 cents, on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   It is too soon to know if consumers have slammed the brakes on
spending but there's still time for back-to-school sales to pick up,
analyst Joseph Teklits of Wachovia Securities said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But the recent stock market turbulence may have kept some shoppers
"frozen on the sidelines," he said. Boring clothes also could be
hurting sales, along with a lack of clearance inventory to draw
bargain hunters to malls, Teklits said.</TE>
<TE>   Gloomy July sales results are particularly painful for retailers
because so many of them were hoping for a strong second half of the
year. At City of Industry-based Hot Topic, "very disappointing" sales
of men's clothing have cast a cloud over third-quarter results, Chief
Executive Betsy McLaughlin said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "In the absence of a clear men's trend, coupled with the
historically significant contribution of men's during the
back-to-school period, we are also revising our original earnings
expectations for the third quarter," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Other retailers also have struggled to move men's products off
shelves, leading some to push the new hip-hugger jeans for men.</TE>
<TE>   Levi Strauss &amp; Co., a San Francisco jeans maker that has been
dogged with slumping sales, launched an advertising campaign this
week to promote its low-slung jeans for men and women. The television
spots show slim young people venturing into gritty parts of town and
encountering danger while clad in what the ad calls "dangerously low"
jeans.</TE>
<TE>   "No one knows if low-rise are going to catch on with guys," said
Michael Wood, vice president of Teenage Research Unlimited in
Northbrook, Ill. "I think it's a risk Levi truly had to take."</TE>
<TE>   Though Levi may have the highest advertising profile for
hip-hugging jeans, several other companies also have begun offering
trim, low-rise pants for males.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Sunwear of California Inc., an Anaheim-based retailer that
caters to surfers and skateboarders, said this week it has begun
testing the lower-cut styles in its stores.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies cranking out the new men's style include Diesel
Inc., which sells jeans for $100 to $200 a pair, and V.F. Jeanswear,
a division of VF Corp. in Greensboro, N.C., and maker of Wrangler and
Lee brands. Hip-huggers account for 15% to 20% of Wrangler's men's
business, said Angelo LaGrega, president of VF Jeans- wear's Wrangler
division.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're all going to make sure our brands are represented
in this emerging trend as it grows," LaGrega said.</TE>
<TE>   While men have been wearing baggy pants hanging off their hips for
years, the newer style is less sloppy and more "James Dean," as one
industry insider put it. Skinny, low-cut jeans have become so popular
with women, that men finally appear ready for the look, some apparel
insiders say. Skimpier jeans won't look as brief on men, though,
since they aren't likely to wear them with midriff-baring tops.</TE>
<TE>   It's far from clear, however, how well low-rise pants will work
for back-to-school shoppers, since parents and school districts also
are likely to weigh in on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, how low is too low?" said Marshal Cohen,
co-president of NPD Fashion World, a division of NPD Group, a market
information company in New York.</TE>
<TE>   For young people, "the more radical and edgy, the better," Cohen
said. "School officials and parents are going to have a different
opinion. The question is, how will they react to the low-rise?"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, many retailers continue to stock up on many styles of
jeans, including the still popular relaxed carpenter-style pants.</TE>
<TE>   Even if shopping gets off to a slow start, retailers can hope for
a rebound in the "second wave" of back-to-school shopping, which
usually occurs late in September after young people start school and
discover they bought the wrong things, said Wood of Teenage Research
Unlimited.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like it was in the day when you went out and did one
shopping trip and that was that," he said. "They convince their
parents to go back then and buy more clothes."</TE>

<HD>Venturing Into the Known</HD>
<DH>Amid the tech meltdown, investors opt for firms with
simpler business plans</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burned by the continuing technology meltdown, more venture
capitalists are aiming their investment dollars at companies with
business plans that nearly anyone could understand.</LD>
<LD>   It's a trend that helped a number of private Southland firms get
venture funding in the second quarter. Among them: Cerritos-based
Aspen Education Group, which runs schools for troubled teens in eight
states, and Seal Beach-based GreenPark Group, which buys and develops
polluted real estate sites.</LD>
<LD>   "You don't need to have a scientist explain these companies to
you," said Don Williams, Pacific Southwest venture capital advisory
group leader for accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young.</LD>
<TE>   Venture funding overall has plummeted over the last two years and
continued to slide in the second quarter as investors have become
more reluctant to sink money into young companies. In Los Angeles,
Orange and San Diego counties, a total of 71 companies got $632
million in venture money in the quarter, according to a survey by
PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Assn.</TE>
<TE>   That was the smallest number of Southland firms funded in any
quarter since the third quarter of 1997, and the smallest dollar
total invested since the first quarter of 1999. The Southland data
mirror the national trend.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly gone from the roster of companies attracting new venture
money are start-up firms, Internet business-to-business plays and
e-commerce anything.</TE>
<TE>   In the Southland, software and medical-related companies continue
to lure investment, albeit in smaller numbers. Among the companies
that got funding in the latest quarter was Irvine-based Valley Forge
Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is developing an eye drop to prevent
myopia in children.</TE>
<TE>   Venture capital funds, which pool money from institutions and
wealthy investors to invest in private firms, have dramatically
scaled back their bets as many young tech companies have collapsed.
Also, the stock market's plunge has reduced the likelihood that many
private companies can go public any time soon. That closes the door
on one of the main routes venture investors use to cash in their
stakes in firms.</TE>
<TE>   In the heady days of the Internet boom, entrepreneurs armed only
with dreams managed to secure millions in venture money. In the
second quarter, by contrast, just one Southland start-up company, San
Diego-based Rubicon Pharmaceuticals, got funding.</TE>
<TE>   "You need a product and you need real revenues to get funded these
days," said Randy Churchill, a director of business development with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The new environment has steered many venture investors toward
companies with simpler business plans, or encouraged them to fund
tech companies in which they already have invested significant sums.</TE>
<TE>   Those trends favored Southland companies such as these in the
second quarter:</TE>
<TE>   * Founded in 1994, Aspen Education employs 1,200 people, had sales
of $72 million last year and is turning a profit on its business of
running schools and treatment programs for troubled teens.</TE>
<TE>   More than 8,000 teens attended Aspen's programs last year, the
company said. Most of the firm's revenue comes from payments made
directly by parents, rather than by government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Aspen's 28-day program in the Blue Ridge Mountains for "parents
seeking solace for their struggling child" costs nearly $11,000. But
parents will mortgage homes, borrow from relatives, "do whatever it
takes" to help their children, said Elliot Sainer, 56, the company's
chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   "The demand for our programs, unfortunately for society, is
growing," Sainer said. "There are so many kids in trouble at every
end of the economic spectrum."</TE>
<TE>   Aspen received $15 million in venture money from one source,
investment firm Warburg Pincus, in the second quarter. The company
will use the money to add to its 10 operating residential treatment
schools and to make acquisitions, Sainer said.</TE>
<TE>   Aspen could go public in the next five years, he said.</TE>
<TE>   * Founded by Johannesburg, South Africa, native Kevin Torf in
1995, Tornado Development has survived the technology sector's
implosion. The El Segundo company has a patent pending for software
that allows a customer to access all messages--phone, fax and
e-mail--in one place.</TE>
<TE>   Tornado raised $20 million in the second quarter from previous
venture investors including GE Equity and Intel Corp., bringing the
total amount raised since the firm's formation to $70 million in five
rounds of financing.</TE>
<TE>   To stay alive, the company has kept costs to a minimum and
concentrated on its product, Torf said.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when many venture capitalists are cutting the cord to
previously funded companies they don't think will make it, keeping
investors involved wasn't easy, Torf said. "You can't see my wounds
over the phone, but there was a lot of blood," he said.</TE>
<TE>   With 60 employees and clients in Malaysia and China, Tornado hopes
to attract major U.S. clients soon or find a buyer among the big
telecommunications companies, Torf, 40, said.</TE>
<TE>   But the blowup of Global Crossing Ltd.--a client and an early
investor in the firm--has hurt, he said. "That took some food off the
table."</TE>
<TE>   * Costa Mesa-based U.S. Education Corp., which provides
post-secondary education in the health sciences and information
technology areas, took in more than $20 million in the quarter from
two investors: ClearLight Partners in Newport Beach and Chicago-based
William Blair Capital Partners.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope to go public in the next two years. It depends on how
fast we grow," said company president William Clohan.</TE>
<TE>   Formed last year, the firm now has 200 employees and plans to use
its private equity for expansion. U.S. Education serves 1,800
students through four campuses in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   "We love this sector. It has great long-term demographic trends
with the U.S. economy's demand for a more highly skilled labor
force," said Rob Healy, a partner with ClearLight.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Battered by industrywide price pressures, write-offs and falling
demand, Verizon Communications Inc. posted a $2-billion
second-quarter loss Wednesday and lowered its full-year revenue and
profit targets.</LD>
<LD>   But in a potent sign of how bad things have become among
telecommunications companies, Verizon's stock shot up on the news,
adding $2.80, or more than 9%, to close at $33 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Shares of fellow local phone companies SBC Communications
Inc. and BellSouth Corp. also advanced.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone expected a lot worse," said Phillip Redman, research
director at Gartner Inc.</LD>
<TE>   New York-based Verizon, the nation's largest local phone provider,
remains one the industry's strongest and most dominant players. But
it faces many of the same challenges as its more troubled rivals. In
addition to sour market conditions, Verizon is carrying a heavy debt
load and losing revenue as customers unplug extra phone lines and
shift their communications to cell phones and e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon said sales fell almost 2% to $16.8 billion for the quarter
ended June 30, down from $17.1 billion in the same quarter last year.
The company's net loss was equal to 78 cents per diluted share,
compared with a loss of 38 cents for the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials also lowered guidance on Verizon's full-year
performance, saying 2002 revenue would be flat to down 1% (revised
from flat to 1% growth), and on its earnings per share before
one-time items of $3.05 to $3.09 (down from $3.12 to $3.17).</TE>
<TE>   Verizon's results were weighed down by extra charges totaling $4.2
billion, or about $1.55 per diluted share. They included $862 million
for the reduced value of Verizon's investments in Telus Corp., Cable
&amp; Wireless and others, plus $475 million for employee severance costs
and $114 million to settle a lawsuit over the company's canceled
purchase of NorthPoint Communications Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The one-time items also include a $183-million charge for unpaid
accounts owed by WorldCom Inc. before its recent bankruptcy filing,
and a $2.4-billion write-down of the value of Verizon's stake in
Genuity Inc., the Internet services firm that Verizon made
independent as part of the merger between Bell Atlantic and GTE.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon maintained a 10% stake in Genuity and has the right to
re-integrate the company in the future. Last week, Verizon announced
it would not reclaim the money-losing operation because it would add
to the company's debt and further depress earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Without the one-time items, Verizon posted earnings of $2.1
billion, or 77 cents a share, which met analysts' expectations that
ranged from 74 cents to 79 cents. At the quarter's end, Verizon's
debt totaled $58.6 billion (after this year's reduction of $4.7
billion), and the company had about 39 million residential lines in
service (down by 355,000) and 20.8 million business lines (down by
479,000).</TE>
<TE>   "A $2-billion loss is a big number," said analyst Redman of
Gartner. "But they still met their earnings per share, and made only
minor adjustments in their projections.... It could have been worse
in this economy."</TE>
<TE>   The good news for the company included strong growth in its
long-distance business and a better-than-forecast increase in
subscribers at Verizon Wireless, the mobile phone joint venture of
Verizon and Europe's Vodafone. The venture, already the nation's
largest mobile-services provider, added 1.1 million customers in the
second quarter to bring its total to 30.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   In other technology earnings news Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * Adobe Systems Inc., the largest maker of publishing and
graphic-design software, reduced its forecast for third-quarter sales
to $270 million to $290 million and profit to 18 cents to 23 cents a
share. A year ago, San Jose-based Adobe had sales of $292.1 million
and profit of 28 cents.</TE>
<TE>   * Computer Sciences Corp., the third-largest U.S.
computer-services company, said its fiscal first-quarter profit rose
66%, to $79 million, or 46 cents a share, from $47.7 million, or 28
cents, a year earlier. Sales at the El Segundo-based company rose
1.9% to $2.76 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Ingram Micro Inc., the world's biggest computer-products
distributor, posted a second-quarter profit, but sales fell 11%, to
$5.35 billion, because of slower demand worldwide. Net income at the
Santa Ana-based firm was $8.8 million, or 6 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $12 million, or 8 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   * Skyworks Solutions Inc., a wireless-phone chip maker formed by
the merger of Alpha Industries Inc. and a unit of Conexant Systems
Inc., posted a wider fiscal third-quarter loss and said it would cut
450 jobs. Skyworks had a net loss of $181.9 million, or $1.92 a
share, compared with a loss of $142.4 million, or $1.64, in the
year-earlier period. Sales more than doubled to $112.9 million from
$51 million. The cuts will reduce its work force to 3,750.</TE>

<LD>A U.S. appeals court rejected a request by DaimlerChrysler, Ford
Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. to shift asbestos lawsuits over
auto parts made by Federal-Mogul Corp. to federal bankruptcy court in
Delaware.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a trial judge's
decision, sending nearly 20,000 personal injury claims back to state
courts. The auto makers wanted the suits by workers who claim they
got sick from handling asbestos-lined brakes and other auto parts
taken together as part of Federal-Mogul's bankruptcy case. An
attorney representing the auto makers said the case would be appealed
to the Supreme Court.</LD>

<LD>Enron Corp.'s creditors' committee has asked a bankruptcy judge to
force J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. to cooperate with the panel's probe of
a series of controversial oil and gas trades.</LD>
<LD>   The transactions between Enron and Mahonia Ltd., a bank entity,
have been scrutinized by congressional investigators and are the
subject of a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court between J.P. Morgan
and 11 insurers who guaranteed the trades with surety bonds.</LD>
<LD>   The creditors' committee said its efforts to investigate the
Mahonia transactions have been hampered by the second-largest U.S.
bank, which also is a member of the panel. The committee asked U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez to order J.P. Morgan to
cooperate.</LD>

<HD>Cooper Tire Penalized for Misleading Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co. was sanctioned by a Mississippi judge for
withholding documents and misleading the court in a wrongful-death
lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   State Judge Bobby B. DeLaughter found the second-largest U.S. tire
maker failed to turn over records of warranty claims and tire
failures that the company told the court it had given to lawyers for
relatives of an accident victim.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact that Cooper Tire withheld those documents, but misled
the court in representing that it had, in fact, furnished them, is
further evidence of just how far Cooper is willing to go to rape
discovery requirements," DeLaughter wrote, ordering the tire maker to
produce the documents by Friday or pay $10,000 a day in penalties.</LD>
<TE>   Cooper said it is "reviewing options." Shares of Findlay,
Ohio-based Cooper, the No. 2 U.S. tire maker behind Goodyear Tire &amp;
Rubber Co., fell 31 cents to $20.01 on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are teaming up to
sell wireless communication devices and services to businesses. The
companies said they'll conduct joint sales, account planning and
marketing. New services and wireless devices will go on sale in the
fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, is striking
partnerships in industries such as wireless-phone service to help it
sell new software programs as demand for personal-computer software
slows. AT&amp;T Wireless, the third-largest mobile-phone company, wants
to boost sales by getting customers to spend more time using phones,
laptops and hand-held computers to retrieve corporate records.</LD>
<LD>   Terms of the partnership weren't disclosed. Microsoft shares fell
12 cents, to $47.98, in Nasdaq trading Wednesday. AT&amp;T Wireless fell
17 cents to $4.69 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</LD>

<HD>Vodafone Explains Accounting Practices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vodafone Group, Europe's biggest mobile-phone company, said its
accounting methods sometimes lead to booking 100% of revenue in
transactions in which part of the amount is shared with third
parties.</LD>
<LD>   Vodafone in some cases booked all the revenue from wireless
Internet services as sales even when a portion was paid to third
parties as part of content-sharing agreements, the Financial Times
reported, citing the company.</LD>
<LD>   Vodafone said it looks at every revenue-sharing agreement on a
case-by-case basis and listed payments to third parties as revenue
only when it collected payments from mobile-phone users, the
newspaper said.</LD>
<TE>   The accounting practice complies fully with British standards,
Vodafone said.</TE>
<TE>   At the company's annual meeting, Chairman Ian MacLaurin complained
that media reports have given a misleading view of the company's
finances and performance. He said reports comparing the mobile-phone
company to WorldCom Inc. and Enron Corp., which both sought
bankruptcy protection, were "odious."</TE>

<HD>Dutch Bank to Buy California-Based VIB</HD>
<DH>Mergers: Rabobank hopes to use the $212.5-million deal to
expand in the U.S. and build on rural roots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A major Dutch bank founded as a farmers cooperative said Wednesday
that it agreed to pay $212.5 million for VIB Corp., a 20-year-old El
Centro bank with branches in rural California communities from Fresno
to Calexico.</LD>
<LD>   The buyer, Rabobank Group, also has focused on farm towns during
its 100-year history and makes 80% of all agricultural loans in the
Netherlands. With assets topping $350 billion, the Utrecht-based
company is the 25th-largest bank in the world, having expanded in the
last eight years by buying rural banks in Australia, New Zealand and
Ireland.</LD>
<LD>   VIB's managers, led by Chief Executive Dennis Kern, would stay on,
continuing to operate the bank's retail subsidiaries as Valley
Independent Bank, Bank of Stockdale and Kings River State Bank.</LD>
<TE>   Rabobank said it planned to rapidly increase agricultural and
consumer mortgage lending at VIB, which has 24 branches and assets of
$1.3 billion and specializes in financing commercial real estate
deals. The new owners also would provide wealth management, insurance
and other specialty services to VIB customers.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at both banks said they expected Rabobank, which has
corporate banking offices in New York and other U.S. cities, to
continue its retail expansion in California and other states.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to start in California, which after all is the biggest
banking market in the country," said Cor Broekhuyse, an executive
vice president at the Dutch bank who heads its U.S. operations from
New York. "But in the end we'd like to be a player all over the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   Rabobank would pay $15.10 a share in cash for VIB common stock, a
premium of 9.4% over VIB's $13.80 Tuesday close on Nasdaq. Shares
rose $1.02, or 7.4%, to $14.82 on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition is expected to close late this year or early next
year, pending shareholder and regulatory approval, said Harry Gooding
III, VIB's chief financial officer. He said VIB began exploring the
possibility of a sale early this year and talked with several
potential acquirers before Rabobank came forward. The companies were
so similar and the strategic fit was so good that the deal was
"basically a no-brainer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The only other foreign buyer of California banks in recent years
has been BNP Paribas, a French bank that is merging Los Angeles-based
United California Bank with Bank of the West in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The dearth of foreign deals in part reflects the declining number
of institutions: a consolidation wave reduced the number of
California banks from 472 in 1991 to 275 at the end of 2001, a 42%
drop, said Edward J. Carpenter of investment bank Carpenter &amp; Co. in
Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   He said the price paid for VIB is about 1.9 times the bank's net
worth, compared with an average of 1.75 times for the six other bank
acquisitions in California this year.</TE>
<TE>   The deal with Rabobank proves that "unusual business plans can
work if you stick to your knitting," Carpenter said. VIB "grew nicely
in non-coastal areas, places that a lot of banks would consider less
desirable."</TE>

<HD>New CEO Thielen Outlines Vision for Bertelsmann</HD>
<DH>Media: Predecessor Middelhoff's imprint is pushed aside as
employees are told of renewed focus on company's core values.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gunter Thielen, the new chief executive of German media giant
Bertelsmann, lost little time in underlining the difference with his
go-getting predecessor, Thomas Middelhoff.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to employees just three days after Middelhoff was
deposed, Thielen stressed the core values of the group, which started
life almost 170 years ago printing hymnals in the northwestern German
town of Gutersloh.</LD>
<LD>   "The basis is the mature, successful Bertelsmann
concept--decentralization, entrepreneurship and management based on
partnership," he told employees.</LD>
<TE>   Pledging a return to the group's core business, Thielen, a 20-year
Bertelsmann veteran, drew a line under the ambitious expansion drive
and the flurry of deal making in the Internet, music and TV
businesses that marked the Middelhoff era.</TE>
<TE>   An engineer who began his career at chemicals giant BASF before
joining Bertelsmann's printing operations in 1980, Thielen stands in
sober contrast to media managers of the late-1990s Internet era.</TE>
<TE>   Where as Middelhoff, the self-proclaimed "American with a German
passport," was driven to match global giants such as AOL Time Warner
Inc., Thielen's priorities appear closer to those of Rheinhard Mohn,
the octogenarian philanthropist who controls the group.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the new chief executive appeared to take a more
cautious line on Middelhoff's "deal of our lifetime"--the planned
flotation of the group by the middle of the decade.</TE>
<TE>   While the group was sticking to an accord with Groupe Bruxelles
Lambert, under which the Belgian investment group has the option of
listing its 25% stake in Bertelsmann, he ruled out any further
listing, ensuring the continued dominance of the Mohn family who
control the remaining 75%.</TE>
<TE>   And although Bertelsmann's finances are nowhere near the strained
levels of rivals such as Vivendi Universal, there was also little
doubt he had less appetite for debt than his predecessor. Noting that
Bertelsmann had overstepped "strict debt limits that we have set
ourselves," Thielen pledged a period of consolidation and focus on
core businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We intend to reduce this debt in a short-term consolidation
phase--without retreating into a backwards looking cost-saving plan,"
he told employees.</TE>

<HD>Burst of Buying Lifts Blue Chips</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: S&amp;P 500 maintains winning streak; the Dow
gains nearly 57 points. Bond yields fall on evidence of slowing
recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A wave of buying in the final hour of trading Wednesday lifted
blue-chip indexes, giving the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 its longest
winning streak since December.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, Treasury bond yields tumbled as fresh data on the
economy suggest the pace of the recovery is slowing.</LD>
<LD>   The broader market was mixed, but many analysts said the day's
action gave more weight to the argument that stocks have stabilized
after the devastating decline of the last 10 weeks.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrials closed with a gain of 56.56 points, or
0.7%, at 8,736.59, rebounding from a drop of as much as 143 points.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 added 8.84 points, or 1%, to 911.62, its fourth
straight gain. The index hasn't risen for four consecutive sessions
since mid-December.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq composite rallied from its lows in the final hour but
still closed with a loss, off 15.93 points, or 1.2%, at 1,328.26.</TE>
<TE>   The government said gross domestic product grew at a 1.1% real
annualized rate in the second quarter, well below expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were encouraged by the market's relatively calm reaction
to the economic news. "The tone of the market is improving," said
Stephen Massocca, president of Pacific Growth Equities. "The economy
has slowed down, but I think people know we're not going back into
recession."</TE>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by 17 to 16 on the New York Stock Exchange,
though losers had a 20-to-14 edge on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow, which plummeted 2,651 points, or 26%, between May 17 and
July 23, has risen 1,034 points, or 13.4%, in the last six sessions,
as concerns over corporate financial scandals have abated, at least
for now.</TE>
<TE>   Some traders said the burst of buying late Wednesday may have been
the work of institutional investors rebalancing their portfolios on
the last day of the month.</TE>
<TE>   But if institutions were selling bonds to buy stocks, it didn't
hurt Treasury securities: Yields fell on the economic news.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the 10-year T-note sank to 4.46% from 4.59% on
Tuesday, even as the government confirmed it will sell $40 billion in
new notes next week to help fund the rising federal deficit.</TE>
<TE>   The two-year T-note yield plunged to 2.23% from 2.42%.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said the GDP report raised anew the possibility of
the Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark short-term rate, already at
a 40-year low of 1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   In currency trading the dollar fell against the yen but rallied
against the euro.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * The Dow was led higher by American Express, up $1.34 to $35.26;
Johnson &amp; Johnson, up $2.06 to $53; and Exxon Mobil, up $1.09 to
$36.76.</TE>
<TE>   * Food and beverage stocks attracted buyers. Coca-Cola gained
$1.79 to $49.94, Anheuser-Busch jumped $3.10 to $51.71 and Yum Brands
rose $1.33 to $30.90.</TE>
<TE>   * Brokerage stocks weakened. UBS fell $1.44 to $44.30, Merrill
Lynch lost 69 cents to $35.65 and Lehman Bros. slid 98 cents to
$56.71.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Charles Schwab fell 38 cents to $8.95 after Standard &amp;
Poor's cut Schwab's long-term debt rating to A-minus from A, citing a
"tough operating environment."</TE>
<TE>   * Among technology firms, IBM lost $1.39 to $70.40, Micron
Technology dropped $1.49 to $19.49 and Cisco Systems eased 15 cents
to $13.19.</TE>
<TE>   * Many investors continued to favor high-dividend stocks. Among
utilities, Consolidated Edison rose 75 cents to $42.85 and Southern
Co. gained 52 cents to $28.78. Among real estate investment trusts,
Weingarten Realty rose $1.18 to $37.10 and Arden Realty was up 43
cents to $25.98.</TE>
<TE>   * Brazil's beleaguered currency, the real, fell to another record
low, closing at 3.46 per dollar on rising concerns the nation may
default on its huge debt.</TE>
<TE>   But Brazil's main share index jumped 4.5% to 9,762.59 as investors
snapped up stocks of exporters that should benefit as the weaker
currency makes their products cheaper for foreign buyers.</TE>

<HD>Online Music Catalogs Lacking</HD>
<DH>Internet: Authorized services don't yet match the pirates'
breadth of selection, hampering major record labels' efforts to woo
customers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite a series of improvements that make legitimate online music
services more attractive, the major record labels still can't give
music fans something they've been getting from pirate services for
more than three years: a comprehensive catalog of songs.</LD>
<LD>   The latest example is the new version of Pressplay, the online
music venture jointly owned by Universal Music Group and Sony Music.
Due to be released today, the update lets consumers load an unlimited
number of songs onto their computers for a flat monthly fee--a first
for an online service backed by the major labels.</LD>
<LD>   But Pressplay's lineup, like that of every other authorized
service, has gaping holes. No Nirvana or Madonna hits. No Beatles or
Beach Boys.</LD>
<TE>   Some of those holes could be filled by signing more deals with
major record labels--Pressplay has Universal, Sony and EMI in its
fold, but not Warner Music Group or BMG. Other hurdles include
problems related to billing systems, publishing rights and the
refusal of a few stars to make their works available online.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at several labels and online services say more tracks
are becoming available every week. But some also said it will take
years for any authorized service to match the depth and breadth of
the selection on the most popular file-sharing services, which don't
pay copyright owners.</TE>
<TE>   Authorized services are far more restrictive than the free ones,
typically using electronic locks to limit movement of their songs.</TE>
<TE>   Over the year, the major labels have gradually lifted some of the
limits they've imposed on the authorized services. There's been a
focused effort in the last six months in particular to make those
services more successful, rather than worrying about how they might
eat into CD sales, said Sean Ryan, chief executive of online music
distributor Listen.com.</TE>
<TE>   The first signs came in December, when Pressplay announced that it
would allow subscribers to record a portion of their downloaded songs
onto CD. Later, EMI, Universal, Sony and Warner all disclosed plans
to let consumers burn CDs with more of the songs they obtain
legitimately.</TE>
<TE>   The new version of Pressplay lifts its previous limits on the
number of songs downloaded or played from its online jukebox. It also
takes a new approach to CD recording and portability, letting users
pay about $1 per track to burn CDs or move songs to selected digital
music players.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst P.J. McNealy of GartnerG2, a technology research and
consulting firm, said the new version of Pressplay is the first
compelling approach to online distribution he's seen. The incomplete
catalog, he said, is "the single biggest hurdle left."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bebel, Pressplay's chief executive, said the company expects
to have all five major companies on board by the end of the year.
Although the gaps in the catalog are frustrating, "everyone is
working in earnest to fix that problem," he said, noting that such
superstars as Bruce Springsteen have been added through these
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The main reason the online catalogs aren't complete, label
executives say, is that it takes time to win clearances from the
music publishers and establish new systems to track and account for
songs delivered digitally. But a number of top artists and those with
older contracts have to approve any online distribution, and some
have been reluctant to agree.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Cohen, vice president of new media for EMI, said he's been
trying to explain to artists that they need to give fans a legitimate
alternative to the pirate services--even if no one is making much
money yet from services such as Pressplay. Otherwise "it's creating a
mind-set that music is free."</TE>
<TE>   The problem for artists is that they have no idea what effect the
new services will have on CD sales and how much they should collect
from them, said Michael Hausman, an artist manager and co-founder of
United Musicians. "Until there's that kind of general understanding
about what artists are going to be paid, I think a lot of artists are
going to be uncomfortable with it."</TE>
<TE>   Some also question whether there's any point at all to supporting
services that have yet to click with consumers. "Piling everybody
into a car with no tires and an engine that malfunctions, we may have
everybody in the car, but it's not going anywhere," said Jim
Guerinot, whose Rebel Waltz management firm represents the Offspring
and No Doubt.</TE>

<HD>Report Buffett Is Buying Debt Boosts Qwest Bonds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc.'s bonds rose Wednesday after
a report that billionaire investor Warren Buffett has been buying
debt of the troubled Denver-based telephone company.</LD>
<LD>   Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway
Inc., has purchased hundreds of millions of dollars of Qwest debt in
recent weeks, CNBC reported, citing traders. The notes, which started
the year at about 98 cents on the dollar, have slumped amid falling
profit at the company and an investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission into its accounting investigation procedures.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes, it's possible, yes, it's reasonable, and yes, it's a
positive," said Joseph Galzerano, a high-yield debt analyst at CIBC
World Markets Corp., who has a "buy" rating on Qwest bonds.</LD>
<TE>   Berkshire Hathaway Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg declined
to comment, saying the company does not discuss its investment
portfolio. Qwest spokesman Steve Hammack said he couldn't confirm or
deny the report "because I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Qwest's 7.25% coupon notes maturing in 2011 rose 2.5 cents to 39
cents on the dollar, traders said. The company's shares closed at
$1.28, down 1 cent, on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as
high as $1.60 shortly after the television report.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are concerned about a potential loan default. Qwest,
which said it will restate results after misreporting sales for 1999
to 2001, has $22 billion of bonds outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett has purchased notes of both the Qwest Communications
holding company and its regulated operating subsidiary, Qwest Corp.,
CNBC reported.</TE>

<BD>Dow Jones/Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of graphic chip maker Nvidia Corp. plummeted 32%, setting a
new 52-week low the day after the Santa Clara company issued a steep
earnings warning for its fiscal second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Nvidia shares were down $5.15 to $11.07 on Nasdaq. Shares
surpassed the previous low of $14.30, set Friday. The stock has
fallen about 84% from its high of $72.66 in January.</LD>
<LD>   Nvidia, the biggest seller of chips and related products that
handle graphics on personal computers, had said it expected
second-quarter sales of $410 million to $430 million, lower than
analysts' expectations of $567.9 million, according to Thomson First
Call.</LD>
<TE>   The company also disclosed that it would have a "significant"
inventory write-down, which will result in the company being "at or
above" break-even.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts had expected the chip maker to earn 40 cents a share for
its fiscal second quarter ending Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Dress Code Keeps 9 Hells Angels Out of Fair in Ventura</HD>
<DH>Security: The new policy is enforced after biker club
members refuse to remove vests marked with group's insignia. Their
leader says he will sue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON and HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine Hells Angels were denied entry to the Ventura County Fair on
Wednesday evening after refusing to remove black leather vests
emblazoned with the trademark winged skull of their motorcycle club.</LD>
<LD>   Stopped at a side entrance, the bikers were told by a security
guard their clothing violated a fair policy that bans gang attire.</LD>
<LD>   The guard told George Christie Jr., president of the Ventura Hells
Angels chapter, and his associates that they would have to remove any
clothing bearing the name of their group to enter the fairgrounds.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to exercise my rights as a United States citizen,"
Christie responded. Holding up two tickets, for himself and the 9
1/2-year-old daughter of his fiancee, Christie asked, "You will not
accept these tickets?"</TE>
<TE>   Security guard Mike Priester then handed Christie a copy of the
fair's dress code policy and again told him he could not come through
the gate unless he removed the clothing bearing the Angels insignia.</TE>
<TE>   As he walked away from the fairgrounds, Christie called the policy
unconstitutional and said he will file a lawsuit challenging it.</TE>
<TE>   "I take offense," he said. "We are not a street gang, we are a
motorcycle club.... We are going to seek legal action."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura attorney Kay Duffy, who had walked with the Hells Angels
and a few of their family members from the group's nearby clubhouse
to the fairgrounds, said she had hoped fair organizers would back
down from the policy and allow the Angels inside.</TE>
<TE>   "The next step is the court system," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fair spokesman Devlin Raley said organizers had no choice but to
turn Christie and the others away.</TE>
<TE>   The dress policy aims to create a safe atmosphere for families to
enjoy the fair, said Raley, adding that it will be enforced during
the 12-day fair that began Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "They chose not to comply with the dress code. It was a challenge
of the policy and the policy was enforced," Raley said, adding that
the conversation with the Angels at the gate was peaceful.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned about gang violence, the fair board recently approved a
tighter policy on gang attire. The policy specifically prohibits
anyone wearing clothing, visible tattoos or other articles bearing
the name or insignia of a criminal street gang from entering the
fairgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   It does not ban the wearing of specific colors or sports team
logos unless clothing has been altered to symbolize a gang.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't prevent anyone from coming to the fair," Ventura
Police Lt. Ken Corney said this week. "You just can't be wearing gang
attire."</TE>
<TE>   The policy identifies 27 local groups as criminal street
gangs--including the Hells Angels and rival Mongols motorcycle clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Christie and lawyers representing the Hells Angels contend there
is no evidence the club meets the legal definition of a criminal
street gang.</TE>
<TE>   But police say recent convictions stemming from a massive
drug-and-racketeering case involving the Hells Angels prompted law
enforcement officials to deem the organization a criminal street
gang.</TE>
<TE>   Corney said revisions to the fair's decade-old dress code were
prompted by a recent appellate court decision in which justices in
Northern California found a similar dress code unconstitutional. The
ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by a Hells Angels member who was
denied entry to the Sonoma County Fair after refusing to remove a
vest emblazoned with the club name. The appellate court found the
dress code vague and overbroad.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Sonoma decision, Ventura lawyers and police say the new
policy is specific and are confident it would withstand a legal
challenge.</TE>

<HD>Dress Code Keeps 9 Hells Angels Out of Fair in Ventura</HD>
<DH>Security: New policy is enforced after biker club members
refuse to remove vests marked with group's insignia. Leader says he
will sue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON and HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nine Hells Angels were denied entry to the Ventura County Fair on
Wednesday evening after refusing to remove black leather vests
emblazoned with the trademark winged skull of their motorcycle club.</LD>
<LD>   Stopped at a side entrance, the bikers were told by a security
guard their clothing violated a fair policy that bans gang attire.</LD>
<LD>   The guard told George Christie Jr., president of the local Hells
Angels chapter, and his associates that they would have to remove any
clothing bearing the name of their group to enter the fairgrounds.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to exercise my rights as a United States citizen,"
Christie responded.</TE>
<TE>   Holding up two tickets, for himself and the 9 1/2-year-old
daughter of his fiancee, Christie asked, "You will not accept these
tickets?"</TE>
<TE>   Security guard Mike Priester then handed Christie a copy of the
fair's dress code policy and again told him he could not come through
the gate unless he removed the clothing bearing the Angels insignia.</TE>
<TE>   As he walked away from the fairgrounds, Christie called the policy
unconstitutional and said he will file a lawsuit challenging it.</TE>
<TE>   "I take offense," he said. "We are not a street gang, we are a
motorcycle club.... We are going to seek legal action."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura attorney Kay Duffy, who had walked with the Hells Angels
and a few of their family members from the group's nearby clubhouse
to the fairgrounds, said she had hoped fair organizers would back
down from the policy and allow the Angels inside.</TE>
<TE>   "The next step is the court system," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Fair spokesman Devlin Raley said organizers had no choice but to
turn Christie and company away.</TE>
<TE>   The dress policy aims to create a safe atmosphere for families to
enjoy the fair, said Raley, adding that it will be enforced during
the 12-day fair that began on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "They chose not to comply with the dress code. It was a challenge
of the policy and the policy was enforced," Raley said, adding that
the conversation with the Angels at the gate was peaceful.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned about gang violence, the fair board recently approved a
tighter policy on gang attire.</TE>
<TE>   The policy specifically prohibits anyone wearing clothing, visible
tattoos or other articles bearing the name or insignia of a criminal
street gang from entering the fairgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   It does not ban the wearing of specific colors or sports team
logos unless clothing has been altered to symbolize a gang.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't prevent anyone from coming to the fair," Ventura
Police Lt. Ken Corney said this week. "You just can't be wearing gang
attire."</TE>
<TE>   The policy identifies 27 local groups as criminal street
gangs--including the Hells Angels and the rival Mongols motorcycle
clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Christie and lawyers representing the Hells Angels contend there
is no evidence the club meets the legal definition of a criminal
street gang.</TE>
<TE>   But police say recent convictions stemming from a massive
drug-and-racketeering case involving Hells Angels members prompted
law enforcement officials to deem the organization a criminal street
gang.</TE>
<TE>   Corney said revisions to the fair's decade-old dress code were
prompted by a recent appellate court decision in which justices in
Northern California found a similar dress code unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by a Hells Angels member
who was denied entry to the Sonoma County Fair and Exposition after
refusing to remove a vest emblazoned with the club name.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate court found the dress code to be vague and
overbroad.</TE>
<TE>   The decision prompted Ventura County Fair officials to revisit
their dress code.</TE>
<TE>   A revised policy was crafted by the Ventura city attorney's office
and approved July 16.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Sonoma decision, Ventura lawyers and police say the new
policy is specific and are confident it would withstand a legal
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Corney said the original dress code was enacted more than a decade
ago in response to gang fights and has been successful in reducing
violence.</TE>
<TE>   This year law enforcement and fair officials have expressed
concern about potential violence between Hells Angels and Mongols
motorcycle clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen people were injured and three men killed during a shootout
between the groups at Harrah's Casino in Laughlin, Nev., earlier this
year.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the shootings, fair organizers say the dress code
will help ensure that violence between those groups and other gangs
does not occur during the fair.</TE>

<HD>Two Parrish Paintings Stolen From Gallery</HD>
<DH>Art: Thieves enter via roof to get works valued at nearly
$5 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pair of paintings valued at nearly $5 million were stolen from a
West Hollywood gallery by thieves who entered through the roof,
disabled motion sensors and alarms and cut the paintings out of their
frames, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The two paintings by Maxfield Parrish, the popular American
illustrator once referred to by Smithsonian magazine as "the common
man's Rembrandt," were stolen from the Edenhurst Gallery on Melrose
sometime between Saturday evening and Monday morning, said Sgt. Bruce
Thomas of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   The thieves did a professional job, authorities said, sliding down
from the roof with ropes or temporary ladders, disabling the alarm
system and escaping the same way, sneaking back out with the probably
rolled-up paintings, which measure 5 by 6 feet.</LD>
<TE>   The paintings were part of a series of oil on canvas panels
created for a room in the Long Island estate of Gertrude Vanderbilt
Whitney, said Maria Gilbert, whose mother, Alma Gilbert, once had the
works in her gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Named Panel 3A and 3B, they depict two couples and an urn set
against the backdrop of Colorado mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "They're nearly national treasures," said Houston-based art
collector J.P. Bryan, who was offering them for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Philadelphia in 1870, Parrish lived much of his life in
New Hampshire, and was known for his dreamy pictures filled with
lush, intense color.</TE>
<TE>   Carting the paintings away would have been no easy task, said Alma
Gilbert, curator of the Cornish Colony Museum in New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   "This is unprecedented; you would need a moving truck and four
people," Gilbert said.</TE>

<HD>4 Took 5th in Beating Probe</HD>
<DH>Grand jury: Judge agreed that two Inglewood officers and
two deputies risked incriminating themselves. So D.A.'s office
granted immunity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors were forced to give immunity to four law enforcement
officers in order to get them to testify before the Los Angeles
County Grand Jury about the videotaped beating of 16-year-old Donovan
Jackson, a transcript and interviews show.</LD>
<LD>   The statements contained in the 450-page transcript could benefit
both sides if the case of two Inglewood officers goes to trial,
experts said.</LD>
<LD>   Inglewood Officer Jeremy J. Morse has been indicted on a charge of
assault under the color of authority for the beating of Jackson.
Morse's partner, Bijan Darvish, was charged with filing a false
police report because he failed to include an account of Morse
slamming Jackson against the trunk of a patrol car. Neither Morse nor
Darvish testified before the grand jury.</LD>
<TE>   At trial, prosecutors would be likely to emphasize the immunized
officers' statements that Jackson had stopped resisting once he was
handcuffed--before Morse slammed the teenager against the car.
Moreover, after being shown the videotape, the two Inglewood officers
granted immunity testified that Morse's actions were inconsistent
with police policy.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, however, were already emphasizing another part
of the testimony: that some of the officers knew they were being
videotaped both by a citizen and a surveillance camera.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a preposterous notion to think that an officer would write a
false police report knowing that there were two independent films,"
said Darvish's attorney, Ron Brower.</TE>
<TE>   He said his client was looking away when Jackson was placed on the
patrol car, adding that the grand jury transcript shows that Darvish
was not the only one who said he did not see what was caught on
videotape.</TE>
<TE>   Morse's attorney, John Barnett, said there were many points in the
transcript that support his case. Referring to the officers' comments
that his client violated policy, he said they did not have all the
facts.</TE>
<TE>   "The officers are not use-of-force experts," he said. "If
use-of-force experts testify and look at both tapes, then their
opinion will be, and is, that the use of force was appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers also may stress that none of the four officers
testified that they actually saw Morse throw Jackson against the car
and that only one witnessed him punch the boy in the face.</TE>
<TE>   When Inglewood Officers Mariano Salcedo and Antoine Crook and
county sheriff's deputies Carlos Lopez and Daniel Leon were called to
testify, each invoked his 5th Amendment right against
self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   After holding a hearing on the issue, Superior Court Judge Dan Oki
ruled that the four officers did risk incriminating themselves by
testifying about their involvement in the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Based on that, prosecutors granted them immunity, meaning they are
essentially protected from criminal charges arising from the fracas.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began when the two sheriff's deputies approached
Jackson's father, Coby Chavis, to investigate expired registration
tags on his car.</TE>
<TE>   A struggle ensued after Jackson allegedly refused to obey several
orders by deputies, according to the transcript. Darvish struck
Jackson in the face before the teenager was handcuffed, the
transcript said.</TE>
<TE>   'No Longer a Threat'</TE>
<TE>   The immunized officers told grand jurors that Jackson stopped
resisting as soon as he was on the ground and handcuffed. Salcedo
said Jackson's legs went limp, and Crook said, "He was no longer a
threat."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson told grand jurors that he had passed out by then after
being choked and pummeled by officers. His father also testified that
his son became unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   The videotape of the incident shot by a bystander, Mitchell
Crooks, shows Morse lifting a handcuffed Jackson off the ground and
slamming him onto the police car.</TE>
<TE>   Salcedo told grand jurors that he heard a thump--presumably the
sound of the slamming--and saw Morse with Jackson on the police car.</TE>
<TE>   A moment later, Salcedo testified, he heard the officer yell, "Let
me go, let me go" and "flinch back with his hips." That could bolster
Morse's contention that Jackson grabbed him in the groin.</TE>
<TE>   One Says He Saw Punch</TE>
<TE>   Salcedo was the only one of the four officer witnesses who
testified that he then witnessed Morse punch Jackson. Afterward, he
said, he restrained Morse to de-escalate the situation.</TE>
<TE>   The other officers told grand jurors that they saw neither the
punch nor the slamming.</TE>
<TE>   During the grand jury proceedings, Salcedo and Crook both watched
the video and said Morse's conduct was not acceptable police policy
or behavior. Crook testified about the slamming: "We weren't taught
to do that as policy.... We are only taught to place people in cars."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Carolyn Kubota, a former federal prosecutor,
said the testimony by Salcedo and Crook could help prove the
prosecution case because "police policy is the guideline for officers
to use to determine appropriate action."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors may also use that testimony to show that police policy
does not permit continued use of force after the suspect quits
resisting.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Law School professor Stan Goldman, however, said he does
not think prosecutors gained much from the officers' testimony other
than getting them on the record. "The grand jury probably would have
indicted them just on the videotape and Jackson's testimony," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman also said defense lawyers will be able to attack Jackson's
testimony that he passed out. "Isn't it convenient to say you are
unconscious just at the moment when Officer Morse is saying you are
grabbing his crotch?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys said the transcript casts doubt on Jackson's
truthfulness. Jackson said he obeyed all of the officers' orders,
though the officers testified that the boy lunged at them. Barnett
said Jackson's testimony contradicted his family's statements that he
did not understand the officers' orders because he is developmentally
disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett added that Jackson continued to resist officers after
being handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as [Morse] picked Jackson up and [Jackson] refused to
walk, that's a form of resistance," he said. Morse could have feared
that the resistance would resume after Jackson was handcuffed,
Barnett said. "The testicle grabbing could support that."</TE>

<HD>A New Focus on Dumping</HD>
<DH>Blight: L.A. officials are placing special cameras in
alleys and other spots where junk frequently is discarded. Lynwood
uses similar cameras to deter taggers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Instead of brooms and bulldozers, city officials hope a motion-sensor
camera and a recorded message will be enough to keep clean a Watts
alley normally blocked by discarded junk.</LD>
<LD>   The camera, mounted on a power pole in the alley near Wilmington
Avenue and 110th Street, is the first of 11 such cameras that will be
installed in alleys and near abandoned buildings throughout South Los
Angeles, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   As a photo is taken, the camera plays a recorded warning. "Stop!
This is the LAPD ....We have just taken your photograph. We will use
this photograph to prosecute you. Leave now."</LD>
<TE>   Similar cameras have been installed in other Los Angeles-area
neighborhoods, including San Pedro, Rampart and Hollywood. The Watts
cameras are thought to be the first paid for with money won from a
settlement against a "nuisance property" owner.</TE>
<TE>   The city attorney's office bought the battery-powered watchdogs,
each costing about $3,500, using money from Homeside Lending Inc.,
which owned a dilapidated house a block away.</TE>
<TE>   The cameras, which will be maintained by Los Angeles Police
Department senior lead officers, are viewed more as a deterrent than
as a prosecutorial tool, Deputy City Atty. Kevin Gilligan said. The
steel-encased camera is designed to catch any movement in the alley
within 100 feet. The images may include taggers and trash dumpers,
but it will also probably snap shots of dogs, cars and people just
passing through.</TE>
<TE>   Five similar cameras will be placed in other South Los Angeles
alleys to catch and deter illegal trash dumping and graffiti; seven
cameras will be mounted near vacant buildings to discourage
squatters.</TE>
<TE>   Lynwood's seven cameras have been monitoring trouble spots for
about a year and "are such a great deterrent, [taggers] don't even
get to the wall," Sheriff's Deputy J.D. Del Gadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Del Gadillo said the motion sensor has been timed so that the
cameras snap photos only of people who linger near a wall, not of
passersby.</TE>
<TE>   No one has been prosecuted in Lynwood with photos from the
cameras, he said. In Los Angeles, illegal dumpers and taggers could
face misdemeanor charges that can carry a six-month jail sentence and
a $1,000 fine per crime.</TE>
<TE>   Those images are admissible in court, UCLA law professor Peter
Arenella said, but their value would be limited. "The nature of the
incriminating evidence is somewhat suspect," he said</TE>
<TE>   Arenella said that because the cameras are mounted in public
places, there is no reasonable expectation for privacy, and that
criminals would either go elsewhere or find ways to disable the
cameras.</TE>
<TE>   The Q-Star Flashcam 530 mounted in the Watts alley is designed to
withstand a shot from a 9-millimeter handgun and is mounted so high
off the ground that police officers will need to bring a ladder to
retrieve the film.</TE>
<TE>   Each senior lead officer will carry a tiny remote control, similar
to the remote entry controls for cars, that can activate or
deactivate the camera from the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Isabel Castanon lives directly across the alley on 110th Street.
In recent years, she said, illegal dumpers have left couches, broken
televisions, even dead dogs in the alley.</TE>
<TE>   People continue to dump junk there, even after the alley has been
cleaned up.</TE>
<TE>   "By the next day," Castanon said, "we start finding all kinds of
trash."</TE>
<TE>   Once a month, a crew cleans the alley, filling up at least one
20-cubic-yard dump truck, said Bruce Howell, who oversees the
Department of Public Works' alley cleaning crews.</TE>
<TE>   He said that many alleys in Watts and South Los Angeles fill four
dump trucks each time they are cleaned.</TE>
<TE>   This year, crews have picked up more than 17,000 cubic yards of
trash from similar sites in Watts, Howell said, more than 800 full
dump trucks.</TE>

<HD>8 Auto Fraud Suspects Arrested in Sting Operation</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Twelve law enforcement agencies worked four
months on the probe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight people were arrested Wednesday after they allegedly tried to
change vehicle identification numbers and buy phony DMV registration
documents from undercover police officers during a sting operation,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests capped a four-month investigation by the district
attorney's Orange County auto-theft task force, which worked with
officers from 12 law enforcement agencies in Los Angeles and Orange
counties.</LD>
<LD>   Arrested were Eric Huerta, 28, of Costa Mesa; his mother,
Margarita Garcia Huerta, 54, of Lakewood; his sister Jennifer Emma
Huerta, 22, of Lakewood; Chad Nakosone, 29, of Irvine; Sean Michael
Brantley, 31, of Mission Viejo; Oscar Sanchez, 32, of Costa Mesa;
Alexander Paleo, 20; and Christian Sanchez, 26, of Hawthorne. They
are being held at Santa Ana Jail on suspicion of grand theft auto,
conspiracy and insurance fraud, among other charges.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Pete Pierce said it is unknown how long the
fraud ring had been operating or how many people were involved, but
more arrests will probably be made.</TE>
<TE>   He said members of the ring handed over their own cars to alleged
ringleaders Eric Huerta and Nakosone, who switched the VINs and
provided fake DMV records.</TE>
<TE>   "The members wouldn't report the cars stolen until after Huerta
does the information switches," Pierce said. That way, he said, they
got insurance money for the car while also reselling the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Nine late-model cars, which cost a total of about $500,000, were
turned over to police for VIN switching before the arrests were made.</TE>

<HD>Former Inmates Claim Violence</HD>
<DH>Jails: In legal filings, men say they were victims of
excessive force by deputies. They are seeking millions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Men's Central Jail inmate who said he was beaten by
sheriff's deputies after being stranded in a hallway on his way to
the shower when a cellblock was shut down because of a disturbance
has filed a claim with the county Board of Supervisors alleging
excessive force, his attorney said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Phillip McLachlan said at least seven deputies attacked him on
July 2 and struck him in the head about 14 times. McLachlan, 36, said
he was in the hallway wearing only underwear and shower slippers when
a riot broke out, closing his cellblock. Deputies told him to stand
facing a wall with his hands up and feet spread, he said.</LD>
<LD>   McLachlan's complaint states he complied but deputies beat him
with their fists. He was then ordered to get down on the ground. "As
I lay on the ground, one of the deputies came and hit me in the head
with a flashlight," McLachlan, who had been serving a nine-month
sentence for parole violations, said at a news conference Wednesday.
The blow left him unconscious, according to the complaint, and opened
a gash above his left eye.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials said Wednesday that they are looking into
McLachlan's claim and could not comment on the specific charges.</TE>
<TE>   County records show that McLachlan filed a $1-million claim with
the Board of Supervisors on July 24. Such claims are made prior to
the filing of lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Also on hand at the news conference was Marvin Ceasar, a former
County Jail inmate who filed a $5-million complaint in January
alleging that several deputies kicked him and hit him in the head in
October 2001 when he fell off a jail bus.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting with a black patch over his right eye, Ceasar, 37, told
reporters that he is blind and had trouble getting on and off the
bus. As the bus returned to Men's Central Jail from court, he said,
he was handcuffed and chained to other inmates. The inmate in front
of him fell, pulling Ceasar down.</TE>
<TE>   Ceasar's complaint states he fell off the bus onto the parking lot
amid deputies shouting, "You're not blind." He was kicked twice in
the back and three times in the leg, according to the claim.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies ordered him to get up, and when he didn't, he was kicked
in the face, Ceasar said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials said they could not comment on Ceasar's
charges, which remain unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Wilson, the attorney for the two men and founder of the
Civil Justice Foundation, said she decided to publicize her clients'
stories in light of the recent beating incident of a 16-year-old in
Inglewood that has resulted in criminal indictments against two
Inglewood police officers.</TE>

<HD>Beloved Father, Salad Chef Killed</HD>
<DH>Crash: A car swerves into young restaurant worker waiting
at a bus stop. The driver is in jail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rafael Lopez Hernandez worked long days as a salad chef in a Beverly
Hills restaurant, often catching the bus near midnight to return home
to his wife and baby.</LD>
<LD>   It was his pattern, but on Tuesday night, as he again stood at the
bus stop with a co-worker, a car careened toward them.</LD>
<LD>   Police don't know why Cloyd Pemberton, a contractor who lives six
blocks away, lost control of his car at Pico Boulevard and Beverly
Drive and swerved from the street, striking the 20-year-old chef.
Lopez died instantly. The car clipped the co-worker, demolished a
street light and crashed into an iron gate outside a delicatessen.</LD>
<TE>   Pemberton, 61, stumbled from the crumpled sedan and tried to run,
Officer Jack Richter of the Los Angeles Police Department said.
Witnesses stopped him, Richter said. Officers booked Pemberton on
suspicion of felony vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence.
Witnesses said he had been speeding on Pico when his vehicle veered,
Richter said.</TE>
<TE>   Ranolfo Mijangos, the co-worker from Islands restaurant who was at
the bus stop with Lopez, was treated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
for a leg injury.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Pemberton was being held on $51,984 bail. Police
said he had not been under the influence of alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   At Lopez's apartment, tears flowed. "Rafael was a good husband and
a good father. He didn't deserve this," said his brother-in-law,
Antonio Marcelo, 29.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's wife, Florina De Marcelo, steeled herself as she prepared
to go to the coroner's office to see the body of her husband of two
years. Their son, Victor Manuel, bounced on his mother's lap as a
Spanish-language music video played on television.</TE>
<TE>   "His father used to dance with him to the videos," said a sobbing
De Marcelo. "That's why the baby likes to dance when he hears music
... I loved him. I loved everything about him."</TE>
<TE>   The couple met three years ago at an adult school where they
studied English. Lopez especially wanted to learn the English words
for the ingredients he used at work.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, Lopez told a co-worker at the West L.A. restaurant
where he then worked about his future plans: "He said he wanted to
work very, very hard--12 to 14 hours a day--for about two years. He
wanted to really save his money and go back to Oaxaca, to seek other
opportunities, to do something different," said chef Roberto Nava.</TE>
<TE>   In the month since he had been at Islands, Marcelo said, her
husband sometimes worked more than 12 hours a day. Workers there were
devastated by his death, said general manager Craig Redden. Donations
for Lopez's family were being left at the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   An account has been set up at Wells Fargo Bank, 8901 W. Pico
Blvd.,to help with burial, in the name of Beatriz Sanchez Reyes.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff's Deputies to Vote on New Contract</HD>
<DH>Labor: A union leader says Ventura County's offer is far
from ideal. It includes a raise but leaves out a disputed provision
on retirement pay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of Ventura County's deputy sheriff's union have agreed on a
tentative contract and are asking their 600 members to vote on it
this week, potentially ending months of bitter negotiations. The
multiyear contract includes a salary raise but leaves out a
controversial provision that would have allowed some deputies to earn
retirement pay nearly equal to their active wages.</LD>
<LD>   Officials on both sides declined to reveal details of the
tentative deal, saying they did not want to influence the balloting.</LD>
<LD>   But Glen Kitzmann, president of the Ventura County Deputy
Sheriffs' Assn., allowed that the contract includes an initial raise
sufficient to keep the salaries of deputies comparable to officer pay
in surrounding cities and counties.</LD>
<TE>   "We will have a contract that kind of keeps us at par at the
beginning. But at the end we will probably fall behind," Kitzmann
said, declining to specify how many years the contract covers.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies have until 6 p.m. Monday to vote on the labor agreement,
said Kitzmann. The results will be announced Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   County manager Johnny Johnston called the proposed pact a "fair
deal" that provides raises even as the county deals with the effect
of slashing $17 million from its current budget.</TE>
<TE>   County officials are also facing the prospect of closing medical
clinics and trimming other basic services if the state follows
through on a threat to cut funding to balance its own budget.</TE>
<TE>   "[The contract is] reasonable under the circumstances," Johnston
said. "It isn't everything they wanted, but it's the best we could
do."</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders had been pushing for pay hikes that automatically
kick in whenever the average pay in neighboring police agencies goes
up. But county negotiators had balkedat that, saying it takes away
the Board of Supervisors' control over pay.</TE>
<TE>   Annual deputy pay currently ranges from $42,000 for trainees to
$65,000 for a senior deputy.</TE>
<TE>   The bigger blow for the union, though, was giving up the fight for
an enhanced retirement benefit. Under the benefit, deputies would
have earned 3% of the value of their pay and benefits for every year
worked.</TE>
<TE>   That means that a 25-year senior deputy would have been able to
retire at age 50 and receive $66,000 annually as a pension--virtually
equal to his or her active wages. The current standard is 2% for each
year worked, or about $44,000.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies last year threatened to walk off the job after
supervisors held firm in refusing to grant the benefit. The deputies
eventually backed off.</TE>
<TE>   The union then spent $60,000 on a media campaign and
unsuccessfully targeted Supervisor Judy Mikels for defeat in last
spring's primary election. Deputies suffered another setback when a
Superior Court judge refused to allow the negotiations to proceed to
binding arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   The union had contended that a recently passed state law allowed
arbitrators to step in to settle disputes. Union leaders appealed the
court's decision, but Kitzmann said it could be years before a final
decision is made.</TE>
<TE>   That prospect, and the declining national economy, made union
leaders decide to take what they can get for now, Kitzmann said. But
it does not mean they are happy with what is being offered, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They may vote to approve, but they are not real happy with it,"
the union president said. "This is basically a Band-Aid on a gaping
wound."</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders outlined the contract for about a third of the
membership at a Monday meeting, Kitzmann said. Many voted on the
spot, but others will receive ballots in the mail, he said.</TE>

<HD>2 Supervisors Propose a Fifth Ballot Measure on El Toro
Planning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The airport may be dead, but two Orange County supervisors are
proposing one--and perhaps two--more ballot measures on the fate of
the former El Toro Marine base.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors Chuck Smith and Cynthia P. Coad said their idea is to
give the public the final word on how the site is developed.</LD>
<LD>   Voters last year approved Measure W, which rezoned the property
from an airport to a massive park. Since then, Irvine, which intends
to annex the land, has modified the park plan to include 3,400 homes
and 2.9 million square feet of office space.</LD>
<TE>   Smith and Coad believe that Irvine's plan should go before the
county's voters. So Tuesday they will ask the Board of Supervisors to
consider placing Measure B on the November ballot. The item would
require a countywide vote on any changes in development plans for El
Toro. If approved, it would set the stage for another measure
specifically on the Irvine plan.</TE>
<TE>   El Toro "is a countywide resource, and Irvine shouldn't be in the
driver's seat to change what voters approved," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Both Smith and Coad supported building an airport at El Toro--the
subject of a decade-long battle that ended last year with passage of
Measure W. Critics of the supervisors said Wednesday that their idea
for a fifth and perhaps sixth El Toro ballot measure is a desperate
attempt to derail Irvine's plan and perhaps keep the airport alive.</TE>
<TE>   "This is their last hurrah," anti-airport Supervisor Todd Spitzer
said. "I've got news for them: All the king's horses and all the
king's men aren't going to put an airport at El Toro back together."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's plan would set aside 4,000 acres--about 85% of the
available land at the former base--for sports fields, museums,
wildlife corridors and other public uses, in keeping with the city's
vision for a "Great Park." Development would be in clusters on the
remaining 738 acres of the site.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy plans to auction off the land in six parts to the highest
bidders. But, under Irvine's plan, whoever buys the properties would
have to turn over the land marked for public use as a condition of
purchase. They would also be required to fund the development and
maintenance of the park. The plan calls for the Navy to pay for the
cleanup of any hazardous waste remaining from military operations.</TE>
<TE>   Coad said voters should be made aware of the changes in the plan
and be allowed to voice their views.</TE>
<TE>   But others said there is no public interest in another ballot
measure. "Everybody that I hear from is content with the direction
Irvine and the Navy are going," said Len Kranser, an anti-airport
activist.</TE>

<HD>Family Comes In 1st Again</HD>
<DH>County fair: Stewarts of Simi Valley have been at the head
of the line on opening day for more than 20 years. The clan plans a
massive turnout next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN F. SHERRY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You have to get up pretty early in the morning to beat out the
Stewarts of Simi Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Once again, as has been the case for more than 20 years, a member
of the family has been the first in line to walk through the gates on
opening day of the Ventura County Fair.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, three generations of Stewarts--represented by four
family members and a friend--woke up at 6 a.m. to beat the crowds and
keep their streak intact.</LD>
<TE>   "They didn't want to take any chances," said patriarch Jim
Stewart, 55.</TE>
<TE>   The Stewarts started the line at Seaside Park at 9 a.m. and stood
there alone for about an hour. At 11 a.m., granddaughter Kaelie
Johnson, 4, helped cut the ribbon before heading straight for the
Lolly Swings.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, the Stewarts plan a full-on family blitz with 30 of
their clan storming the gates on opening day.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting older and it's getting harder to do this," Jim
Stewart said. "We want to make a big bang at least one year."</TE>
<TE>   As the morning haze burned off and the crowds downed their first
bites of fried dough, many wondered who would be the first to try the
newly added bungee jump. Down the midway, visitors could purchase
everything from hats to ceramic lawn ornaments.</TE>
<TE>   A water buffalo sat passively near the livestock pavilion, though
its horns were dwarfed by those on a pair of African Ankole Watusi
cattle, whose massive headgear resembled the handlebars of a
motorcycle.</TE>
<TE>   Near the stables and animal pens, breeders and caretakers gave
last-minute makeovers to their sheep and horses. The Budweiser
Dalmatian rolled lazily in the grass while some of the signature
Clydesdales received soapy showers.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Jessica Gaytan painted the hoofs of Galeno, her chestnut
Andalusian horse. The black polish helps give the hoofs a visual pop
during competition.</TE>
<TE>   Gaytan and her grandfather, Ventura County native Art Gaytan, had
been up since 6:30 a.m., bathing their two horses, working them in
the arena and then bathing them again.</TE>
<TE>   They shaved the horses' faces and removed stray hairs from their
ears in an effort to get "a highly polished, well-groomed and
manicured horse," Jessica Gaytan said.</TE>
<TE>   The Shadow Hills family has been working horses for more than 40
years, getting them used to the noise and commotion associated with
fairs. "We're just bombarding them with so much stimuli that it's no
big deal," Jessica Gaytan said.</TE>
<TE>   Anita Alfaro, a breeder from Spanish Eyes Ranch in Chino, also
hoped to impress the judges with her gray Andalusians. The breed,
originally bred to carry royalty, is known for its long manes and
tails, flashy movement and manageable temperament, Alfaro said.</TE>
<TE>   Every performance venue is different, so the horses need to be
ready for anything, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We basically do our training on the streets of Chino," Alfaro
said. "Look at all you've got going on here. You can't duplicate this
in your backyard."</TE>
<TE>   The fair ends Aug. 11.</TE>

<HD>4 Men Ordered to Trial on Rape Charges</HD>
<DH>Court: The suspects allegedly gave woman Ecstasy drug and
then sexually assaulted her in her Simi Valley home. Defense lawyers
say she consented.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four San Fernando Valley men were ordered Wednesday to stand trial on
criminal charges of drugging and raping an 18-year-old Simi Valley
college student.</LD>
<LD>   After a two-day preliminary hearing, Ventura County Superior Court
Judge Donald Coleman found there was sufficient evidence to hold the
men to answer charges of forcible gang rape, rape with the use of
drugs and related allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Coleman dismissed one count of robbery, agreeing with a defense
lawyer that there was no evidence the defendants entered the woman's
home with the intent to rob it.</LD>
<TE>   Brian Jafari, Yan Karim and Jeffrey Pineda, all 20, and Dejon Lee,
22, were ordered back to court Aug. 14. Jafari is from Studio City
and the other three are from North Hollywood. If convicted, each
could spend more than 40 years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, Pineda knew the alleged victim and
on Jan. 11 arrived with his three friends at the Simi Valley house
where she rented a room. The woman let them into the house, where
they drank some alcohol before going to her bedroom to watch
television.</TE>
<TE>   The woman testified that she quickly began to feel weak and
blacked out as someone started to undress her.</TE>
<TE>   She said she awoke 30 minutes later to find two men sexually
assaulting her.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, the woman said she never consented to taking
drugs or having sex with the men.</TE>
<TE>   According to testimony, a urine sample taken from the woman after
the alleged rape tested positive for the drug Ecstasy. Police said
six pills of the drug were found in a car in which the defendants
were riding that night.</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, defense lawyers challenged the woman's story
and tried to show that the sex was consensual.</TE>
<TE>   After Wednesday's hearing, Los Angeles attorney Richard M. Sudar
said statements by the woman have been inconsistent and raise issues
about her credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she is going to have a very difficult time at trial,"
said Sudar, who represents Lee. "Her story keeps changing."</TE>
<TE>   A relative of one of the defendants said after the hearing that
they are innocent of the charges and will be exonerated at trial.</TE>
<TE>   But Ventura County Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. David M. Lehr said
the prosecution's case is strong.</TE>
<TE>   Lehr said he intends to try the men separately to use their
statements to police against each other.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants remain free on $250,000 bail each.</TE>

<HD>Not Guilty Plea in 1989 Slaying</HD>
<DH>Crime: Defendant's DNA was found on cigarette butts at
ex-girlfriend's home, authorities say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA L. ESPARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Riverside County man accused of killing his former girlfriend 13
years ago pleaded not guilty to the crime Wednesday in a Whittier
courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   Arturo Johannas Gutierrez, 41, of Perris was arrested on suspicion
of murder July 10 in the 1989 suffocation death of his high school
sweetheart, Whittier resident Christie Lee Fleming, 25. DNA on
cigarette butts left in her condominium, where her body was found,
match Gutierrez's, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   A warrant was issued in 1993 to draw blood from Gutierrez for DNA
testing, and although the DNA matched, it also matched 10,750 people
of Latino descent, Gutierrez's arrest warrant states. With a more
technologically advanced DNA test, Gutierrez's blood, along with
Fleming's and three other of her acquaintances, was tested in March.
The test concluded that the cigarette butts contained DNA belonging
to Gutierrez, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's still like it's not real to me," said Rhonda Davis,
Fleming's sister. "She had so much going for her. She had her life
completely in order.... She was in the prime of her life."</TE>
<TE>   On May 13, 1989, Davis found her sister's body on the kitchen
floor of Fleming's condo, which she had bought six months earlier.
Davis went to the home after her sister failed to arrive for a
pre-Mother's Day breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   The condo was in disarray, inconsistent with Fleming's
housekeeping habits, Davis said, adding that "she was as neat as a
pin."</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez's arrest warrant states that Fleming was borderline
obsessive about both cleanliness and her personal security, leading
police to believe that she struggled with her attacker, whom they say
she knew.</TE>
<TE>   Her home had no signs of forced entry, the warrant states, and a
burnt-out cigarette butt on her kitchen counter and an intact
cigarette ash found on her bedroom floor "are in direct contrast to
the immaculate manner in which the victim kept her home.... The
condominium would not have been left in that state for an extended
period of time prior to the murder."</TE>
<TE>   The butt on the counter, along with three others in the trash can,
matched Gutierrez's DNA, according to the warrant.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez and Fleming had dated in high school, and resumed a
relationship in the months preceding the murder, said Bryan "Bud"
Fleming, the victim's father. She soon ended the relationship, the
elder Fleming said.</TE>
<TE>   He and Davis are hoping for an end to their 13-year quest for
justice. "I prayed every night, and I never thought [the arrest]
would happen," Davis said. "My prayer now is for a guilty verdict."</TE>

<HD>Daughter Testifies as Her Father Goes on Trial in 1984
Murder Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Man accused in two Antelope Valley slayings was
extradited from Mexico last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 22-year-old woman testified Wednesday that she heard gunshots, then
saw her father return home in a truck and hastily pack his clothes
before he vanished on the day two neighbors were slain 18 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Josephine Jurcoane was almost 4 the day authorities say her
father, Josif Jurcoane, fatally shot an Antelope Valley rancher and
the rancher's girlfriend. Lloyd William Bryden, 67, and Alice B.
McCannel, 39, were killed July 4, 1984.</LD>
<LD>   Immediately after the killings, Josif Jurcoane fled to Mexico,
where he lived for the next 17 years. He used the alias Jose Lopez
Rodriguez.</LD>
<TE>   At his murder trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court,
Jurcoane's daughter testified that she was at a picnic table outside
the family's trailer and her mother was preparing dinner when her
father got into a truck and drove off. Next, she recalled, she heard
gunshots and saw her father return home.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember him walking down the stairs with clothes in his hands
... he and my mother were arguing ... and [I remember] him leaving,"
Josephine Jurcoane said.</TE>
<TE>   She said she had no further contact with her father until he was
arrested in Mexico in April 2001 and returned to Los Angeles County
to await trial. She said she has visited him at the North County
Correctional Facility in Saugus, where he is being held without bail.</TE>
<TE>   Through tears, Josephine Jurcoane told jurors in the San Fernando
courtroom that she was overcome with emotion when she learned of her
father's arrest and extradition to the United States. "I didn't know
whether to defend him," she said. "I did not know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   In February or March of this year, Josephine Jurcoane provided Los
Angeles County sheriff's deputies with an account of some key events
on the day her neighbors were killed. She said it was the first time
she had given any statement to authorities about the crimes.</TE>
<TE>   After the daughter's testimony, Jurcoane's attorney, Arnold M.
Notkoff, told jurors during his opening statement that the evidence
against his client is "very circumstantial."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, prosecutors lost a bid to force Josif Jurcoane's
estranged wife, Susan, to testify against him at the preliminary
hearing. Despite their long separation, Susan invoked her marital
privilege. A state appellate court ruled in November that she could
not be compelled to testify about statements Jurcoane allegedly made
to her before he left the country.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, another prosecution witness, a Mexican immigration
official, testified that Jurcoane told her during his deportation
hearing that he fled to Tijuana because a man he called "El Loco"
used Jurcoane's 12-gauge shotgun to kill Bryden and McCannel.</TE>
<TE>   He said "he took his things to Tijuana because he was afraid that
he was going to be charged with the crimes," Sonia Luz Jimenez-Vargas
testified.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Bryden's daughter, Nancy Roebuck, said in court that her
father bought the 450-acre Mountain Brook Ranch in Valyermo, near
Palmdale, in 1964 and lived on the property until he was killed two
decades later. She said Jurcoane worked as a mechanic and helped
manage the ranch, with its cherry orchard, horses and alfalfa fields.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Rouman Ebrahim said Jurcoane and his family
lived on the ranch until around Memorial Day 1984, when Bryden fired
him and ordered him to move off the ranch. The Jurcoanes then moved
into a trailer on adjoining property.</TE>
<TE>   Jurcoane, 52, is charged with two counts of murder with the
special circumstance of multiple murders, and faces life in prison
without parole if convicted. Prosecutors agreed not to seek the death
penalty as a condition of Jurcoane's extradition from Mexico. Trial
testimony is set to continue Friday before Superior Court Judge Shari
K. Silver.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A retired Glendale judge denied that he should have disqualified
himself from two traffic cases involving friends of his former
campaign manager while he was on the bench, according to a document
filed Wednesday with the state's judicial discipline agency.</LD>
<LD>   James R. Simpson also denied, in his six-page answer to
disciplinary charges, that he improperly tried to influence two court
commissioners and a Glendale police officer to give favorable
treatment to friends while serving as a judge.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, the state Commission on Judicial Performance filed six
counts of ethics violations against Simpson, who, if found guilty of
misconduct, could be barred from handling cases as a temporary judge.</LD>
<TE>   Special masters appointed by the commission set a hearing date for
the case.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson denied all the allegations, including one that he violated
ethics rules when he recalled a bench warrant in 1995 for Allen
Brandstater, who had managed Simpson's judicial campaign a year
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also alleged that Simpson acted unethically when he
asked Commissioner Steven K. Lubell about a $135 citation for driving
an unregistered vehicle issued to one of Brandstater's friends.
Another allegation involved Simpson rescheduling a court date for
Brandstater's friend after she failed to show up in court to defend a
traffic ticket for allegedly running a red light in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson, 66, was granted disability retirement from the Los
Angeles County Superior Court in December. A former deputy district
attorney, Simpson was elected to the Glendale Municipal Court in 1994
and elevated to the Superior Court in January 2000 when the courts
were unified.</TE>

<HD>UC Hospital Capping Indigent Care</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Irvine facility says it can no longer handle
patient load, sets geographic boundaries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB and PHIL WILLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Irvine Medical Center officials today will begin referring some
poor patients to 24 other Orange County hospitals, saying the center
can no longer provide the bulk of medical care for the indigent.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new policy announced Wednesday by its chief executive
officer, Dr. Ralph Cygen, the medical center in Orange will turn away
poor patients who do not live within five miles of the hospital or
two miles of its satellite clinics in Anaheim and Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   Emergency care will still be provided, as will service to existing
patients, Cygen said. But new patients living outside UCI Medical
Center's service areas whose conditions aren't immediately
life-threatening will be referred elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a looming health care crisis in Orange County," said
Cygen, the latest in a long line of directors of the financially
troubled institution, which traditionally has been the main provider
of care for the poor in the county.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many people will be affected, or how soon. The
medical center will refer patients to other contracting hospitals or
to the county officials who administer indigent care funds.</TE>
<TE>   Patient advocates said they understand UCI's predicament and
reserved their criticism for county supervisors, who decide how much
money to spend on health care.</TE>
<TE>   "No one who's been a health advocate in Orange County for any
period of time would hold it against the university because they're
taking this step. They're doing more than their share," said Nancy
Rimsha, director of the Health Consumer Action Center at the Legal
Aid Society of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad called UCI's actions
unwarranted.</TE>
<TE>   "UCI was premature because we were making headway," she said. "UCI
thought we were at a stalemate, but we were not at a stalemate.... I
thought it could be worked out a different way."</TE>
<TE>   But Cygen said the medical center, which must build a costly new
facility to meet earthquake safety standards, is losing too much
money and jammed with too many poor patients to serve anyone properly
or meet the university hospital's teaching and research missions.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been going on now for almost 20 years; it has created a
crisis in the medical center and a crisis in the county," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cygen said the medical center was not reimbursed by the county for
$10 million to $11 million in hospital services and $2.5 million in
physician services in the fiscal year that ended June 30, and as much
as $200 million over the past two decades.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study of the county's Medical Services for the Indigent
program showed that with just 9% of the county's hospital beds, UCI
Medical Center provided 29% of all inpatient services among the 25
hospitals that contract with the county to provide MSI care in the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2000. And it provided 63% of all
outpatient services, several times more than the next-highest
provider.</TE>
<TE>   Medical center officials put the county Health Care Agency on
notice last year that it would not continue to serve indigent
patients unless more providers participated in the contract program.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, a task force of hospitals, the Orange County
Medical Assn. and the county Health Care Agency have met 20 times to
seek a solution, said David Riley, the county's MSI negotiator. One
of the issues that came up was the number of patients going to UCI,
Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   The medical center's action also is an emphatic statement that it
will not serve as the de facto county hospital for one of the three
urban counties in the state that do not have a county-run facility to
provide medical care for the poor. (The others are San Diego and
Sacramento.)</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will result in enough pressure that it'll work toward
finding a solution," Cygen said.</TE>
<TE>   The MSI program provides medical care for people ages 21 through
64 who make too much money to qualify for Medi-Cal, are not old
enough for Medicare. Often, that means working poor whose employers
do not provide health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Cygen said his medical center was forced to take such a dramatic
step because it can't afford the financial burden. He said several
specially recruited doctors had left the 215-bed teaching hospital
because they were overwhelmed with care of poor patients and had
little time to spend on research.</TE>
<TE>   UCI also found that more than 52% of the outpatients travel more
than 11 miles to the medical center or the clinics, bypassing one of
the 24 other county hospitals that are part of the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We've told the county it wasn't our intention to pull the rug out
from underneath the system or the patients," Cygen said. "But we want
everyone to do their fair share."</TE>
<TE>   Rimsha, of Legal Aid, said that along with being underfunded, the
MSI program is fraught with baffling bureaucratic rules that in many
cases impede proper care and keep many doctors from participating.</TE>
<TE>   "Under MSI, if you have cataracts, they will operate on only one
eye," she said. "They won't pay for the other one."</TE>
<TE>   Felix Schwarz, executive director of the Health Care Council of
Orange County, a patient advocacy group in Orange, said that for
every $1 Orange County spends per capita on health care, San
Francisco spends $10.</TE>
<TE>   "The Orange County Board of Supervisors are congratulating
themselves on their fiscal acumen for not having a county hospital,"
he said . "Unfortunately, the poor and the middle class are the
people who are suffering."</TE>
<TE>   Riley countered that in the past two years the county has
increased funding of the MSI program by a total of $5 million, to $47
million. This year, he said, the health agency's budget has been cut
$14 million because of state budget shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>   He said the county has been negotiating with three or four
hospitals near UCI to reserve beds for indigent patients, in
anticipation of the medical center's move. He would not name the
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the county expects to install a new case-management
program to approve care beforehand, on the model of a health
maintenance organization. He said he expected the changes to be in
place in the fall. UCI officials said they have provided services
only to learn later that there would be no reimbursement.</TE>
<TE>   UCI Medical Center's contract with the county ends Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County also is struggling with how to pay for treating
the uninsured. It has a network of public hospitals that care for
patients from across the region, but, facing an $800-million overall
health care deficit, is considering limiting services.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to limit the impact of what they say are inevitable
medical care cuts, Los Angeles County supervisors this week placed on
the November ballot a $168-million parcel tax measure to preserve the
region's emergency health system.</TE>
<TE>   Of the roughly 800,000 patients treated in Los Angeles' six public
hospitals and dozens of clinics each year, roughly 75% have no
insurance, though almost all of those patients work or are related to
those who do.</TE>
<TE>   As UCI Medical Center has tried to transform itself from a county
hospital to a top-ranked teaching hospital, it has had several
brushes with financial disaster, often because of the cost of
indigent care.</TE>
<TE>   UCI officials have long complained about indigent patients being
sent there instead of to other hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as 1997, UCI was having discussions with private
companies about leasing the medical center.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven years ago, the medical center was in such straits that the
University of California threatened to close it. Orange County
supervisors came through with $3 million to cover care for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Two years before that, medical center officials said they were
threatened with bankruptcy because they were treating so many
indigent patients.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital began turning away women in labor because the
maternity ward was treating twice as many patients as its capacity.
Care for pregnant women is now covered under the state-funded Cal
Optima program.</TE>

<HD>UCI Medical Center Caps Indigent Care</HD>
<DH>Medicine: It draws boundaries for taking patients, saying
that providing more than its share of such services has hurt finances
and its teaching status.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Irvine Medical Center officials today will begin referring some
poor patients to 24 other Orange County hospitals, saying the center
can no longer provide the bulk of medical care for the indigent.</LD>
<LD>   Under the new policy announced Wednesday by its chief executive
officer, Dr. Ralph Cygen, the medical center in Orange will turn away
poor patients who do not live within five miles of the hospital or
two miles of its satellite clinics in Anaheim and Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   Emergency care will still be provided, as will service to existing
patients, Cygen said. But new patients living outside UCI Medical
Center's service areas whose conditions aren't immediately
life-threatening will be referred elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a looming health care crisis in Orange County," said
Cygen, the latest in a long line of directors of the financially
troubled institution, which traditionally has been the main provider
of care for the poor in the county.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many people will be affected, or how soon. The
medical center will refer patients to other contracting hospitals or
to the county officials who administer indigent care funds.</TE>
<TE>   Patient advocates said they understand UCI's predicament and
reserved their criticism for county supervisors, who decide how much
money to spend on health care.</TE>
<TE>   "No one who's been a health advocate in Orange County for any
period of time would hold it against the university because they're
taking this step. They're doing more than their share," said Nancy
Rimsha, director of the Health Consumer Action Center at the Legal
Aid Society of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad called UCI's actions
unwarranted.</TE>
<TE>   "UCI was premature because we were making headway," she said. "UCI
thought we were at a stalemate, but we were not at a stalemate.... I
thought it could be worked out a different way."</TE>
<TE>   But Cygen said the medical center, which must build a costly new
facility to meet earthquake safety standards, is losing too much
money and jammed with too many poor patients to serve anyone properly
or meet the university hospital's teaching and research missions.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been going on now for almost 20 years; it has created a
crisis in the medical center and a crisis in the county," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cygen said the medical center was not reimbursed by the county for
$10 million to $11 million in hospital services and $2.5 million in
physician services in the fiscal year that ended June 30, and as much
as $200 million over the past two decades.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study of the county's Medical Services for the Indigent
program showed that with just 9% of the county's hospital beds, UCI
Medical Center provided 29% of all inpatient services among the 25
hospitals that contract with the county to provide MSI care in the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2000. And it provided 63% of all
outpatient services, several times more than the next-highest
provider.</TE>
<TE>   Medical center officials put the county Health Care Agency on
notice last year that it would not continue to serve indigent
patients unless more providers participated in the contract program.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, a task force of hospitals, the Orange County
Medical Assn. and the county Health Care Agency have met 20 times to
seek a solution, said David Riley, the county's MSI negotiator. One
of the issues that came up was the number of patients going to UCI,
Riley said.</TE>
<TE>   The medical center's action also is an emphatic statement that it
will not serve as the de facto county hospital for one of the three
urban counties in the state that do not have a county-run facility to
provide medical care for the poor. (The others are San Diego and
Sacramento.)</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will result in enough pressure that it'll work toward
finding a solution," Cygen said.</TE>
<TE>   The MSI program provides medical care for people ages 21 through
64 who make too much money to qualify for Medi-Cal, are not old
enough for Medicare. Often, that means working poor whose employers
do not provide health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Cygen said his medical center was forced to take such a dramatic
step because it can't afford the financial burden. He said several
specially recruited doctors had left the 215-bed teaching hospital
because they were overwhelmed with care of poor patients and had
little time to spend on research.</TE>
<TE>   UCI also found that more than 52% of the outpatients travel more
than 11 miles to the medical center or the clinics, bypassing one of
the 24 other county hospitals that are part of the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We've told the county it wasn't our intention to pull the rug out
from underneath the system or the patients," Cygen said. "But we want
everyone to do their fair share."</TE>
<TE>   Rimsha, of Legal Aid, said the MSI program is also fraught with
baffling bureaucratic rules that in many cases impede proper care and
keep many doctors from participating.</TE>

<LD>Voters will have a chance Nov. 5 to stop a much-debated housing
development that would also bring the city its first public high
school in four decades.</LD>
<LD>   A referendum placed on the ballot Tuesday by the City Council
resulted from a petition drive that ended last week.</LD>
<LD>   The school was scheduled to open in September 2005 with Whispering
Hills, an adjacent 175-home development in the eastern foothills. But
a petition drive has placed the project on hold.</LD>
<TE>   Phil Schwartze, a former councilman who works for the developer
and is seeking a council seat in November, said opponents of the
project may spoil the city's opportunity to have its own high school.</TE>
<TE>   But the citizens group that sponsored the petition drive says the
project would have hurt the city by bringing crowding and traffic.</TE>

<HD>Schools to Get State Rewards for Boosting Test Scores</HD>
<DH>Education: Eighty-seven county campuses will receive a
total of $1.6 million. Funds had been in doubt because of budget
problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of schools across Southern California will soon receive
financial rewards for boosting scores on state achievement tests, an
unexpected windfall that has come as a pleasant surprise for many
cash-strapped campuses.</LD>
<LD>   In Ventura County, 87 schools will get a total of $1.6 million for
meeting the state's performance targets on exams taken in spring
2001.</LD>
<LD>   The payout comes months after schools were supposed to receive the
cash awards, promised as part of the governor's 3-year-old public
school accountability program.</LD>
<TE>   Budget woes in Sacramento forced education officials to halt
disbursement of reward funds in February--and called into question
whether the money would come at all.</TE>
<TE>   "We were under the impression there was no money coming, so it's a
great surprise," said John Wilber, principal at Fillmore High School,
which will get $25,000 for increasing its score by 51 points on an
academic index. "We were feeling really good about that, so it's nice
to get that recognition."</TE>
<TE>   Wilber said the money would probably be used to buy new math and
science textbooks, as more students in Fillmore, one of the county's
poorest areas, are registering for classes required for UC admission.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, 3,428 schools will receive $67.3 million in reward
money to spend on new teaching materials, technology and other
extras, Gov. Gray Davis' education secretary, Kerry Mazzoni,
announced this week.</TE>
<TE>   Most districts in Ventura County will receive at least one reward,
according to the state report. The largest chunk in the county will
go to Simi Valley Unified, where $202,988 will be distributed among
14 campuses.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout California, schools should receive checks by the end of
September, said Ann Bancroft, spokeswoman for the education
secretary.</TE>
<TE>   The bonuses amount to $36.88 per student tested. An additional $39
per student is proposed in Davis' budget, which is still being
debated in the Legislature, Bancroft said.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for the rewards, schools had to achieve a required
growth amount on the Academic Performance Index for their campus
enrollment. The index represents a public ranking of schools based on
test scores.</TE>
<TE>   Schools also had to meet growth targets for specific groups of
students, including children from low-income homes and from various
ethnic groups, said Bill Padia, director of the policy and evaluation
division in the state education office. Although the money that
schools will receive this year is much less than initially promised,
administrators said they understand the state's budget crisis and are
happy to get something.</TE>
<TE>   "We're ecstatic to receive anything, really," said Tom McCoy,
principal at Oxnard's Hueneme High School, which will get the largest
reward in the county--about $71,800--for its campus of more than
2,500 students. "We thought we were going to have to tell students in
the fall that the award was cut."</TE>
<TE>   Because the funding is one-time money, it can't be used to hire
counselors or specialists--a critical need for many districts.</TE>
<TE>   That is one reason most said they aren't worried the rewards
program was not reinstituted this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working just as hard this summer as we have the summer
before--we're working harder than ever," said Wilber of Fillmore
High. "We're not geared to the reward money. We're figuring out how
to get kids to graduate."</TE>

<DH>Funds: Secession backers say midyear tally doesn't show the

<DL></DL>
<LD>The political campaign for San Fernando Valley cityhood had raised
about $75,500 as of June 30, a fraction of the nearly $2 million
collected by Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession drive, according to
a disclosure statement filed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Valley secessionists said they also have received about
$275,000 since July 1, though they declined to provide details. They
said that money will be included on a disclosure report to be filed
in October.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the Valley secession funds raised as of June 30 came from
two sources: $50,000 from Hollywood cityhood leader Gene La Pietra
and $10,000 from Lodwrick Cook, co-chairman of the beleaguered Global
Crossing Ltd.</LD>
<TE>   Valley and Hollywood secession measures are on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley secessionists said they have pledges of about $250,000
in additional contributions and will have a well-funded campaign,
though it will depend largely on grass-roots efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "We are certainly the little guys in this battle against City Hall
special interests," said Jeff Brain, president of Valley VOTE.
"However, we are not as little as some people would like to suggest."</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders said the law does not require them to disclose
contributions to the city Ethics Commission, but that they did so in
the interest of informing the public.</TE>
<TE>   The state disclosure law, they said, applies only to money raised
after the secession proposal was formally placed on the ballot, which
was last week.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's anti-secession campaign released its list of contributions
July 25. It showed that much of the $1.9 million came from corporate
interests and individuals with business before the city.</TE>
<TE>   Other contributions to the Valley cityhood campaign as of June 30
include $5,000 from D &amp; G Escrow, $2,500 from Valley Independence
Committee Co-Chairman Richard Katz and $2,000 from Administrative
Resource Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign also received $1,000 each from Horace Heidt,
president of Horace Heidt Estates; Ellen Fitzmaurice, owner of
MindWorx; and Harvey Berg, vice president of ACI Billing Services
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   All other donations were under $1,000, including $100 from Brain
and $500 from the law firm of Gilchrist &amp; Rutter, of which Valley
VOTE Chairman Richard Close is a member.</TE>
<TE>   Noticeably absent from the roster of contributors are Bert
Boeckmann, owner of Galpin Motors in North Hills, and Studio City
attorney David Fleming, the secession movement's top benefactors in
the past. The campaign, however, said Fleming has committed to
raising or contributing at least $200,000. Brain said he believed
Boeckmann also would play some role in fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Among other pledges, the committee said the campaign
co-chairpersons, Richard Katz and Laurette Healey, have agreed to
raise $100,000 each, as has Brain.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-secessionists criticized the Valley campaign for relying on
La Pietra for most of its initial money. They said they will make La
Pietra's past an issue; the Hollywood nightclub owner was convicted
in the 1970s on state and federal obscenity charges for selling
sexually explicit movies and books.</TE>
<TE>   "Gene La Pietra has nothing to do with the Valley," said Larry
Levine, head of the anti-secession group One Los Angeles. "And given
Mr. La Pietra's background, I don't think the Valley wants those
kinds of people financing their secession movement."</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra said that his nightclubs are legitimate businesses, and
that he contributed to the Valley movement because as it goes, so
goes Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "It is one people, one movement, one outcome," La Pietra said.</TE>
<TE>   His company, Bookcity News Inc., which started out owning an adult
bookstore in Hawaiian Gardens in the 1970s but now runs the
nightclubs, gave $30 separately to the Valley campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Cook's Global Crossing is under federal investigation for its
accounting practices. The firm filed for bankruptcy protection Jan.
28. Cook, a Valley resident and also vice chairman of Pacific Capital
Group, could not be reached for comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Katz, co-chairman of the Valley campaign committee, said
it was "very pleased" with the sources and amount of contributions.
Altogether, it has received donations and pledges from 200 people.</TE>
<TE>   The secession leaders initially predicted they would raise up to
$4 million to compete with the $5 million that Hahn plans to collect.
Some observers were surprised by the comparatively small amount
banked by the secessionists so far.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes them appear to be a paper tiger," said Fernando Guerra,
director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola
Marymount University. "They will have a difficult time matching Hahn
in spending."</TE>
<TE>   Brain, however, said the campaign's spending will be complemented
by that of candidates for 14 city council seats and the mayor's post
in a Valley city. The election for the council and mayoral seats are
on the same ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Valley cityhood backers continued to refuse to
fully disclose the sources of more than $500,000 in contributions to
nonprofit Valley VOTE in the last four years. They said the state
disclosure law does not apply to Valley VOTE.</TE>
<TE>   The group has only disclosed that in 1998--when it launched the
petition drive that led to the secession ballot measure--its leading
contributors were the Daily News, Boeckmann and Fleming.</TE>
<TE>   In its last state tax filing, for 2000, Valley VOTE reported that
its loan debts included $25,000 to Boeckmann's Galpin Motors Inc. and
$40,000 to Fleming.</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, Hahn's political advisor, said all of Valley VOTE's
finances should be disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "What do they have to hide?" he asked.</TE>

<DH>Services: Legwork in Burbank shows a small city has better
roads, except when it doesn't.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES RICCI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruce Feng, determined to be fair to Los Angeles, pulls his City of
Burbank van to a stop where Clybourn Avenue dead-ends at the
eastbound Ventura Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   For more than five miles, the boundary between L.A. and Burbank
runs down the middle of Clybourn, the main drivable street shared by
the two cities. Feng, Burbank's public works director, wants to point
out a spot where L.A.'s portion of the road is better maintained.</LD>
<LD>   "On our side, you can see the asphalt's got what we call alligator
cracking, whereas the L.A. part is very smooth."</LD>
<TE>   Feng falls silent. His engineer's eyes have fallen on a couple of
unexpected infrastructural anomalies just inside the North Hollywood
section of the larger city.</TE>
<TE>   "Oops," he says. "Looks like they've got a pothole on L.A.'s side.
And I see a gutter there that's too low and collecting water. Also,
this big asphalt patch is asymmetrical, and it should be squared off
because that holds better."</TE>
<TE>   "OK," he concedes, "maybe you can't find a stretch where L.A.'s
better. It might be equal, but not better. But it's really an
apples-and-oranges situation. It's not that L.A.'s doing a terrible
job, just that we're fortunate to be Burbank."</TE>
<TE>   Reputationally speaking, these are grand days for Burbank. Gone is
the notoriety the city endured a generation ago, thanks to the
disparagement visited on "beautiful downtown Burbank" by NBC's "Rowan
&amp; Martin's Laugh-In" and Johnny Carson's "The Tonight Show."</TE>
<TE>   Today, the debate over whether the San Fernando Valley should
secede from L.A. and form a separate city, an issue that will be
decided on the Nov. 5 ballot, has cast Burbank (and the adjacent city
of Glendale) in the most golden light. Secession leaders hail it as a
paragon of diligent civic stewardship and pudding-smooth roads,
beloved of its citizenry, visibly distinct from broken and graffitied
L.A. Everything, in short, that a new Valley city could become.</TE>
<TE>   As Valley secession leader Jeff Brain lamented at one recent
public meeting: "Why must there be a glass wall between North
Hollywood and Burbank?"</TE>
<TE>   The hosannas emanating from the secession debate have intensified
the pride Burbank's civic leaders take in their city. That pride
seems tempered, however, by a realization that overly extolling the
virtues of Burbank while its mammoth neighbor is undergoing such
painful domestic woes would be less than tactful.</TE>
<TE>   "The reasons Burbank is such a well-run city and looked to as an
example by others are, first, we have a tremendous economic base,"
says Mayor David Laurell, referring to the seven major entertainment
companies based there. "No. 2 is, we use it extremely prudently. And
the third element--the thing that secession proponents have to
remember--we are a small city, 17 square miles. We're a little over
100,000 residents. That is ... extremely manageable."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, a new Valley city would encompass about 211 square
miles and more than 1.3 million residents.</TE>
<TE>   "To think that if they move forward with secession, that
automatically they're going to wake up--what's one of the names
they're considering? Camelot?--and it's going to be Camelot or
nirvana or Shangri-La, well, it's simply not," Laurell says. "The
fact that Burbank is such a well-run city doesn't mean it doesn't
still have its problems. This is not Shangri-La. This is Burbank."</TE>
<TE>   When civic passions and rhetoric rise, inflamed perception often
obscures reality. Is there really a "glass wall" dividing L.A. and
Burbank? Can a traveler really tell immediately from the surroundings
that he or she has departed L.A. and passed into a more blessed
condition known as Burbank?</TE>
<TE>   Mostly no.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes yes.</TE>
<TE>   It depends where a person makes the crossing.</TE>
<TE>   A reality-seeker undertaking a slow drive of the Burbank-L.A.
border might begin on Clybourn from Lakeside Country Club, which is
along the L.A. River, and head north to Cohasset Street (Clybourn
accounts for about 5 1/2 of the roughly 6 1/2 miles of drivable
boundary between the two cities).</TE>
<TE>   The border then runs east for about a mile on Cohasset, which is
interrupted for much of its length by Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena
Airport. The remainder of Burbank's border with L.A. is a roadless
line through the Verdugo Mountains to the north. On the east and
south, Burbank is bordered by Glendale and the L.A. River, save for a
fragment of Griffith Park, which is in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   In general, the eastern side of Clybourn, Burbank's, doesn't look
markedly different from the western side, L.A.'s. With only a couple
of exceptions, housing stock seems in about equal repair (mostly good
to excellent).</TE>
<TE>   Burbank's road surface is overall somewhat smoother, and is devoid
of the potholes and upheaved sidewalk sections very occasionally to
be found on L.A.'s side. It also shows noticeably fewer incidences of
green fur growing in asphalt fissures.</TE>
<TE>   In some stretches, such as just north of Camarillo Street, the
L.A. side of Clybourn looks to be in even better shape than the
well-kept Burbank side. In a brief stretch north of the airport,
however, broken-down curbs and vigorously growing weeds mark the west
side, while the Burbank side is clean and clear. Similarly, near
Chermak Street, the L.A. side is momentarily embarrassed by some
gutter trash and an abandoned grocery cart, phenomena not seen on the
eastern side.</TE>
<TE>   If there is one place where the L.A.-Burbank dichotomy is most
profound, it is where Burbank Boulevard crosses Clybourn. In L.A.,
Burbank Boulevard is an earthquake in the suspension system of a car.
As soon as it crosses the intersection into Burbank, it becomes
smooth as glass.</TE>
<TE>   Not quite as bad--but bad--is the entry into Burbank on Magnolia
Boulevard, where the roadway in L.A. is half concrete and half
asphalt, with numerous bouncy seams and patches. The road surfaces
goes suddenly smooth at Cahuenga Boulevard--still in L.A.--and
continues in that condition after passing into Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the ledger, Camarillo Street in L.A. is a
perfectly level and sleek road that momentarily gets a little rougher
when it becomes Verdugo Avenue in Burbank (it smoothes again almost
immediately). And Riverside Drive is even smoother in L.A., as it
passes through the commercial center of the handsome Toluca Lake
area, than it is after entering Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   "When you add it all up, the physical difference, from an
infrastructure standpoint, isn't all that much," says Feng, the
public works director. "The difference is more our responsiveness. If
you've got a pothole, it'll be filled within 24 hours. We are able to
remove 85% of the graffiti we find within 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's not just roads and things like that. It's community
spirit. Community pride, civic pride--that's what makes this town
work. You could throw all the money you want at North Hollywood, but
without that community spirit .... "</TE>
<TE>   He shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "But we're not perfect, and we're not all that unique. You been to
Glendale? I mean, you could eat off the sidewalks there."</TE>

job of maintaining the 5 1/2 miles of Clybourn Avenue that they

<HD>Highway 395 Rolls Right Past Hubcap Heaven</HD>
<DH>The owner of the auto wrecking and parts store says her
collection includes about 200,000 of the wheel covers.</DH>

<LD>Not even "Hubcap Lucy," as Lucy Pearson likes to be known, can tell
you exactly how many hubcaps are stacked and strewn about
Pearsonville, Calif., the one-stop town she founded on a forlorn
stretch of U.S. 395. Her current estimate--200,000--reflects an
obsession that Andy, her late husband, once likened to madness.</LD>
<LD>   "He said, 'Jan, I've got to talk to you--the old lady's lost her
mind,' " their daughter Janice Pearson recalled. "He really thought
she had lost her mind because she was doing all this incredible
collecting of hubcaps."</LD>
<LD>   That was a quarter of a century ago. Hubcaps have been piling up
for 40 years now, and counting. They are, of course, the No. 1
commodity at the Pearsonville Auto Wrecking &amp; Hub Cap Store, where
Lucy, at age 75, tends the counter in her favorite blue floral
bonnet, hawking taillights and dashboard radios and styles of hubcaps
you're not likely to find anywhere else.</LD>
<TE>   Hanging above the cash register are half a dozen relics that have
been shined up and crafted into wall clocks. They go for $35 apiece,
about what you'd pay if you bought a hubcap--without the numerals--to
stick on the wheel of your old Chevy.</TE>
<TE>   There are hubcaps for Chargers, DeVilles, Falcons, Mustangs,
Rivieras and more. Spoked and plain rim, foreign and domestic, they
tower in the vast parts warehouse like empty pie tins--some coated
with dust, others immaculate in plastic packaging and bread bags. As
a leitmotif, hubcaps also provide a gleaming measure of distinction
for a town of junked cars and little else.</TE>
<TE>   Pearsonville sits on the east flank of the Sierra Nevada between
Ridgecrest and Lone Pine. Its most conspicuous landmarks are a gas
station, a dirt racetrack and a sign over a boarded-up cafe: EAT. It
might be a stretch to say 30 people live here, and they survive
without a grocery store, school, post office or restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Lucy's home sits in an oasis of trees across the highway from the
parts store. Hubcaps festoon her wire fence like bottle caps wedged
in the spokes of a bicycle. Whipping desert winds occasionally blow
them around. They dot the yard like crop circles.</TE>
<TE>   Janice remembers opening Mom's freezer one day and finding a
hubcap in there, too--a platter for burritos.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you imagine?"</TE>
<TE>   Lucy just about cackles. "This really is the hubcap capital of the
world," she said, repeating a slogan emblazoned on caps and T-shirts
and on the side of Pearsonville's lone water tank. Customers have
driven 200 miles just to buy hubcaps, she boasted. Pat Beckett of
North Hollywood-based Cinema Vehicles, which supplies cars to the
film industry, sought her out to scrounge up hubcaps for--of all
things--a 1974 AMC Gremlin.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think there were any of those left in the world,"
Beckett said. "She had enough to do three cars."</TE>
<TE>   Orders filter in from New York, Texas, Florida--practically
anywhere. After the Berlin Wall came down, a man in Germany paid $250
for a set of four to fit a 1953 Plymouth. Shipping cost him as much
as the hubcaps.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody loses a hubcap, they're sick till they find it," Lucy
said. "I've usually got them. It makes me feel good that I've got
them."</TE>
<TE>   She isn't crazy, just proud of her niche in the car culture. Savvy
as Cal Worthington, she is also as tough as the chrome on a '64
Caddie. This is a woman who, nevermind her age, races around the
desert washes in a new four-by-four.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't cross her," said son Don, who owns and operates the
Pearsonville wrecking yard and channels hubcaps directly to Mom.
"She's a redhead. She's got a little temper."</TE>
<TE>   How she got here, from the mountains of Kentucky, is a case study
in unquenchable spirit. At 16, she was engaged to be married, a
situation complicated by the fact that her father didn't know and she
longed to escape the hardships of canning and milking. At the last
minute she skirted the altar and fled to Dayton, Ohio, where her
sister was living, and found a job in a rifle factory.</TE>
<TE>   "I eloped by myself!" Lucy said, her voice rising shrill as a
schoolgirl's.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of years later, with World War II ending, her sister
raved about a young infantryman home with his head bandaged, arm in a
sling.</TE>
<TE>   Sight unseen, Lucy claimed him and proceeded to the men-only bar
where he was known to hang out. "I went in and got him," she said.
"I'd never seen him--I'd never seen him!"</TE>
<TE>   The courtship took two months. The marriage lasted 52 years, until
Andy Pearson died four years ago. They came to California when land
was cheap and bought 40 acres of desert for their wrecking yard.
"When we got here," said Don, who was a child then, "there was
nothing. Nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Home was a trailer. Crashed cars rolled in and Lucy demanded the
hubcaps. That's how it started.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen hubcap catalogs now fill her Navy-surplus desk, beneath
paintings of Andy and Lucy--and her hubcaps. She deals by fax and
computer. Her Web site, www.hubcapqueen.com, shows her waist-deep in
a sea of hubcaps, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   It's where she plans to be for "as long as I can put one foot in
front of the other," Lucy said. "Don said if I get disabled or
something, he'll get me a wheelchair and I can run up and down the
aisles ....</TE>
<TE>   "My hubcaps is my hobby. I talk to people and show them my
hubcaps."</TE>

<HD>Free Tax E-Filing System Defeated</HD>
<DH>Law: California and the IRS water down their plans under
pressure from tax-preparation industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California and the Internal Revenue Service have backed away from
giving taxpayers free computer tax filing, bowing to opposition from
private companies that make tax preparation software.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the tax collectors are compromising with the industry.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the IRS announced that it has struck an agreement
with a consortium of companies that typically charge a $10 to $30 fee
to file taxes electronically. The IRS will refrain from establishing
its own free online filing system. In exchange, the companies agree
to offer free filing to at least 60% of taxpayers, with the mechanics
to be worked out in coming months.</LD>
<TE>   In California, where Intuit Inc. has led the industry's effort by
hiring lobbyists and making targeted campaign contributions, the
private companies have successfully scuttled the Franchise Tax
Board's plans to offer a free, state-run Web site in which a computer
does a taxpayer's arithmetic.</TE>
<TE>   An industry-supported bill that would ban an interactive
state-sponsored electronic tax filing system is scheduled to be heard
before a Senate committee Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   At both the federal and state levels, the tax agencies say they
are simply trying to give people a quicker, easier way to file with
the government and eliminate long lines at the post office before
midnight on April 15.</TE>
<TE>   Makers of tax preparation software call the government effort
unwarranted competition.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect this [IRS] proposal will greatly increase electronic
tax filing," said Ed Black, president of the Computer &amp;
Communications Industry Assn., which represents software makers and
Internet and telecommunications companies. "A huge percentage of that
will be free and it will be done by companies that have already
invested a lot in making sophisticated, sharp, intelligent software."</TE>
<TE>   IRS Commissioner Charles O. Rossotti called it "another
significant step in the government's e-filing effort."</TE>
<TE>   The debate in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., is the same. Tax
agencies say they are not competing with private industry because
their free filing systems would provide only arithmetic capability
and a scan of tax tables, and would not advise people how to fill out
their returns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's basically a form with some links to some instructions that
does the math," said Harley Duncan, executive director of the
Federation of Tax Administrators. "It's not: 'Did you think about
deducting the steel-plated safety shoes?' "</TE>
<TE>   But the tax preparation industry objects for competitive reasons
and, representatives say, because of concern for taxpayers' privacy.
They point to troubles this spring in England, where the government's
electronic tax system was shut down after people reported being able
to view strangers' tax data. In California, taxpayers can connect
through the Franchise Tax Board Web site to nearly a dozen companies
that offer electronic filing. That includes Intuit, which offers free
use of its TurboTax program to people who earn less than $25,000 a
year. But Californians cannot do their taxes directly through the tax
agency's computer site, as taxpayers can in several other states.</TE>
<TE>   In Missouri, where lawmakers killed a bill that would have banned
the state from establishing e-filing, the number of people using the
state's "WebFile" system grew 53% in its second year.</TE>
<TE>   California tax officials say that of the 13.5 million state tax
returns filed so far this year, 3.1 million were filed by computer.
Of those, 2.4 million were handled by professional tax preparers. An
additional 700,000 residents used private electronic filing services.</TE>
<TE>   State Controller Kathleen Connell, who wields great influence over
the progress of electronic tax filing as chairwoman of the Franchise
Tax Board, calls the current battle with the computer industry a
"trench war."</TE>
<TE>   Mountain View-based Intuit has spent $400,000 since 1999 lobbying
the board and lawmakers. The company and its executives contributed
$75,000 to Connell, including $10,000 for her unsuccessful run for
mayor of Los Angeles in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Connell has pushed the Franchise Tax Board staff to find a way for
the 4.3 million Californians eligible to use the state's simplest tax
form, the 540 2EZ, to file by computer. They can already file by
punching digits on a push-button telephone.</TE>
<TE>   Franchise Tax Board Executive Director Jerry Goldberg said Connell
appeared to be pleased in January when he showed her a demonstration
Web site that calculated state income taxes for residents using the
"2EZ" form and allowed them to file directly to the agency for free.</TE>
<TE>   "We were set to move forward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Connell halted progress at Franchise Tax Board meetings in
March.</TE>
<TE>   She said she did so because of the privacy concerns of state Sen.
Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) and Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys).
Intuit has not contributed to either lawmaker since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Peace said he fears that state tax auditors will track people's
keystrokes as they fill out their tax forms on the computer, then
target those who make many changes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want all the work I did to get to the final product to be
in their hands," said Peace. "I don't want auditors to go back and
say, 'Here's a guy who took three tries at filling in his income.' "</TE>
<TE>   Franchise Tax Board spokesman Pat Hill acknowledged that there is
technology that allows a tracking of keystrokes.</TE>
<TE>   "But why would we do it?" he said. "We're interested in collecting
the final tax return that they transmit to us."</TE>
<TE>   In March, Connell met with representatives of several electronic
tax filing companies, including Intuit. They struck an agreement,
later approved by the entire Franchise Tax Board, under which the
state will not provide math calculations or tax table searches for
electronic filers. Instead, taxpayers must download a form, print it
out, use a pen and calculator to fill in the form, then log back in,
enter the data and hit "send."</TE>
<TE>   The board is prepared to launch such a free system in September,
according to Connell's office.</TE>
<TE>   Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for the California Tax Reform Assn. and
the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, criticized the system as clunky.</TE>
<TE>   "You shouldn't prevent taxpayers from pulling up the form and
filling it out, having the computer do the math and look up the tax,"
he said. "You shouldn't have to pay to file your taxes."</TE>
<TE>   A bill pending in the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee, AB
2781 by Assemblywoman Rebecca Cohn (D-Saratoga), would limit the
state's electronic filing capability to a system like that in the
agreement struck by Connell with private industry.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the arithmetic is the key here," Connell said. "The
key here is to get people to file electronically, with or without the
arithmetic."</TE>
<TE>   But others in California say they want the state to operate its
own free electronic tax filing, regardless of what the IRS does--or
what private industry wants.</TE>
<TE>   "This industry doesn't need to be in the game for a lot of tax
filers," said state Sen. Joe Dunn, (D-Santa Ana), whose bill last
year to require state sponsorship of e-filing was killed by industry
opposition. "For the person who prepares a simple form, they really
don't need Intuit or H&amp;R Block."</TE>
<TE>   "We ought to set up an e-file system that is consumer-friendly,"
said Dunn, "and I couldn't care less if the industry is happy about
it or not."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Virginia Ellis contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Remodeled Terminal at LAX Debuts</HD>
<DH>Airport: In a $300-million improvement project, American
Airlines raised ceilings, added a floor and tunneled underground to
double its space.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Passengers are seeing double in the American Airlines terminal at Los
Angeles International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   Double the number of agents in the ticket lobby. Double the amount
of concession and baggage claim space. Twice as many seats in waiting
rooms near gates. And, of course, two Starbucks.</LD>
<LD>   The additional room is the result of a four-year, $300-million
renovation of Terminal 4 at LAX--the airport's largest improvement
project. American, the facility's second-biggest airline, will
dedicate its new building today.</LD>
<TE>   The contemporary facility, which mimics grand transportation halls
built in the 1940s and '50s, is one of a series of massive renovation
projects undertaken by American, including a $1.3-billion terminal
reconstruction at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York
and a $1.7-billion improvement project at Miami International
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles has been a focus city for us for 70 years," said Art
Pappas, the company's managing director in Los Angeles. "We have a
lot of employees here, and we want to do what we can to keep our
customers and make travel at LAX as easy as we can."</TE>
<TE>   American has 5,000 employees in Los Angeles and operates 180
flights a day to 37 cities with its regional airline partner American
Eagle. The renovation, unlike many construction projects at airports
across the country, continued after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The carrier hopes its remodeled terminal will help it lure travelers
back to LAX.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of features in this building were the direct result of
complaints and comments we got in the mid-'90s from passengers," said
Scott A. Windham, a regional manager for corporate real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Like other airlines suffering the lingering effects of a poor
economy and the skyjackings, American saw its passenger count at the
airport fall in the first half of 2002. It served 3.7 million people
at LAX from January through June, down 9% from the same period last
year.</TE>
<TE>   American grappled for years with inadequate space at Los Angeles'
antiquated international gateway. To gain more room in Terminal 4,
architect Rivers &amp; Christian raised the ceilings, added a floor in
some places and tunneled underground. The carrier pays $4.6 million a
year to lease the 43-year-old terminal from the city agency that
operates the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "The building has great curved spaces that evoke light and an
uplift in spirit," said architect Donald Christian, whose firm also
worked on United Airlines' international terminal and the FedEx
complex at LAX. "That's what an airplane is: It's an uplifting
experience."</TE>
<TE>   Architects used perforated aluminum panels in vaulted ceilings,
terrazzo flooring and travertine on walls in high-traffic areas. The
aluminum panels boost acoustics in the terminal, where a new paging
system increases its volume as crowds get thicker and prevents
employees from broadcasting messages simultaneously by holding
messages in a queue.</TE>
<TE>   The terminal also features a fiber-optic computer system
programmed to change colors displayed under glass planets embedded in
the floor near security checkpoints. Art inspired by the solar system
is part of a $1-million commission that American awarded artist Susan
Narduli to develop a series of pieces. She says they are designed to
evoke humankind's yearning to "transcend earthly bounds and soar
toward the heavens."</TE>
<TE>   Among the artworks are likenesses of muscular nude men sandblasted
in oval granite slabs near security checkpoints. The images were
papered over last summer after the airport agency questioned whether
they were appropriate for a public place. The men were uncovered
after the Cultural Affairs Commission ruled that they satisfied the
city's design specifications.</TE>
<TE>   Art elements designed by Narduli include several other pieces
embedded in the floor--the phases of the moon and the sun, depicted
in metal, and the asteroid belt--plus 1,000 square feet of laminated
glass panels installed on the wall that feature cloud patterns.</TE>
<TE>   The terminal also includes a new 100,000-square-foot customs
facility that can serve 1,200 people an hour through 20 passport
stations. The unit also will process American's connecting passengers
who arrive at the Tom Bradley International Terminal.</TE>
<TE>   This facility empties into the domestic baggage claim area, which
features four new carousels. A new system with automated laser
bag-tag readers--in lieu of an employee with a scanner--helped the
carrier quadruple the number of outbound bags it can move each
minute.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Oxnard police arrested three people on suspicion of attempted murder
Wednesday morning after a wild car pursuit through residential
streets that ended with the suspects trying to flee on foot,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The suspects were identified as Jolene Annette Lopez, 23, Jason
James Reyes, 24, and Raymond Jacob Martinez, 21. Police said Lopez
was the driver.</LD>
<LD>   They were taken into custody less than 30 minutes after the
pursuit, which began at about 8:30 a.m. near the intersection of
Doris Avenue and M Street, said Sgt. Doug Wiley.</LD>
<TE>   Wiley said an Oxnard officer was writing a traffic ticket when a
man drove by and said someone had shot at him. The man, who was not
injured, was able to point out the suspects' car as it drove away,
Wiley said.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Enrique Alvarez, who was writing the citation, attempted
to pull the car over but it sped away. Wiley said the suspects threw
a shotgun and handgun out a window during the chase.</TE>
<TE>   The car crashed into a tree at Oxnard State Beach Park. The
suspects tried to escape on foot before surrendering, Wiley said.</TE>

<HD>Whispering Hills Set for Nov. 5 Ballot</HD>
<DH>Growth: The San Juan Capistrano vote delays the housing
project and the city's high school.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Juan Capistrano voters will have a chance Nov. 5 to stop a
much-debated housing development that would also bring the city its
first public high school in four decades.</LD>
<LD>   A referendum placed on the ballot Tuesday by the City Council
resulted from a petition drive that ended last week.</LD>
<LD>   The new school--to be called San Juan Hills--was scheduled to open
in September 2005 with Whispering Hills, an adjacent 175-home
development in the eastern foothills. But a successful petition drive
has placed the Whispering Hills project--and the school--on hold.</LD>
<TE>   "You can't open a school in November,'' said Phil Schwartze, who
works for the developer and is looking to regain a council seat in
November. "So we're probably delayed until at least 2006 now," even
if voters approve the project.</TE>
<TE>   If residents reject Whispering Hills, the developer, Dennis Gage,
would have to wait a year before introducing any project that might
bring a high school to town.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartze said not-in-my-backyard opponents may spoil San Juan
Capistrano's opportunity to have its own high school. "The city has
been desirous of a school for 40 years," Schwartze said. "Here we
finally found one and these NIMBYs got it stopped."</TE>
<TE>   However, the citizens group that sponsored the petition drive,
Citizens Against Uncontrolled San Juan Expansion, says the project
would hurt the city by bringing crowding and traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, they say, the City Council could have preserved the
school by accepting a scaled-back plan of 103 homes. The council
rejected the compromise last spring.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday the council voted to allow the Capistrano Unified
School District to write the ballot argument in favor of Whispering
Hills. The citizens group will write the rebuttal.</TE>
<TE>   Whispering Hills is the second development issue to be placed
before city voters. Last month, council members agreed to ask voters
whether the city should sell 13 acres to Home Depot for $9 million.</TE>

<HD>State to Pay Schools for Better Test Scores</HD>
<DH>Education: In Orange County, 285 campuses will share a
total of $6.3 million. Funds had been in doubt because of budget
problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of schools across Southern California will soon receive
financial rewards for boosting scores on state achievement tests, an
unexpected windfall that has come as a pleasant surprise for many
cash-strapped campuses.</LD>
<LD>   In Orange County, 285 schools will share a total of $6.3 million
for meeting the state's performance targets on exams taken in spring
2001.</LD>
<LD>   The payout comes months after schools were supposed to receive the
cash awards, promised as part of the governor's 3-year-old public
school accountability program.</LD>
<TE>   Budget woes in Sacramento forced education officials to halt
disbursement of reward funds in February--and called into question
whether money would come at all.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm just thrilled we are getting the money that we had pretty
much written off,'' said Rhonda Friedman, principal of Garden Grove
High School, which won $51,374 in reward money. ''Right now, anything
that comes our way is appreciated.''</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove Unified got the largest share of the money for Orange
County. About $935,000 will be distributed among 45 schools.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman said some of the money likely will be used to install
more lockers on campus. Currently, there are not enough lockers for
every student at the school, forcing many to carry their books around
all day in backpacks.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, 3,428 schools will receive $67.3 million in reward
money to spend on new teaching materials, technology and other
extras, Gov. Gray Davis' education secretary, Kerry Mazzoni,
announced this week.</TE>
<TE>   Schools should receive checks by the end of September, said Ann
Bancroft, spokeswoman for the education secretary.</TE>
<TE>   The bonuses amount to $36.88 per student tested. Bancroft said an
additional $39 per student is proposed in Davis' budget, which is
being debated in the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for the rewards, schools had to achieve a required
growth amount on the Academic Performance Index for their campus
enrollment. The index represents a public ranking of schools based on
test scores.</TE>
<TE>   Schools also had to meet growth targets for specific groups of
students, including children from low-income homes and from various
ethnic groups, said Bill Padia, director of the policy and evaluation
division in the state education office. Although the money that
schools will receive this year is much less than initially promised,
administrators said they understand the state's budget crisis and are
happy to get something.</TE>
<TE>   ''Nobody built their budgets on this, but it's something they can
use to fund a wish list of things that would be an additional bonus
for a school,'' said David Smollar, spokesman for the Capistrano
Unified School District, which won about $750,000 for 27 schools.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's like the difference between a car with a stereo and a car
without a stereo," he said. "You don't need the stereo to drive, but
the stereo might make the drive more relaxing and entertaining.''</TE>
<TE>   Because the funding is one-time money, it can't be used to hire
counselors or specialists--a critical need for many districts.</TE>
<TE>   That is one reason most school officials said they aren't worried
that the rewards program was not reinstituted this year.</TE>
<TE>   ''If I believed that teachers' performance across the state was
really motivated by this kind of possible reward, then I'd say it
needs to be continued,'' said Dean Waldfogel, superintendent of the
Irvine Unified School District, which will get about $281,102 under
the rewards program. ''I don't happen to believe that.''</TE>

<HD>Terrorism Won't Break Israeli Will</HD>
<DH>This fight is for the world's future.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YOSSI KLEIN HALEVI</AU>
<BD>Yossi Klein Halevi is the Israel correspondent for the
New Republic.</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Wednesday it was a university cafeteria next door to the art school
where our son's baby-sitter is exhibiting her graduation project. Two
days ago it was our family's favorite falafel place downtown, where
the owner gives you a falafel ball to stimulate your appetite while
you wait for your order to be filled.</LD>
<LD>   Gradually, over the last two years of terrorist war, the landmarks
of daily life have been turned into scenes of atrocity. Yet we've
stopped marking those scenes with memorials or plaques listing the
victims. Partly that's because there are now too many sites to
commemorate. But partly too it's because Israeli society knows it
can't afford to dwell on its losses in the midst of war. Just as
soldiers don't pause to eulogize a fallen friend during battle, we
too must continue fighting this war in which civilians are the
front-line soldiers and persistence is our most powerful weapon.</LD>
<LD>   This terrible summer is defined not only by terrorism but also by
a stubborn Israeli refusal to be terrorized. Last week, thousands
attended the Jerusalem Film Festival, enjoying live jazz and the
latest foreign films. In the lulls between terrorist attacks, we
return to cafes and restaurants and shopping malls, defying those who
seek to destroy our public spaces.</LD>
<TE>   We've become expert in finding safe corners where we can steal
some moments of normalcy. Last week, my wife and I drove 20 minutes
out of Jerusalem to a kibbutz in the Judean hills that offers a
famous Friday brunch. When we got there, we found hundreds of other
Jerusalemites who had the same idea of finding a respite in the
countryside.</TE>
<TE>   One example of our ability to endure the unendurable was provided
by a recent restaurant review in a local Jerusalem newspaper. "A
moment before an emergency army call-up notice whisked away my
partner to an unknown destination and for unknown length of time,"
wrote the reviewer, "we went out with our young daughter to celebrate
a year of our becoming parents. At the entrance [to the restaurant]
we rang the bell, and only after they saw that we were lovers of
peace and seekers of life did they open the locked door." That kind
of irreverent humor helps us get through the day. Most of all, we
persist, thanks to our national unity. This notoriously fractious
society has rediscovered its commonality.</TE>
<TE>   Ariel Sharon, once unelectable, now enjoys 70% support. Even many
of us who once opposed occupying the territories now agree that we
have no choice but to destroy the terrorist state-in-the-making
nurtured by Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than undermine our morale, the terrorist attacks only
strengthen our resolve. Most Israelis realize that this isn't a war
of Palestinian desperation but part of a long pattern of Palestinian
self-destructiveness. Just as there would have been no Palestinian
refugee problem had the Palestinians not rejected the U.N. partition
in 1947 and tried to destroy the newborn Jewish state, and just as
there would have been no Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
had the Arab world not tried again to destroy Israel in 1967, so too
would there be no reoccupation today had the Palestinians accepted
Israel's offer of statehood two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, we draw strength from the realization that we are the
front line in a global war against a new barbarity. Humanity is
poised between breakthrough and breakdown, between unimagined
scientific and medical advances and the forces of terrorist
dissipation and religious reaction that would send us back to the
Middle Ages.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the Jews once again find themselves the primary
targets of those intent on world domination. As history has
repeatedly proved, what begins as a threat to the Jews ends with a
threat to civilization. In clinging to a semblance of normal life and
refusing to be terrorized, we are fighting a war whose implications
extend far beyond Israel. Terrorists around the world are watching
this conflict to see whether terrorism breaks Israeli will. Whether
or not the world recognizes it, we know we're holding the line for
its future as well as ours.</TE>

<HD>A Game Plan for a Simon Touchdown Nov. 5</HD>
<DH>Don't write him off. The campaign hasn't even begun.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH L. KHACHIGIAN</AU>
<BD>Kenneth L. Khachigian is a Southern California lawyer
who was senior advisor and strategist for President Reagan and Govs.
George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Simon Jr. must be tired of hearing how he can't win the
governorship. Well, he can. After all, the Nov. 5 election is not the
incumbent's to lose; it's Simon's to win. Here's a partial victory
checklist.</LD>
<LD>   First, Simon should be mindful that a week is a lifetime in
politics. In the 1982 gubernatorial campaign against popular Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, George Deukmejian lagged behind and gained
traction only in the final 10 days. Simon has three full months to
go.</LD>
<LD>   Never mind that Simon has had a rough 3 1/2 months; the incumbent
has had a rough 3 1/2 years. As one of my former bosses used to say:
It's better to be a mile away from hell and heading out than 100
miles away and heading in.</LD>
<TE>   Second, Simon should take advantage of the faraway election date
to reacquaint himself with his original decision to run. Find a quiet
48 hours away from his staff, advisors and the chattering class.
Reestablish his center and rekindle his passion. Get back in touch
with the premise of his candidacy--his core message. Commit it to a
handful of staccato sentences; they are his home port.</TE>
<TE>   Polls and focus groups are handy guideposts, but nothing surpasses
a candidate's inner compass.</TE>
<TE>   Third, Simon shouldn't overlook the "tactical campaign." Davis and
his stooges are masters of distraction, and they've done pretty well
so far. So Simon must get his self-confidence back.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' advisors are not nearly as tough as those crooks and thugs
Simon faced down as a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office. And,
believe me, the governor is much more fearful of losing this race
than Simon is. By the way, the governor's real first name is Joe--a
pretty ordinary moniker. Simon should think of him that way.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth, Simon must get on the offense and stay there. His
opponent's record offers up a target-rich environment. Nothing will
stir up Simon's base more than a steady and relentless drumbeat of
political-attack rhetoric that underscores his determination to
sharpen differences with Davis.</TE>
<TE>   One place to start is with Fremont High School in Los Angeles.
Trust me, Fremont is the tragic model for this administration's
betrayal of our children. That speech will write itself.</TE>
<TE>   Fifth, perhaps it's a small point, but I keep reading about those
hecklers who follow Simon around to shout him down. Put that to an
end. If the opponents show up with 20 hecklers, Simon should send 40
to the governor's next appearance. When they send 30, treat the
governor to 60. The only way to end that kind of juvenile behavior is
to make it more painful to receive than to give. If Simon's campaign
lets them continue unabated, his opponents will think of him as a
pitiful wimp, and so will many of his supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Sixth, Simon must marshal his resources. A reasonable media
campaign from here to November requires $20 million. If he has it--or
will have it--then he should start spending it now. But if it's not
there, I'd rather he ran a pauper's campaign in August than in
October.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's worst mistake would be to run a third or half of the
needed media now because that's nearly as bad as none at all. If
dollars are limited, then gut it out for a couple more weeks. Going
dark will make the other side wonder what mischief he's up to. Then
he can put huge sums into 15 days of tough, gritty radio spots that
lay the groundwork for the silver-bullet issues his staff have been
squirreling away for months. Tough and targeted radio would give
Simon a presence, carve into Davis' base and bolster the morale of
Simon's supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Seventh, political reporters are tough, on the whole more liberal
than Simon and often annoying. But Simon should spend more time with
them. They love politics, relish a good fight and a good race and
will strive to be fair if he helps them with a story.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there's no love lost between them and Davis. Simon
shouldn't concede the political press to the other side. And he
should travel with someone on his staff who can help him prepare for
each encounter. Jim Baker correctly observed: Proper preparation
prevents poor performance.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Simon might not like all the rules of the game, but in a
democracy political campaigns are not meant to be dignified
coronations. So he shouldn't just give as good as he gets; he should
give better. Show his passion, fight fair but hard and--as important
as anything else--have some fun. An upbeat candidate looks and sounds
like a winner.</TE>

<HD>Give It One More Try Before War</HD>
<DH>Use military threat to secure a tough weapons inspection
program in Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP GORDON and MICHAEL O'HANLON</AU>
<BD>Philip Gordon and Michael O'Hanlon are senior fellows
at the Brookings Institution.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is there any way to remove the threat posed by Saddam Hussein without
going to war to unseat him?</LD>
<LD>   Washington's European allies argue that the real problem is not
Hussein but his weapons of mass destruction, so the resumption of
U.N. inspections would be a way to avoid a potentially costly and
destabilizing military invasion of Iraq. Arab countries endorsed this
approach during their March summit in Beirut.</LD>
<LD>   Hawks in the Bush administration and elsewhere worry that getting
inspectors back into Iraq would be a booby prize. They believe that
inspections have proved futile, that any agreement by Hussein to
allow inspectors back in would be a trick and that the U.S. should
overthrow Hussein even if he suddenly offers to open his doors to the
United Nations. The extremes on both sides of this debate are missing
a key option: a much tougher inspections regime with immediate
demands on Hussein to reveal his illicit weapons so we can destroy
them and a clear, multilateral promise to go to war if he thwarts us
even one time. This may be an option that the U.S. and its allies can
all agree on, if it is carefully developed.</LD>
<TE>   In other words, unlike the situation in the 1990s, the U.S. and
its allies, preferably through a new U.N. Security Council
resolution, would leave no doubt about what would happen should Iraq
resort to its old ways. And Washington would get as much of the world
as possible to endorse that basic position in advance.</TE>
<TE>   We would ensure that if inspections do happen, they stand a high
probability of successfully denying Iraq weapons of mass destruction.
And if Hussein thwarts inspectors, the U.S.-led coalition will have
made it known that there will be no more second chances.</TE>
<TE>   This approach should deprive Hussein of his hope of splitting the
U.S. from its friends and allies as a means of preventing war.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the ultimatum to Iraq should include the following:</TE>
<TE>   * Immediate progress on accounting for and eliminating several key
items of concern. These include VX nerve agent and associated
delivery vehicles, the dozen or more Scud missiles still believed to
be hidden and materials to make biological agents. Iraq would be
given a tight deadline for compliance.</TE>
<TE>   * Immediate access to anyone in the Iraqi nuclear and biological
weapons programs, along with the right to usher them and their
families out of the country and to asylum should they provide
information that Hussein does not want to get out. Of course, the
international community would also insist on access to
nuclear-related and biological weapons materials we learn about so
they could be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   * An agreement with other industrial countries to establish
restrictions on future high-tech trade with Iraq for as long as
Hussein or a similar despot holds power in Baghdad. Styled after the
Cold War limits on sales of items that could aid the militaries of
communist foes, it would place particular emphasis on denying Iraq
technologies used in a nuclear weapons program. It could also include
monitoring rights for other technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Under this approach, we would still be connected to Hussein by a
chain made up of U.N. resolutions and international obligations. But
we would be the ones yanking the chain, not him. And if we had to go
to war, most of the world would then be with us.</TE>

<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Where is God?</LD>
<LD>   Was he there in Somerset, Pa.--as one of the jubilant rescue
workers insisted he must have been--when, in the wee hours of Sunday
morning, they pulled the nine trapped coal miners from the pitch
depths of the flooded shaft they'd been trapped in for more than 74
hours? It suits us well to think so, but it shouldn't.</LD>
<LD>   The townspeople have hailed the dramatic and unlikely rescue as
nothing less than a bona fide miracle, a compensation, some have
suggested, for the loss of the brave passengers aboard United
Airlines Flight 93, the hijacked plane that crashed in a field only
10 miles from Somerset on Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   The media snapped up the miners like a godsend, the television
news anchors were all over the best feel-good story they'd gotten
their hands on in weeks, particularly when it comes to God.</TE>
<TE>   The Pledge of Allegiance, after all, was bowdlerized last month,
the offending words "under God" having been declared unconstitutional
by a federal appeals court sitting in California. Everyone is in a
panic that the phrase "In God We Trust" on our currency may be next
on the chopping block.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the god of Mammon seems to have taken righteous
offense, sending the stock market into fits of bipolarity that only
the ravages of divine distemper seem able to explain.</TE>
<TE>   Then, of course, there has been the rash of child abductions
across the country in the last few weeks, leaving us unbelieving that
any God could countenance the unspeakable suffering of a 5-year-old
girl, sexually assaulted, murdered and left propped up on the side of
the road. Where was our miners' God then? Was he there when Samantha
Runnion lay frightened and in pain beyond enduring? Is he there by
the side of Elizabeth Smart, wherever she may be? Or was he only
there in Philadelphia when mercy was shown to 7-year-old Erica Pratt,
who escaped to safety by chewing through the duct tape with which her
captors had bound and gagged her?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe God has been busy in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe we're just custodians of a cheap and bribable faith.
Maybe we're just the kind of fair-weather believers who pray for the
winning Lotto ticket or the outcome of an election or who cross
themselves in the batting box and the end zone because they think God
cares about a timely touchdown or home run. Maybe we're the kind of
folks who, as some have argued in recent weeks, make blasphemous
common coin of God's name by printing it on our money, or mixing it
up with our idolatrous love of country. Maybe our "god" is just a
word after all, something we use and discard depending on the outcome
of our bets.</TE>
<TE>   And so I repeat, where is God? Where is our God? And what is he?
Is he just a euphemism for getting what we want, a capricious
projection of our selfish wants, a good day for a rescue crew or,
like the Islamist's Allah, a convenience we invoke to sanction our
victories?</TE>
<TE>   In these times, the answers to these questions matter more than
ever because we are in a religious war with militant Islam, every bit
as much as we are caught in a clash of civilizations, and God is in
the middle of it.</TE>
<TE>   Our God should be constant, the God both of tears and laughter,
not the God of good fortune at the race track. If we can make of God
nothing more than a name to be cut and pasted haphazardly into oaths,
or praised only on the auspicious days, then we have lost the faith
this nation--under and trusting in God--was founded on and, moreover,
the faith that makes it worth defending.</TE>
<TE>   Happy endings have nothing to do with it.</TE>

<LD>Dear Mr. Attorney General:</LD>
<LD>   I received the Department of Justice's July 3rd reply to my letter
of March 28, 2002, regarding individuals detained as part of the
department's investigation into the September 11th terrorist attacks.
... [It] was an incomplete response to my inquiry.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Carl Levin</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carl Levin (D-Mich.) chairs the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. In March, he wrote John Ashcroft asking the attorney
general to tell his panel how many men, women and-- who knows?--maybe
even children the government had detained since 9/11. Where were they
locked up? When would they hear the accusations against them? How
many had the government released?</TE>
<TE>   More than incomplete, Ashcroft's July 3 response is unsettling,
suggesting as it does that the Bush administration assumes it has
carte blanche to choose which aspects of democracy to honor in this
time of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   We are not among those who snicker at Ashcroft for remaining on
high alert about possible Al Qaeda sleeper cells eager to commit more
mass murder--psychologists might call that denial. Most Americans
take the threat seriously and will make sacrifices to keep it from
happening, including, possibly, giving the government a freer hand in
detecting, arresting and detaining the nation's enemies. But that
doesn't include dismissing the constitutional checks and balances
that have served this nation for 200 years.</TE>
<TE>   When he finally replied, Ashcroft said the FBI and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service had detained 881 people, on criminal or
immigration charges. But last winter the department said federal
agents had corralled close to 1,200 suspects. What happened to the
other 300? Are they still waiting in some jail cell, lost to the
system?</TE>
<TE>   Levin asked why Ashcroft had ordered immigration judges to close
their courtroom doors for hearings on noncitizen detainees, barring
the public, reporters and even family members. The attorney general
dug his heels into constitutional quicksand. Open hearings, he said,
"would adversely impact our pending criminal and terrorism
investigations ... the security of these as well as other detainees,
the immigration courts and the public."</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft also insisted, "We do not maintain records ... for the
total number of individuals who have been detained without being
charged." Whether a sign of disorganization or duplicity, this answer
doesn't fly.</TE>
<TE>   Levin wrote Ashcroft again, on July 18, with more pointed
questions. How many people had been detained by federal agents? How
many had lawyers? How many had appeared before a judge? Had been
deported?</TE>
<TE>   Levin is not the only Congress member nagging the attorney general
to explain what his department has done since 9/11, why the mass
roundups and secret hearings he authorized are necessary and how the
Constitution justifies such departures from due process. As the
direct representative of the people and one of three equal branches
of government, Congress is entitled, indeed obligated, to ensure that
the president and his Cabinet don't act unilaterally or recklessly.</TE>
<TE>   Levin asked Ashcroft to reply to his latest inquiry by this
Friday. Even if Al Qaeda strikes again today, Americans shouldn't
tolerate another response of "I don't know" or "I'm not going to tell
you."</TE>

<LD>The director of the baseball players union tried to reassure
Americans the other day by saying the players had no strike set for
Sept. 16. Aww, why not? How about Sept. 4? Or tomorrow?</LD>
<LD>   Let's take all the petulant millionaire players and all the
cantankerous millionaire owners by their ears and put them in
separate corners. Let's give them a timeout and make them face the
wall and what they're doing to a once-grand game that used to seem
like America's pastime. Now it's more like passed time. Did either
side grasp the lessons, the drooped attendance and the distaste
lingering from 1994's 232-day strike?</LD>
<LD>   It's one thing to put up with the five or 10 seconds of excitement
between long bouts of spitting, tapping, glove-tightening and idle
swinging. But today, we've got 850 active players making, on average,
$2,345,920 a year. Poor babies, that's only about $14,481 a game for
one "year" of "work"--staying in peak shape and dashing around
carefully raked dirt, hitting or chasing a little ball for maybe
eight months. After running 90 feet they need a break to brush off
any dirt. That salary is more money per year than most of us will
make for a lifetime of real work.</LD>
<TE>   Donald Fehr, the union executive, is racking up frequent-flier
miles these days briefing players on all 30 teams on the status of
negotiations with owners. They don't want to be striking on the
anniversary of Sept. 11, which shows how sensitive they are, see?</TE>
<TE>   How about collecting fan feedback? Ask fans whether they might
strike both sides in baseball. Ask parents whether they still share
baseball stories with their children to teach real-life lessons about
education, grit and comebacks. Do they count days till the World
Series ritual? How do parents answer wide-eyed questions about heroes
using drugs or being asked to drop by the police station? Also check
how many afternoons at the old ballpark the average family can afford
these pricey days. Besides ATMs, these parks will soon need loan
officers to finance snacks.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, this is a business for both sides. Players seek more; owners
pay it. Then they cry poverty. They market themselves as the key
element of the game, as fantasy, as entertainment. Then they act like
real pirates. Sure, the issues are thorny. Handle them. With so much
mistrust polluting our business and political atmospheres, it's
incumbent on these folks to work it out, take one for the national
team.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, did either side notice the average per-game attendance
after 1,467 games this year? It was down 1,533 fans to 28,281. That's
a 5% drop. Hmmm, any lesson there? Other than the obvious one:
Increase prices again.</TE>

<LD>Zimbabwe's notoriously repressive government recently arrested two
journalists and put them on trial for allegedly publishing
falsehoods. Two other journalists recently got the same treatment in
Wyandotte County, Kansas. This is bad governance, whether it happens
in Africa or North America.</LD>
<LD>   In the case closest to home, a free tabloid newspaper reported
that Kansas City Mayor Carol Marinovich and her husband, a county
judge, did not live in the county. They did. The district attorney
brought charges against the paper's publisher and its editor. A jury
decided that the two knew the information was wrong and didn't care.
It found them guilty of criminal defamation, a crime in Kansas
punishable by up to a year in jail.</LD>
<LD>   Don't get us wrong. Lying is repugnant--even more so when done in
print. It can undermine a person's reputation. It hurts society and
journalism by eroding fragile public confidence in the press, an
institution that is supposed to act as a watchdog over government
institutions and elected officials.</LD>
<TE>   Within intentionally narrow guidelines, the 1st Amendment allows
people who have been libeled to sue in civil court and receive
damages for harm done to their reputations--even public figures,
although they have additional hurdles to clear, such as proving that
the reporters acted with malice.</TE>
<TE>   What's problematic is a law that lets the government swagger in
and arrest or jail someone for reporting something that a mayor,
district attorney, governor, president or the guy next door doesn't
want to hear--even if it turns out to be untrue. Look at Zimbabwe and
the other countries where oppressive cranks or leaders with an
immature grasp of basic democratic principles use the power of
criminal laws to suppress dissent and chill unflattering reportage.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than half of the states in the U.S. have criminal defamation
statutes. None should.</TE>
<TE>   We agree with free-press advocates in Africa, who are fighting
Zimbabwe's repressive anti-press measures, and in Kansas, where they
seek to repeal the state criminal libel law.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cable television operator Cox Communications Inc. reported sharply
higher second-quarter revenue driven by subscriber growth, but said a
decline in the value of its Sprint PCS stake led to a loss.</LD>
<LD>   Cox reported a second-quarter net loss of $516.2 million, or 86
cents a share, including $813.8 million in losses on its Sprint PCS
and other investments, compared with a profit of $30.7 million, or 5
cents a share a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Cox's operating cash flow rose 16% to $441.9 million, compared
with $382.1 million, at the higher end of analysts' estimates of
$427.4 million to $446 million, as compiled by research firm Multex.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue for the quarter rose 19% to $1.24 billion from $1.05
billion, also at the high end of analysts' expectations of $1.15
billion to $1.24 billion.</TE>

<LD>Re "Heat-Related Deaths Spur Call to Lower Power Rates," July 29:</LD>
<LD>   The recent deaths of three individuals in Palm Springs have
prompted calls for the reduction of power rates in that region so
that residents can afford to run their air conditioners.</LD>
<LD>   Huh?</LD>
<TE>   That is tantamount to having drivers of vehicles that get poor
fuel economy qualify for discounted gasoline prices.</TE>
<TE>   If one chooses to live in the desert, he or she is on notice that
not only does it get hot in the summer but that air conditioning will
cause power bills to go up.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps people confronting such a choice should seek a different
place to live.</TE>

<TE>   The deaths described in your article are tragic, but hardly the
fault of electric utilities.</TE>
<TE>   If state Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta) is successful in compelling
utilities to sell electricity at reduced rates to anyone who chooses
to live in the desert, I hope he targets insurance companies next. I
choose to live in a state that is widely known for its seismic
activity and I can't afford earthquake insurance.</TE>

<HD>Social Security: Private Interests Rate Attention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Social Insecurity," Opinion, July 28: Jacob Heilbrunn assumes
that partial privatization of Social Security means investing in
stocks when there are plenty of safer investments private citizens
could make (bonds, annuities, etc.). All yield better returns than
Social Security's scandalous 3%, and you'd actually own something.</LD>
<LD>   Worse, Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. The so-called trust fund
is a stack of government bonds. Safe investment, you say? Well, if
you believe that one party (the government) can be both a lender and
borrower in the same transaction, you must believe I can get rich by
suing myself for a million bucks.</LD>
<LD>   No, the current system is a crime being perpetrated on those born
after 1970 who will get stuck with the tax increases (and economic
malaise) necessary to cover the boomers' checks. And if government
bonds are such a safe bet, let me own some directly. Then if I die
before retirement, my heirs would get something. Under Social
Security, they'd get zilch. Fringe idea? Only to nanny-staters immune
to logical thinking.</LD>
<TE>   Jim Bass</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Heilbrunn is either too trusting or is giving President Bush and
his handlers the benefit of the doubt when he attributes their
continuing advocacy for privatizing Social Security to "optimism."</TE>
<TE>   The same greed that has given us Enron is driving the push to get
Social Security money into the hands of powerful financial interests.
It is another example of a government that identifies its interests
with those of the wealthy, corporate elite and only pretends to care
about the fate of the average worker.</TE>

<LD>In reading "Fewer Tourists Leaving Hearts in S.F." (July 27), I was
surprised to see no mention of the factors that have dissuaded my
wife and me from returning to San Francisco since our last visit
about 15 months ago. We were dismayed at the foul streets and the
swarms of panhandlers, most of them young and apparently able-bodied.
When my wife remarked on the contrast between New York and San
Francisco, I commented that Mayor Willie Brown is not Rudolph
Giuliani and that, unlike San Francisco, New York has erected no
monument to the homeless.</LD>
<LD>   I lived in San Francisco for several years in the 1970s. This last
visit, on Grant Avenue in particular, we were accosted by aggressive
panhandlers in front of virtually every second shop. Near Halladie
Plaza we saw human excrement on the sidewalks. In fact, of the many
major cities that we have visited, San Francisco is by far the
filthiest. Mayor Brown, if you clean up your city, the tourists will
return and we will be happy to join them.</LD>

seems only right that the Clintons should be reimbursed for their
legal fees in defending themselves from the many years of the
Republican witch hunt. In addition to making the Clintons whole, some
taxpayer group should file a suit against the Republicans to recoup
the $70 million of taxpayers' money--money wasted just for political
reasons years after it was determined that there was no credible
evidence against the Clintons in the Whitewater affair.</LD>
<LD>   Heck, it shouldn't be any problem for the Republicans to raise
such a sum; just have George W. host a fund-raiser with his
big-business buddies.</LD>

<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft wants us to stand united at our windows,
spying on our neighbors. He claims to be a good Christian, but
somehow I can't buy it.</LD>
<LD>   What happened to love thy neighbor as thyself and the commandment
that thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor?</LD>
<TE>   You know that 90% of the spy calls will be hate-related and the
other 10% will be stupid. What Ashcroft really wants is for us to spy
on our Muslim neighbors. Don't forget that Hitler wanted everybody to
spy on their Jewish neighbors as well. What this country needs is
love and understanding, not spying on each other.</TE>

<TE>   While I don't know any chief executives I suspect of terrorist
attacks on the economy, I feel it is my duty to report my neighbor to
the Operation TIPS hotline. Not only does he speak with a strange
accent, but he recently purchased a huge sport utility vehicle.
Perhaps he plans on terrorizing other drivers or sickening our
children with his exhaust. Could he be planning on weakening our
economy by increasing the trade deficit or making us more dependent
on foreign sources of oil? Even more sinister, might he be hoping
that global warming and the resulting economic chaos will bring us to
our knees? Perhaps, or this could be an attempt at living the typical
American lifestyle while planning a more spectacular but less harmful
bombing or anthrax attack.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Method Without Madness" (July 30), your Column One about suicide
bombers, you quote a number of mental health professionals, including
one who claims that the suicide bombers are "psychologically as
normal as you and I." You offer no differing view.</LD>
<LD>   As a clinical psychologist for 25 years, I view this claim as
nothing short of absurd. Suicide cultists are clearly operating from
a mass delusion and are very disturbed. Children dying to be close to
God are brainwashed and out of their minds. The fact that forethought
goes into these acts does not prove they aren't coming from a very
disturbed inner mental process. You don't need to look like a raving
lunatic to think like one.</LD>
<LD>   Why aren't older men who have lived full lives wanting to
sacrifice for their righteous cause? If martyrdom is next to
godliness, why is it mostly the young who are lining up to strap on
the bomb-laden belts? Any belief that makes us take our own
life--short of extenuating circumstances such as extreme pain or
torture--I consider pathological, no matter what forethought has gone
into it and no matter how lofty the politico-religious cause may be.</LD>
<TE>   We are now subject to what happens when institutionalized
craziness goes out to fight a war. And it isn't pretty. Because
craziness never is. Throughout history, craziness combined with
ideological righteousness has always been a lethal combination.
Always. Do you think it's going to be any different this time?</TE>

<TE>   When perusing the chart, "Suicide Through the Ages," that
accompanied your article, I felt like a kid playing one of those
"which item does not belong in this category" word games. My answer
is, of course, the item describing the Jewish men and women who
committed suicide at Masada rather than being raped, beaten, tortured
and then executed by the Romans.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining items on the chart described individuals, such as
the Japanese kamikaze pilots, committing suicide while maiming and
killing as many of the enemy as possible. I do not believe that such
actions can be compared to those of a group willing to die rather
than be captured and killed. The men and women at Masada did not
attempt to harm their would-be captors during their death throes,
unlike today's suicide bombers in the Middle East.</TE>

leaders of those organizations have fled to neighboring countries.
This may be true, but Taylor ignores a point that is so obvious, so
basic: Al Qaeda and the Taliban may be out of Afghanistan now, but if
the U.S. pulls out, they will surely return.</LD>
<LD>   The fact is that postwar Afghanistan has a very unstable
government, and if the U.S. were to pull out at this critical
juncture, the country, or at least major parts of it, would sink into
anarchy and civil war, providing fertile ground for the return of
those radical elements that are, for the time being, biding their
time in Pakistan and elsewhere. Any true intelligence expert would
understand that after any military victory comes the responsibility
of ensuring that the enemy doesn't reemerge in the postwar chaos.</LD>
<TE>   In 1945, the U.S. won a decisive victory over Germany and Japan,
but we retained control over those countries until 1955 and 1952,
respectively (and we still keep a military presence in those
countries to this day). For Taylor to argue that because we won the
war in Afghanistan we should now pull out is shockingly naive. To
follow his advice would only mean that one day we would have to
return to fight the war all over again.</TE>

<LD>Thank you for George Pyle's important warning regarding industrial
agriculture ("Grim Reaping," Commentary, July 29). The
industrialization of our food supply is one of the reasons why I buy
my food from farmers' markets, where I can meet the people who grow
my food and have a sense of a localized, organic agriculture that's
about supporting small family farmers rather than big agribusiness.</LD>
<LD>   Pyle paints a grim picture indeed, but it's encouraging to know
that healthy alternatives already exist. It's to everyone's benefit
that we begin to support our small local farmers if we ever hope to
sustain the land that feeds us.</LD>

<HD>Soaring Falcons Produce Cleaner Water Off Beach</HD>
<DH>Two of the Raptors Are Used to Scare Off Gulls That
Polluted Area Near Landfill</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VERONIQUE de TURENNE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Here at the Tajiguas Landfill, where 650 tons of fresh garbage are
dumped each day, a sport of kings is meeting the needs of the common
man.</LD>
<LD>   A pair of falcons rides the air currents above the 80-acre site,
keeping thousands of sea gulls at bay. Where once the sky was white
with birds and the land was white with guano, a scant dozen of the
more daring gulls circle the site from a wary distance.</LD>
<LD>   Since the county turned to falconry to control the gulls last
spring, heavy-equipment operators can work all day without stopping
to scrub away bird droppings so thick that they obscured their
windshields and so noxious that they ate through paint and metal.
Visitors to Tajiguas no longer have to wear hats.</LD>
<TE>   Most surprising, however, is the sudden rise in water quality at
nearby Arroyo Quemado beach. It was once the filthiest beach in Santa
Barbara--and last year in all of Southern California--but gull-free
Arroyo Quemado's waters have logged 15 weeks of passing grades. Local
residents welcome the cleaner water, and county officials plan to use
the turnabout to make a case for extending the life of the
controversial landfill by 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The falcons were an experiment, really, and the results have been
truly amazing," said Mark Schleich, director of the county's solid
waste division. "That beach was a mess, and for the first time in
five years, since the falcons came, the water is testing clean."</TE>
<TE>   Falconry, a 4,000-year-old sport defined as the pursuit of quarry
with a trained raptor, was once practiced only by the rich and
titled. Over the millenniums it has become a passion for some of the
less well-heeled. Of the estimated 4,400 licensed falconers in the
United States, about 600 live in California. Most use their birds for
sport, but a growing number are putting them to work.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Stephan founded his Ramona, Calif.-based company, Air
Superiority Falconry Services, seven years ago. His 15 birds have
flown missions as varied as stopping starlings from eating grapes at
Central Coast vineyards and helping the Air Force protect the
sensitive skin of $2-billion Stealth bombers from pigeon droppings.</TE>
<TE>   "We would ride a crane to a motorized catwalk near the ceiling of
the Stealth hangar and let the falcons go," said Stephan, now 42, who
became a falconer when he was 14. The pigeons soon sought a safer
place to roost.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a natural predator-prey relationship, and it's the most
effective way to control nuisance birds," Stephan said. "Plus,
falcons are beautiful, just beautiful in everything they do."</TE>
<TE>   Historians call falconry the world's oldest sport. It's certainly
one of the most regulated. In the U.S., falconers are required to
have licenses from state fish and game departments. Their training
begins with an apprenticeship, includes study of history and lore as
well as the intricacies of bird keeping, and culminates with written
and practical exams.</TE>
<TE>   "Falconry is a lifestyle," said Jeff Diaz, the falconer whose
birds now patrol the landfill in Santa Barbara. "The relationship you
develop with your birds is beyond words."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz stumbled onto the Tajiguas job. "I had heard that the county
was thinking about using falcons for their gull problem, so I took a
chance and drove down to the landfill," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the county solid waste department happened to be
there, watching the thousands of gulls that had ignored firecrackers,
bird bombs and piped-in distress calls.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes of the falcons' first flight, the sea gulls had
dispersed. Within weeks, Arroyo Quemado beach had posted its cleanest
water ratings in five years. County officials were so impressed that
they gave Diaz a one-year contract that comes to about $95,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that airports used falcons to keep birds from their
runways," said Kathy Kefauver, a wildlife biologist who had the idea
of using a falconer at the site. "But seeing Jeff work the birds and
watching the gulls leave the working face of the landfill was
impressive."</TE>
<TE>   So were the water quality numbers. DNA tests had shown that 80% of
the pollution at Arroyo Quemado beach came from gull droppings, but
getting rid of the birds without killing them had flummoxed county
officials. The falcons just frighten the gulls. Unlike firecrackers
or bird calls, which the gulls quickly learned to ignore, the fear of
predators is hard-wired into their consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is impressed. Hillary Hauser, founder of Heal the
Ocean, an environmental organization that wants to shut down the
Tajiguas dump, sees the falcons as something of a parlor trick.
Though the birds cleaned up the water at Arroyo Quemado beach, that
doesn't convince Hauser that the county should give the landfill a
15-year extension.</TE>
<TE>   "The falcons are amusing, but they don't solve the landfill
problem," Hauser said. "What it boils down to is the county is trying
to push the expansion of an environmental hazard on the back of a
pair of falcons. That's absurd."</TE>

<HD>Fire East of San Diego Consumes 18,200 Acres, Is 10%
Contained</HD>
<DH>Safety: Hundreds of residents have been evacuated as the
3-day-old blaze threatens 300 structures.</DH>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A brush fire near the community of Julian east of San Diego spread to
18,200 acres Wednesday, the California Department of Forestry and
Fire Protection said.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the blaze, which erupted Monday afternoon, is only
10% contained. They could give no estimate of when it would be under
control.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 2,000 firefighters were battling the fire.</LD>
<TE>   Five homes were destroyed Tuesday, and officials said another 300
structures are threatened by the south front of the fire, which
apparently was sparked by a National Guard helicopter that clipped a
power line.</TE>
<TE>   Four firefighters battling the blaze have suffered minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   A female gray wolf and its three cubs were killed Tuesday, after
flames burned across the California Wolf Center. Another 26 wolves, a
mix of Mexican grays and the more common Alaskan grays, survived.
Some sought refuge in concrete and soil fire boroughs built by the
center for just such an emergency.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred residents who were ordered to evacuate Tuesday had
not been permitted to return to their homes by late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In Sequoia National Forest, the McNalley Fire has burned 88,000
acres and is 35% contained.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, that blaze threatened several groves of giant sequoias,
but now the fire is heading north and east, officials said. The
ancient trees are safe, authorities have said.</TE>
<TE>   Along California's northern border, the 35,000-acre Sour Biscuit
Fire continued its push to merge with the 145,000-acre Florence fire,
which has been burning in southwestern Oregon since July 13. More
than 17,000 people in Oregon's Illinois Valley have been told to be
ready to evacuate within 30 minutes if given notice.</TE>

<HD>Parks Collects $157,000 for City Council Bid</HD>
<DH>Politics: The ex-police chief raised the most money in the
shortest time of all candidates, campaign finance reports show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bolstered by support from a wide range of city leaders, former Los
Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks collected nearly $157,000 in
his bid to represent parts of South Los Angeles on the City Council,
according to campaign finance statements released Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Parks--who stepped down as police chief several months ago after
the Police Commission denied him a second five-year term--received
$500 donations from attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., businessman Eli
Broad, activist Danny Bakewell and Councilman Nate Holden. Parks also
received the maximum individual contribution of $500 from Police
Commissioner David S. Cunningham III, the only commissioner to vote
in favor of a second term for Parks, according to statements.</LD>
<LD>   Parks was among 30 City Council candidates required to file
campaign finance statements for the first six months of 2002 with the
ethics commission. The statements had to be postmarked by midnight
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Parks, who announced his candidacy in late May, raised the most
money in the shortest amount of time. He brought in $127,541 in
donations--most of it during a one-week period in late June. He also
lent his campaign $25,000, and received about $3,700 in non-monetary
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Among his rivals in the race to succeed Mark Ridley-Thomas in the
8th Council District, Karen Bass reported raising $79,800 and
Assemblyman Rod Wright (D-Los Angeles) raised $33,570.</TE>
<TE>   In all, voters next year will decide seven of the council's 15
seats in a nonpartisan March primary and the May 20 general election.</TE>
<TE>   Four seats are occupied by council members who cannot run again
because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   Two seats are held by Wendy Greuel and Tom LaBonge, who were
elected in the last year to finish partial terms and now are seeking
full four-year terms. No challengers to Greuel and LaBonge had filed
finance reports by Wednesday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The assemblyman who lost to Greuel last spring, Tony Cardenas, is
running for a northeast Valley council seat being vacated by Ruth
Galanter. Cardenas' finance forms were unavailable Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining race features incumbent Nick Pacheco, who is seeking
a second term in the 14th Council District, which includes parts of
Eagle Rock, Mt. Washington and Boyle Heights. Pacheco raised $237,538
during the first six months of 2002. Challenger Alvin Parra, who
works for Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, raised nearly
$101,700.</TE>
<TE>   In the six-way race to represent the 12th Council District in the
north San Fernando Valley, the chief of staff to outgoing Councilman
Hal Bernson raised the most money.</TE>
<TE>   Greig Smith has collected more than $112,000 to succeed Bernson,
who was first elected to the City Council in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Among Smith's supporters is Larry Calemine, the executive officer
of the Local Agency Formation Commission, which evaluated the
viability of the San Fernando Valley as a city. Calemine and his
wife, Camille, each gave Smith $250, as did LAFCO Deputy Executive
Officer Sandor Winger. Winger also serves as president of the North
Valley Area Planning Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills builder Rob Vinson reported raising $22,708.</TE>
<TE>   Ethics officials were awaiting campaign statements late Wednesday
from three of the six candidates in Holden's 10th Council District,
which includes Koreatown and other parts of the mid-city area.</TE>
<TE>   In that race, Holden aide Deron Williams reported raising nearly
$53,000 and Madison Shockley II, a pastor and writer, listed about
$36,000 in donations.</TE>
<TE>   Reggie Jones-Sawyer, a manager at the city's General Services
Department, reported raising $19,000.</TE>

<HD>Woman Facing New Trial Is Ordered Freed</HD>
<DH>Court: A prosecutor calls the U.S. panel's ruling unusual.
The jurists had overturned the Sacramento woman's 1986 murder
conviction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four months after overturning a Sacramento woman's murder conviction,
a federal appeals court Wednesday ordered her released on bail
pending a new trial in the two-decade-old case.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco directed a
federal judge in Sacramento to hold a hearing within 30 days to set
conditions for the release of Gloria Killian. She has been in state
prison since 1986 for masterminding the 1981 murder of a Sacramento
coin dealer.</LD>
<LD>   In March, the 9th Circuit ruled 3 to 0 that Killian was entitled
to a new trial, saying that her conviction was based on false
testimony by a convict who hoped for a lighter sentence in return for
helping prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   Patrick J. Whalen, a deputy state attorney general who had asked
the court not to grant bail, called the 9th Circuit's action "very
unusual."</TE>
<TE>   "In Sacramento, there is no bail" when someone is charged with
murder, Whalen said.</TE>
<TE>   But Killian's appellate lawyer, William Genego of Santa Monica,
said she clearly was entitled to bail.</TE>
<TE>   The legal standard is that the individual is entitled to bail
"unless the court finds the person is dangerous or a flight risk,"
Genego said.</TE>
<TE>   Genego also said that a Sacramento judge had granted bail to
Killian when she originally was charged with the crime years ago "and
she stuck around for trial."</TE>
<TE>   The veteran defense lawyer said he would attempt to get the
hearing set as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Genego said he expected that Joyce Ride of Pasadena, the mother of
America's first woman astronaut, Sally Ride, would testify at the
bail hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Ride met Killian years ago in a goodwill visit to the California
Institute of Women, became convinced of her innocence and hired a
private investigator to look into the case. Ride has offered to
provide a home for Killian when she is released.</TE>
<TE>   Killian, now 56, had nearly completed law school at the time of
her trial. While in prison, she has helped a number of inmates with
their legal problems.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-March a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit ruled
unanimously that Killian was entitled to a new trial. Writing for the
court, Judge Michael D. Hawkins, a former prosecutor, described Gary
Masse, the sole witness against Killian, as a "thoroughly discredited
perjurer."</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins said that "because Masse perjured himself several times
and because he was the 'make or break witness' for the state, there
is a reasonable probability that, without all the perjury, the result
of the [trial] would have been different."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Christopher T. Cleeland, the Sacramento deputy
district attorney who prosecuted the case, said he was still
convinced of Killian's guilt.</TE>
<TE>   The California attorney general's office asked the 9th Circuit to
reconsider its ruling, but no action has been taken yet on that
motion.</TE>

<HD>Joel Oliansky, 66; TV and Film Writer Won Emmy for 'The
Law'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joel Oliansky, writer and director of such films as "The
Competition," starring Richard Dreyfuss and Amy Irving in 1980, and
writer of the television miniseries "The Law" and "Masada," has died.
He was 66.</LD>
<LD>   Oliansky, who also drafted the screenplay of the 1988 biopic
"Bird," about jazzman Charlie Parker, died Monday in Los Angeles of
heart failure, said his sister, literary agent Lynn Pleshette.</LD>
<LD>   The writer's scripting of the 1970 TV program "The Senator,"
starring Hal Holbrook, earned an Emmy, and "Masada," with Peter
O'Toole, earned Oliansky a Writers Guild Award. His efforts on "The
Law," starring Judd Hirsch, earned Emmy, Writers Guild and Humanitas
awards.</LD>
<TE>   Born in New York City, Oliansky earned a bachelor's degree at
Hofstra University and a master's at Yale. He was playwright in
residence at Yale before coming to Hollywood in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   His considerable directing credits include episodes of the TV
series "Emergency," "Kojak," "Quincy," "Bring 'Em Back Alive,"
"Alfred Hitchcock Presents" and the specials "The Silence at Bethany"
and "In Defense of a Married Man."</TE>
<TE>   Oliansky was best known for his writing, which includes a play,
"Bedford Forrest," produced at the Eugene O'Neill Festival, and a
1966 novel, "Shame, Shame on the Johnson Boys!" about the folk music
boom.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the importance of technical research to his
screenwriting while working on "The Law," Oliansky told The Times he
had observed and consulted a public defender, but that "It's human
involvement and dramatic license that shapes the story."</TE>
<TE>   Oliansky expected to follow his modest success with "The
Competition," a film about two classical pianists falling in love at
a San Francisco music contest, by writing and directing a
biographical movie about Parker.</TE>
<TE>   A jazz buff, Oliansky had heard the sax player perform in 1955. He
had talked with Parker's former wife, Rebecca; his last companion,
Chan; and a trumpeter, Red Rodney, who had played with Parker.
Oliansky wrote what he acknowledged was an overly long draft
screenplay that would have run three hours. He held out hopes of
directing the Parker movie when Richard Pryor expressed an interest
in playing the innovative saxophonist.</TE>
<TE>   But Pryor backed out. Several directors were approached and the
property switched studios. "Bird" was finally made by Warner Bros.,
starring Forest Whitaker and directed by Clint Eastwood.</TE>
<TE>   Although Oliansky clearly admired Eastwood, he also regretted
having so little control over the finished product. If he couldn't
direct, he told The Times in 1988, he at least would have preferred
to rework his own script.</TE>
<TE>   "Eastwood knows as much about jazz as I do, if not more," Oliansky
said when the film was released. "He has as much passion for jazz as
I do, if not more. Where we may differ is in how much we know about
screenplays. Eastwood cut 20 pages from my script and he did a
wonderful job. But what I saw was a film of my first draft."</TE>
<TE>   A favorable Times review of the film noted that Oliansky had
"deftly constructed the script along jazz lines."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his sister, Oliansky is survived by two children.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is scheduled for 1 p.m. Aug. 9 at the Catalina
Bar &amp; Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ernest Watanabe, 91, the largest flower wholesaler and rose grower in
Hawaii whose floral business earned him the nickname the "Rose King
of Hawaii," died Sunday at his home in Honolulu of natural causes.</LD>
<LD>   Watanabe built the one-acre farm his father operated in the 1920s
into a multimillion-dollar business that supplies most of the 300
florists in Hawaii, as well as hotels and restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   His company grows roses on eight acres of greenhouses in Waimea on
the island of Hawaii and sells them through a division called Rose
Connection.</LD>
<TE>   On Oahu it produces other flowers, including pompom chrysanthemums
and dendrobium orchids. It also imports blossoms from California, the
Pacific Northwest, Mexico, South America and New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   Watanabe was born on Maui. He earned a chemistry degree from the
University of Hawaii at Manoa in 1934, then went to work as a
$120-a-week chemist for the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Assn.</TE>
<TE>   After service in World War II, he entered the rose business with
$10,000 from his parents. In 1945 his roses were the only commercial
rosebushes in the state.</TE>

<HD>Maurice Denham, 92; British Radio, TV Actor Had 'a Thousand
Voices'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Maurice Denham, 92, a durable British character actor whose voice and
face were more easily recognized than his name on both sides of the
Atlantic, died July 24 in London of natural causes.</LD>
<LD>   The son of a dentist, Denham became an apprentice engineer but
always wanted to act. He joined a repertory company in 1934, and
within two years was on the London stage. But radio became his
principal metier, with the "man of a thousand voices" first heard on
a 1938 BBC broadcast about the history of flight.</LD>
<LD>   Denham made his reputation with two much-loved BBC radio classics
in the 1940s, "It's That Man Again" and, after his four years as an
army artillery officer during World War II, in "Much Binding in the
Marsh." His credits included about 1,000 radio broadcasts, 100 films
and countless television programs as he voiced a panoply of
characters from the pigs of "Animal Farm" to crooks, clergy and
kings.</LD>
<TE>   To Americans, he is remembered for a key role in the television
series "Rumpole of the Bailey" and in such movies as "The Day of the
Jackal" and "Our Man in Havana." Denham was awarded the Order of the
British Empire in 1992.</TE>

<HD>Harry Quadracci, 66; Printing Firm Made Him Among Richest
in U.S.</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harry V. Quadracci, founding president of Quad Graphics, which prints
mail-order catalogs and such magazines as Newsweek, Time and Playboy,
died Monday in an accidental drowning in Pine Lake near his home in
Chenequa, Wis. He was 66.</LD>
<LD>   With a simple business plan of "Think Small," Quadracci started
his company in 1971 in an abandoned Pewaukee, Wis., factory with 11
employees and a $35,000 second mortgage on his house. The company now
has 14,000 workers, about $2 billion in annual sales and 15 plants on
three continents. Quadracci regularly found himself on the Forbes
list of the 400 richest Americans.</LD>
<LD>   In a 1998 speech to key Wisconsin chief executive officers,
Quadracci advised: "The key is to be the best in your business.
Niche-manship and being highly specialized are important. Do not set
out to be No. 2.... Take care of your supervisors and ... know your
employees.... Business is the world's most competitive sport. Success
is not guaranteed."</LD>
<TE>   Quadracci had worked ceaselessly since a 10-story company storage
building burned down in early July, killing one of his employees.</TE>
<TE>   With his wife, Betty, publisher of Milwaukee magazine, Quadracci
became a generous philanthropist. In 1997, the couple pledged $10
million for expansion of the Milwaukee Art Museum.</TE>

<HD>Boy, 8, Dies After Apparent Fall From Bin</HD>

<LD>An 8-year-old Oxnard boy has died after sustaining head injuries when
he apparently fell off a large trash bin, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony Smith was injured July 23 behind his family's apartment.
He died Monday at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony had taken a bag of trash out to the bin when, authorities
believe, he climbed on top of the bin and fell. His stepmother found

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight people were arrested Wednesday after they allegedly tried to
change vehicle identification numbers and buy phony DMV registration
documents from undercover police officers during a sting operation,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests capped a four-month investigation.</LD>
<LD>   Arrested were Eric Huerta, 28, of Costa Mesa; his mother,
Margarita Garcia Huerta, 54, of Lakewood; his sister Jennifer Emma
Huerta, 22, of Lakewood; Chad Nakosone, 29, of Irvine; Sean Michael
Brantley, 31, of Mission Viejo; Oscar Sanchez, 32, of Costa Mesa;
Alexander Paleo, 20; and Christian Sanchez, 26, of Hawthorne.</LD>
<TE>   They are being held at Santa Ana Jail.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Pete Pierce said suspects handed over their
cars to alleged ringleaders Eric Huerta and Nakosone, who switched
the vehicle identification numbers and provided fake DMV records.</TE>
<TE>   "The members wouldn't report the cars stolen until after Huerta
does the information switches," Pierce said. That way, he said, they
got insurance money for the car while also reselling the vehicle.</TE>

29-year-old gang member convicted of killing a UC Irvine student in
1994.</LD>

<LD>A sales tax on launches could hurt commercial space launches from
Vandenberg Air Force Base.</LD>
<LD>   Exemption from the tax for satellite and other commercial launches
may fall victim to the state's budget troubles. The California Space
Authority notified its members of the "threat" to the exemption for
commercial space missions, and it urged them to contact elected
officials.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Daniels, director of state and local government relations for
the California Space Authority, said the commercial space incentive
was among sales-tax exemptions cited by lawmakers looking to balance
California's budget.</LD>
<TE>   A launch sales tax would add about $8 million annually to state
coffers, or about $1 million per liftoff.</TE>

<LD>The city's biggest card club was ordered to begin closing its tables
from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Read Ambler ordered the card club Bay 101 to
adhere to the city's restrictions starting Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ambler's decision upheld a 1999 ordinance banning round-the-clock
gambling, and gave the city more power in regulating clubs that some
officials said promote crime and gambling addictions.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Ron Gonzalez said Tuesday that he plans to pursue his goal
of shutting down the city's card clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very pleased and hope we can move on to the next stage to
phase the card rooms out," Gonzalez told the San Jose Mercury News.
"It's important for the safety of our community."</TE>

<LD>A citizens group has filed suit against the town of Truckee in an
effort to stop development of the 900-acre Old Greenwood resort.</LD>
<LD>   The Mountain Area Preservation Foundation said in a lawsuit filed
last week that the town did not comply with state planning, zoning
and environmental laws in approving the project.</LD>
<LD>   The suit says that the town's general plan lacks required
standards for an "open-space recreation" designation, which covers
most of the resort, and that the project itself doesn't follow the
general plan.</LD>

<LD>Historians are still hoping to save the 71-year-old Salinas jailhouse
from demolition after the Monterey County Board of Supervisors voted
to tear it down to make way for offices.</LD>
<LD>   The building has been empty for 20 years.</LD>
<LD>   Some asked the supervisors to save the jail, saying it was
culturally important because Cesar Chavez was jailed there in 1970
over a court order involving the right of strikers to assemble.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Kennedy's widow, Ethel, made her way through anti-union
demonstrators in front of the jail to visit Chavez there.</TE>
<TE>   But county officials say there are other memorials to Chavez,
including a library and a school.</TE>
<TE>   They say the old jail is structurally unstable, and filled with
asbestos, mold and lead-based paint.</TE>

<HD>C. Wysocki, 73; Art Portrayed a Primitive, Pure America</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Wysocki, a painter whose idealized depictions of American
life have adorned everything from calendars to collector plates, died
of organ failure Monday at the USC Research Hospital. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   His death followed complications from surgery for a longtime
stomach ailment.</LD>
<LD>   Wysocki was a Detroit native and commercial illustrator who began
full-time painting in the early 1960s. His art celebrates the
American past, featuring rosy-cheeked families in clapboard houses
set in unspoiled landscapes. He embedded an American flag in every
scene.</LD>
<TE>   His acrylic originals have sold for as much as $30,000, and his
fans have been known to stand for hours in a driving rain for a
chance to meet him.</TE>
<TE>   Avoiding traditional galleries for a more commercial approach, he
built a merchandising empire that put his artwork on jigsaw puzzles,
greeting cards, wallpaper, mugs, popcorn tins and T-shirts. By the
1980s, his products were bringing in more than $7 million in annual
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Gus Walbolt, whose Concord, Calif., company, AMCAL, began
publishing "The Americana Calendar by Charles Wysocki" in 1975, said
the artist's success was due in part to timing.</TE>
<TE>   "Following the Vietnam War, there was a void. You just couldn't
find everyday items reflecting a positive image of America," Walbolt
said. "Then along came Chuck, who offered paintings of rural America
and New England coastal scenes that were charming and upbeat. Every
one of them included an American flag. They were unlike anything else
done at that time."</TE>
<TE>   Wysocki was the son of an immigrant autoworker and grew up in a
Polish enclave of Detroit. After a two-year stint with the Army in
Germany, he moved to Los Angeles and studied to become a commercial
illustrator at the Art Center, now Art Center College of Design in
Pasadena. He formed his own advertising agency in the late 1950s
called Group West, which served clients such as Carnation, Chrysler
and Dow Chemical.</TE>
<TE>   He turned full time to producing his own art after marrying
Elizabeth Lawrence, a UCLA art history graduate and descendant of a
San Fernando Valley pioneer family. She introduced him to then-rural
parts of the Valley and New England, which inspired Wysocki to begin
painting scenes in a primitive style.</TE>
<TE>   He was a favorite artist of Ronald Reagan, who hung one of
Wysocki's homespun New England scenes in his office when he was
California governor. In 1995, Wysocki had a show of 33 original
paintings at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda.
His painting of Nixon and his brothers at their birthplace has been
reproduced on T-shirts and note cards by the presidential library.</TE>
<TE>   He was snubbed by the art world as being too commercial. Anne
Lamott, in a 1994 review of Wysocki's art book, "Heartland," cited
his vision of America (a place "where things make sense and love
holds ... the past as it ought to have been") as "the most
beautifully concise description of kitsch I can imagine."</TE>
<TE>   Wysocki said he was proud of his mass market success.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the fact that I appeal to the average guy, and that my
calendar, prints and other products are enjoyed by millions," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wysocki moved to Lake Arrowhead in the 1990s and opened his own
gallery.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife; sons, David and Matt; and daughter,
Millie.</TE>

<LD>Regal Entertainment Group, the largest U.S. movie-theater chain, had
a fiscal second-quarter profit of $38.7 million as ticket sales rose.</LD>
<LD>   The firm had net income of 9 cents a share in its quarter ended
June 27, compared with a net loss of $1.2 million, or 7 cents, in the
year-earlier period, Regal said in a statement. Sales rose more than
fourfold to $607.3 million from $128.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz created Regal by merging
three companies he acquired through bankruptcy reorganizations: Regal
Cinemas Corp., United Artists Theatre Co. and Edwards Theatres Inc.
Regal operates 553 theaters under those three names.</LD>

<HD>A Texas-Sized Win for Rangers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After pounding one of baseball's top pitchers and setting season
highs for hits and runs, the Texas Rangers had plenty to celebrate.</LD>
<LD>   They also had something to ponder: What took so long?</LD>
<LD>   A lineup built to bash did plenty of it Wednesday night at
Arlington, Texas, roughing up Mike Mussina and routing the New York
Yankees, 17-6.</LD>
<TE>   Alex Rodriguez hit his major league-leading 36th home run during a
second-inning burst that featured seven extra-base hits, tying a
modern record last done by the Yankees in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   The other six hits in the inning were all doubles, matching an
American League mark last done in 1934.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Kevin Mench had four of Texas' 21 hits and Mike Lamb scored
four times.</TE>
<TE>   "We were like Mike Tyson hitting an opponent," Rafael Palmeiro
said, emphasizing his words with a pretend uppercut. "Some nights
you're going to get clobbered and some nights you do the clobbering.
Tonight was one of those where everything went well."</TE>
<TE>   In ending a three-game losing streak, Texas won for only the third
time in the last 10 home games and only the sixth time in 25 tries
against the Yankees at The Ballpark in Arlington.</TE>
<TE>   "This happened so quickly, you have to shrug it off," said
Mussina, who gave up seven runs and 11 hits in three innings. "Six
doubles in one inning hasn't been done in, what, 60 years? It was
their day to be playing and not ours."</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 5, Detroit 2--Bret Boone hit a three-run homer in the
fifth inning as the Mariners put together their first three-game home
sweep of the Tigers in 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   Boone hit his 15th homer of the season on the first pitch he saw
from starter Brian Powell (1-1). The two-out shot to the right-field
bleachers scored Carlos Guillen, who led off with a single, and John
Olerud, who walked with two out before Boone came to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Boone has three homers and 14 runs batted in since the All-Star
break.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 12, Tampa Bay 2--Rodrigo Lopez became the first Oriole
pitcher in 23 years to win six consecutive decisions in a month with
a victory at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez (12-3) gave up one run and six hits over six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore's Chris Richard homered on the first major league pitch
he saw this season to lead off the second inning.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 6, Cleveland 4--Mark Ellis singled home Terrence Long with
the go-ahead run in the eighth inning as the Athletics avoided a
sweep at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Mulder (12-6) recovered from a rocky second inning to win for
the 10th time in 13 starts as the A's salvaged one victory against
Cleveland after two narrow losses.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 9, Kansas City 2--Eric Hinske hit a two-run homer and
Dewayne Wise drove in three runs for the Blue Jays at Kansas City,
Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Hinske hit his 18th homer after Shannon Stewart led off the game
with a single off Shawn Sedlacek (1-2). Hinske is two homers shy of
the team's rookie record set by Fred McGriff in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 2, Chicago 1--David Ortiz hit an RBI single in the
bottom of the 10th inning to give the Twins the victory at
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz's hit came after Antonio Osuna (5-2) intentionally walked
Corey Koskie to load the bases.</TE>

<HD>Angels Add Ochoa for Depth</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Veteran will be reserve outfielder and
right-handed pinch-hitter. Fabregas sent to Brewers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Angels convinced that their roster needed nothing more than
a little tinkering, they acquired outfielder Alex Ochoa from the
Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday in a five-player trade succinctly
analyzed by outfielder Tim Salmon.</LD>
<LD>   "It gives us something we didn't have," Salmon said. "We didn't
lose much. So it's a good deal."</LD>
<LD>   In exchange for Ochoa, acquired as a backup outfielder and
right-handed pinch-hitter, and minor league catcher Sal Fasano, the
Angels gave up reserve catcher Jorge Fabregas and two minor leaguers
to be named.</LD>
<TE>   If the trade was modest, so was the price. In dollars, the cost to
the Angels was $750,000, the difference between what Ochoa and
Fabregas will earn over the final two months of the season. In
prospects, there was virtually no cost to the Angels. By Sept. 20,
the Brewers can choose two minor leaguers from a list provided by the
Angels, but several sources said that no top prospects will be on
that list.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa, 30, is hitting .256 with six home runs, three of which came
in his first 10 at-bats of the season. He has a good arm and good
speed, and as a pinch-hitter he has five hits in 15 at-bats for the
last-place Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad the Angels wanted me," he said. "It will be exciting to
be in a pennant race. Hopefully, I can go there and contribute."</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa is making $2.75 million this season and is eligible for free
agency this fall.</TE>
<TE>   As a player whose promise has exceeded his production, he has been
traded seven times, the first time for Bobby Bonilla in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels said they would do little before Wednesday's trading
deadline, and their word was good. They were pleasantly surprised
when the Seattle Mariners did nothing all week and the Oakland A's
did nothing Wednesday after picking up second baseman Ray Durham and
reliever Ricardo Rincon in the last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels searched for relievers and reserve outfielders, but
they refused to trade top prospects or add significantly to their
payroll. The Cleveland Indians had indicated they would not pay any
of the $2.2 million owed to Rincon this season and next; the Kansas
City Royals had indicated they would not pay any of the $2 million
owed to closer Roberto Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers wanted to dump salary and agreed to the trade
Wednesday morning, after learning that no team would assume Ochoa's
contract and provide a top prospect as well.</TE>
<TE>   They accepted Fabregas, sources said, in the hope that they might
later trade him should a contender need a veteran catcher who hits
left-handed.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels then took Fasano, a journeyman who will play at
triple-A Salt Lake City as insurance against injury to Bengie and
Jose Molina.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Fabregas, the Brewers have catchers Paul Bako and
Robert Machado on the major league roster and Raul Casanova on
rehabilitation assignment. If they cannot trade any of their
catchers, they might release Fabregas.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a team that was contending, and I felt like I was a big
part of this team," Fabregas said. "That's what hurts the most. I
went through the struggles last year. I'd like to go through the good
times, especially if this team goes to the playoffs."</TE>

<LD>Benjamin Molina was a pretty good baseball player in his day, the
all-time hit leader in the Puerto Rican amateur league. But a father
always wants better for his children, and so Wednesday was a
particularly touching day for Molina, when the Angels decided that
their two major league catchers would be two of his sons.</LD>
<LD>   Bengie Molina, 28, and Jose Molina, 27, have previously played
together only because of injury. But, with Wednesday's trade that
sent Jorge Fabregas to the Milwaukee Brewers for outfielder Alex
Ochoa, Bengie is the Angels' starting catcher and Jose is the backup.</LD>
<LD>   "For our family, and from where we came from, this is very nice
and very special," Bengie said. "I'm very happy."</LD>
<TE>   The brothers expressed sadness at the departure of Fabregas, a
friend. But they were thrilled at the chance to stick together,
particularly since the news came at a time their father, mother and
two cousins are visiting from Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   Jose has played professionally for 10 seasons but has not played a
full season in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bengie is expected to be activated tonight, after a one-game
rehabilitation appearance Tuesday with Class-A Rancho Cucamonga. He
caught six innings as scheduled, but he was reluctant to leave the
game because Pedro Liriano was throwing a no-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Molina did come out, not wanting to risk a recurrence of his
hamstring injury. Liriano, 21, gave up a single in the seventh inning
and finished with a one-hitter.</TE>

<LD>Norman Chad of America Online wonders if WNBA players decide to
strike, will anyone care?</LD>
<LD>   "In its start-up days, the WNBA's slogan was, 'We Got Next.' These
days, the players' slogan is, 'We Got Next to Nothing.' I kind of
think the first slogan is catchier.</LD>
<LD>   "Ah, but in yet another sign of the times--gosh, wouldn't it be
nice if we could finally have a sign of some other times, say, like
the 1890s--WNBA players are thinking about a strike.</LD>

<TE>   Chump change: Jon Heyman of Newsday, on baseball's labor
negotiations: "Once you sort through the overwrought rhetoric and all
the egos fatter than their wallets, then strip this down to the
sides' essential difference (yes, the monetary discrepancy), you'd
notice we're talking about peanuts here. Maybe not peanuts to me and
you. But peanuts to them."</TE>

<TE>   Generation gap: Racing legend Mario Andretti has driven against
both his sons, Michael and Jeff, and his nephew John. Now he's hoping
to do the same with his grandson Marco, who is 15.</TE>

that could definitely be the impossible dream."</TE>

<TE>   Head case: From David Whitley of the Orlando Sentinel: "According
to media reports, which are never wrong, Barry Bonds' hat size grew
by two sizes last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Medical experts say that kind of skull expansion for a
37-year-old man can only happen if he is taking steroids, or he's
paid $18 million and allowed exclusive use of three lockers, a lounge
chair, a television and a personal trainer and French chef in the

wants to play in the NFL until he's 50 and shatter the standard set
by quarterback-kicker George Blanda, who played until he was 48.</TE>
<TE>   "It's attainable if I stay healthy," said Andersen, soon to be 42.
"I still love this game. I still love the camaraderie and the
competition. The NFL is a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Teetotalers: According to a survey conducted by ESPN.com and a
marketing firm, 55% of Southland fans drink beer while they watch
sports, fewer than in any other U.S. major market.</TE>

<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1978, Pete Rose of the Cincinnati
Reds went 0 for 4 against Atlanta to end his hitting streak at 44
games, the longest since Joe DiMaggio's record 56-game streak in
1941, in a 16-4 loss to the Braves.</TE>

<TE>   Trivia answer: Davey Lopes, with 63 in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Rookie quarterback David Carr, the NFL's No. 1 draft
pick, is making a strong impression in his first training camp with
the expansion Houston Texans, writes Fran Blinebury of the Houston
Chronicle:</TE>
<TE>   "It is not the [passes] Carr can drop into the hands of sprinting
receivers that have offensive coordinator Chris Palmer smiling. It is
[Carr's] reading of defenses and [his] understanding of what the
Texans are trying to do."</TE>
<TE>   Said Palmer: "The great players in all sports--a Jordan, a
Gretzky--have vision about the game that is beyond the average
player's. David seems to be that way."</TE>

<LD>   What: "True Commitment: College Football's Other Season"</LD>
<LD>   When: Today, 4 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Where: ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   College football, played in the fall, has become a year-round
sport. There are winter workouts, spring practices and summer
workouts. The winter and summer workouts are supposed to be
voluntary, and only strength and conditioning coaches can be present.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN's "Outside the Lines" examines these so-called "voluntary"
workouts in this one-hour program. Last year three players died
during these workouts--Northwestern's Rashidi Wheeler, Florida
State's DeVaughn Darling and Florida's Eraste Autin.</TE>
<TE>   The show's first segment looks at Arizona's "voluntary" workout
program. Safety Clay Hardt says, "It's voluntary to a point. It's
voluntary to where there are no rules anywhere that say, 'You have to
be here.' But in my point, it's mandatory. It's just the unwritten
law."</TE>
<TE>   Brad Arnett, Arizona's strength coach, is shown warning players
about not showing up on time. "If a teammate is late, you hold him
accountable," he says. "Get your ... out of bed and get here on
time."</TE>
<TE>   The strength coaches are not allowed to tell head coaches who is
participating and who isn't. Arnett says he abides by that rule, but
at the start of fall practice he gives Coach John Mackovic a report.</TE>
<TE>   Mackovic says such a report is permitted, but an NCAA official
says it is not.</TE>
<TE>   Another segment features Stanford junior defensive end Drew
Caylor, a prospective starter. Caylor missed his summer workouts,
opting instead to intern at Morgan Stanley in his hometown of
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a college football player is something you do; it's not all
you do," Caylor says.</TE>
<TE>   That attitude, as this show points out, is lost on most of those
involved in college football.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Pitching Has Been Bumpy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid and Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger pitching coach Jim Colborn said the staff is only experiencing
a "bump in the road," though it appears to be a big bump.</LD>
<LD>   The group had an outstanding 3.56 earned-run average in the first
half as the club took the NL West lead. In 19 games since the
All-Star break, the Dodgers have a 4.81 ERA and several starters
struggled in July.</LD>
<LD>   The team is batting .257 and averaging 3.6 runs during that span
after hitting .263 and averaging 4.4 runs in the first half, so the
offense hasn't done much to compensate for pitching woes. But the
Dodgers acknowledge they have holes offensively, which is why they
built the club on a foundation of pitching.</LD>
<TE>   Is the foundation cracked?</TE>
<TE>   "They threw so well in the first half, it's tough to keep that up
the whole year," catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "We're also not giving
them a lot to work with, and pitchers are trying to make perfect
pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Colborn agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a little bit of that," he said. "There are times, in
the first inning, when we're carefully pitching around a guy with
first base open. That wouldn't happen if you knew you were going to
get five or six runs, but I don't think it's affected them too
negatively overall."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby (0-3, 6.75 ERA), Odalis Perez (0-3, 7.16) and Kazuhisa
Ishii (1-2, 5.16) are in the worst post-All-Star slumps.</TE>
<TE>   "The product of a good season is the handling of various slumps,
and making proper adjustments as they're needed," Colborn said. "When
this season is done, it will end up being a strong season, but it's
not just a product of smooth sailing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans made a late push to acquire All-Star
center fielder Randy Winn from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays before
Wednesday's non-waiver trading deadline, baseball sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Evans declined comment on the trade talks, but sources said Tampa
Bay General Manager Chuck LaMar asked for current members of the
25-man roster that the Dodgers would not trade. Winn was batting .322
with 32 doubles, eight home runs, 48 runs batted in and 21 stolen
bases beginning play Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   There would have been a logjam in the outfield had Evans acquired
Winn, 28, who cannot become a free agent until after the 2004 season,
but that would have been a good problem for the struggling Dodgers.</TE>

<KH>GOLF THOMAS BONK</KH>
<HD>Viewers No Longer Primed for Tiger?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All right, the golf was better than last year, but the facts are that
the national Nielsen ratings for the "Battle at Bighorn," Monday
night's made-for-TV golf show starring Tiger Woods, Jack Nicklaus,
Sergio Garcia and Lee Trevino on ABC, dropped from 6.1 to 5.1 (and
both ABC and IMG were mystified), so what does that mean?</LD>
<LD>   It's possible that we've got a case of overexposure right here.</LD>
<LD>   It's possible that regardless of the format--Tiger vs. somebody,
Tiger and an LPGA player vs. somebody else and another LPGA player,
or even Monday night's matchup of two teams of
superstar-with-superstar geezer--enough is enough already.</LD>
<TE>   Can you remember anyone saying we don't have enough golf on
television? That we don't see enough of Tiger on TV?</TE>
<TE>   If you have been paying close attention, he's pretty much all that
we do see.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger playing golf. Previews of Tiger playing golf. Taped
highlights of Tiger playing golf. Tiger selling cars. Tiger selling
golf clubs and balls.</TE>
<TE>   And players wearing microphones while they play isn't new anymore,
if that's what passes for cutting-edge golf programming these days.
The point is, the golf has to be something unusual, something
compelling, something you can't get anywhere else if it is going to
score a ratings hit in prime time with many viewers who are casual
golf fans at best.</TE>
<TE>   Even for the more ardent golf fans, there might be a saturation
point when the novelty of the event wears off, regardless of the
quality of play, which was high enough Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But that may be the reason for a 33% decline in the ratings, from
a 7.6 in 2000, to a 6.1 in 2001 to the 5.1 national rating from
Monday's telecast.</TE>
<TE>   Here's an idea: A Senior PGA Tour player against an LPGA player,
golf's version of Bobby Riggs vs. Billie Jean King.</TE>
<TE>   But that wouldn't include Tiger, and Tiger is the deal right now,
in this game. Another 33% drop, and this show should be over.</TE>
<TE>   Suggestion Box</TE>
<TE>   It's true, next year's event will move from Bighorn Country Club
in Palm Desert, thus ending the "Battle at Bighorn" series, and
relocate to the Bridges at Rancho Santa Fe, where it will be renamed
the "Battle at the Bridges."</TE>
<TE>   As long as this thing is staged at golf courses that start with
the letter "B," they're going to be all right in the "battle"
alliteration game, but you have to wonder what titles they didn't
choose.... "Rumble at Rancho"? Don King probably has the rights to
that one. Or "Every Which Way at Rancho Santa Fe."</TE>
<TE>   They have time to think about it.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   Why it's good to have your own jet: Woods is going to be a very
busy player toward the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In a span of 18 days, Tiger will play four events--in Japan,
Hawaii, Indio and Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   He has the Dunlop Phoenix tournament in Miyazaki, Japan, Nov.
21-24; the PGA Grand Slam of Golf, Nov. 26-27, in Koloa, Kauai; the
Skins Game, Nov. 30-Dec. 1, at Landmark Golf Club; and his own
tournament, the Target World Challenge, Dec. 5-8, at Sherwood Country
Club.</TE>
<TE>   Smackdown</TE>
<TE>   News item: CBS, which is broadcasting the Tour de France, asks on
its Web site whether Tiger or Lance Armstrong has had the most
impressive accomplishments and Armstrong wins by more than a 3-1
margin.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Really? Next time, on the WWE Web site, during pro
wrestling telecasts, let's put Lance up against the Rock and see who
comes out on top.</TE>
<TE>   Closing Numbers</TE>
<TE>   Annika Sorenstam has won seven times this year and 38 times in her
LPGA career, but she couldn't close the deal last week at the Sybase
Big Apple Classic in New Rochelle, N.Y. The record shows that
Sorenstam is still a decent closer: she's 23 for 39 when leading
after three rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Time Out</TE>
<TE>   The last word on the British Open was that it was, well, timely.
The average round time for the 52 threesomes for Thursday was four
hours 30 minutes and 4:34 on Friday. The 42 groups of twosomes for
Saturday's round, which was affected by bad weather, was 3:52, about
12 minutes over the optimum time established. On Sunday, the average
round time was 3:28.</TE>
<TE>   Vision Quest</TE>
<TE>   J. P. Hayes says he had a vision before last week's John Deere
Classic at Silvis, Ill. He told his caddie, Steve Kay, that he would
have a putt to win.</TE>
<TE>   "You mean the pro-am?" Kay asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No, the tournament," said Hayes, who was wrong. He won by four
shots, his second PGA Tour victory in his eight-year career.</TE>
<TE>   Hayes had only one bogey in four rounds. The last player to win a
72-hole event without a bogey was Trevino at the 1974 Greater New
Orleans Open.</TE>
<TE>   Equipment News</TE>
<TE>   News item: Hale Irwin shoots a closing 66 at the FleetBoston
Classic, playing the putter he used when he won the 1990 U.S. Open at
Medinah.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: The rest of his clubs are in a museum.</TE>
<TE>   Monty Update</TE>
<TE>   News item: Colin Montgomerie, who angrily says at Muirfield that
he won't play for a while because of media criticism, enters this
week's Volvo Scandinavian Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: He must have remembered that he's the defending champion
and it's worth $300,000 if he wins it again.</TE>
<TE>   Conjunction Malfunction</TE>
<TE>   It had to happen--a story that upset virtually everyone mentioned
in it. That would be Golf Digest's recent story on Mark Calcavecchia,
who candidly dissects the mostly frosty relationship between Woods
and Phil Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody is arguing that Calcavecchia didn't say what he did (" ...
half of what Phil says is complete BS" and "they put up with each
other"), but as it usually happens, it looks harsher in black and
white, which is why Woods and Mickelson are not happy with each other
and not happy with Calcavecchia, who is not happy with writer Jaime
Diaz. That's journalism for you.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder Cup Update</TE>
<TE>   It's not too early to start thinking about the Ryder Cup, which is
less than eight weeks away, after being postponed for a year because
of security concerns from last September.</TE>
<TE>   The list of players includes nine major championship
winners--eight on the U.S. team and only one, Bernhard Langer, on
Europe's team. But the real story is how the players' performances
have fluctuated since Sept. 2, 2001, when the European team's
qualification process ended.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a list of the players, with their current World Ranking
and then their ranking from Sept. 2 in parentheses.</TE>
<TE>   Europe: Garcia, 5 (7); Padraig Harrington, 8 (13); Darren Clarke,
14 (8); Montgomerie, 15 (10); Langer, 30 (21); Niclas Fasth, 32 (31);
Thomas Bjorn, 36 (20); Jesper Parnevik, 44 (22); Paul McGinley, 57
(40); Phillip Price, 85 (56); Pierre Fulke, 92 (44); Lee Westwood,
107 (16).</TE>
<TE>   U.S: Woods, 1 (1); Mickelson, 2 (2); David Toms, 6 (9); Davis Love
III, 7 (6); David Duval, 9 (3); Jim Furyk, 12 (11); Scott Verplank,
20 (26); Scott Hoch, 25 (12); Paul Azinger, 41 (15); Calcavecchia 43
(18); Stewart Cink, 48 (24); Hal Sutton, 99 (19).</TE>
<TE>   Birdies, Bogeys, Pars</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Wie, 12, of Honolulu, qualified for her third LPGA event,
this week's Wendy's Championship in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   A tournament to benefit Barlow Respiratory Hospital will be played
Friday at Robinson Ranch in Santa Clarita. Long-driving specialist
Mike Moulton will conduct a demonstration. Details: (213) 202-6816.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Carey, Don Ford, Willie Buchanon, Mitch Gaylord, Willie
Gault, Randy Jones, Mike Lansford, Dr. Sammy Lee, Pat McCormick and
Rogie Vachon are some of the celebrities expected to play in the
Ford/San Clemente Sunrise Rotary Club tournament Aug. 26 at Talega
Golf Club in San Clemente. The event benefits Laura's House, a
shelter for victims of domestic violence. Details: (760) 632-7770.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After winning three of his first five starts at Calder Race Course in
Florida,  3-year-old gelding Mighty David fell off the pace  after
arriving in California.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Chris Paasch and owned by a partnership that includes
Eastern Sky Unlimited Trust, Mighty David managed only one
second-place finish in his first four starts on this coast.</LD>
<LD>   Three races ago, Paasch removed the blinkers  and Mighty David
stepped up his game  July 10 at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<TE>   An 8-1 shot in a field of five that included the talented
comebacker Tribal Rule and the streaking 3-year-old Timely Action,
Mighty David battled through quick fractions (21 3/5 and 43 3/5) and
kept on digging to beat Tribal Rule by a neck. The final time for the
six furlongs was 1:08 1/5, the quickest clocking for the distance at
the Hollywood Park meet.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida-bred will try for his sixth lifetime win in today's
seventh at Del Mar. An optional claimer at 6 1/2 furlongs, the race
is part of a pick six that  has a carryover of $125,908.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the field is made up of Our Shining Hour,
McCordnskuba, Lebontempsroulet, Coded Message, Lookn East and
Tavasco.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Admiralty Arch, one of many promising 2-year-olds
trained by Todd Pletcher, makes his second start in today's seventh
at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Francisco Duran. The apprentice jockey led the
standings at Santa Rosa after the first six days of the meet.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Shaun Bridgmohan. The rider lost with 20 of his first
21 mounts at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using French Rebel and Macon
County in the second, singling Fleeting Term in the third and using
Morning Riser and Swingin Swiss in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/11. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $6.40/$77. Total money bet: $120.</TE>

<HD>Kariya Signs On for a Year</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Mighty Duck All-Star agrees to one season at $10
million and doesn't rule out eventual long-term deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks, engaged in an active off-season, took care of their
captain Wednesday, signing Paul Kariya to a one-year contract.</LD>
<LD>   Kariya, the team's all-time leading scorer, agreed to take his
qualifying offer of $10 million in base salary with bonuses added for
winning some of the NHL's top awards.</LD>
<LD>   "I want the team to continue to get better and I want to get back
to playing my game," Kariya said. "One year at a time is what I feel
comfortable with. I'm not ruling out a long-term deal, but at this
point going year to year is just fine with me."</LD>
<TE>   The Ducks are coming off two disappointing seasons and, although
Kariya, 27, will be a restricted free agent until he is 31 under the
current collective bargaining agreement, that agreement ends after
the 2002-03 season. The age a player becomes an unrestricted free
agent is expected to be highly contested in the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "There is pressure on the organization to improve and Paul wants
to see that as well," Duck General Manager Bryan Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Kariya is coming off the worst full season in his eight-year
career, although that says more about the talent level that
surrounded him than any decline in ability. He had 32 goals and 57
points, both team highs, but considerably low for a player who has
twice scored more than 100 points in a season.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks scored the second fewest goals in the NHL last season
and Kariya, who has always preached the team's party line, was
outwardly frustrated at times.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year was a nightmare for myself and the team," Kariya said.
"I don't want to just get back to where I was before, I want to be
better."</TE>
<TE>   Murray has sought to solve that problem with a flurry of moves
this off-season, acquiring center Adam Oates, defenseman Fredrick
Olausson and right wing Petr Sykora.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't remember when I've been so excited going into a season,"
Kariya said. "I know the team is going in the right direction. We
made the moves we needed to make. If we get things sorted out early,
we have the talent to be the No. 1 team in the league."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks still need to come to terms with center Matt Cullen,
defenseman Ruslan Salei, center Steve Rucchin and center Andy
McDonald. Cullen and Salei have filed for arbitration, with Cullen
almost certain to take that route.</TE>
<TE>   Murray said that left wing Timo Parssinen and defenseman
Antti-Jussi Niemi, the team's other two restricted free agents, may
not return next season.</TE>

<LD>Negotiators for baseball's owners and players narrowed differences on
the minimum salary and benefit plan Wednesday while leaving their
respective analysts to work over revised numbers on the central issue
of revenue sharing.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes, you get to a point on one subject where the numbers
are so complicated that you have to leave it to people who aren't at
the table to analyze and move on to another topic to keep your
momentum going," Rob Manfred, baseball's lead lawyer, said in
explaining why Wednesday's negotiations were spent on the benefit
plan and minimum salary.</LD>
<LD>   The owners had initially proposed raising the major league minimum
from $200,000 to $285,000, with annual cost-of-living increases. The
union proposed a $300,000 base, with annual increases of $25,000.</LD>
<TE>   "We're close. We still have some differences, but they appear to
be within a dimension that can be worked out," union lawyer Gene Orza
said.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, it isn't clear whether arbitrator Shyam Das will deliver
his delayed decision on the union's contraction grievance today as
expected.</TE>
<TE>   Manfred said he anticipated the decision, but Orza said he would
have expected Das to call Wednesday with a definitive word.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was initially expected in mid-July, but Das asked for
an extension until Aug. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Said Orza: "It was never Aug. 1 specifically, but on or about Aug.
1."</TE>

<LD>Ponderosa Ruby, who will make her fifth career start in tonight's
fifth race, holds a dubious and  unofficial title.</LD>
<LD>   Call the 2-year-old gray filly the biggest money burner of the
meet.</LD>
<LD>   In her first four races for owner Daniel Alvarez and trainer Jaime
Gomez, the Louisiana-bred daughter of Royal Quick Dash has been
beaten at 1-2, 5-2, 1-2 and 4-5.</LD>
<TE>   She has run well in all of her outings, finishing second three
times and third once.</TE>
<TE>   Ponderosa Ruby will shorten to 220 yards tonight, the distance of
her first race, and will be ridden by Rodrigo Aceves, the jockey  in
two of her starts.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Tinys Royal Hugger. 2. Excessive Gossip. 3.
Hurricane Juno. 4. Apollo Dash. 5. Red Hot Blitzer. 6. Dalkas. 7.
Chicky Do Run Run. 8. Failure To Comply.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Adriannas Cruisin, Ponderosa Ruby and Red Hot Blitzer in
the fifth, Jace My Ace and Dalkas in the sixth, Chicky Do Run Run and
Sheza Ramblin Too in the seventh and Failure To Comply, Contreras and
Another Shooter in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Dreams To Fill steps up after a claim in the
first and switches to leading rider Ramon Sanchez. Zoneout adds Lasix
in the second for trainer Blane Schvaneveldt.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Reflecting the economic climate and fear of a work stoppage, the
final hours of baseball's nonwaiver trade deadline failed to generate
the usual swap meet.</LD>
<LD>   The deadline came and went Wednesday, with the Angels' low-grade
acquisition of journeyman Milwaukee outfielder Alex Ochoa the
highlight, unless you're intrigued by the San Diego Padres cornering
the market on pitchers named Jones, reuniting the former New York
Mets, Bobby J. and Bobby M. Jones, in a deal that sent reliever Steve
Reed to New York for Bobby M.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, there were a few others.</LD>
<TE>   The Mets traded center fielder Jay Payton to Colorado, the Rockies
dealt former Dodger Todd Hollandsworth to Texas and Boston acquired
reliever Bobby Howry from the Chicago White Sox, but that was it.</TE>
<TE>   A total of five trades, not the kind of big-name, fast-paced
action usually associated with a trade deadline day.</TE>
<TE>   This is meant as no disrespect to any of the involved players,
particularly Ochoa, who provides Manager Mike Scioscia with the
right-handed-hitting outfielder he wanted on the bench, if leaving
General Manager Bill Stoneman vulnerable to criticism for failing to
improve a bullpen that has only one left-hander and apparently will
rely heavily on the comparatively untested Brendan Donnelly, Scot
Shields and Ben Weber down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, several big-name players had been traded already,
including Scott Rolen, Cliff Floyd, Bartolo Colon, Raul Mondesi, Ray
Durham and Kenny Lofton, but Wednesday's comparative calm may have
had more to do with widespread payroll restraints and a feeling among
many clubs that there was no sense trading a package of prospects for
a high-salaried player when the season may end at any time after
mid-August.</TE>
<TE>   Some general managers reached Wednesday disagreed, but one said:
"I don't think there's any question but that the labor situation
scared off some clubs.... There's not a lot of clubs willing to take
on salary, and the labor uncertainty compounds that. If the labor is
resolved quickly, you might see more trades than usual before the</TE>
<TE>   31st."</TE>
<TE>   He referred to Aug. 31. Any player acquired before then is
eligible for the postseason, but he would have to clear waivers
before joining another club.</TE>
<TE>   Who have been the winners and losers to this point?</TE>
<TE>   Winners</TE>
<TE>   * St. Louis Cardinals (Acquired Rolen and Chuck Finley): A happy
Rolen adds right-handed balance to the middle of an impressive
lineup, enables Albert Pujols to stay in left field and gives the
Cardinals six defenders of Gold Glove caliber. A good trade becomes a
great trade if the Cardinals can re-sign the free agent-eligible
Rolen to a multiyear contract, but that shouldn't be a problem. Rolen
wants to play in the Midwest, and players are generally quick to
sign--Mark McGwire and Jim Edmonds, for example--once they get a view
of the red army in Busch Stadium. Finley is in the twilight of a
resilient career, but he adds a healthy arm to a rotation traumatized
by injuries and the death of Darryl Kile.</TE>
<TE>   * Boston Red Sox (Acquired Cliff Floyd, Alan Embree and Howry):
The Red Sox didn't land a starting pitcher, but they enhanced a
suspect bullpen with Embree and Howry and filled a void behind Nomar
Garciaparra and Manny Ramirez with Floyd. The latter failed to
fulfill expectations in his brief return to Montreal and now must
quickly adjust to a new league, but he should, at least, give
pitchers pause as they work through the middle of the Boston lineup.
Equally important, perhaps, the Red Sox prevented the dreaded and
voracious New York Yankees from landing him.</TE>
<TE>   * Dodgers (Acquired Tyler Houston and Paul Shuey): Determined to
justify a $105-million payroll and end their playoff drought, the
Dodgers filled two immediate needs. It's all about this year and
next, when the Dodgers can begin unloading a few of their biggest and
most restrictive contracts. However, it may take longer to evaluate
the two trades. The Dodgers gave up pitcher Ben Diggins, Kevin
Malone's No. 1 draft choice of 2000, in the Houston trade, and
pitcher Ricardo Rodriguez, their No. 1 prospect, according to
Baseball America, in the Shuey trade. A still-thin farm system got
thinner, but others clearly evaluated the two pitchers higher than
the Dodgers' current regime, and both will be forgotten if the
Dodgers are still playing in October.</TE>
<TE>   * Yankees (Acquired Jeff Weaver and Mondesi): With a payroll of
$135 million and counting, the rich get richer and the players'
union, knowing who drives the salary market, continues its fight to
protect Yankee resources. Although Weaver has been hit hard in four
starts with New York and outpitched by Ted Lilly, who went from the
Bronx to Oakland in that three-way trade, he represents a sound,
26-year-old arm in a rotation handicapped by injury and age, and his
promise can be measured by the fact that he was probably the market's
most pursued pitcher before traded to the Yankees. Mondesi tends to
punch his own time clock, but he still brings considerable talent to
right field, and the framework of the Yankee clubhouse should help
provide a definition of focus--if anything ever does.</TE>
<TE>   Losers</TE>
<TE>   * Philadelphia: The Phillies might have done better with a
Cincinnati offer of third base prospect Brandon Larson and relief
pitcher Scott Williamson for Rolen, but Reds' owner Carl Lindner is
said to have withdrawn it amid concern over a strike beginning Aug.
16. The Phillies also might have done better trading Rolen last
winter, once he had rejected their $140-million offer, but they took
a chance that they could win with him, building on their second-place
division finish of last year. Ultimately, as Rolen feuded with fans,
manager and front office, questioning the overall commitment to
winning as Curt Schilling did before him, the Phillies had to get
what they could, which wasn't much, under duress: a quality utility
player in Placido Polanco, an inconsistent reliever in Mike Timlin
(whom they have been trying to trade) and starter Bud Smith, who had
disappointed the Cardinals with his performance and work ethic after
a promising debut last year.</TE>
<TE>   * White Sox: Flattened by Minnesota in the American League
Central, the White Sox have embarked on an unexpected overhaul,
trading Durham, Howry, Lofton and Sandy Alomar Jr. for a lot of young
players and the uncertainty that goes with them. They would love to
defuse a combustible clubhouse by trading Frank Thomas, but his value
has taken a bigger beating than even his team has.</TE>
<TE>   * Cleveland: The Indians, at least, knew from the start they were
in for an overhaul, and now Finley, Colon and Shuey have joined the
previously departed Roberto Alomar, Juan Gonzalez and Lofton. The
rebuilding project will need at least two years to sort out and would
have been more extensive if Cleveland had found takers for the
high-salaried Omar Vizquel and Ellis Burks. Give Jim Thome credit for
retaining his affection for the city and refusing to waive his
no-trade clause for any suitor. He will be the bridge between the old
and new Indians.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>ATP officials had to separate Andy Roddick and Nicolas Lapentti after
the American's 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (5) second-round victory over the
Ecuadorean at the Toronto Master Series ended in an ugly shouting
match Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   As the players left the court after a two-hour 18-minute encounter
played in searing heat, Lapentti accused Roddick of exaggerating leg
cramps late in the third set and of playing mind games.</LD>
<LD>   Officials stepped in to separate the pair as they argued at the
net and escorted a seething Lapentti off the court.</LD>
<TE>   "I think tennis is a sport where you have to be a gentleman," said
the unseeded Lapentti. "Andy is a great player and I told him that,
but I also told him you don't have to act like you're cramping to
take the match.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the first time he's done it. He did it against [Michael]
Chang at the French Open....</TE>
<TE>   "I'm saying he's faking it, he's playing with my mind. It's very
unsportsmanlike what he did. He tried to win with something else but
tennis.</TE>

<LD>Offensive tackle John Tait will miss two weeks of the Kansas City
Chiefs' training camp after a fight with a rookie teammate left him
with cuts that needed 17 stitches to close.</LD>
<LD>   Tait, the starting right tackle, also had his nose broken in the
fight with defensive lineman Eddie Freeman on Tuesday in River Falls,
Wis., and emerged from the scuffle bleeding from his eyebrow and
nose.</LD>
<LD>   "He had my helmet and hit me with it. It wasn't his fist," Tait
said Wednesday. "It's common knowledge he had my helmet in his hand
and he swung it back and hit me with it."</LD>
<TE>   Freeman, a second-round draft pick from Alabama-Birmingham, has
been involved in several scuffles since the Chiefs opened practice on
Friday. He was subdued Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the young new guy on the block. It was just in the heat of
battle," the 310-pound Freeman said. "I'm going to talk to him
today."</TE>
<TE>   Chief Coach Dick Vermeil said he had not talked with Freeman, whom
he called "a hothead."</TE>
<TE>   "But I talked with the team about it," Vermeil said. "Fights
happen in football. You never know who threw the first punch."</TE>
<TE>   Vermeil has said he did not plan any disciplinary action against
Freeman, but Tait wasn't sure he agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "He apologized to me yesterday. But it was right after it happened
and I couldn't talk to him at the time," Tait said. "It's not like I
want to kill Eddie. But I definitely think perhaps some disciplinary
action should be taken. Maybe even for myself."</TE>

<TE>   The Minnesota Vikings went through practice in Mankata, Minn., in
high heat and humidity--conditions eerily similar to those in which
Korey Stringer collapsed exactly a year ago. He died the next day.</TE>
<TE>   It's impossible for the Vikings to forget what happened and how
much they miss the man everyone called "Big K."</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a couple weeks here," receiver Randy Moss said, "so it

times."</TE>

<HD>Johnson Finds Old Form, Strikes Out 15</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Randy Johnson is back to his old self, and that's bad news for
National League batters.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson struck out 15 and threw 149 pitches at Montreal in
pitching his third complete game and the Arizona Diamondbacks
defeated the Expos, 5-1, on Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt locked in," said Johnson (15-4), who raised his strikeout
total to 215 and moved ahead of teammate Curt Schilling for the major
league lead.</LD>
<TE>   The four-time Cy Young Award winner, who pitched seven scoreless
innings to win his last start, had his second strong outing since
giving up eight runs in five innings in an 11-9 loss in San Diego on
July 21.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt my mechanics were much better in the last two starts,"
Johnson said. "It really was like night and day compared to my start
in San Diego. I watched some videotape of that game and worked hard
in between, and mentally I'm back where I need to be."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who beat the Padres, 2-0, on April 1 in Arizona's first
game of the season, gave up eight hits. He lost what would have been
his first shutout since opening day when Jose Macias drove in Andres
Galarraga in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   It was Johnson's first complete game since April 21. Johnson has
82 career complete games.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Gonzalez hit his 22nd homer off Masato Yoshii (2-4) leading
off the second.</TE>
<TE>   Quinton McCracken added Arizona's second run later in the inning
on a run-scoring grounder and Erubiel Durazo's sacrifice fly in the
fourth put the Diamondbacks ahead, 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   New York 10, Houston 0--At New York, slumping Jeromy Burnitz hit a
three-run homer in the Mets' seven-run first inning, helping Shawn
Estes (4-8) end a seven-start winless streak.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after bolstering their pitching staff with two deals at the
trade deadline, the Mets broke through for their biggest first inning
since scoring seven on June 8, 1995, against San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Mo Vaughn and Rey Ordonez had run-scoring doubles, Edgardo Alfonzo
hit a run-scoring single and Roberto Alomar's run-scoring triple with
two out capped the rally against Dave Mlicki (3-7). Every Met
position player either scored or drove in a run in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 9, Milwaukee 1--The Braves' Matt Franco hit three doubles
and drove in three runs and Chipper Jones homered at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Millwood (10-6) gave up one run and five hits and struck out
seven in 6 2/3 innings. The right-hander is 8-1 in his last 14
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 7, Colorado 6--Brian Giles put the Pirates ahead with a
two-run double, and Pittsburgh ran the Rockies' losing streak to
eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Mackowiak added a two-run homer and finished with three runs
batted in at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 8, St. Louis 5--The Marlins, who had been outscored,
95-52, in the first inning, bucked the trend by taking a 4-0 lead in
the first against Travis Smith (4-2). That ended Florida's 21-inning
scoreless streak at home.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Beckett (4-4) won despite giving up seven hits and five runs,
including Jim Edmonds' 22nd homer.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 8, Chicago 6--Mark Kotsay and Phil Nevin hit 11th-inning
home runs--Nevin's second of the game--to lead the Padres at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Gant and Ryan Klesko also homered for the Padres.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Picks Up Where He Left Off</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Giant slugger returns to lineup with bang,
hitting 596th career home run, but Phillies win, 8-6.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>In his return to the San Francisco lineup, Barry Bonds hit his 596th
homer, got his major league-leading 41st intentional walk and had
words with Philadelphia Manager Larry Bowa.</LD>
<LD>   Before Bonds was intentionally walked to load the bases in the
ninth inning, Bowa went to the mound, and then exchanged words with
Bonds on the way back to the dugout.</LD>
<LD>   Closer Jose Mesa then retired Rich Aurilia to end the threat and
give the Phillies an 8-6 victory over the Giants on Wednesday night.</LD>
<TE>   "I told him he wasn't going to beat us," Bowa said. "You don't
want to know what he said to me and you don't want to know what I
said back to him."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds also doubled twice in his return to the lineup after sitting
out 10 consecutive starts because of a strained right hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   He doubled in his first at-bat and later hit his 29th home run and
a ground-rule double. He finished three for four with a strikeout and
intentional walk.</TE>
<TE>   "You just can't let him beat you," Bowa said. "He's always locked
in and he loves those situations. Bonds is a good guy when he's
sitting on the bench, he's not a good guy standing in the box."</TE>
<TE>   In the eighth, Bonds caught Marlon Anderson's fly ball in left
field and walked around for a few seconds. He was OK, and stayed in
the game.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds has hit 27 homers at Veterans Stadium, the most by a
visiting player at the park. Gary Carter hit 26.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' solo homer in the fifth off Phillie newcomer Mike Timlin
tied it at 6-6. It was the first homer that Timlin had surrendered to
Bonds in his career.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of names in his book. I was hoping to keep my
name out of it," Timlin said</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies broke the tie in the sixth. Anderson singled and Todd
Pratt was hit by a pitch from reliever Troy Brohawn (0-1).</TE>
<TE>   Doug Glanville laid down a sacrifice bunt and Felix Rodriguez
threw a wild pitch that made it 7-6. Jimmy Rollins added a sacrifice
fly.</TE>
<TE>   Timlin (2-3) earned the victory in his Phillies' debut. They got
him in a trade that sent Scott Rolen to St. Louis.</TE>

<LD>Seating the 10 Pacific Conference football coaches around lunch
tables next to the knives was a risky proposition, but we can report
Wednesday's annual media gathering at a hotel near LAX ended without
anyone getting butter-rolled or back-stabbed.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA Coach Bob Toledo and Washington's Rick Neuheisel, two former
Bruin assistants who exchanged off-season recruiting-war salvos, in
the papers, announced they had agreed to a tepid peace sometime after
spring practice and before the three-bean salad.</LD>
<LD>   "We've both been men about it," Toledo said.</LD>
<TE>   Neuheisel started the jousting when he popped off about negative
recruiting among Pac-10 coaches, which was sort of like Gaylord Perry
accusing opposing pitchers of throwing spitballs.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Neuheisel?</TE>
<TE>   It took him 10 minutes to tick off nine Pac-10 coaches after he
arrived three years ago from Colorado, a school Neuheisel left in a
huff and, it turns out, in a mess.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 9, Neuheisel will fly to Philadelphia to explain to the
NCAA why the program he left is facing 51 alleged--albeit
minor--recruiting violations.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm anxious to tell my side of the story," Neuheisel said
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Neuheisel also says he is sorry for pointing the finger at his
Pac-10 brethren.</TE>
<TE>   "I whined," Neuheisel said, "It's not very becoming and I won't do
it again."</TE>
<TE>   The oral wars only underscore the tenacious competitive turn the
Pac-10 has taken since the North (Oregon, Oregon State, Washington
State, Washington) took over the South (UCLA, USC).</TE>
<TE>   It also helps to explain why an undeniably powerful conference has
yet to put a team in the bowl championship series title game.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is there has been way too much infighting.</TE>
<TE>   Seven different schools have won the conference title the last
seven years and Washington State has been tabbed to win the Pac-10
this year for the first time in the 41-year history of conference
straw polls.</TE>
<TE>   The Pac-10 is deeper and better than ever, yet realistically,
less-regarded conferences such as the Big East and Atlantic Coast
once again have a better chance of producing a national champion.</TE>
<TE>   The Pac-10 hasn't boasted a consensus national champion since USC
in 1972. USC won the coaches' share in 1978 and Washington claimed
the coaches' title in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   And, while the Pac-10's stature has risen since the formation of
the BCS in 1998, it has ultimately failed to deliver the grand prize.</TE>
<TE>   "It can happen," Pac-10 Commissioner Tom Hansen said, "but it's
really hard."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA came tantalizingly close in 1998 before losing to Miami.
Oregon got squeezed out last season by the BCS computer despite
finishing No. 2 in both polls.</TE>
<TE>   As the oxymoron goes, the better the Pac-10 gets the worse chance
it has of getting a team to No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to remove margin of victory from the BCS ratings
system should benefit the Pac-10--Oregon would have played Miami in
the Rose Bowl for the national title in this scenario--yet it's
difficult to fathom how the Pac-10 is going to push a team all the
way to the Fiesta Bowl, host of this season's title game.</TE>
<TE>   The Pac-10 is in a Catch-22. It needs to play tough nonconference
games to make up for its lack of national exposure--it's a time zone
problem, really--yet adding those games to cut-throat league play is
a lethal combination.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done good against nonleague opponents," Toledo said, "but
if you don't go undefeated in conference, it's hard to get in the
national title picture."</TE>
<TE>   USC?</TE>
<TE>   It plays Auburn, Kansas State, Colorado and Notre Dame out of
league and then fends a conference gantlet that includes games at
Oregon, at Washington State, at Stanford and at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Washington?</TE>
<TE>   It opens Aug. 31 at Michigan and finishes on the road at Oregon
and Washington State in consecutive weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon?</TE>
<TE>   Its nonconference schedule looks favorable on a gang-green post-it
note: Mississippi State, Fresno State, Idaho, Portland State. Too bad
quarterback Joey Harrington now plays for the Detroit Lions.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA? The Bruins play Colorado State (favored to win the Mountain
West Conference) and Colorado (picked ahead of Nebraska in the Big 12
North).</TE>
<TE>   Washington State?</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars have a plucky Pullman chance, only because their 10-2
record last year will give them a running start in preseason polls, a
decisive factor in the BCS formula.</TE>
<TE>   The key to Washington State's national hopes is a Sept. 14 victory
at Ohio State, yet, as reality sinks in, mentioning the Cougars and
the national title is like talking about the Cubs in the World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   "What does it take to get in?" Hansen asked.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be very fortunate and have a lot of luck on the way."</TE>
<TE>   The good news was Wednesday's Pac-10 luncheon didn't turn into a
food fight.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, for the coaches, that's a start.</TE>

<LD>It was Pacific 10 football media day in Los Angeles on Wednesday, and
a chance to celebrate the great football that is expected to be
played at Washington State, Oregon and Washington this season.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA Coach Bob Toledo and USC Coach Pete Carroll also showed up;
free lunch was being served.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   NOW IT'S kind of a tradition that each Pac-10 coach brings along
one of his top players, Mike Price at Washington State, for example,
sharing the microphone with quarterback Jason Gesser and Washington
Coach Rick Neuheisel sitting beside quarterback Cody Pickett.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll called on safety Troy Polamalu because his first name is
Troy and because quarterback Carson Palmer has been missing for some
time now.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo came with an offensive tackle, raising all kinds of
questions: Did quarterback Cory Paus elect to go on one final bender
before the start of camp? Is Paus serving time again? Is it Toledo's
plan to make everyone think the Bruins' best player is an offensive
tackle so no one has an interest in lending one of the obscure ones
an SUV?</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure the Bruin offensive tackle, whatever his name is, has
proud parents and a lot of friends who think he blocks just great.
But the key to UCLA's season hinges on keeping Paus sober, and anyone
who has sent their kid to college recently knows just how difficult
that can be.</TE>
<TE>   Paus, while saying the right things last season after two
car-related alcohol violations, could finish as the school's all-time
passer in yardage behind Cade McNown with a solid year. He could also
be the first UCLA player to park in a handicapped spot since McNown
if he has another one for the road.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to prove to me he can walk a straight line," said Toledo,
his choice of words seemingly no accident.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A YEAR ago the Bruins began the season 6-0 with a Heisman
candidate in DeShaun Foster, 23 seniors and national title
aspirations. They never even made it to a bowl game, and the sting of
that disappointment has put a new resolve in Toledo, who is probably
resolved to also impressing the school's new athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   "Call it tough love if you want, but Cory and DeShaun Foster hurt
me--hurt us--a lot last year," Toledo said. "I've told Cory I'm not
going to name a starting quarterback until a week before the season
starts.... It's more of a hammer over his head. He knows one more
mistake and he's done."</TE>
<TE>   The media have already determined the Bruins are done, placing
them sixth in the Pac-10 preseason poll, with Washington State picked
to win it all.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins were picked to finish sixth in 1993 and won the title.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the media also picked Washington and Oregon to win the
title the last two years and were correct.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TROJANS received three first-place votes, which suggests three
reporters have degrees from USC. USC is picked to place fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have a real good chance to win the Pac-10 title,"
Carroll said, and I believe every time I buy a Lotto ticket I am
going to win.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans have something going for them, however, that makes
them legitimate picks to surprise: a sober quarterback, who so far
has done nothing more than drive USC fans to drink--as if they needed
an excuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Carson Palmer has been fairly assessed," Carroll
said. "The past two years for the most part this has been a lousy
team, and that's not all Carson. If we're a balanced, good team,
Carson will be just fine."</TE>
<TE>   I only need the Mega number to be 16, and I think I've really got
a chance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE EXPECTATION from USC insiders is that running back Justin
Fargas, a transfer from Michigan, and wide receiver Keary Colbert
will play huge roles in the Trojan offense and give Palmer a better
chance to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Interesting, though, that after all the hype about Palmer--in this
his fifth year at USC--it's Polamalu who is featured on the cover of
the Trojan media guide.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I GOT a wave and a wink from USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett at
Pac-10 media day, or maybe he was starting to close his eyes after it
dawned on him whom he was waving to across the room.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I MET UCLA's new AD, Dan Guerrero. He smiles a lot. I'd like to
see him, however, after he has sat across the table from Garrett
awhile.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PRICE, WHO along with the Cougars went to a Rose Bowl on the
strength of Ryan Leaf's arm, said he wishes Leaf had not retired,
"and proved everyone wrong. He deserves better. I don't see where he
did anything really that bad."</TE>
<TE>   And some people wonder why Leaf never learned accountability.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I RECEIVED a barrage of e-mail from upset readers who said CNN's
Larry King was mistaken in suggesting that I was mistaken about the
amount of money it takes to win at the track before having to sign an
IRS statement.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently I was correct when I wrote that the IRS doesn't demand
a signature unless someone wins $601 or more.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that concerns me the most about your correction,"
e-mailed Robert Libby, "was that you would assume Larry King was
right, and that you were wrong. The man has had 17 wives; he's not
right too often."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Billy Sottile:</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Dwyre's recap of the Kournikova-Stevenson tennis match
mentioned 'shallow, uninformed types, some of whom write Page 2
columns for major metro sports sections and who wouldn't know a foot
fault from a foot fetish.' I wonder who he is referring to?"</TE>
<TE>   No need for me to even give it a Second Thought: Chris Dufresne.</TE>

<HD>Two Years in Spain Too Long for Blanco</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico World Cup striker Cuauhtemoc Blanco agreed Wednesday to rejoin
his former team, Club America of Mexico, for one year after earlier
rejecting a contract offered by the Mexico City-based club.</LD>
<LD>   Blanco, 29, had been demanding $1 million a year but was believed
to have settled for less, although terms of the contract were not
revealed.</LD>
<LD>   He spent the past two seasons with Valladolid in Spain but failed
to have much impact on the Spanish league and said he was pleased to
be returning home.</LD>
<TE>   "After the experience I had in Spain, I don't want to leave
Mexico, I want to stay here," he said in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to return to Europe. I had an offer from [an unnamed
team in] England, but I didn't want to go. I'm happy here."</TE>
<TE>   New Stadium for Arsenal</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal, the north London team that completed "the double" last
season by winning the English Premier League title and the F.A. Cup,
was given judicial approval to build a $623.5-million, 60,000-seat
stadium and shopping complex only one mile from its current stadium
in Highbury.</TE>
<TE>   Local residents in Ashburton Grove had challenged the proposal on
environmental grounds, citing noise and pollution, but after a
three-day hearing a London High Court judge ruled that the residents'
case was "unarguable" and gave Arsenal the go-ahead to proceed with
the project, which includes restaurants, offices and a casino.</TE>
<TE>   The club has played at Highbury since 1913, but the 38,500-seat
ground is too small to meet the club's needs and cannot be expanded.
The new stadium, on a 60-acre site, is expected to be ready for the
2005-2006 season.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's Ahn Dispute</TE>
<TE>   The dispute between South Korea World Cup striker Ahn Jung-Hwan
and his Italian club, Perugia, moved closer toward resolution when
Ahn agreed to return to the team provided it trades him to another
European club.</TE>
<TE>   Perugia's president had lambasted Ahn after the forward scored the
goal that knocked Italy out of the World Cup, saying he would never
play for the club again. When Ahn subsequently refused to return to
Perugia, the club suspended payment of his salary.</TE>
<TE>   Ahn's agent and lawyer will travel to Italy this weekend to
complete details of his transfer to another team, although it was not
clear which league that might be. Perugia will likely seek the
highest bidder.</TE>
<TE>   Argentine Teen Injured</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Canenaghi, the teenager whose 15 goals last season made
him the top scorer in the Argentine league, suffered a knee injury in
River Plate's opening game of the new season and will be sidelined
for six weeks after undergoing surgery, the Buenos Aires club said.</TE>
<TE>   England to Play Portugal</TE>
<TE>   England's first game since its 2-1 loss to eventual champion
Brazil in the quarterfinals of the World Cup will be against Portugal
on Sept. 7 at Villa Park in Birmingham, England, the English Football
Assn. announced.</TE>
<TE>   New Coach for South Africa</TE>
<TE>   The South Africa Football Assn. (SAFA) appointed Ephraim Mashaba
as its national team coach, replacing Jomo Sono, who led the "Bafana
Bafana" ("the Boys") at the Korea/Japan '02 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Mashaba, 51, was hugely popular as a player and has enjoyed
success on the youth levels. He coached South Africa's under-20 team
to second place in the African championship in Morocco in 1997;
earned the bronze medal with the country's under-23 team at the
All-Africa Games in 1999, and coached South Africa's team at the
Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.</TE>

<TE>   Update--Put aside the hoopla about Lisa Leslie's dunk: The Sparks
are trying to avoid their first consecutive losses of the season
after a poor performance against Miami, and they're clinging to a
one-game lead over Houston in the Western Conference race. Seattle is
fighting for the final Western Conference playoff spot. Add to that
the fight both teams showed in Seattle's 79-60 victory July 11, when
the Sparks' Latasha Byears and Seattle's Michelle Marciniak were
ejected after Byears threw the ball at Marciniak and Marciniak
charged her in a tiff that started with a hard foul by Marciniak.
"No, I'm not trying to get back at her," Marciniak said. "We're
trying to make the fourth playoff spot, so our motivation is
extremely high.... I think it's a healthy rivalry. I don't think they
liked losing by that margin. I know Michael Cooper doesn't like
losing, period." Byears and Marciniak say they're friendly. "Yeah, I
know her," Byears said. "She's a great actor, too."</TE>

<HD>Williams Doesn't Drop Ball in Easy Victory</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Slovakia's Husarova has early success with unique
strategy, but Venus, the defending champion, adjusts in a 6-4, 6-1
win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>Opponents of Venus Williams keep digging deeper into the tennis bag
of tricks. Most of the time, as was the case Wednesday night in the
Acura Classic, the rabbit stays in the hat.</LD>
<LD>   Janette Husarova of Slovakia, ranked No. 40 and with a game that
had about as much chance of handling Williams as John McEnroe has of
becoming a monk, floated out the old drop-shot strategy.</LD>
<LD>   Husarova led in the first set, 3-1. Husarova lost the match, 6-4,
6-1.</LD>
<TE>   Such is life on the women's tour these days, where chasing the
Williams sisters has become a weekly climb of Everest proportions.</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams, ranked No. 2 and two-time defending champion here,
said she had never faced that many drop shots before.</TE>
<TE>   "Nope, never," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She also said, with a chuckle, that the strategy got to her enough
for her to try some of her own.</TE>
<TE>   "I was influenced," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a day in which some main contenders to dethrone Williams
here got through to the next round with relative ease. No. 3 Lindsay
Davenport, in her second tournament back after recovering from knee
surgery, beat Marie-Gaiane Mikaelian of Switzerland, 6-3, 6-0; No. 5
Kim Clijsters of Belgium beat Eleni Danilidou of Greece, 6-3, 6-1,
and No. 6 Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia, playing the second night match,
beat Anastasia Myskina of Russia, 6-4, 6-3.</TE>
<TE>   Fan favorite Anna Kournikova, attempting to get her first tour
title in her 113th tournament, made her way into the round of 16 by
beating Jennifer Hopkins, 6-2, 6-4. Hopkins had replaced No. 4-seeded
Monica Seles after Seles was forced to withdraw before the tournament
began.</TE>
<TE>   To Husarova's credit, her drop-shot strategy turned a potentially
one-sided match into an entertaining contest. Instead of Williams
merely out-banging the less-powerful Husarova, she was forced to
sprint to the net repeatedly and created interesting angles on the
run.</TE>
<TE>   To Husarova's discredit, trying as many as 15 drop shots against
one of the fittest, fastest players on the women's tour was probably
a flawed idea. It made for good theater, but bad results, especially
when Husarova started dropping most of her drop shots on her own side
of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to hit a lot of balls, and that was good," said Williams,
who hit 24 winners and won 69 points to her opponent's 51.</TE>
<TE>   For Williams, who was making her sixth straight appearance here, a
2002 season that looks statistically as if it should be a career year
really hasn't been. She has won five tournaments, including last
week's at Stanford, and has been runner-up three times. But there is
the rub.</TE>
<TE>   Two of her second-place finishes have been at the French Open and
Wimbledon, grand slam events that are the measuring stick for all
tour players.</TE>
<TE>   And her losses in those two were at the hands of her sister,
Serena, who currently carries the No. 1 ranking and who is not
playing here.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about those Grand Slam losses, Williams got quiet and
responded, "It's hard."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about how she and her sister handled things after the
Wimbledon singles match, she said, "Serena was pretty normal. We just
went out and played a doubles match. The toughest thing was just
getting her to get ready for the doubles."</TE>
<TE>   Davenport, who broke Mikaelian's serve at 3-3 of the first set and
never lost another game, said that her comeback is going better than
she expected. "I'm really happy where I'm at right now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Kournikova, who served at an impressive 75% clip, said her victory
was "in general, a good match, but not as perfect as yesterday," when
she demolished Alexandra Stevenson before a packed house in 47
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The tournament sets up now for semifinals matching Davenport and
Williams and Kournikova and Jennifer Capriati, who is seeded second
but did not play Wednesday.</TE>

<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>They had a Ripley's-Believe-It-Or-Not candidate in the Acura Classic
tennis tournament Wednesday, when Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia, the
event's seventh-seeded player, was upset by unseeded Ai Sugiyama of
Japan.</LD>
<LD>   Hantuchova was serving in the third set at 5-6, advantage and
match point Sugiyama, when chair umpire Denis Overberg, who had
warned her earlier for the same infraction, called a point penalty on
Hantuchova for slow play.</LD>
<LD>   That meant the end of the match, and a 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 victory for
Sugiyama.</LD>
<TE>   Veteran tennis observers said they had never before seen a ruling
like that on a match point.</TE>
<TE>   It clearly was one of the more unusual moments on the women's pro
tennis tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe it," Hantuchova said. "I was playing well
enough to win."</TE>
<TE>   The rule states that play must begin 20 seconds after the previous
point has ended, and Clare Wood, Women's Tennis Assn. tour
supervisor, said that the rules had been followed.</TE>
<TE>   "The chair did act within the rules," she said. "The rule should
be enforced if it is abused."</TE>
<TE>   Overberg was the umpire in the chair for the 1999 Australian Open
match when Venus Williams started losing beads from her hair and was
assessed a point penalty because the beads bouncing around on the
court were impeding play.</TE>
<TE>   After Williams won her evening match Wednesday, she was told of
the Hantuchova incident and said, looking stunned, "My word. You can
have good days and bad days, and that's a bad day. I play some people
on the tour who seem like it they take 90 seconds to get the ball
into play."</TE>

<HD>Mets Acquire Pitching Help</HD>
<DH>Trades: They get Thomson from the Rockies for their
rotation and Reed from Padres to bolster bullpen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Mets bolstered their pitching staff, acquiring starter
John Thomson from the Colorado Rockies and reliever Steve Reed from
the San Diego Padres before Wednesday's nonwaiver deadline.</LD>
<LD>   The Mets got Thomson and outfielder Mark Little from the Rockies
for outfielder Jay Payton, right-hander Mark Corey and minor league
outfielder Robert Stratton.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm surprised we got a starter," Met General Manager Steve
Phillips said. "I wasn't very confident we would. Thomson is one of
the guys we had identified that if the price was right we thought he
would help us. But we weren't sure the price would be right."</LD>
<TE>   The Mets acquired Reed and right-hander Jason Middlebrook from San
Diego for left-hander Bobby M. Jones, right-hander Josh Reynolds and
outfielder Jay Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "We've addressed our pitching needs," Phillips said. "Steve Reed
is not the sexiest name out there among the relief corps, but he's
probably the guy pitching the best."</TE>
<TE>   Reed went 2-4 with a 1.98 earned-run average in 40 relief
appearances for San Diego this season, holding opponents to a .228
batting average.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson will replace the struggling Jeff D'Amico in New York's
rotation as the Mets try to make a playoff run.</TE>
<TE>   D'Amico gave up five runs in three innings of a 16-3 loss to
Houston on Tuesday night. After spending parts of the last five
seasons on the disabled list, D'Amico is finally sound, but he has
struggled, going 5-9 with a 5.09 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never felt this good and pitched this bad," he said.
"Everything feels great. I'm just not getting the job done out
there."</TE>
<TE>   Thomson has also pitched poorly of late, going 1-6 with a 5.74 ERA
in his last 11 starts. He was 7-8 with a 4.88 ERA for Colorado but
should benefit from a move from hitter-friendly Coors Field.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson said that a few years ago he thought there wasn't enough
money that would make playing in New York worth it. But he is looking
forward to joining a playoff race after languishing in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been in this situation before," Thomson said. "It's
something I'm looking forward to. I think I'm going to like it."</TE>
<TE>   Payton, once a top prospect for the Mets, overcame a slew of
injuries early in his career and is hitting .284 with eight homers
and 31 runs batted in this season. Payton has a .365 average in his
last 18 games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a good situation for me," said Payton, who is
eight for 13 in his career at Coors. "Some of those fly ball outs to
the warning track at Shea might go for round-trippers. That won't be
a bad thing."</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies also sent outfielder Todd Hollandsworth and
left-hander Dennys Reyes to the Texas Rangers for Gabe Kapler and
infield-outfield prospect Jason Romano.</TE>
<TE>   Corey was 0-3 with a 4.50 ERA in 12 relief appearances for the
Mets this season. He had a seizure on June 26 shortly after smoking
marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Little will provide outfield depth for the Mets. He batted .200
with no home runs and five RBIs in 105 at-bats for the Rockies this
season.</TE>
<TE>   In other deals, the Boston Red Sox acquired right-handed reliever
Bob Howry from the Chicago White Sox for two minor league pitchers,
and the Pittsburgh Pirates finally gave up on one-time top prospect
Chad Hermansen, sending the outfielder to the Chicago Cubs for
outfielder Darren Lewis.</TE>

<HD>Top U.S. Lawmakers Seek Expanded Afghanistan Role</HD>
<DH>Policy: Legislators express concern that the unstable
nation will fall back into chaos. Rumsfeld bristles at some remarks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Leading lawmakers voiced concern Wednesday that Afghanistan could
again become a haven of chaos and terrorism unless the United States
expands its peacekeeping role--a proposal that Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld firmly resisted during congressional testimony
that included several testy exchanges.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't want to win this war and then lose the peace in the
sense of seeing a return to chaos," said Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.),
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</LD>
<LD>   The two-hour hearing reflected growing concern on Capitol Hill
that the stability of Afghanistan's fledgling government is being
undermined by fighting among regional warlords.</LD>
<TE>   The session also demonstrated that many in Congress are
increasingly comfortable criticizing aspects of the war effort, in
sharp contrast to the early months of the conflict when members
feared that raising even minor questions would make them appear
unpatriotic.</TE>
<TE>   Several lawmakers not only challenged White House reluctance to
deploy American soldiers as peacekeepers, but they also argued that
the military made a major blunder by not using U.S. troops to seal
off Al Qaeda escape routes during the major battles of the war.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, Operation Enduring Freedom has become Operation Enduring
Frustration," said Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.). "We still haven't killed
or captured Osama bin Laden and his terrorist cadre. Do you happen to
know where he is?"</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld bristled at the line of questioning. "You can be
frustrated if you want--I'm not," he said. He acknowledged that the
United States does not know the terrorist mastermind's whereabouts,
but he argued that Bin Laden's capture was not the paramount goal of
the war.</TE>
<TE>   "He may be dead. He may be seriously wounded. He may be in
Afghanistan, he may be somewhere else," Rumsfeld said. "But wherever
he is, if he is, you can be certain he is having one dickens of a
time operating his apparatus."</TE>
<TE>   Though the hearing was billed as a status report on the war in
Afghanistan, much of the discussion centered on Iraq, widely
perceived as the Bush administration's next military target.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how the administration will decide which countries should be
targeted by preemptive military action in the war on terrorism,
Rumsfeld stopped short of pointing to Iraq, but he said that some
nations "obviously elevate themselves as problems."</TE>
<TE>   "If we sat down and looked at what they are doing to their own
people -- starvation, repression, butchery, use of chemicals,"
Rumsfeld said, "pretty soon people have to nod and say, 'Well,
they're nominating themselves.' "</TE>
<TE>   In Wednesday's hearing, Rumsfeld and Gen. Tommy Franks, the
U.S.-based commander of the operation in Afghanistan, defended the
military decision to rely heavily on Afghan troops during a December
assault on Tora Bora. Many in Washington believe that Bin Laden was
in the cave-pocked region in eastern Afghanistan at the time but
escaped.</TE>
<TE>   Franks said Afghan forces, and not U.S. commanders, pushed for the
invasion of Tora Bora.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he was eager to avoid the mistakes made by the
Soviets in their 1978-89 occupation of Afghanistan, which left more
than 15,000 Soviet soldiers dead and 55,000 wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very mindful of the Soviet experience," Franks said. He
said he did not know how many Al Qaeda network fighters escaped Tora
Bora, but he said hundreds were probably killed.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the hearing focused on ongoing tensions between the White
House and members of Congress over the appropriate scope of U.S.
involvement in safeguarding the Afghan government and rebuilding the
war-torn country's infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush scoffed at such "nation-building" efforts during
his 2000 presidential campaign, and the U.S. has refused to
contribute troops to an international security force in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The recent assassination of an Afghan vice president prompted the
United States to begin providing a security detail for Afghan
President Hamid Karzai. But lawmakers Wednesday pressed Rumsfeld to
go further and begin supplying U.S. troops to an international
security force currently run by Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, outside of Kabul we are bordering to some degree on
chaos," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.). "The fact is we need to
expand the peacekeeping force. We're the world's superpower. We have
to step up."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld all but rejected that notion, saying the United States
wants to keep its focus on hunting down remnants of Al Qaeda and
training the Afghan military. He said the United States is
encouraging other countries to contribute troops to an international
security force in Afghanistan but is finding few takers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't agree that the situation in Afghanistan outside of Kabul
is bordering on chaos," Rumsfeld said. "I think it is reasonably
secure. It is an untidy place, but it's a lot tidier than it used to
be."</TE>

<HD>Transplanted Angeleno Comes Face to Face With Carnage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>David Kosak was eating kebab in Hebrew University's Frank Sinatra
cafeteria when the force of a blast slammed him to the floor. His
first thought was that the oven had exploded, the reaction of a man
who had once been a chef.</LD>
<LD>   But in the next instant, the terrible realization came to him:
another bomb. This was what his relatives had worried about, the
reason they had urged him and his wife, Laura, not to leave Los
Angeles a month ago and move to Jerusalem.</LD>
<LD>   At first, the room was chillingly quiet. Then there was movement
as those able to move clawed through the smoke and debris and glass
shards. The room was dark, all the lights blown out.</LD>
<TE>   Kosak got to his feet and began making his way to the door, hands
over his head, barely aware of the carnage around him. His first goal
was to get out of the room, to get away from the smoke and the flying
debris that just seconds before had been the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just moving to get out," Kosak said. "We just went into
battle mode. I saw people going through the door and I did the same."</TE>
<TE>   Kosak was one of the lucky ones. His wounds were superficial, but
his ears were ringing from the blast's deafening noise, which was
amplified by the closed room. He was taken to Bikur Holim Hospital
near downtown Jerusalem, along with 23 other people--including
foreigners, Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs--whose injuries were not
considered life-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, Kosak was sitting on his bed in the hospital trauma
center, talking about the last months. He and his wife had decided to
move to Jerusalem, where they would first study Hebrew and then he
would begin his rabbinical studies.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was not an easy one. There was the major factor of
family members opposed to his coming. They warned about the dozens of
suicide bombings, the danger of being in the wrong place at the wrong
time.</TE>
<TE>   "My family was worried about that possibility," said the
35-year-old Kosak, who had worked as a chef and caterer in Los
Angeles for a number of years. "But just to get by you have to think
nothing is going to happen to you."</TE>
<TE>   They moved here a month ago, renting an apartment in the pleasant,
upscale neighborhood of Rehavia. One thing they did promise their
parents was that they would never take buses in Jerusalem because
those are frequent targets of suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Kosak was not in the cafeteria when the bomb went off during
the lunch hour. She was studying at the library and did not hear the
blast. Her cell phone, which she'd gotten only last week, rang. It
was her husband, telling her that there had been an explosion. He
wasn't badly hurt, but a lot of other people were.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm coming now," she said, but she was unable to find her husband
in the crowd. She dialed his cell phone and finally found him around
the corner from where she had been looking.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Kosak sat on the hospital bed next to her husband Wednesday
afternoon. She said her parents had also been against her coming to
Israel, until Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they realized there are no guarantees anywhere," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Three beds over was Sawalha Assad, 27, a dentistry student at the
university for the last six years. He was just walking into the
cafeteria when the bomb detonated, sending him flying through the
air, shards of glass piercing his skin. Assad, from the small village
of Kfar Kama, near the Sea of Galilee, said he thought of the school
as a second home.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel really bad that they [the bombers] can get to the
university. This isn't supposed to happen in a place like that," he
said. "It's terrible. These things continue, and I call on those
doing it to think again and take different steps to solve your
problems. I don't know one student who agrees to this kind of thing
going on."</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the room, David Oliel, an Israeli Jew, lay
with his hands tucked behind his head. He had been overcome by smoke
when he raced into the cafeteria and began looking for people to pull
out of the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I thought it was a sonic boom," said Oliel, 26, who is
studying communications. But then he saw someone running toward the
cafeteria and gave chase himself. Inside the room and through the
smoke he saw two bodies under a table and was sure those people were
dead. He saw the scorched body of an Asian student, who also appeared
to be dead. Another student on the floor had a huge splinter of wood
embedded in his leg. He, too, was dead.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he found a young woman who was bleeding but alive. He
carried her to safety and the waiting ambulances.</TE>
<TE>   "The ceiling was gone," he said. "The place was just destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   In the hours after the bombing, David and Laura Kosak went home
and marveled at their luck. David Kosak thought he had been close to
the bomb, perhaps no more than a few table rows away, yet he had
lived while others had died. He, the new arrival from the United
States, had survived while three other Americans had perished.</TE>
<TE>   Friends came by the apartment. They ordered Chinese. Kosak said he
would be returning to school, maybe not tomorrow but certainly the
day after. As far as he is concerned, two years of study in Jerusalem
lie ahead of him. And at least in the hours after the bombing, he
said, he felt as if his relationship with his new country had
changed.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel more connected to Israel," he said.</TE>

<HD>In China, a Light in the Cave</HD>
<DH>One dedicated teacher brings learning, literacy and hope to
a remote mountain village that relies on him as its link to the
modern world.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ZHONGDONG, China</DL>
<LD>Every morning, the children in raggedy clothes perch on the rocky
mountain ridge, waiting for a skinny figure to stumble into view.</LD>
<LD>   If Yang Zhengxue makes it, there will be school. If he doesn't,
there will not.</LD>
<LD>   Yang is the only teacher in this remote corner of southern China.
His students live high up in a huge limestone cave, an almost
prehistoric habitat without electricity, running water or any other
amenity that would identify it as a home for residents of the 21st
century.</LD>
<TE>   He is their only bridge to the modern world.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a tradition for education here. So many villages in
this area have no school at all," said Yang, who treks up and down
craggy peaks and through muddy fields for an hour and a half to reach
his students. "If I give up, it will be the end of this school."</TE>
<TE>   It's a heavy burden for a 38-year-old whose own education peaked
at middle school. His sense of mission highlights the monumental task
his country faces in educating the most populous nation on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   While technically still a developing nation, China wants to
project the image of a rising global power, one capable of hosting
the 2008 Olympics and embracing world trade. The Communist leadership
in Beijing knows that education is a basic building block that makes
everything else possible.</TE>
<TE>   The Communist government has made enormous strides to combat
illiteracy since coming to power more than five decades ago. In 1949,
the country's illiteracy rate was 80%; it has dropped to 6.7%,
according to the latest government census, in which literacy is
loosely defined.</TE>
<TE>   But a huge education gap persists between the wealthier coastal
cities and the impoverished inland countryside. Failure to narrow the
schism could have lasting repercussions on the country's
developmental ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   "China's education system is a giant pyramid. At the top is a few
highly educated people, and at the bottom is a huge base of 1.3
billion who are barely educated at all," said Zhong Dajun, who runs a
private research center in Beijing. "The difference between ignorance
and knowledge is the difference between poverty and wealth."</TE>
<TE>   The hardships of the cave students and this mountainous area's
historic isolation and primitiveness make it an extreme example of
the unevenness of development in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The spectacular limestone peaks and lush green forests surrounding
the cave where the children and their families live look deceptively
inviting. But life here is so poor and underdeveloped, it's no wonder
that every other teacher quit. Yang, however, still makes the arduous
hike from his home several mountains away, every day weather permits.
He's been doing it for almost 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   "When he arrived, there were five teachers. Now he's the only one
left," said Wang Qixiang, 17, a former student of Yang's.</TE>
<TE>   The cave sits several hours' walk across rocky mountain terrain
from the nearest road and about five hours' drive from Guiyang,
capital of Guizhou province.</TE>
<TE>   Unless one knows the cavern exists, it's almost impossible to spot
it among the endless rolling slopes that dominate the landscape.
That's why people chose to live here: It was a perfect hideaway from
warlords, armed bandits and tax collectors who terrorized the country
before the Communist revolution.</TE>
<TE>   The 70-odd cave dwellers call their home Zhongdong, or middle
cave. It's the largest of the three natural caverns in the area and
the only one hospitable to long-term residence because it goes deep
into the mountainside, a kind of underground stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The other two are hardly caves at all, but hang on the forested
path to Zhongdong like giant archways along an emerald stairway to
the skies.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, however, Zhongdong is far from paradise. Two dozen
shanties with plastic for roofs and straw sheets for walls squat
under the cave's porous moonscape ceiling. The air is a potent
cocktail of pigsty waste and human sweat. The only source of water
trickles down in tiny droplets from a crack in the darkness above.</TE>
<TE>   Daylight peeks in through a thick curtain of bamboo shielding the
large entrance. Most families can't afford to buy candles, so they
huddle around a campfire in the middle of the dirt floor. An eerie
silence reigns except for the pounding echo of stone tools being used
to press corn into flour.</TE>
<TE>   Cave dwelling used to be popular in this area of Guizhou. Various
poverty-alleviation programs have succeeded in relocating some
residents, but others have refused to leave, usually because they
worry about making ends meet outside.</TE>
<TE>   Those who remain eke out a living by hawking their precious few
chickens, pigs and cows to markets far below the mountains. Those too
old or frail to raise livestock subsist on corn, the only crop that
grows in this hilly terrain.</TE>
<TE>   The 20 families who live in Zhongdong belong to the ethnic Miao
minority. They speak their own tongue and don't understand Mandarin,
the national dialect.</TE>
<TE>   Some adults, especially the women, have never ventured beyond the
cave. There's no television, newspaper or mail carrier to deliver
information from the outside world. Not even the ubiquitous cell
phone now connecting almost every corner of China works deep within
these ancient hills.</TE>
<TE>   The only modern appliance seen here is a battery-operated red
plastic alarm clock. Twice a day, its owner lets it chirp on and on,
for as long as 45 minutes. Its mandate is not so much to tell time,
but to entertain, like music from a Stone Age radio.</TE>
<TE>   "She likes the sound," said Wang Hongguang, 54, gesturing to his
wife as she sat on the doorstep of their home cradling their infant
granddaughter.</TE>
<TE>   The dozen children growing up here have never tasted ice cream or
owned a toy. They can't communicate with strangers who don't speak
their dialect, so they express their affection through song.</TE>
<TE>   The national anthem is the only one in Mandarin they know well.
Ask them any question, and they'll sing it in response: "Arise the
people who don't want to be slaves. Let's forge our flesh and blood
into a new great wall."</TE>
<TE>   The children sport one set of dirty clothes season after season.
Some don't own shoes. Hunger is constant. Breakfast, lunch and dinner
are often rolled into one bowl of cornmeal with salt. Even the cats
in the cave scurry around starving. They've run out of mice to catch,
and there's little leftover food to throw at them.</TE>
<TE>   In this desolate environment, school is the ultimate luxury.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, the government built a one-room brick house inside
the cave to spare the youngest children the long trek to the nearest
school outside the cavern. Those who make it through the first two
grades can move on to boarding school below the mountains, if their
parents can afford it or if they get financial help from the
government.</TE>
<TE>   Last semester, local officials built a slightly bigger school
below the cave entrance, giving the children access to natural
lighting and two classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   But many parents still can't afford the dollar a semester it takes
to enroll their kids. The average income for cave dwellers is $60 a
year.</TE>
<TE>   "The country has a nine-year compulsory education system, but no
one can force the children here to go to school," teacher Yang said.
"A lot of girls want to go, but their parents say no. The lucky ones
finish first grade. The adults think it's a waste of money."</TE>
<TE>   The new school has 43 students and two grades--first and second.
The children's ages range from 6 to 14. There are 15 girls in the
first-grade class and only two in the second grade.</TE>
<TE>   Yang teaches the two classes simultaneously. The first-graders
repeat after him, reciting the story of a country bumpkin going to
the big city. As they carry on, Yang hops over to the other room,
telling second-graders to flip to the chapter in their threadbare
textbook on how to weigh an elephant.</TE>
<TE>   Yang performs the same juggling act as he teaches math, art, music
and physical education. To outsiders, his efforts seem haphazard. To
these deprived youngsters, they are life-changing exercises.</TE>
<TE>   "I teach them basic things like marching together, turning right,
turning left," Yang said. "Without these simple steps, they will
never be able to adjust to life in a real school."</TE>
<TE>   After making less than $13 a month for 15 years, Yang finally got
a raise last year that boosted his state-paid salary to $75 a month.
That makes him the richest man in the area and the subject of great
envy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most parents are grateful for his presence.</TE>
<TE>   "He's teaching here because nobody else wants to," said Wang
Fengguo, 40, whose daughter went to the cave school. "Every semester
a new teacher comes and goes. This place is too remote. They can't
get used to it."</TE>
<TE>   Yang grew up in the Zhongdong area. His family also lived in the
cave for a time. The children have become part of his life. He knows
all their stories.</TE>
<TE>   There's the 9-year-old boy whose mother was recently kidnapped and
sold as a bride in another part of China. The 14-year-old
first-grader whose father died and whose mother doesn't want her in
school. The 7-year-old girl who doesn't like to talk; her mother, who
is deaf and mute, went job hunting with her husband in the city and
they never returned.</TE>
<TE>   They are some of the lucky ones. After the new school was built,
Yang took on students from nearby villages. They must walk two hours
of mountain path each way to get here. Lunch for them is a cold
potato, if anything at all.</TE>
<TE>   "These children have no idea what the outside world is like," Yang
said. "I wish I could teach classes in my house. That way they could
watch TV and see that not everyone in the world lives like
primitives."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he pays some of the children's tuition out of his own
salary. "I tell their parents if they can learn to read and write
they can find a job away from the cave and make more money," Yang
said.</TE>
<TE>   Yang's parents were illiterates who grew up in the cave. He was
the first son of eight siblings, and his family was too poor to send
him to school. When he was 10, he sneaked out to gather medicinal
herbs in the hills and sold them for the 6 cents it took to enroll in
school.</TE>
<TE>   He became the most educated person in his village. His father was
his first pupil.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't know how to keep track of our corn harvest," Yang said.
"I taught him how to read numbers and count to 10,000."</TE>
<TE>   When the cave needed teachers, Yang earned the highest score on
the qualifying test and got a job. His dedication earned him a spot
in the Chinese Communist Party, a great source of pride for this
farmer's son.</TE>
<TE>   But that has not made his frustrations go away. Official
corruption keeps most financial aid from reaching the children. Poor
oversight allowed shabby construction of the new schoolhouse. It
leaks water and is in danger of collapsing.</TE>
<TE>   Going back to the cave is hardly an option. The school inside is
too small, and some residents have a habit of chopping up its desks
and chairs to burn as firewood.</TE>
<TE>   But the learning continues, as long as there is one teacher
standing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm never leaving," Yang said. "This is my hometown. These
children need an education. I have to persist no matter what."</TE>

<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Leftist rebels forced at least 1,000 Colombian villagers into boats
bound for the jungle, turning their settlement into a near ghost
town, the army said Wednesday. Authorities launched a search but have
not found the residents.</LD>
<LD>   Guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known
by the Spanish acronym FARC, told the people of Puerto Alvira, in the
central province of Meta, to leave Saturday, the army said.</LD>
<LD>   One of the few people left in the town, Jaime Tellez, said the
rebels had ordered locals to get out because an offensive by the
armed forces or by far-right paramilitary outlaws was imminent.</LD>
<TE>   Colombia's top human rights official, ombudsman Eduardo Cifuentes,
called the incident "a massive hostage-taking, almost without
precedent in the country. It is a grave violation of international
humanitarian law."</TE>
<TE>   The army arrived in the town Tuesday, and a civilian commission
followed the trail of the townspeople into the jungle along the
Guaviare River to try to determine their fate.</TE>
<TE>   "The town is practically deserted," said Gen. Carlos Saavedra,
commander of the army's 7th Brigade. "We could only speak to about
five people."</TE>

<HD>'Juan Diego Was Noble, Sweet'</HD>
<DH>Mexico: Canonization of the Catholic Church's first
indigenous American saint is the religious experience of a lifetime
for many.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Salvador Suarez, a 37-year-old shoe salesman, traveled all night on a
bus from his village in western Mexico and entered the Basilica of
Guadalupe at 6 a.m. Wednesday--four hours before the religious
experience of his lifetime.</LD>
<LD>   Suarez is a full-blooded Nahua Indian and devout Roman Catholic.
This was the day his spiritual godfather, Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin,
would become the church's first indigenous American saint.</LD>
<LD>   The church makes saints of the dead to hold up as models for the
living. As other worshipers filled the vast basilica with songs and
chants, awaiting the arrival of Pope John Paul II, the shoe merchant
from Tuxpan reflected on the character of the 16th century Chichimeca
Indian and on a phrase heard at home as a child: "May God make you
like Juan Diego."</LD>
<TE>   Across the Western Hemisphere, Catholics watching the pope on
television heard the legend of Juan Diego and the Virgin of
Guadalupe. She was the dark-skinned mother of Jesus who appeared from
heaven and asked for a church to be built for her people. He was her
chosen messenger, the humble Indian on whose cloak she miraculously
imprinted her image to persuade a skeptical Spanish bishop.</TE>
<TE>   The story helped Spanish colonizers win Indian converts to
Catholicism across the Americas, but it was Our Lady of Guadalupe,
not Juan Diego, who became Mexico's patron saint. Until now, he has
knelt in the Virgin's shadow, an actor in a supporting role--evidence
to many that a Eurocentric church slights its Indian faithful.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday was Juan Diego's day.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always thought of our indigenous brother as a saint; it
has taken the Church of Rome 500 years to catch up," Suarez said,
seated in a section with 34 Nahua neighbors in loose-fitting white
suits. "But that does not make us any less content. It's something
marvelous."</TE>
<TE>   Suarez said he follows Juan Diego's example by doing volunteer
work in his impoverished village.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent storm, an elderly neighbor slipped on the mud
floor of her cardboard shack and broke a foot. Suarez spent four
hours trying to get her admitted to a series of nonindigenous medical
clinics, which turned her away. Finally he delivered her to an
Indian-run clinic in nearby Guadalajara.</TE>
<TE>   "Juan Diego was noble, sweet and charitable," Suarez said. "He
would have done the same."</TE>
<TE>   Will his sainthood help raise Mexico's 10 million Indians from
poverty and racial discrimination by the mestizo majority?</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is going to change unless we change it," Suarez said.
"His sainthood will help us reflect more on good examples to follow.
Leaders will emerge, and we will lift ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Millions of worshipers have flocked to Mexico City for the pope's
visit, not all of them so familiar with St. Juan Diego.</TE>
<TE>   According to a survey by the newspaper Reforma, 83% of Mexican
Catholics believe that Juan Diego was a real person, despite the
doubts of some scholars. But nearly as many said they had never
prayed to him.</TE>
<TE>   "For all our lives we have seen Juan Diego kneeling in front of
the Virgin, so people are reluctant to think of him on his own," said
Felipe Avila, who sells religious statuettes outside the basilica.
"Maybe after the pope has gone, interest in him will pick up."</TE>
<TE>   Catalina Castro Cruz, 37, said the Virgin of Guadalupe appeared on
her family's ranch in Veracruz a few years ago and helped cure her
sister-in-law of cancer, prompting the family to build a little
chapel there in the heavenly lady's honor.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never asked Juan Diego for a miracle," Castro said. "But
if he is--as it is said--the one the Virgin chose to speak to, then
he is beautiful to me."</TE>
<TE>   To canonize Juan Diego, the Vatican had to certify a miracle. It
ruled that the recovery of a young Mexico City man from massive head
and spinal injuries in a three-story suicidal plunge was due to his
mother's prayers to the Indian.</TE>
<TE>   If the pope has his way, Juan Diego will soon be busy answering
more prayers. In his homily Wednesday, John Paul asked the new saint
to bless families, strengthen marriages, help parents give their
children a Christian upbringing and ease the plight of the poor, the
sick and the lonely.</TE>
<TE>   Reforma reported Tuesday, tongue-in-cheek, that Juan Diego had
already performed a few miracles this week: The federal and Mexico
City governments, run by rival parties, collaborated on the papal
visit; farmers protesting plans for a new airport suspended their
protest during the pope's stay; and streets along the pope's route
were cleaner than ever.</TE>
<TE>   The canonization Mass drew a crowd of 150 from the Archdiocese of
Los Angeles, where Juan Diego and the Virgin are well known among
Mexican Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Floriza Martinez, 75, a Long Beach entrepreneur, said she prayed
to Juan Diego and the Virgin that she could make the trip despite
having been diagnosed in May with cancer. She underwent surgery in
early June and recovered.</TE>
<TE>   "Juan Diego is a healer," she concluded before heading to the
basilica.</TE>
<TE>   One couple who planned to be with her group, Ruben and Martha
Lujan of Alhambra, reported that a miracle had kept them home.</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Lujan, 65, a retired physical rehabilitation counselor, has
not been well. His wife said she prayed to Juan Diego for his health.
A week ago, he went for his annual physical. He had four clogged
arteries and underwent a quadruple bypass Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Had he delayed the exam until after the pilgrimage, he said, "I
might not have made it back home."</TE>

<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>Authorities struggled Wednesday to restore electricity to five Indian
states--home to 235 million people--after they were plunged into
darkness overnight in one of the biggest power outages in years.</LD>
<LD>   Hospital services were suspended, trains stopped running and
factories shut down in the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya
Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Goa, in the central and western parts of
the country. Some water supplies also dried up as pumps stopped
working.</LD>
<LD>   "We hope to bring the situation to normal by evening," said R.P.
Singh, chairman of Power Grid Corp., which oversees the electricity
network in the country.</LD>
<TE>   Power was restored Wednesday morning in most cities and towns,
after a 12-hour outage. But power was yet to return to thousands of
villages, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The blackout occurred after Madhya Pradesh state tried to pull
more electricity from the national grid than the network could
handle, Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   A drought has lowered hydroelectric dams' output.</TE>

<HD>Scientist Warns of Iraq's Nuclear Gains</HD>
<DH>Congress: Regime is nearly capable of building cores for
bombs, exiled chief of Baghdad's weapons program tells the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has sharply accelerated his nuclear
program and is broadening his already substantial efforts to build
chemical and biological weapons, the program's former director told
Congress on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   At the first in a series of hearings on U.S. tensions with Iraq,
Khidhir Hamza told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that
Hussein was in the final stages of creating a uranium-enrichment
program that would enable him to build cores for nuclear bombs. Iraq
already has a workable bomb design and most of the needed components
for a weapon, Hamza said, noting that German intelligence reports
predict that Baghdad could have material for three bombs by 2005.</LD>
<LD>   "Iraq is working to defeat containment, and in the end, it will
achieve its purpose," said Hamza, an American-trained nuclear
scientist who led Iraq's bomb-making program from 1987 to 1990 and
escaped from the country in 1994.</LD>
<TE>   Hussein's goal of nuclear capability is a key reason the Bush
administration has been contemplating an effort to oust him.</TE>
<TE>   In a report last year, the Pentagon estimated that Iraq would not
have sufficient enriched uranium for a bomb until at least 2006. But
some experts have predicted that the Baghdad government could
accumulate the necessary amount sooner by buying the material abroad
or through the efforts of its two dozen nuclear scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Hamza, who spent two decades in Iraq's nuclear program, said his
former employer also has "extensive" experience testing and designing
radiological, or "dirty," bombs. These weapons encase conventional
explosives in low-level radioactive material, polluting the targeted
area and terrorizing the population.</TE>
<TE>   Few countries have tested such bombs, which are thought to have
little military use.</TE>
<TE>   Hamza said Iraq tested two bombs in Mohammediyat in 1988. Though
the test showed little about whether such devices would be valuable
in battle, "this provides Iraq another tool for possible use in a
terrorism setting," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hamza said Hussein has also actively cultivated terrorist
connections, including efforts to recruit agents at Islamic
conferences in Iraq for the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   But addressing another pressing question, a former United Nations
weapons inspector told the committee that, in his opinion, Hussein
would not hand over deadly weapons to terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Butler, an Australian who formerly headed the U.N. weapons
team in Iraq, said he had seen no evidence that Iraq had shared
weapons technology with terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect that, especially given his psychology and aspirations,
Saddam would be reluctant to share with others what he believes to be
an indelible source of his own power," Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is important because many experts believe that national
governments are less likely than terrorist groups to strike the U.S.
with weapons of mass destruction. This is because governments could
be easily destroyed in an American counterattack, while terrorists
would be more difficult to find.</TE>
<TE>   Butler and other witnesses said that despite mounting American
anxiety, the exact state of the Iraqi weapons program continues to be
highly uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not know and have never fully known the quality and
quantity of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing also brought conflicting advice on how the United
States should go about mounting a military campaign against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Marine Gen. Joseph P. Hoar, commander of U.S. forces in
the Middle East from 1991 to 1994, warned that the United States
should not underestimate the number of troops, planes or ships that
would be needed for such a fight.</TE>
<TE>   The logistics of moving forces in the Middle East are daunting, he
said, cautioning that an inadequate force could increase the cost of
such a campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt we would prevail, but at what risk?" Hoar said.</TE>
<TE>   But retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas G. McInerney urged striking
Iraq with a smaller "blitz warfare" force, relying heavily on air
power, that would require only a "relatively small footprint" of U.S.
forces in the region and "would minimize the political impact on our
allies adjacent to Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate committee convened hearings to explore broad questions
about the U.S. effort to oust Hussein, and to better inform the
public at a time when the Bush administration is saying little about
its largely unformed plans.</TE>
<TE>   Congress generally supports the notion of overthrowing Iraq. But a
number of senators raised questions about the mission, expressing
concerns that it would cost lives and American resources and could
damage U.S. relations abroad and tie up U.S. forces for years to
rebuild Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not believe this administration has yet made the case for
military action against Iraq," said Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.).</TE>

<HD>South Korean Lawmakers Reject Female Prime Minister</HD>
<DH>Asia: Parliament votes down president's choice, a former
university chief who had been criticized for alleged doctoring of her
resume.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>South Korean lawmakers rejected the first woman nominated as prime
minister Wednesday, undermining the ruling party during an election
year and dealing a blow to the scandal-plagued administration of
President Kim Dae Jung.</LD>
<LD>   "This is serious," said Kim Byung Kuk, associate professor of
politics at Korea University. "It's a message to the president that
he has to shape up and a warning that his remaining days in office
could be very rocky."</LD>
<LD>   Chang Sang, a 62-year-old theologian and former president of
prestigious Ewha Womans University, was voted down 142 to 100 during
confirmation hearings. The post has little decision-making power, but
the prime minister would lead the government if the 77-year-old
president died or was incapacitated. The prime minister's seat became
vacant last month in a government reshuffle.</LD>
<TE>   The rebuff followed two bruising days of hearings during which the
political neophyte was slammed on live television for allegedly
doctoring her resume, pursuing questionable real estate deals and
failing to choose Korean citizenship for her son.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition legislators charged Chang with trying to make people
believe she'd graduated from Princeton University, when in fact she
received her doctorate from Princeton Theological Seminary. Both are
in Princeton, N.J. Chang blamed a translation error by her aides.</TE>
<TE>   Her rejection by the National Assembly came as South Korea
approaches closely watched elections for a handful of parliamentary
seats Aug. 8 and presidential voting Dec. 19. The opposition holds
128 of the assembly's 259 seats, and members of the ruling Millennium
Democratic Party and United Liberal Democrats crossed party lines to
vote against Chang.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Wednesday's vote delivered a message that lawmakers,
backed by their constituents, were unhappy with the growing number of
scandals surrounding Kim's administration. Corruption charges were
recently leveled against two of his sons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's regrettable that the government gave the opposition party an
excuse to attack," said Chung Jae Guk, 33, an insurance salesman from
Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts said another source of discontent was Kim's
apparent unwillingness to include among his advisors anyone beyond a
small and increasingly unpopular circle of insiders.</TE>
<TE>   But Chang didn't help herself much, either. Accused of speculative
real estate dealings, she initially denied any knowledge, saying her
now incapacitated mother-in-law had handled everything.</TE>
<TE>   "That killed her. It seemed really disingenuous," said Mo Jong
Ryn, associate professor at Yonsei University. "Overall, she did
something a lot of other people probably did. But people aren't so
tolerant anymore, especially of someone trying to be prime minister."</TE>
<TE>   Another charge leveled against her was that she failed to have her
American-born son renounce his U.S. citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes us ordinary people sad when leading figures don't set a
good example," said Chae Kyong Sook, a 36-year-old homemaker.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the opposition Grand National Party employed
something of a stealth campaign in undermining Chang's candidacy. It
wasn't overly tough on her in public, wary of alienating female
voters, but it worked overtime behind the scenes to discredit her.</TE>
<TE>   This latest skirmish in South Korea's bare-knuckles political
world leaves the ruling party in disarray as key leaders talk about
defecting to create a new party.</TE>
<TE>   With only 16 of its 273 parliamentary seats held by women, South
Korea is ranked a low 97th in the world for female participation in
politics, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. Fourteen
parliamentary seats are vacant.</TE>
<TE>   Women for Women's Political Power, a South Korean nongovernmental
group, said in a statement that the standards used to judge Chang
were too high compared with those applied to past prime ministers.</TE>
<TE>   However, Chang's rejected candidacy is not likely to hurt women's
growing influence in South Korea, analysts said. In fact, given the
importance of female voters in the upcoming elections, the next
candidate for prime minister could again be a woman.</TE>

report.</TE>

<HD>Blast Kills 7 at University in Jerusalem</HD>
<DH>Israel: Three Americans die. Hamas claims responsibility
for attack, whose toll includes Arabs as well as Jews. The bomber
escapes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A powerful bomb ripped apart a crowded cafeteria at Jerusalem's
Hebrew University on Wednesday, killing seven people--three of them
Americans--and wounding nearly 100 others as they were sitting down
to lunch. Israeli Jews and Arabs and other foreign nationals were
also among the casualties.</LD>
<LD>   The military wing of Hamas, a radical Islamic group, claimed
responsibility for the attack at Israel's oldest and most prestigious
institution of higher education. The bombing, inside a student center
named for Frank Sinatra, was to avenge Israel's killing last week of
the top Hamas military commander and 14 other Palestinians, most of
them children, a Hamas spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli police said the nail-studded bomb appeared to have been
hidden in a bag and planted under or on top of cafeteria tables, then
detonated by an assailant who escaped--a departure from the suicide
bombings that have terrorized Israel for months.</LD>
<TE>   Besides the three Americans killed, four were injured, a State
Department spokeswoman said in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   One of the dead was identified by a family spokesman as
36-year-old Janis Ruth Coulter, assistant director of graduate
studies based at Hebrew University's New York office, Associated
Press reported.</TE>
<TE>   Coulter had been escorting U.S. students to Israel, the spokesman,
Harry King, said in Boston, where the victim's family lives. "Janis
Ruth was a wonderful, loving, caring person," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The attack shattered a sense--an illusion, perhaps--that the
university was an oasis, a sanctuary from daily violence. The
sprawling Mt. Scopus campus on the eastern outskirts of Jerusalem was
a place of higher learning for Jews and Arabs, as well as foreign
students. It had remained relatively free of the strife engulfing the
world just outside its metal gates.</TE>
<TE>   Especially in the cafeteria, where the bomb wreaked devastation,
students of many nationalities and ethnic backgrounds had mixed
casually--a rarity in a land polarized by hatred and revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the summer break, the university was busy. Hundreds of
students were present to take exams. Summer Hebrew-language courses
popular with foreigners had just begun.</TE>
<TE>   "No one would have expected this to happen here," Alastair
Goldrein, a British national taking Jewish studies at the school,
told reporters at the scene. He had just approached the cafeteria
when the explosion shook the ground. "Why would someone target this
university? This is what was best about Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Dazed, blood-spattered students staggered from the building in the
minutes after the blast. Rescue workers rushed up the narrow streets
to the cafeteria, located at the heart of the campus.</TE>
<TE>   The interior was etched in panic. Upturned chairs were scattered
on the bloodied floor; abandoned water bottles littered the tables.
The force of the blast blew windows and glass facades to bits and
tore panels from the ceiling. The stench of smoke and burned flesh
wafted through the air.</TE>
<TE>   "After the blast, everything went black, and you feel like you are
trapped inside a balloon, being sucked away or dragged by some
force," Yossi Halfon told Israeli radio. "I found myself running
outside, away from the cafeteria."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government branded the bombing "a despicable act so
horrendous it defies words." It said it makes no distinction between
Hamas and other Palestinian factions, including the Fatah movement of
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, on whom Israeli
officials said the ultimate blame rests.</TE>
<TE>   "No cause, no sense of deprivation, no argument can possibly
justify killing innocent teenagers in a discotheque, in a coffee shop
or, today, in the cafeteria of Hebrew University," said Dore Gold, an
advisor to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority condemned the bombing but said Sharon
and his "policies of destruction and collective punishment" bore the
ultimate blame.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush condemned the bombing. "There are
clearly killers who hate the thought of peace and, therefore, are
willing to take their hatred to all kinds of places, including a
university," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's attack was the second Palestinian bombing in two days.
On Tuesday, a 17-year-old Palestinian blew himself up at a popular
falafel stand in central Jerusalem, wounding five people but killing
no one else.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas is threatening a long campaign of revenge attacks. Even
before Wednesday's bombing, Israel's top internal security official,
Avi Dichter, had told a parliamentary committee that intelligence
services believed that at least 60 attacks were being planned.</TE>
<TE>   "If they are going to attack our children, then they will have to
expect to drink from the same poison," Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh
said Wednesday in Gaza City, where hundreds of Hamas supporters
poured into the streets late in the day to celebrate the university
bombing and vow more attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon convened his senior security advisors Wednesday afternoon
to plan the government's retaliation. Earlier, Israel finally
released $15 million to the Palestinian Authority, part of money owed
but retained as a punitive measure. Several of Sharon's government
ministers demanded, in the aftermath of the Hebrew University attack,
that no more money be released and that Israel suspend all contact
with Palestinian officials--contacts that were only beginning to be
renewed.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate to find a way to halt attacks that have continued
despite Israel's reoccupation of most of the West Bank, Sharon's
Cabinet decided before the cafeteria bombing to deport to the Gaza
Strip a male relative of a Palestinian man suspected in a recent
deadly shooting attack outside a Jewish settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Punishing the relatives of alleged terrorists is a controversial
move. When the government first floated the idea several weeks ago,
there was intense international criticism, and Israel's attorney
general said deportation could not be carried out en masse or imposed
on relatives who have no link to the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Early today in the West Bank town of Beit Jala, the army destroyed
the family home of the Palestinian who carried out Tuesday's
food-stand bombing.</TE>
<TE>   At Hebrew University, officials said that they had redoubled
security in recent months but that an open campus could not be
hermetically sealed--not, said university Vice President Moshe
Vigdor, "if you want to maintain a living, breathing campus, visited
by 20,000 people a year."</TE>
<TE>   Guards posted at perimeter gates and at the entrances to main
buildings routinely search book bags, backpacks and purses. But in
the spirit of educational freedom, police are not stationed
throughout the campus.</TE>
<TE>   Several student leaders were critical of what they called lax
security. They said it was easy to gain access to the campus from the
adjacent Palestinian village of Issawiyeh by scaling a low fence and
scampering through the gardens.</TE>
<TE>   The university's student newspaper, Pi Haaton, published an
account in April called "Chronicle of an Attack Foretold," in which
it predicted a bombing in the same student center that was the scene
of Wednesday's tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Benny Vered, the paper's deputy editor, said that for a related
story he held a large sign saying "terrorist" and jumped over the
fence. "I just crossed back and forth for 40 minutes, and no one
looked twice," Vered told Israeli radio Wednesday. "The security at
the entrances to the university is actually relatively good. But it's
like placing a door in the middle of the desert and guarding it
closely, while ignoring the rest."</TE>
<TE>   The Mt. Scopus campus is adjacent to several Arab neighborhoods.
In what was considered a major event in Zionist history, the
university was inaugurated on the site in 1925, before the
establishment of the state of Israel. It flourished until Israel's
1948 War of Independence, when it became disconnected from
Israeli-controlled West Jerusalem. An alternative campus was
established in West Jerusalem. After Israel captured the West Bank in
1967, the Mt. Scopus facility regained its status as the main campus.</TE>
<TE>   The Frank Sinatra Center is named for the late singer, who with
other West Coast benefactors donated money for its construction.</TE>
<TE>   Of an estimated 23,000 students at Hebrew University, about 20%
are Arab and about 1,500 are foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   "We were an oasis of coexistence," Hebrew University rector Haim
Rabinowitch said in an interview. "We have differences of opinion,
Jews, Arabs, religious, secular. A university by definition is a
place of plural ideas.... The terrorists broke all the rules."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers James Gerstenzang and Paul Richter in
Washington contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Canonization Spotlights Mexico's Indians</HD>
<DH>Religion: While naming Juan Diego the first indigenous
American saint, John Paul II urges greater respect for minority
rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II proclaimed Juan Diego Cuauhtlatoatzin the Roman
Catholic Church's first indigenous American saint Wednesday and, in a
colorful Mass blending Aztec and European traditions, challenged
Mexico to end the racism and neglect that mire its Indian minority in
poverty.</LD>
<LD>   In a Spanish-language homily televised live in much of the Western
Hemisphere, John Paul urged his hosts to build "a better Mexico, with
greater justice and solidarity," and to support Indians' "legitimate
aspirations, respecting and defending the authentic values of each
ethnic group."</LD>
<LD>   "Mexico needs its indigenous people, and these peoples need
Mexico," he said.</LD>
<TE>   President Vicente Fox joined the 10,000 worshipers inside Mexico
City's Basilica of Guadalupe, becoming the first Mexican chief
executive to attend a papal Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of thousands of jubilant believers lined John Paul's
route to the shrine and watched the ceremony on giant TV screens set
up in the middle of closed-off boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen Indians in multicolored plumed headdresses danced up the
central aisle of the basilica as a portrait of the new saint was
borne to the altar through a cloud of incense. Three Indians blew on
conch shells, and people throughout the congregation shook maracas.</TE>
<TE>   Priests read from the Bible in Spanish and in Nahuatl, the
language of the Aztecs.</TE>
<TE>   The pope's message and the indigenous flavor of the high-profile
Mass could weigh heavily on two conflicts within Mexico and
Catholicism.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico and its dominant church are struggling to come to terms
with an Indian rights movement led by Zapatista rebels, who staged an
armed uprising in the mid-1990s, as well as with demands by
indigenous lay Catholics for a bigger role in administering their
parishes.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, the billion-member church is divided by controversy
over how far to stretch its liturgy and traditions to accommodate
non-European converts.</TE>
<TE>   According to legend, Juan Diego was a Chichimeca Indian convert to
Catholicism in 1531, a decade after the Spanish conquest of Mexico,
when the mother of Jesus appeared before him as the dark-skinned
Virgin of Guadalupe. After the local Spanish bishop demanded proof of
the apparition, the virgin miraculously imprinted her image on his
cloak.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish missionaries spread the story to help convert indigenous
people throughout Latin America, making it the most populous Catholic
region in the world. The Guadalupe basilica, built on the site of the
reported apparition, is the second-most visited Catholic shrine after
St. Peter's in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Mexicans are overwhelmingly Catholic and mestizo, of mixed
Indian and Spanish blood. But about 10% of Mexico's 100 million
people are Indians who cling to their ancestral language and culture.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them feel alienated from the church and are defecting to
Protestant faiths.</TE>
<TE>   In retelling Juan Diego's story, the pope asserted that
Catholicism needs to launch a "new evangelization." He came down on
the side of openness to indigenous rituals and language--and against
Vatican traditionalists.</TE>
<TE>   The Virgin of Guadalupe and Juan Diego, the pontiff said in his
homily, are "a model of perfectly inculturated evangelization," in
which the church of five centuries ago showed how to adapt to Indian
ways.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul, 82, ignored Vatican advice to avoid this journey
because of his frail health. He slumped in a gilded chair during the
three-hour Mass, straining to raise his head before speaking.</TE>
<TE>   In a weary but firm voice, he brushed off doubts by some scholars
that Juan Diego really existed. He was, John Paul said, "a good
Christian Indian, whom simple people have always considered a saint."</TE>
<TE>   "In accepting the Christian message without forgoing his
indigenous identity, Juan Diego discovered the profound truth of the
new humanity, in which all are called to be children of God," the
pope added. "Thus he facilitated the fruitful meeting of two worlds
and became the catalyst for the new Mexican identity."</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo Cruz, executive director of the Secretariat for Hispanic
Affairs at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington,
said the pope delivered a "powerful message" to traditionalists who
resist bending Eurocentric Catholic liturgy.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the 'new evangelization' requires us to understand that
this diversity God has given us is an integral part of our identity
as Catholics, and we must celebrate that difference," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are struggling with that idea in the United States as our
parishes become bombarded with immigrants," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The pope drew loud applause when he insisted that Juan Diego's
life should be a model for "encouraging brotherhood among all
[Mexico's] children and ever helping to reconcile Mexico with its
origins, values and traditions."</TE>
<TE>   Indigenous leaders took that as an endorsement of their struggle
for equality.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Vazquez, a Nahua leader who wore a straw hat and a loose
white cotton suit to Mass, said he did not believe that another armed
struggle like the Zapatista rebellion was necessary. Instead, he
repeated the pope's advice to behave like the humble, respectful Juan
Diego--but he added that he would pray to the new saint for a
miracle.</TE>
<TE>   Indians want a stronger version of the Indian rights bill passed
last year by Mexico's Congress. The law leaves implementation up to
state governments, which have been slow to act.</TE>
<TE>   "What the pope is telling us is that our weapon should be the
Gospel, hope and faith," said Vazquez, president of an impoverished
7,000-member Nahua community in Tuxpan, near Guadalajara. "Today we
have hope in our president, hope that Juan Diego will illuminate Mr.
Vicente Fox on the urgency of our demands."</TE>
<TE>   Fox later discussed Indian rights, poverty and other issues with
the pope during what the president's office called a 20-minute
courtesy visit at the papal nuncio's residence in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Sahagun de Fox, the president's wife, attended the meeting,
but there was no indication that any personal issues came up.</TE>
<TE>   Fox and his wife, both practicing Catholics, are seeking
annulments of their first marriages to gain church recognition for
their marriage to each other last year.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's election two years ago ended seven decades of rule by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party and helped warm church-state
relations.</TE>
<TE>   For the pope's visit, more than 35,000 police and 1,600 doctors
were put on special duty to help with crowds, and brigades of
government workers planted flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested a 14-year-old boy for firing an air gun from the
roof of his house shortly before the pope passed by on his way from
the cathedral. They said John Paul was not the target.</TE>
<TE>   Faithful hordes climbed trees, hung from balconies and perched on
rooftops to get a glimpse of John Paul, who waved from his vehicle
through bulletproof glass that was partially lowered to give the
crowds a better view.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first pope to recognize an Indian, a humble Indian!"
said Maria Socorro Dominguez, a 48-year-old lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Mexican Americans, including about 150 from the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, traveled here for the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Father Vicente Lopez, a priest at Mother of Sorrows Catholic
Church in South-Central Los Angeles, said Juan Diego's canonization
had special significance for Mexican Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "If a man from the lowliest caste in Mexico can be recognized as a
saint, then there's hope for those on the bottom," he said. "A lot of
Latinos who migrated north see themselves in Juan Diego. They see
that what the Indians suffer in Mexico is pretty much what they
suffer in the United States."</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Resume Dialogue With North Korea</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: A brief meeting between Powell and his
counterpart at ASEAN summit breaks the impasse. Russia served as a
go-between.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei</DL>
<LD>After 18 months of menacing rhetoric by both nations, the United
States and North Korea will resume their dialogue as a result of the
first contact Wednesday between Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
and North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun.</LD>
<LD>   "We have agreed to resume the dialogue between North Korea and the
United States," Paek said after an informal, 15-minute chat early
Wednesday at an annual Asian summit here. "Everything went
satisfactorily."</LD>
<LD>   Powell later described the talks, held over coffee in a delegates
lounge, as a good meeting. "We agreed where we are, and I told him
that we should stay in touch and see how to pursue our dialogue,"
Powell said after a meeting here with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
S. Ivanov.</LD>
<TE>   North Korea also said it would welcome a formal proposal for
further discussions, a senior State Department official told
reporters traveling with Powell. But the secretary will not make a
decision on that point until he gets back to Washington for further
consultations within the administration.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. goal is a "serious conversation on substantive issues,"
including weapons of mass destruction and North Korea's conventional
forces deployed along the border with South Korea, the U.S. official
said.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting was only the second of ranking officials from both
nations since they were at war half a century ago. Then-Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang in October 2000 to
negotiate a deal to limit North Korean production and sales of
ballistic missiles. The agreement was never finished because of
differences over verification and monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of the changing times, Russia urged the world's most
staunchly Marxist regime to engage the Bush administration. Ivanov
relayed Moscow's message to its Communist ally during a visit to
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Monday before flying to the
conference here. He then conveyed a message to Powell that North
Korea was ready for unconditional talks.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, in his State of the Union message, President
Bush described North Korea as one of three nations in an "axis of
evil" that produced weapons of mass destruction and endangered
democratic nations.</TE>
<TE>   The erratic government of Kim Jong Il appears to be trying to
reach out to the world again. South Korea on Tuesday accepted
Pyongyang's proposal to resume talks. Japan also has agreed to talks.
Foreign ministers of the two countries held talks Wednesday on the
sidelines of the conference in Brunei, an oil-rich sultanate on
Borneo.</TE>
<TE>   Yet not everything has changed. Even as Powell and Paek met, North
Korea's state-run media labeled the United States "the aggressor and
kingpin of evil." A commentary in the Communist Party paper Rodong
Sinmun also called for Washington to pull its 37,000 troops from
South Korea, where they have been based since the 1950-53 war.</TE>
<TE>   The Pyongyang regime also charged Wednesday that South Korea is
trying to undermine dialogue by its actions in the Yellow Sea,
alleging that several South Korean patrol boats and dozens of fishing
craft had crossed into its waters. The disputed area has been the
source of frequent tension, including a naval confrontation in late
June in which at least four South Korean sailors were killed.</TE>
<TE>   After first blaming the United States and South Korea for the
confrontation, the Pyongyang regime abruptly expressed regret last
week, putting diplomatic efforts back on track.</TE>
<TE>   News of the Powell-Paek meeting took the limelight from the
gathering of 23 Southeast Asian and Pacific Rim countries. But
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the foreign
ministers assembled were delighted by the renewed contact.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting also came a week before the U.S., European Union,
South Korea and Japan will oversee the beginning of construction of
an atomic plant for North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 7, the foundation is to be poured for a light-water
reactor, the product of a 1994 agreement negotiated by the United
States to end North Korea's nuclear power program, which the West
feared would be used to develop material for nuclear weapons.</TE>

<HD>U.N. Blames Both Sides in Jenin Battle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>A U.N. report on Israel's military attack on a Palestinian refugee
camp does not back up claims of a massacre, but it does criticize
both sides for putting civilians in harm's way, Western diplomats
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The report accuses Israel of delaying medical help to Palestinians
in the Jenin refugee camp. And it charges Palestinian militants with
deliberately putting its fighters and equipment in civilian areas in
violation of international law, the diplomats said.</LD>
<LD>   The violence in Jenin came during a five-week offensive Israel
launched March 29 in response to a suicide bombing that killed 29
Jews. The heaviest fighting during the period was in the Jenin camp,
where Palestinians claimed that Israeli attacks killed as many as 500
people.</LD>
<TE>   The report, set to be released today, says that 52 Palestinian
deaths were confirmed by April 18 and that as many as half may have
been civilian. It calls the allegation that up to 500 were killed "a
figure that has not been substantiated," the diplomats said. Israel
has reported 23 soldiers killed in the battle.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. findings mirror those of Human Rights Watch.</TE>

recession was deeper than thought.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>New measures released Wednesday show that the nation's economic
recovery--which seemed so dazzling in the immediate aftermath of last
year's terror attacks--is stumbling.</LD>
<LD>   The gross domestic product, which measures the economy's total
output of goods and services, grew at only a 1.1% annual rate in the
spring, according to new figures from the Commerce Department. That
was less than half what had been expected and substantially less than
the 5% pace of earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   The sharp slowdown in the April-through-June quarter raises the
risk of the country slipping back into recession and contradicts the
upbeat posture of the Bush administration, which has been portraying
the economy as well along the road to recovery. American consumers,
one of the few supports for the economy, appear to be pulling back,
analysts say.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, last year's recession, which top administration
officials only last weekend were describing as barely perceptible,
turns out to have been longer, deeper and more damaging than
previously thought, newly revised Commerce Department figures reveal.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of shrinking for a single quarter in 2001 as the
government had thought, the revised figures show, the economy
contracted for nine straight months.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of paying $5.1 trillion in wages and salaries last year,
the figures show, employers paid $4.95 trillion, or almost 3% less
than previously thought. Instead of making $1.64 trillion in profits
in 2000 and 2001, the figures show, corporate America made $1.5
trillion, or 8.5% less.</TE>
<TE>   Combined with separate reports that show manufacturing in the
nation's heartland weakening and a Federal Reserve study that
describes growth nationally as uneven, the new GDP figures paint a
decidedly dark picture of the country's immediate prospects, analysts
say.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only was last year's recession more severe, but this year's
recovery is less robust than we thought," said Mark Zandi, chief
economist of Economy.com, a West Chester, Pa., forecasting firm.
"Basically, the economy has come to a standstill since spring."</TE>
<TE>   The stock market, which has been struggling to catch its balance
after months of losses, initially sank on Wednesday's economic news
but then rallied. Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index ended the day higher, while the
tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost more ground.</TE>
<TE>   Market watchers said the unusual reaction was evidence that people
on Wall Street and in Washington had their minds elsewhere,
especially on talk of a U.S. invasion of Iraq. One of the big winners
Wednesday was Exxon Mobil Corp., whose shares jumped 3% in value;
many believe that the energy giant would profit if a new Middle East
war drove up oil prices.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush sought to put the best face on the new numbers,
saying they show the economy is growing again, even if not strongly.</TE>
<TE>   "I am positive about our economy," the president told reporters
after a morning Cabinet meeting. "I feel very optimistic about it
because I look at the facts, and the facts are that inflation is low,
interest rates low, productivity is high."</TE>
<TE>   But many analysts say the new GDP figures cut to the very heart of
the optimists' assessment of the economy. The numbers show that the
economy's performance was nowhere near as spectacular as it was made
out to be. And they suggest that the principal player behind what
little growth there has been recently, the free-spending American
consumer, is beginning to cut back.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no locomotive that's pulling this economy forward," said
Edward F. Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast in Los
Angeles. "We're going to have sluggish growth for a long time. It's
not going to feel good, and it's not going to be any good for jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Leamer and others said that at 1.1%, the real, inflation-adjusted
growth rate for the latest quarter was too weak to reduce the
nation's unemployment rate, which has risen to 5.9% from a four-
decade low of 3.9% in October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Unemployment is going up almost no matter what," economist Zandi
predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Before Wednesday, most analysts thought the economy had grown at a
2.3% pace in the spring quarter and at a powerful 6.1% rate from
January through March. Besides announcing weaker growth in the latest
quarter, Commerce officials also trimmed their initial estimate of
the earlier quarter's growth to 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the most recent quarter's figures were particularly
disturbing because they showed that much of the recent weakness was
traceable to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Although consumer spending, which accounts for nearly two-thirds
of the nation's economic activity, continued to grow, it did so at a
considerably slower pace than in recent quarters and without a burst
of expenditures on big-ticket items such as houses and cars.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts say a slowdown on the consumer's part is precisely
what the economy does not need.</TE>
<TE>   "What these numbers suggest is that what you've got is an
exhausted consumer," Leamer said. "That's not good for growth."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the one positive note in the most recent quarterly
numbers was a pickup in business investment in equipment and
software. But the improvement was modest at best: Investment, which
was racing along at a nearly 20% clip in the late 1990s, climbed at a
mere 2.9% rate in the latest quarter, the Commerce Department
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps as striking as the recent quarterly numbers were
Commerce's revision of its annual growth figures for the last years
of the 1990s boom and the first years of the new decade.</TE>
<TE>   Although the department regularly revises its GDP figures as new
information becomes available, officials acknowledged Wednesday that
the latest revisions were particularly large. They represented, in
effect, the economic equivalent of the recent rash of corporate
profit restatements.</TE>
<TE>   The revisions show that the economy slowed abruptly in mid-2000,
earlier than previously thought, and began contracting during the
first quarter of 2001, just as Bush took office.</TE>
<TE>   Commerce officials concluded that instead of growing 1.2% in 2001,
the economy shrank for the first three quarters and then grew at a
2.7% pace in the quarter after the Sept. 11 attacks. For the full
year, growth was a negligible 0.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the changes mean that such important economic
measures as productivity growth were nowhere near as strong as
previously thought.</TE>
<TE>   That means the economy will have to pull out of its current
troubles without many of the advantages policymakers such as Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan thought it had.</TE>

<HD>Simon Firm Must Pay $78 Million, Jury Rules</HD>
<DH>Verdict: The panel finds the family investment group liable
for fraud in a pay telephone deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles Superior Court jury ordered the William E. Simon &amp; Sons
firm to pay $78 million in damages for fraud and other misconduct in
an investment debacle that also led to a major personal financial
loss for Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr.</LD>
<LD>   The damages awarded at hearings Tuesday and Wednesday by a state
Superior Court jury were a major blow to a candidate who has marketed
himself primarily as a successful businessman.</LD>
<LD>   The jury ordered the Simon firm to pay $65 million in punitive
awards and $13.3 million in compensatory damages to the plaintiff, P.
Edward Hindelang of Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   Simon released a statement Wednesday saying he expects Superior
Court Judge Thomas L. Willhite Jr. to set aside the judgment "or it
will be overturned on appeal."</TE>
<TE>   "The findings in today's court verdict are fundamentally flawed,
and I don't expect them to stand," the candidate said.</TE>
<TE>   Two investment partners of the Simon group were also found liable
for fraud: B-R Investors Inc. and BR Telephony Partners LP, both
controlled by William Rogers. The jury ordered B-R Investors to pay
$8.9 million in compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive
damages.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, a co-founder and co-chairman of William E. Simon &amp; Sons,
was not named as a defendant. But the case stems from a 1998 pay
telephone investment deal in which Simon personally lost more than
$1.2 million, according to tax returns that he let reporters see for
a few hours last week.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that Simon reviewed details of the deal as it
unfolded, and he testified about his role in a videotaped deposition.</TE>
<TE>   The jury found that William E. Simon &amp; Sons--established in 1988
by Simon, his brother Peter and their father, William E. Simon, the
late Treasury secretary--defrauded Hindelang in a deal to take
control of his Los Angeles pay phone company, Pacific Coin.</TE>
<TE>   The jury concluded that the Simon firm hid from Hindelang, who
retained an interest in the company, that it planned to borrow huge
sums of money to expand Pacific Coin against his wishes, and then to
take it public in a stock offering.</TE>
<TE>   Within months of the Simon group's February 1998 takeover, Pacific
Coin went deep into debt to fund its $42-million acquisition of
another company, Golden Tel, which owned a network of pay phones in
Las Vegas casinos. Pacific Coin soon collapsed and was taken over by
its lenders.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon group, according to Hindelang, gave up on Pacific Coin
and let it die in order to take advantage of tax deductions from the
resulting losses. The candidate's tax returns show that Bill Simon
Jr. substantially reduced his federal tax bill in 1999 and 2000 by
writing off his Pacific Coin losses.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Oster, a lawyer for Hindelang, told the jury Wednesday that
the greed and arrogance of the Simon investment group caused the
death of Pacific Coin, a company that Hindelang had built up over 14
years.</TE>
<TE>   "They destroyed the company," Oster said. "They destroyed 14 years
of hard work."</TE>
<TE>   The jury also upheld Hindelang's complaint that the Simon firm
concealed its plan to charge him unconscionable investment banking
fees totaling $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said that Hindelang had failed to disclose to the Simon
investment group that he had been convicted for marijuana trafficking
in the 1970s. Simon called Hindelang "precisely the kind of criminal
I used to pursue" as a Manhattan federal prosecutor in the 1980s.
Under the Simon group's control, Pacific Coin fired Hindelang after
learning of his conviction in a Wall Street Journal story.</TE>
<TE>   But the Superior Court jury dismissed a claim by the Simon
investors in which they charged that Hindelang had defrauded them by
concealing his conviction.</TE>
<TE>   In a hearing Wednesday on the damage claims, Hindelang's attorneys
portrayed the talk of their client's marijuana conviction as
irrelevant to the Pacific Coin investment fiasco. They said it was
part of a campaign of character assassination by the Simon group to
smear a man who had the courage to challenge a powerful Wall Street
investment firm in court.</TE>
<TE>   The jury found unanimously that William E. Simon &amp; Sons was liable
for defrauding Pacific Coin Management, a company led by Hindelang.</TE>
<TE>   The damage awards underscored anew the perils of running for
public office as a businessman at a time of corporate scandal in
America. For two months, Simon's Democratic opponent, Gov. Gray
Davis, has hammered him in television ads for some failures that
Simon suffered as an investment banker. Davis' most recent spot says
Simon has faced "losses, bankruptcies, lawsuits and even allegations
of fraud."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's difficulties could grow further next month when--just
weeks before the Nov. 5 election--a trial is scheduled to begin in a
1992 lawsuit he filed to recover his family's $40-million investment
in the defunct Western Federal Savings and Loan.</TE>
<TE>   Simon alleges that government wrongdoing caused the S&amp;L's
collapse. But the U.S. Justice Department argues that Simon and his
partners made a bad investment, then made it worse by retaining
executives who mismanaged the thrift.</TE>
<TE>   The pay phone deal was one of hundreds that Simon oversaw during
his 14 years as a top manager at his family's investment firm. Simon,
who ran the firm's Los Angeles office, has taken a leave of absence
to run for governor.</TE>
<TE>   In his statement Wednesday, Simon said his family invested $16.5
million in Pacific Coin. In an interview with The Times last winter,
Simon recalled that his wife asked him at the time: "Why do you want
to invest in a pay phone company? Nobody uses pay phones anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said he replied: "No matter how much mobile phones come in,
there's always going to be a need for pay phones."</TE>
<TE>   But Simon's tax returns show that Pacific Coin was one of Simon's
biggest investment failures. It appears on the tax returns as
Coinable Simon LLC, the company that his family set up to invest in
Pacific Coin. Simon took Coinable Simon write-offs of $754,314 in
1999 and $450,546 in 2000. The jury found Coinable Simon liable for
fraud, but assessed damages only to William E. Simon &amp; Sons and its
partner in the deal, B-R Investors.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, lawyers for the Simon investment group tried to
convince the jury that the Simon group had done nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose it would be politic for me to say I'm sorry," William
H. Lancaster, a William E. Simon &amp; Sons lawyer, told the jury. "I
cannot. I will not. I did not bring you a lie. My clients did not
bring you a lie."</TE>
<TE>   "They made a very substantial investment in the company, and it
was lost," he said. "Is that reprehensible? No."</TE>

<HD>'Senseless' Attack by Chicago Mob Leaves 2 Dead</HD>
<DH>Crime: The driver of a van accidentally slams into a group
on porch, injuring three. He and passenger are beaten to death. No
arrests have been made yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>On a hot, humid evening in one of this city's toughest South Side
neighborhoods, two men accidentally injured three women when their
van ran into a porch--and a mob descended and beat the men to death.</LD>
<LD>   Chicago police, who had detained one man for questioning but made
no arrests by late Wednesday, ruled both deaths homicides.</LD>
<LD>   "A thug is a thug is a thug is a thug," said Chicago Police Chief
Terry Hilliard. "These are murderers. They killed two innocent
individuals.... One was a senior citizen, as far as I am concerned."</LD>
<TE>   A furious Hilliard promised to bring the killers to justice.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know how senseless this is?" he asked. "This was a traffic
accident, a simple traffic accident. We have traffic accidents down
in the [downtown] Loop where people get injured and people don't beat
[the drivers] to death with their hands and fists."</TE>
<TE>   One of the victims of Tuesday night's accident was hospitalized in
critical condition late Wednesday; the other two women were listed in
fair condition.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of the two men, who also lived in the Oakland area,
were taken to the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the rental van, 62-year-old Jack Moore, and his
passenger and friend, Anthony Stuckey, 49, both died of multiple
blunt-trauma injuries, the medical examiner's office said. They were
apparently bludgeoned by fists, feet and sticks, as well as bricks
that had fallen from the porch the van had struck.</TE>
<TE>   Police pleaded with residents who saw the melee or perhaps
videotaped it to come forward. Neighbors said dozens of people were
outside in the humid, 90-degree heat when the accident occurred and
estimated that well over 100 gathered after the crash.</TE>
<TE>   "People were everywhere, yelling," said Sandra Bowen, 20. "Fists
were flying, people were screaming, then the cops came with all their
sirens, and the ambulances. They shouldn't have beat those men. But
everybody was right there and mad."</TE>
<TE>   A neighborhood with a few working-class homes and numerous
tenements, not far from the prestigious University of Chicago, the
Oakland neighborhood is predominantly black and poor.</TE>
<TE>   Although the area has improved somewhat over the last two decades,
improvement has been by a matter of degrees. In 1980, Oakland ranked
77th out of 77 Chicago neighborhoods in terms of income, according to
the U.S. Census Bureau. Some 66% of residents were living below the
poverty level and 52% of housing was government-subsidized public
housing.</TE>
<TE>   The area was later broken up for study purposes and officially
given various seldom-used neighborhood names by the city. But it
remains one of the most destitute and dangerous in the city.</TE>
<TE>   The accident occurred shortly after 6:30 p.m. Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, still distraught over his mother's recent passing,
according to local residents, was at the wheel of the van.</TE>
<TE>   Beside him was his longtime friend Stuckey, a mostly unemployed
day laborer who was helping to move some of Moore's mother's
furniture to a storage area, according to Stuckey's mother, Virginia
Stuckey.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to make a U-turn, according to witnesses--for reasons that
are unclear--Moore apparently lost control of the rented moving van,
ran across a yard, a sidewalk and into a house where several people
were gathered.</TE>
<TE>   The van pinned two women, Jenny Lawrence, 18, and Shauna Lawrence,
26, against the porch. A 17-year-old girl was also struck. Police did
not immediately identify her. Some members of the crowd, which was
overwhelmingly black, according to witnesses, set immediately upon
the men in the van, both of whom were also black.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of rendering aid to the three girls and waiting for
police, they pulled the two individuals out of the van and, using
their fists and bricks, beat them to death," said Chicago Police
Department spokesman Philip Cline.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the first patrol car was on the scene four minutes
after the first call to 911 came in--though it's not clear how long
after the accident the first call was made. Numerous other officers
arrived shortly thereafter because the first officer called for
backup.</TE>
<TE>   Julia Mitchell, who lives across the street, said she made eye
contact with one of the two men immediately after the beating. "His
eyes were big and he was scared," the 29-year-old said. "He looked at
me, blinked once and exhaled, and I knew that he had died."</TE>

<LD>   The state's three largest drugstore chains say they are
withdrawing from Massachusetts' Medicaid program, meaning poor and
disabled people could soon be shut out of more than half of the
state's pharmacies.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Jane Swift urged CVS, Walgreens and Brooks Pharmacy to
reconsider and said her administration is exploring legal options to
force the companies to continue filling prescriptions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a good time for a little corporate responsibility," Swift
said.</TE>
<TE>   The chains said they will withdraw from the assistance program
because of state budget cuts that reduce reimbursement rates for

<HD>Navy Aviator Involved in Tailhook Gets Back Pay</HD>

<LD>WASHINGTON, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Overturning a 1995 decision, the Navy has promoted a highly
decorated aviator whose career was grounded by the Tailhook sex
scandal.</LD>
<TE>   Cmdr. Robert E. Stumpf, who once commanded the Blue Angels
precision flying team, has been promoted retroactively to captain and
will be given back pay to July 1995, officials said. Now a Federal
Express pilot living in Florida, Stumpf retired in late 1996, saying
he was tired of fighting for the promotion.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Stumpf attended the three-day Tailhook Assn. convention
in Las Vegas, where dozens of women complained they were groped and
assaulted by drunken pilots. The Defense Department's inspector
general implicated 117 officers in various offenses, including sexual
assault and indecent exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Though a board of inquiry in 1993 found no misconduct in Stumpf's
case, the Senate Armed Services Committee said it opposed Stumpf's
promotion, partly on the grounds of its own confidential probe.
Former Navy Secretary John H. Dalton pulled his name from a 1995
promotion list.</TE>

<HD>Bush Is Off to Ranch-- for a Working Vacation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Like much of official Washington, President Bush is about to leave
for his summer vacation. The White House is emphasizing that it will
not be all fun and no work.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials clearly are sensitive to any criticism
that Bush's 25-day break at his ranch near Crawford, Texas, is too
long, given the economy and the threat of terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Wednesday: "You
know, Washington is just a silly town sometimes where people don't
let a good man have a vacation without having to make more of it than
it is."</LD>
<TE>   Besides, Fleischer said, it isn't really a vacation: White House
staff will be shuttling into Crawford for meetings, the president
will visit 12 cities on short trips from the 1,600-acre ranch, and at
least one foreign visitor--President Vicente Fox of Mexico--is
expected to drop by.</TE>
<TE>   Just as presidential vacations in August are routine, so too are
flaps in Washington on whether the vacation is excessive.</TE>
<TE>   President Reagan regularly spent much of August at his ranch
outside Santa Barbara. Bush's father made several trips each summer
to his vacation home in Maine, including an annual vacation that
often stretched to three weeks in August. And President Clinton spent
two-week holidays on Martha's Vineyard.</TE>
<TE>   Just as he did last year during a 27-day summer stay at the ranch,
Bush is planning several days of travel beyond Crawford. On these
trips, he will give policy speeches and headline political events.
His plans include a three-day West Coast swing in late August.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also is summoning roughly half his Cabinet, other officials,
business executives, union members and others to an economic forum in
Waco, near Crawford, on Aug. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said that "when you subtract out all the days the
president's traveling and the days that the president's going to
welcome foreign leaders to Crawford or the days that he's going to
have an economic forum in Waco, fact is, he's probably going to be
down to about two weeks [of vacation], just like everybody else, like
most people."</TE>
<TE>   Bush leaves for Texas on Tuesday--one day after he returns to the
White House from a weekend visit at his parents' summer home in
Maine.</TE>

<HD>Firefighters on the Offensive at Mesa Verde Park</HD>

<DL>MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK, Colo.</DL>
<LD>Firefighters battling a 2,415-acre blaze in one of the nation's
archeological treasures took the offensive Wednesday as they began
digging containment lines.</LD>
<LD>   They got help from five helicopters, at least two air tankers and
30 engines. Crews were accompanied by archeologists to avoid
unnecessarily damaging the sites that make Mesa Verde National Park a
major tourist draw. The park remained closed.</LD>
<LD>   The fire, ignited by lightning, was spreading northeast. Fire
officials said cooler weather was forecast, which could help them
make some progress.</LD>
<TE>   "That gives us an opportunity," said Justin Dombrowski, a fire
information officer.</TE>
<TE>   The top priority of firefighters was protecting a research center
that holds artifacts and human remains, as well as the park's
archeological sites. After spending the previous day protecting
buildings, they also began digging lines to contain the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   The fire broke out Monday, forcing the evacuation of about 2,000
employees and tourists. The flames charred the mesa above a cliff
dwelling, but archeological sites were not damaged because they are
inside limestone cliffs.</TE>

<HD>Officials Probe Heart Attack Death on Train</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Authorities are investigating why a man who suffered a fatal heart
attack on a commuter train had to wait about 20 minutes for medical
attention while the train made its regular stops.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant conductor Susan Bergeron defended the crew, saying that
she performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on James Allen, 61, and
that it would have been dangerous for the train to rush through
stations without stopping.</LD>
<LD>   Allen died Tuesday in the emergency room at Boston Medical Center,
where he was taken when the train stopped in Boston, said Brian
Pedro, spokesman for the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Pedro said transit authority police were reviewing
the emergency procedures of Amtrak, which provides crew for the
commuter rail line, to see if there was negligence. Amtrak placed the
train's conductor on administrative leave. Allen, a coastal erosion
specialist for the U.S. Geological Survey, was stricken as the
Framingham-to-Boston train arrived at its Auburndale stop. Although
the crew was told of the emergency, passengers said the train stopped
at West Newton and Newtonville before arriving at Boston's Back Bay
station.</TE>

<HD>Senate Kills Prescription Drug Bill</HD>
<DH>Legislation: A drive to provide coverage for the elderly is
likely put off until after fall elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A much-heralded drive to provide the elderly with prescription drug
coverage died in the Senate on Wednesday, likely putting the
legislation on hold until the fall elections determine whether either
party can gain the upper hand in shaping policy after 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Once-high hopes that Congress would enact a prescription drug
benefit this year were dashed when the Senate voted, 50 to 49,
against a last-ditch compromise. The Democratic leaders who control
the Senate then pulled the plug on a debate that had stretched over
more than two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Some proponents clung to hope that the push for prescription drug
coverage could be revisited soon if enough senior citizens rise up
and lambaste senators for their inaction.</LD>
<TE>   "It's never too late to do the right thing," said Bill Novelli,
head of the AARP, the senior citizen's group that plans to continue
its heavy lobbying to end the Senate stalemate.</TE>
<TE>   But others predicted that Wednesday's vote was likely the Senate's
last word on the issue this year. "This is probably our last, best
chance to pass a prescription drug benefit in [this] Congress," Sen.
Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) said of the compromise plan he helped write.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate, having shelved several alternatives for providing drug
coverage in recent votes, passed a more modest but important measure
to help curb the cost of medicine. It voted, 78 to 21, for a bill to
make it harder for brand-name drug companies to block the marketing
of cheaper generic versions.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Senate's debate on drug coverage was inconclusive, it
may not be for naught. Some believe a path to future compromises has
been opened because both parties took major steps away from their
traditional positions.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats for the first time significantly scaled back their most
ambitious plans for universal drug coverage. Republicans embraced a
bigger expansion of a government entitlement program than the party
traditionally has supported. The two parties even seemed to reach
consensus on the price tag: By the debate's end, both Republicans and
Democrats were backing alternatives that would cost roughly $400
billion through 2012.</TE>
<TE>   But prospects for compromise broke down on stubborn philosophical
differences--not over spending but over the role of government.
Democrats, preferring the stability and uniformity of a
government-run program, wanted the coverage delivered through
Medicare, which provides benefits to those 65 and older and to the
disabled. Republicans preferred relying on the private sector to
deliver drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries, arguing that
competition among insurance companies and health maintenance
organizations would be more efficient than government in controlling
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's final vote on the issue came on a compromise that
would have targeted drug benefits to elderly people who are poor or
face very high drug costs. It would have cost $390 billion through
2012 and would be delivered through the Medicare program.</TE>
<TE>   The vote broke largely along party lines: four Republicans joined
45 Democrats in voting for the bill; 44 Republicans, five Democrats
and one independent voted against it. California's senators,
Democrats Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, both voted in favor of
the compromise.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Senate rejected a Democratic proposal that would
have cost $594 billion through 2012. Also failing was a GOP plan
totaling $370 billion over the same period. Both fell short of the 60
votes needed to clear a crucial Senate procedural hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   A bill passed earlier this year by the GOP-led House would provide
about $310 billion for drug coverage over 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats said they were pleased their bill drew 52
votes--more than any other alternative. "It's inevitable that we're
going to pass it; it's just a question of when," said Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.).</TE>
<TE>   Even the Republican alternative--which won 48 votes--would have
represented the biggest expansion of benefits for Medicare recipients
since the program was established in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Senate debate made clear that there is a broad
consensus that something needs to be done to help the elderly cope
with drug costs. Almost every senator voted for one or another of the
various drug-coverage alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   But the stalemate is characteristic of how hard it is to work out
the details of a major new social program with Congress so narrowly
divided between the two parties. Republicans control the House by a
handful of votes; Democrats rule the Senate by one seat.</TE>
<TE>   When Congress enacted Medicare, by contrast, Democrats controlled
the Senate by a 36-seat margin and the House by a 155-seat margin.</TE>
<TE>   Many Democrats plan to use the stalemate over drug coverage to
make the case to voters that they should elect more Democrats to
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "Democrats control the Senate, but they don't control it by enough
votes," said Tovah Ravitz-Meehan, spokeswoman for the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee. "That becomes a rallying cry for us:
If we have reinforcements, we can finish these and other domestic
issues."</TE>
<TE>   Similar arguments will be made by Democrats about House races.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP's political sensitivity to the drug issue was apparent in
Wednesday's roll call vote on the compromise. Three of the five most
vulnerable Republicans facing re-election this November voted for the
compromise: Smith of Oregon, Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas and Susan
Collins of Maine. Collins' Democratic opponent has made the issue the
centerpiece of the bid to unseat her.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans believe the Senate stalemate gives them fresh
ammunition for defending their record on an issue that is
traditionally Democratic turf. They are stressing that the House--the
chamber they control--passed a prescription drug plan, while the
Senate did not.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be pretty hard to blame it on someone else when you
are in charge," said Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).</TE>
<TE>   The National Republican Senatorial Committee has already aired
radio ads criticizing Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, for failing to pass a prescription drug
bill. "Max Baucus, he's all hat and no cattle!" the ad said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, while not taking a prominent role in the
debate, was quick to criticize the Senate for failing to act. Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer said, "Seniors once again will have to
continue to wait for long overdue prescription drug coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts agree that the Senate debate may make it harder for
Democrats to use the issue against Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "Now you have the situation where everybody can go home and say
they voted for a prescription drug bill," said Tricia Neuman, vice
president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. "It's very difficult for
voters to understand the differences between these proposals."</TE>
<TE>   But political risks may face incumbents of both parties. John
Rother, of the AARP, said senior citizens are clearly running out of
patience with inaction on the drug issue. "Our members are not going
to accept finger pointing. We're not going to accept stalemate. We're
not going to rest until this thing is done this year."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Blendon, professor of health policy at Harvard University,
said he believes Congress will have to find a way to act before
voters go to the polls in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue has sufficient staying power; it's not going to go
away," said Blendon.</TE>

<HD>Rebel Flag Protest in 22nd Day</HD>
<DH>History: A Mississippi student makes his stand at the site
of early civil rights demonstrations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GULFPORT, Miss.</DL>
<LD>A college senior spent his 22nd straight day Wednesday camped out on
a Gulf Coast beach to protest the Confederate battle flag being flown
in a nearby display.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Whitfield, 21, is taking a peaceful stand against what he
views as an emblem of hatred at the same location where some of the
Deep South's first civil rights protests were held. The beach now is
a site where blacks and whites mingle to sunbathe and hold family
reunions.</LD>
<LD>   Whitfield, who is black and a student at traditionally black
Alcorn State University, has left his sit-in only to take an
occasional shower at his parents' Gulfport home. He's vowed to sit
there until the flag comes down.</LD>
<TE>   "I've learned more in three weeks than I've learned in the entire
21 years of my life," he said Monday, sitting under a canopy in the
90-degree heat. "This is about more than a flag. It's about
spirituality. It's about fearing God. I'm willing to stay here as
long as it takes."</TE>
<TE>   Whitfield and others say their reasoning is simple: The
30-year-old, eight-banner display is supposed to fly the historical
flags of the governments that have ruled this area, including the
Confederacy. The Stars and Bars of the Confederacy, not the Rebel
flag on display, is the correct banner, they say, and a historian
hired by the county agrees.</TE>
<TE>   The monument, a landmark along U.S. 90, is overseen by the County
Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "They say the majority of their constituents support this flag,"
said Whitfield. "Even if it were 99%, and 99% were wrong, I'd still
be here."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the board reiterated its decision to keep the Rebel
flag flying. The vote came two days after 500 people, including
leaders of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People
from across the South, held a rally in support of Whitfield.</TE>

<HD>Ohio Court OKs Lesbians' Name Change</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>In a victory for gay rights, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled Wednesday
that a lesbian couple can legally adopt a last name they created.</LD>
<LD>   The court said in a 6-1 vote that Belinda Lou Priddy and Jennifer
Lane Bicknell followed required procedures to change their names and
their intent was not fraudulent.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling reversed lower courts' decisions.</LD>
<TE>   Appeals courts in New Jersey and Pennsylvania also have ruled over
the last few years that trial courts cannot arbitrarily deny requests
by homosexuals and transsexuals to change their names.</TE>
<TE>   In Ohio, lower courts said the couple's new name would be
fraudulent because it would give the public the misperception that
same-sex marriages were lawful, thereby violating state policy.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Alice Robie Resnick wrote in the majority opinion that,
despite the "unique circumstances involved" in the case, the only
issue before the court was whether the couple's request to change
their last names was reasonable and proper under state law.</TE>
<TE>   "Any discussion, then, on the sanctity of marriage, the well-being
of society, or the state's endorsement of nonmarital cohabitation is
wholly inappropriate and without any basis in law or fact," Resnick
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Priddy, 31, and Bicknell, 33, filed individually in 1999 to change
their last names to "Rylen," which they created by combining letters
from each of their last names.</TE>
<TE>   The couple have lived together for 11 years. Priddy was
artificially inseminated and gave birth prematurely to triplets last
fall. Two babies died. The surviving girl, Sarah, has the last name
of Rylen.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Butler County Probate Court and the 12th Ohio District
Court of Appeals denied their requests to change their names.</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Bill to Ease Way for Generic Drugs</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Measure would get cheaper products to the
market more quickly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate, desperate to do something about the increasingly
burdensome cost of prescription drugs, overwhelmingly approved
legislation Wednesday intended to get cheaper generic drugs to market
more quickly.</LD>
<LD>   Moments after rejecting a final proposal to provide Medicare
recipients with a prescription drug benefit, senators voted, 78 to
21, for a bill designed to hold down the costs of prescription drugs
for everyone.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to easing the way for less expensive generic drugs to
get to market, the legislation would allow importers to buy U.S.-made
drugs in Canada, where they are significantly cheaper, and resell
them in the United States at below-market prices.</LD>
<TE>   Generic drugs, which must be as effective as their brand-name
counterparts, often cost as much as two-thirds less. The
Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Senate-approved
legislation would save consumers, insurers and government agencies
$60 billion over 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The vote was a rare defeat for the big drug companies, which have
one of the most powerful lobbies on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think the pharmaceutical industry today is sort of scratching
their head and saying, 'Gee whiz, we don't control the Senate. We
don't control the Congress the way we thought we did,' '' said Sen.
Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), an original co-author of the generics
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the
industry's leading trade group, immediately denounced the Senate
action, calling it ''an example of election-year politics trouncing
good policy.''</TE>
<TE>   Coming on the heels of the bruising, weeks-long battle over
Medicare drug coverage, the vote in the Senate on whether to revise
drug patent law was an easy call for most lawmakers. The Medicare
prescription drug benefit would have cost taxpayers a minimum of $300
billion over 10 years; the provision to speed generic drugs to market
would reduce medication prices for all consumers and cost taxpayers
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   But the Senate bill faces an uncertain future in the
Republican-controlled House. Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House
Energy and Commerce Committee, said the panel would consider taking
action on generic drugs but would be limited by the fact that only
one month remains in the legislative calendar before the November
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Several months ago, the generics legislation faced equally long
odds in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The pharmaceutical industry adamantly opposed revising the 1984
Hatch-Waxman law, named after Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) and Rep.
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   Patents now protect drugs from copycat competition for 20 years
from the date when the drug maker applies for Food and Drug
Administration approval. Because of the length of time consumed by
the approval process, the industry says the typical drug enjoys only
about 11 years of protection while it is on the market.</TE>
<TE>   But the manufacturer of an original drug can keep a generic
version off the market for another 30 months simply by filing a
lawsuit alleging patent infringement. In some cases, manufacturers
have secured multiple 30-month delays. Manufacturers' practice of
securing multiple patents on the same drug can keep generics off the
market for many more years.</TE>
<TE>   Brand-name manufacturers want to protect their market share from
the often devastating financial effect of generics. Within two months
after the FDA opened the door to generic versions of the
antidepressant Prozac, for example, Eli Lilly's sales of the iconic
drug had dropped roughly 70%.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate legislation would allow brand-name manufacturers only
one automatic 30-month patent extension. In addition, it would bar
them from paying generic companies to keep their copycat versions off
the market permanently--thus leaving consumers with only
higher-priced brand-name drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Prospects for the Senate bill improved after consumer advocates
and sponsors of the generics legislation succeeded in refocusing the
debate on rapidly escalating drug prices and the techniques used by
brand-name companies to keep generics out of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Prescription drug spending is increasing roughly 17% a year, and
health-care costs are again spiraling out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing the market share of generic drugs, which account for
almost half of all prescriptions filled but only 8% of the money
spent on them, seemed a reasonable step to many lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   ''We were able to take this bill, which seemed like a technical
bill, and change it so that people understood that it was
cost-cutting, it was money in their pocket,'' Schumer said Wednesday
in explaining the legislation's overwhelming support.</TE>
<TE>   Senate passage of the bill also came a day after the Federal Trade
Commission issued a report criticizing the brand-name companies'
''abuse'' of the original law and calling on Congress to do away with
the strategies that delayed the market entry of generic drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), co-author of the compromise
legislation passed by the Senate, called it ''a giant step forward in
lowering the cost of prescription drugs for all Americans.''</TE>
<TE>   Collins, who is running for reelection in November, faces a
Democratic opponent who has made lower prescription drug costs her
No. 1 campaign issue.</TE>
<TE>   The drug-price issue is especially critical for Collins, Sen. Paul
Wellstone (D-Minn.) and other senators from northern states who are
facing reelection. Many seniors in those states travel regularly to
Canada, where they can get their prescriptions filled at a fraction
of the cost charged by their hometown pharmacy.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, the generic legislation had bipartisan
support.</TE>
<TE>   Schumer and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona wrote the original
version, which was then modified by Collins and Democrat John Edwards
of North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the primary sponsor of the House
version, predicted that public pressure would force his Republican
colleagues to follow the Senate's example.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's a question of whether the Republicans can wean themselves
off of drug company money for the first time and do the right
thing,'' he said.</TE>

<HD>University Drops Race as Factor in Admissions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATHENS, Ga.</DL>
<LD>In response to a federal appeals court ruling, the University of
Georgia announced a new admissions policy Wednesday that doesn't
consider race.</LD>
<LD>   The overhaul comes after years of suits by white women who argued
that they would have been admitted if they were black or male. The
school has a higher percentage of female students than male students
and favored male applicants for several years.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta threw out the
policy last year. The university has now eliminated any consideration
of race, gender or country of origin, as well as a tradition of
favoring alumni-related applicants.</LD>
<TE>   This fall's freshman class of about 4,300 was admitted on the
basis of an interim formula combining high school grades with
standardized test scores.</TE>
<TE>   Applicants for the 2003 freshman class will be placed into three
groups: academically superior, academically competitive and not
competitive. There will be no accounting for race. The former plan
gave some borderline students a slight boost if they weren't white.</TE>
<TE>   Around the country, federal appeals courts have reached
conflicting decisions in recent years on affirmative action in
admissions.</TE>
<TE>   In a case that could ultimately go to the U.S. Supreme Court, a
federal appeals court in May upheld the use of race in admissions at
the University of Michigan law school. In 1996, a federal appeals
court ruling led the University of Texas law school to stop
considering race in admissions.</TE>

<HD>Bush Again Defends His Actions as a Member of Oil Company's
Board</HD>
<DH>Business: He opposed a Bahrain oil-drilling venture, and
says U.S. firms should pay taxes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush and the White House on Wednesday again fended off
questions about whether his record as a director of an oil company
undermined his administration's push for corporate reform.</LD>
<LD>   The latest controversy concerned companies locating overseas to
escape U.S. taxes, which Bush says he opposes.</LD>
<LD>   "We ought to look at people who are trying to avoid U.S. taxes....
I think American companies ought to pay taxes here," Bush said
Wednesday, one day after he signed legislation establishing stricter
accounting standards for U.S. corporations.</LD>
<TE>   Harken Energy Corp., on whose board of directors Bush served more
than a decade ago, established a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands, a
move that would have shielded profits from off-shore oil drilling
operations that Harken was starting near Bahrain, an island nation in
the Persian Gulf, if the work had produced oil.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the Harken subsidiary, Bush said he had opposed an
"arrangement with Bahrain, a drilling venture there."</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer denied that the
subsidiary was set up to avoid taxes. "Any oil that was produced in
Bahrain and sold in the United States would have been taxable in the
United States," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   He added: "No oil was produced, so I think it's a moot question."</TE>
<TE>   While taking a more aggressive stance against business corruption
in recent weeks, Bush has been forced to defend his record as a
Harken director.</TE>
<TE>   He was tardy in reporting to the Securities and Exchange
Commission his sale of nearly $850,000 worth of stock in Harken 12
years ago. Also, weeks after he sold the stock, its value tumbled.
That prompted an insider trading inquiry by the SEC; the agency
closed the investigation in 1991 after finding "insufficient
evidence" to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   These aspects of Bush's tenure with Harken have been publicly
aired before, including during the 2000 presidential campaign. But
they have drawn new attention during the push for the business reform
bill that Bush signed into law Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest matter, minutes from Harken Energy's board of
directors meetings in the fall of 1989 show that Bush and the
company's seven other directors were briefed on details of the
Bahrain venture, and all of them ultimately signed off on it.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bush strongly opposed the Bahrain deal when it first came
before the board that year, said an official of the Harken subsidiary
involved in the project. That opposition was based on reasons
unrelated to offshore corporate registrations and taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The official, Monte Swetnam, now retired, was president of Harken
Exploration Corp., the Harken subsidiary that included the Cayman
Islands-registered Harken Bahrain Oil Co. The subsidiary was created
to explore Bahrain's territorial waters. Swetnam also was the
project's chief architect and advocate within the company.</TE>
<TE>   "George Bush did oppose it, and to my recollection, he was the
only board member who opposed the Bahrain venture," Swetnam recalled
in a telephone interview Wednesday. "In fact, it became my job to win
over George Bush."</TE>
<TE>   Efforts by companies to register in foreign tax havens to avoid
paying U.S. taxes have drawn increasing political attention in recent
weeks. The Senate on Wednesday approved a measure that would prohibit
companies from doing business with the Pentagon if they take such a
step.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats said the report of the Harken subsidiary demonstrated
that as a business executive, Bush failed to follow the practices he
is now advocating.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is true, I think it gets harder and harder to take his
position on corporate accountability seriously," said Senate Majority
leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).</TE>
<TE>   Swetnam said he couldn't recall whether Bush and the rest of the
board were told that Harken Bahrain Oil Co. was created and
registered in the Cayman Islands.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, he said, Bush opposed the Bahrain exploration venture
because he believed such a costly and ambitious international
exploration project was far beyond Harken's experience, expertise and
financial means.</TE>
<TE>   "I do know I was able to reduce his fears significantly," Swetnam
said.</TE>
<TE>   That is confirmed by the Harken board meeting minutes obtained by
The Times.</TE>
<TE>   At the company's Dec. 6, 1989, board meeting, which Bush attended,
Swetnam extensively laid out "the potential benefits which the
Company could realize from this opportunity," the minutes stated.</TE>
<TE>   "The Board unanimously approved HEX [Harken Exploration Corp.]
proceeding toward finalization of a formal agreement with the state
of Bahrain," the minutes said.</TE>
<TE>   Swetnam recalled that Harken's decision to register its Bahrain
subsidiary in the Caymans "had been recommended by our
advisors"--specifically, Harken's auditors at the time, Arthur
Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   "It had to do with repatriating funds and the like," Swetnam said.
"It wasn't set up to be a tax dodge or anything."</TE>
<TE>   Many American multinational companies register subsidiaries that
do business overseas in such Caribbean island nations as the Caymans
to facilitate the movement of cash, as well as to insulate profit
from U.S. taxation.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Harken Bahrain Oil Co., though, profit was never an
issue. The venture, which was formally signed in late January 1990
and gave Harken rights to any and all oil or gas discovered and
produced off Bahrain's shores, involved drilling two dry holes before
it was abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Harken lost little of its own money.</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Bush Choice for Appellate Court Post</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Wednesday previewed the battles ahead for President
Bush's judicial nominees as it promoted a Pennsylvania judge to the
U.S. Appeals Court despite Democratic complaints he did not deserve
the job.</LD>
<LD>   The 64-35 margin to confirm U.S. District Judge D. Brooks Smith
was the closest judicial vote this year. Partisan fights are expected
before year's end on two other nominees, Priscilla Owen and Miguel
Estrada.</LD>
<LD>   Majority Democrats have opposed what they call conservative Bush
nominees and they are saving for last the most contentious picks for
the bench.</LD>
<TE>   "There's hardly a moderate among them, particularly at the
appellate court level," said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). "The
nominees are committed to an ideological agenda which turns the clock
back to maybe the 1930s, maybe the 1890s."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-four Democrats along with one independent, Sen. James M.
Jeffords of Vermont, lined up against Smith's nomination for the U.S.
3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. Fifteen Democrats sided with the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP called the criticism against the nominees unwarranted.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is the kind of thing that members of the body use as an
excuse for thwarting the president's judicial nominations, then the
American people will have a big laugh at our expense, and rightly
so," said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, top Republican on the Senate
Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, the committee delayed until after the Senate's
August recess a final decision on Owen, a Texas Supreme Court justice
nominated to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   The committee has not scheduled a hearing for Estrada, selected
for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
but the chairman, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), has promised one
before year's end.</TE>
<TE>   The committee earlier this year refused to let U.S. District Judge
Charles Pickering of Mississippi--also nominated to the 5th
Circuit--get a Senate vote after criticism from women's, civil rights
and liberal groups.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of Bush's appeals court nominations that have advanced
from the committee have won easy approval. The Senate has approved 64
district and appeals court nominees so far.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who was made a federal judge in 1988, will work out of the
Philadelphia-based appeals court covering Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Delaware and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</TE>

<HD>Kayaker, Stranded 2 Days, Is Rescued Off of Hawaii</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>A kayaker was found alive about 80 miles west of the Big Island, two
days after calling for help on his cellular telephone to report being
stranded at sea.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Stockton, 28, of Phoenix, was spotted by a Navy P-3 Orion
aircraft just before noon Tuesday, Coast Guard Petty Officer David
Mosley said.</LD>
<LD>   Stockton had been missing since Sunday afternoon, when he called
on a cell phone to report his kayak was taking on water about 10
miles from the Big Island. An English teacher and missionary, he
called back that night before dusk to say he spotted a search plane,
but crews were unable to locate him before the phone's battery died,
the Coast Guard said.</LD>
<TE>   "When they found him, they were able to see him waving his arms,"
Mosley said.</TE>
<TE>   A Coast Guard C-130 aircraft arrived on the scene about 12:30 p.m.
and dropped a life raft and supplies. A Coast Guard helicopter
dispatched from Oahu reached the scene at 1 p.m. and had Stockton out
of the water about 15 minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman at Kona Community Hospital said he was in good
spirits and in stable condition.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a choice, to stay with the boat, or swim to shore,"
Stockton said. "I chose the boat. I could have kicked myself for
that."</TE>

<HD>Lap Dancing Is OK--but Feet Are Off-Limits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Worried that excessive contact between topless or nude lap dancers
and their customers breeds prostitution, Clark County commissioners
on Wednesday adopted an ordinance that strictly limits what parts of
a dancer's body can touch a patron and that outlaws putting tip money
behind a dancer's G-string.</LD>
<LD>   The new ordinance, which affects 20 clubs near the Strip and in
outlying neighborhoods of the county, replaces a 1994 law that had
outright banned exotic dancers from performing up close and-personal
for individual patrons, frequently in curtained rooms. The law had
gone unenforced because strip clubs had successfully challenged its
constitutionality.</LD>
<LD>   "These restrictions will still allow people to come here and have
fun," said County Commissioner Yvonne Atkinson Gates. "But many of
the activities that had been going on were prostitution, or close to
it."</LD>
<TE>   The new law defines which parts of a patron's body the dancer
cannot touch, and which parts of her body are off-limits to customer
contact. But Atkinson Gates, who initially wanted a 6-foot separation
between dancer and patron, supported the final draft, which allows
the dancer to slide down a patron's leg as long as she doesn't touch
his groin or his feet.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the restrictions were needed because an 18-month
undercover vice operation resulted in 63 arrests of 52 dancers on
prostitution charges.</TE>
<TE>   Casino executives have grown increasingly frustrated that a
growing number of conventioneers and others are abandoning the Strip
in favor of strippers, and they hope the restrictions will temper the
clubs' popularity.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman welcomed the crackdown--so customers
would visit the strip clubs in his jurisdiction. "In my city, as long
as no law is broken, anything goes," he said. "That's what Las Vegas
is all about. That's what makes us mythical."</TE>

<DL>CRANFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>A semiretired hat salesman who beat leukemia years ago came forward
Wednesday to claim a $165-million lottery jackpot.</LD>
<LD>   Sundel "Sonny" Judson, 73, said he plans to form a foundation and
give part of the money to charity.</LD>
<LD>   Judson said he was diagnosed with leukemia almost 30 years ago and
given only a few months to live. He said he eschewed chemotherapy in
favor of a vitamin program his wife suggested. "I guess I beat the
odds," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The same applies to his July 16 win in the multistate Mega
Millions game. The odds were 1 in 135 million.</TE>
<TE>   Judson said he has been married for 52 years and has grown
children and grandchildren who also will benefit from the windfall.</TE>
<TE>   Judson, who has lived in a Cliffside Park condominium for 28
years, said he may splurge on a bigger apartment in the same
building, but he hopes the jackpot does not change his life.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty well-off before this," Judson said, adding that he
plans to continue working at Hyp, a New York City maker of baseball
caps.</TE>
<TE>   He chose to take the prize in a lump sum of $92 million.</TE>

<HD>Judge Voids Utah's Antinuclear Laws</HD>
<DH>Court: A U.S. jurist rules that statutes designed to keep
out waste are illegal. She says it is a federal issue, outside the
scope of state lawmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A federal judge has struck down a package of Utah laws designed to
keep nuclear waste out of the state, saying it is a federal issue
beyond the reach of state lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell said state officials have
unfairly hindered nuclear utilities that are seeking a federal permit
to store used nuclear fuel on the Skull Valley Goshute Indian
Reservation.</LD>
<LD>   Her ruling, issued late Tuesday, prohibits the state from
enforcing a series of laws that regulate nuclear waste and impose
large fees on waste-storage businesses.</LD>
<TE>   "Clearly, Utah may not prevent radiological waste from entering
Utah because of safety concerns. Nor may Utah create a separate,
state licensing process," Campbell wrote. She said the group, Private
Fuel Storage, has a right to seek a federal license without state
interference.</TE>
<TE>   A major decision on a federal license is expected later this year.
The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board has gathered testimony on the
plan and will advise the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on whether to
grant a permit, which would allow as much as 40,000 tons of waste to
stay in Utah for up to 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   The site is barren desert, about 45 miles southwest of Salt Lake
City, on the Goshute Reservation. The storage plan would bring the
small impoverished tribe a fortune--possibly as much as $3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The state had challenged the contract between the tribe and
Private Fuel Storage, saying it wasn't properly approved by the
Goshutes. Campbell ruled that the contract is a tribal matter and
none of the state's business.</TE>
<TE>   The state's antinuclear laws had also created obstacles in the
licensing process.</TE>
<TE>   One provision barred local governments from providing emergency
services to such an operation. Another required consent from the
governor and Legislature before state roads could be used in
connection with the facility.</TE>
<TE>   "This veto right builds the equivalent of a 'moat' around the
proposed site," Campbell wrote. That "moat" illegally infringed on
the realm of nuclear regulation--where the federal government holds
sway, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Martin, a spokeswoman for Private Fuel Storage, said
Campbell's ruling could help clear away any doubts regulators may
have.</TE>
<TE>   "Having this ruling I think makes it easier for them to rule," she
said. The decision also removes financial obstacles the state had
tried to build, such as a $5-million license application fee and a
requirement that Private Fuel Storage pay a "transaction fee" equal
to 75% of the value of its contracts.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Gov. Mike Leavitt said the state would appeal
the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Private Fuel Storage, a group of eight nuclear utilities, has
always considered the Skull Valley site a stopgap measure to deal
with a looming waste-storage crisis, Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has pledged to take charge of all waste
generated by nuclear utilities. A site in Yucca Mountain, Nev., has
been selected as the permanent dump for the nation's radioactive
waste, but it won't be built until at least 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Some Private Fuel Storage utilities, such as Minnesota's Xcel
Energy, are almost out of on-site storage space for spent fuel and
say they need a temporary dump while Yucca Mountain is developed.</TE>
<TE>   Six of the eight utilities that make up Private Fuel Storage have
said they won't need to ship any waste to Skull Valley in Utah--as
long as the Nevada site is built on time.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a new study released in Washington says that a volcanic
eruption at Yucca Mountain could do more damage than previously
thought, possibly forcing radioactive waste from its burial site to
the surface.</TE>
<TE>   If long-dormant volcanoes near the prospective high-level nuclear
waste dump sprang back to life, molten rock traveling at speeds up to
600 miles an hour could fill the repository deep beneath the Nevada
desert within hours, said an article published in the July issue of
Geophysical Research Letters, a publication of the American
Geophysical Union.</TE>
<TE>   Intense heat and pressure could cause some canisters of spent
nuclear fuel that are to be buried at Yucca to rupture and allow
radioactive material to flow toward the surface, the article said.</TE>
<TE>   "It can potentially affect a large number of waste canisters,"
wrote a team of English, Dutch and American scientists that developed
computer models to assess the risk of a volcanic eruption.</TE>
<TE>   Seven dead volcanoes are within 27 miles of the site, but the last
eruption was 80,000 years ago. Yucca project scientists say that the
chance of one occurring within the waste repository over the next
10,000 years is 1 in 70 million.</TE>

<HD>White House Assailed Over Whistle-Blower Protections</HD>
<DH>Fraud: Administration sees the provision in the new
corporate law applying only to investigations. Critics say that view
weakens intended safeguards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>One day after President Bush signed legislation cracking down on
corporate wrongdoing, the administration was accused Wednesday of
weakening a provision of the law providing new protections to
corporate whistle-blowers.</LD>
<LD>   A member of the president's party, Sen. Charles E. Grassley
(R-Iowa), and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy
(D-Vt.) assailed the White House's "narrow interpretation" of the
whistle-blower protections. They said it could discourage company
insiders from reporting fraud.</LD>
<LD>   "I hope the White House will rethink its interpretation of this
law and show it isn't going soft on corporate fraud before the ink is
even dry," Grassley said.</LD>
<TE>   The dispute over such a narrow issue gave the president's critics
a new opportunity to question his commitment to business reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "If this takes clarification, we will clarify it immediately,"
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said. "But it does cause
me to question how serious this administration is with regard to
corporate accountability."</TE>
<TE>   A White House spokesman said the president was deeply committed to
ending accounting abuses and bringing corporate miscreants to
justice.</TE>
<TE>   The administration said that by its interpretation of the
legislative language, only those employees who reported corporate
wrongdoing to congressional committees conducting investigations were
entitled to government protections against retaliation from their
employers.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy and Grassley, who wrote the provision, said they intended it
to apply to employees who reported misdeeds to any member of
Congress, regardless of membership on a committee investigating
corporate fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intent was plain: to protect corporate whistle-blowers,
period," Grassley said.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials stood by their interpretation and said it
was up to Congress to provide any clarification.</TE>
<TE>   The whistle-blower protections are included in a far-ranging
business reform law sparked by accounting scandals at Enron Corp.,
WorldCom Inc. and other companies. The law creates a board to oversee
the accounting industry, requires corporate officers to attest to the
accuracy of their company's financial statements and increases
criminal penalties for white-collar crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The whistle-blower provision is modeled after protections granted
to airline workers who report safety problems. Under the new law,
whistle-blowers who face retaliation from their bosses can file
complaints in federal court if the Labor Department has not acted on
them within 180 days. Previously, employees could not go to court
until the Labor Department completed its review. If successful,
whistle-blowers can be awarded reinstatement, back pay and
compensatory damages.</TE>
<TE>   The provision was partly triggered by Enron Vice President Sherron
S. Watkins, who wrote the infamous letter to former Enron Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay in August, warning that the company was about to
"implode in a wave of accounting scandals."</TE>
<TE>   Although Watkins did not lose her job, proponents of the new
whistle-blower protections cited an internal Enron memo advising
executives that she could be fired under existing law.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer defended the
administration's interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   "There are different people who will look at different parts of
each of these sections and come to different conclusions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued shortly after Bush signed the bill, the
administration noted that the whistle-blower protections were
designed to shield employees from retaliation for "lawful cooperation
with investigations" and that the executive branch would construe the
section as "referring to investigations authorized by the rules of
the Senate or the House of Representatives."</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Claire Buchan said that the administration
based its interpretation on the legislative language on Congress' own
rules.</TE>
<TE>   "If Congress chooses to ... say that individual members can
investigate, that's up to Congress to decide, and we'll defer to
Congress," she said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Alleges Olympic Skating Bribery</HD>
<DH>Sports: A reputed Russian gangster is accused of trying to
fix two contests at the Salt Lake City Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN and HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>An alleged Russian mobster was arrested Wednesday in Italy and
charged with trying to bribe skating officials and fix the outcome of
two Winter Olympics figure skating contests--including the
controversial pairs skating competition--earlier this year in Salt
Lake City.</LD>
<LD>   Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov, described as a major figure in the Russian
mafia, was taken into custody near his resort home in Forte dei Marmi
in northern Italy and faces U.S. conspiracy charges that could lead
to 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines, according to a federal
complaint filed in Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   The dramatic allegations unveiled by U.S. Atty. James Comey
suggest that Tokhtakhounov offered bribes to French skating officials
and conspired to have French and Russian skating judges award each
other's teams gold medals in separate skating competitions. He did
this, the complaint alleged, to curry favor with French Skating
Federation officials in the hope of winning an extension for his
expiring French visa.</LD>
<TE>   The disclosures reignited the international controversy that
flared in February, when a French skating judge said she was
pressured to cast a deciding vote for a gold medal in pairs skating
to the Russian team, even though many experts believed the Canadian
pair of Jamie Sale and David Pelletier had deserved to win. The judge
later recanted her statement, saying it had been made under duress.</TE>
<TE>   After completing an investigation, the International Skating Union
banned both the judge, Marie-Reine Le Gougne, and French Skating
Federation President Didier Gailhaguet from international events for
three years, but made no mention of possible underworld involvement.
Subsequently, Olympic officials jointly awarded gold medals in the
pairs competition to Canada and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   But Wednesday's arrest--the first of many in the case, Comey
promised--showed that the duplicity thought to be associated with
this year's Olympic judging had reached a new level. The
unprecedented investigation of mob involvement in the Olympic Games
was a joint effort by FBI officials, Italian police agencies and the
U.S. attorney's office, which, Comey said, has had a "long-standing
interest" in probing and keeping an eye on the activities of the
Russian mafia. U.S. officials have requested the suspect's prompt
extradition.</TE>
<TE>   Tokhtakhounov's arrest revealed that "the long arm of Russian
organized crime reached across the globe this past winter with a pair
of fixes for the Winter Olympics," Comey told a news conference. "The
conspirators were saying: 'We will make this [fix] happen. We will
line up whatever support is going to be needed.' "</TE>
<TE>   The story of how Tokhtakhounov attempted to rig one of the world's
elite sporting events is an eye-opening tale of gangsters with easy
access to French and Russian skaters, brazenly confident of their
ability to alter judging outcomes. The roots of the case, built
heavily on wiretaps, go back several years, according to the
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Tokhtakhounov, a Russian citizen born in Uzbekistan and believed
to be in his 50s, had approached Gailhaguet two years ago, offering
"large amounts of money" to fund a French professional hockey team,
authorities said. French officials had indicated they could not
afford to organize and promote such an organization.</TE>
<TE>   In return, the alleged mobster--who has fixed beauty contests in
Moscow and has been involved in drug distribution, illegal gun sales
and trafficking in stolen vehicles, according to federal
prosecutors--wanted French authorities to extend his visa. Earlier,
the government had asked Tokhtakhounov to leave the country, causing
him to relocate in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   French Skating Federation officials told FBI agents that they had
rebuffed Tokhtakhounov, believing the issue was dead. But wiretapped
conversations this year put him in the thick of an apparent effort to
orchestrate vote-swapping by French and Russian skating judges.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, Tokhtakhounov helped organize a "quid
pro quo" in which a French judge would help award a gold medal to the
Russian pair skating team of Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze;
in return, Russian judges would ensure that the French ice-dancing
team of Marina Anissina--a Russian who was a member of the French
team--and Gwendal Peizerat would also win a gold medal. Both teams
ultimately won the gold.</TE>
<TE>   The conspiracy came to light in February, as the Games were
unfolding in Utah, when Italian police taped several conversations
between the alleged mobster and Russian and French skaters. On Feb.
12, the day after the Russian pair won the gold medal, an
unidentified member of the Russian Skating Federation told
Tokhtakhounov, "Our Sikharulidze fell, the Canadians were 10 times
better, and in spite of that, the French with their vote gave us
first place."</TE>
<TE>   Then the federation member, in an apparent reference to the French
team's chances in the ice dancing competition six days away, told
Tokhtakhounov: "Everything is going the way you need it."</TE>
<TE>   In a March 7 conversation, an unidentified female ice dancer
discussed the gold medal results with Tokhtakhounov. He said that a
member of the Russian skating federation had told him that
"everything will be OK, [the female ice dancer] should not be
concerned, let her perform even if she falls, everything will be OK."</TE>
<TE>   Comey said the investigation was continuing, but he refused to say
whether Anissina or anyone else were targets of the probe.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicions of vote-swapping and national bias on the part of
judges have long clouded figure skating, and a Ukrainian ice-dance
judge was suspended after the 1998 Nagano Games for telling another
judge in a taped phone conversation how the competition would finish.
But the pairs judging scandal at Salt Lake City threatened to engulf
the Games and fatally undermine the sport's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with allegations of mob involvement in the Winter Games,
prominent skating officials reacted with anger and disbelief.
International Olympic Committee spokeswoman Giselle Davies said:
"This kind of alleged activity has no place in the Olympic movement.
At this early stage, we will wait for the U.S. judicial process to
take its course but we will be following developments very closely."</TE>
<TE>   Skate Canada President Marilyn Chidlow and Chief Executive Pam
Coburn said their organization was shocked by the arrest, terming the
revelations "unbelievable [and] a major concern to Skate Canada."
They added, "These new developments point to the immediate importance
of changing the current judging system to build in protection for
honest judges."</TE>
<TE>   Anita DeFrantz, the senior IOC delegate in the U.S., said, "I am
appalled that this system of judging can be so manipulated as the
allegations suggest. The athletes should be outraged. They put their
best performance out there for the public, and it's horrible to learn
that the decision may have been made before the event began."</TE>
<TE>   LeGougne's attorney, Maxwell Miller of Salt Lake City, said that
Wednesday's developments were news to him and added that his client
was not implicated. "All I can tell you is no evidence of this was
presented in Lausanne about these allegations," he said, referring to
an ISU hearing this year regarding LeGougne's alleged misconduct
during the Olympics. "She's not a target of this, as far as we
know.... It seems to me this raises more questions than answers."</TE>
<TE>   Liz DeSevo, the agent for Anissina and Peizerat, said she had not
spoken to them Wednesday because they were in England, to perform in
a figure skating gala for Queen Elizabeth II.</TE>

<HD>Man Accused of Selling Phony IDs to Hijackers Leaves U.S.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A New Jersey man who allegedly sold fake documents to two of the
Sept. 11 hijackers left the country in recent days as authorities
were preparing to arrest him Wednesday and search his house and
office, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Mohamad El Atriss faces fraud charges for operating a fake
document business that sold identification cards to buyers in New
Jersey, California, Florida and other states, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Among his customers, according to Passaic County, N.J., Sheriff
Jerry Speziale, were Khalid Almihdhar and Abdulaziz Alomari, who are
suspected of being on two commercial jetliners that were hijacked and
flown into the Pentagon and World Trade Center.</LD>
<TE>   El Atriss is suspected of selling Almihdhar a "U.S. identification
card" and Alomari an international driver's license--even though
neither document officially exists, Speziale said.</TE>
<TE>   As Passaic County sheriff's officials prepared to execute search
warrants in Paterson and Elizabeth, N.J., on Wednesday, El Atriss
called an employee from overseas. He is believed to have taken a
plane to Egypt on Tuesday or Wednesday, apparently for a business
trip, Speziale said. He is believed to be a native of Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed," Speziale said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Speziale said authorities had no indication that El Atriss knew of
the two hijackers' intentions. Even so, Speziale said, providing
terrorists with false documents, even unwittingly, only helps them
commit criminal acts.</TE>
<TE>   "Once it gets into the hands of someone involved in a criminal
organization, it's a problem," he said of fake documentation.</TE>
<TE>   Interpol has been notified, and authorities are searching for El
Atriss so that he can be questioned. Speziale said police seized
evidence from El Atriss' home and office, including dozens of fake
IDs that sold for as much as $800 each and other indications of a
large-scale fraud operation.</TE>
<TE>   Three of El Atriss' employees were arrested on suspicion of
manufacturing and distributing fraudulent documents and conspiracy,
Speziale said.</TE>
<TE>   El Atriss could not be reached for comment. But an FBI official
said a preliminary investigation determined that El Atriss not only
lacked any foreknowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks but hadn't broken
any federal laws because the identification cards included
disclaimers that they were not official.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that non-U.S. citizens
captured in Afghanistan and held at the detention center at the U.S.
Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have no right to demand a trial in
a U.S. court.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in
Washington dismissed two lawsuits brought on behalf of two British
citizens, an Australian and 12 Kuwaiti nationals who have protested
their detention by the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   Another federal judge in New York on Wednesday questioned why
President Bush was named in court papers seeking the immediate
release of Jose Padilla, the alleged Al Qaeda operative accused of
plotting with others to detonate a radioactive "dirty bomb" in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla, 31, also is being held in military custody. A lawyer for
Padilla told U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey that Bush should be
a party to the case because he declared Padilla an "enemy combatant"
and because he acted illegally in ordering that he be held in
military custody. Justice Department lawyers said Bush should be left
out of the case.</TE>

<HD>Not Guilty Plea for Handyman</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man is accused of thefts from home of missing Utah
teen. Case is not tied to abduction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A Utah judge on Wednesday entered a not guilty plea for a former
handyman charged with stealing items from the home of a Utah teenager
who was kidnapped eight weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   Police have said career criminal Richard Albert Ricci, 48, tops
their list of potential suspects in the June 5 kidnapping at gunpoint
of Elizabeth Smart, but so far no one has been arrested in the girl's
disappearance. The theft and burglary charges are unrelated to the
abduction.</LD>
<LD>   Ricci, who had done odd jobs in the Smart home, has admitted
taking items from the house last year, but he has denied any
involvement in the girl's June 5 abduction from the family's
million-dollar home. Police have said Ricci is not the sole focus of
their probe. His wife has said he was with her at the time of the
abduction.</LD>
<TE>   On July 11, Ricci was charged with theft and burglary for
allegedly taking jewelry, cash and other items from the Smart home
and another residence in the same neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   If found guilty, he could go to prison for the rest of his life
because he has already been convicted twice of felonies.</TE>
<TE>   Ricci's next court appearance will be on Aug 27.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Smart's kidnapping is one of several high-profile
abductions of children this summer. A man in Missouri was charged
last week with murder and sexual assault in the slaying of 6-year-old
Cassandra "Casey" Williamson. Samantha Runnion, 5, was snatched from
her driveway in Stanton this summer and her bruised and naked body
was found the next day. A 27-year-old man has been charged.</TE>
<TE>   Despite hundreds of volunteers searching for Smart, her
whereabouts remain a mystery.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BATON ROUGE, La.</DL>
<LD>A woman in her 70s has died of West Nile virus, a state health
department spokesman said Wednesday. It is the nation's first
confirmed death from the mosquito-borne disease this year.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, who was not identified, was one of 32 people in
Louisiana known to have West Nile, health department spokesman Bob
Johannessen said. She died Monday in Baton Rouge.</LD>
<LD>   The department is seeking to determine whether West Nile is the
cause of two other Louisiana deaths.</LD>
<TE>   Before the woman's death, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention had confirmed 185 cases, including 18 deaths, since the
first Americans were diagnosed in 1999. The virus was first detected
in New York City and has been found in 34 states and the District of
Columbia.</TE>

<DL>FAYETTEVILLE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>The wife of an Army special operations officer has been charged in
his shooting death in the latest in a string of domestic violence
cases that have shaken Ft. Bragg.</LD>
<LD>   Joan Shannon, 35, was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder and
conspiracy to commit murder in the July 23 fatal shooting of Maj.
David Shannon, 40.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe financial gain is one of the primary motives of the
crime," police Lt. Tom Guilette said Wednesday. He did not elaborate.</LD>
<TE>   Shannon's slaying is the fifth domestic-related slaying linked to
the base since June 11. Four Ft. Bragg wives have been killed,
allegedly by their husbands, and Ft. Bragg officials say they are
looking at the cases to determine if the stress of military life was
a contributing factor.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Shannon told police she awoke to gunshots about 3 a.m. and
saw an intruder, and followed him from the bedroom down a hallway.
She was unable to give police a description.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested Shannon based on evidence at the scene and
"admissions and omissions that were given" during the investigation,
Thompson said.</TE>

<HD>New Study Validates Benefits of Mammograms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regular mammograms reduce breast cancer deaths by up to 44%,
according to a major new study that involved a third of the women in
Sweden.</LD>
<LD>   The efficacy of mammography  has been the subject of great debate
over the last year or so, based in large part on a Danish study
claiming that clinical trials of breast screening had procedural and
other flaws that rendered them meaningless.</LD>
<LD>   Most major health organizations have since reaffirmed their belief
in the value of screening, but doubts raised by critics have left
many women concerned about the need for mammograms and their
potential benefits. The new study may finally lay some of those
doubts to rest.</LD>
<TE>   The results, published today in the journal Cancer, "effectively
refute" the claims that mammography is not beneficial and "confirm
beyond any doubt" that reductions in deaths can be obtained in large
screening programs, said Dr. Stephen A. Feig of Mount Sinai Hospital
in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very impressive study that is going to change a lot of
people's minds about mammography," added Dr. Larry Norton of the
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, president of the
American Society for Clinical Oncology. "It seems very compelling
that the benefits might be even more than we had anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   The new study is by far the largest ever to examine the potential
benefits of mammography. Its design apparently eliminates the flaws
that led critics to reject some earlier studies.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope that it would cause some people who have been very
critical of mammography to look at it very carefully and to find that
many of the limitations they focused on" are not present here, said
Robert A. Smith of the American Cancer Society, an epidemiologist who
participated in the study.</TE>
<TE>   "The debate had grown bigger than the data. Now we can move on to
researching how to do the best job we can at finding breast cancers
when they are very small and treatable."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 190,000 American women are diagnosed with breast
cancer each year, and more than 40,000 will die of it. Current U.S.
guidelines issued by the American Cancer Society, the American
Medical Assn. and other groups recommend that women over age 40 have
an annual mammogram.</TE>
<TE>   Critics note, however, that only 20 out of every 100 positive
mammograms actually indicate the presence of a cancer. The false
positives, they charge, expose women to many serious diagnostic
procedures, such as breast biopsies, without any proof of benefit.
The new study would seem to provide that proof.</TE>
<TE>   An international team of researchers headed by Dr. Lars Holmberg
of Uppsala University studied breast cancer in seven Swedish counties
that include roughly 33% of the country's women. The counties each
began extensive mammography programs between 1978 and 1989, screening
women every 1 1/2 to two years.</TE>
<TE>   Using the centralized health data available in Sweden, the team
examined cancer deaths in each county in the years immediately before
widespread screening began and then in the period afterward. Six of
the counties screened women beginning at age 40, and one at age 50.</TE>
<TE>   Among the women who were actually screened, the death rate from
breast cancer was reduced by 44%, compared with rates in the
pre-screening period.</TE>
<TE>   Some proponents of screening have argued that earlier studies,
which showed no benefit from mammography, did not have a long enough
follow-up period. The new results support that contention. In the
counties in which screening had been offered for 10 years or less,
the overall reduction in deaths was 18%, while in those that had
offered it for more than 10 years, the reduction was far higher.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this clinches the case for mammography," Norton said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just about the best way you can do such a study," said
Dr. Lawrence Bassett, director of the Iris Cantor Center for Breast
Imaging at UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center. "But I am not
surprised by the results because they are in line with what we have
been finding in our own patients."</TE>
<TE>   That seems to be the experience elsewhere as well. In an editorial
in the same issue of Cancer, Feig noted that there has been a 39%
reduction in deaths for the average patient with invasive breast
cancer since 1980. Some of that is clearly due to better treatments,
but much of it is also due to earlier detection, he said.</TE>

<HD>Slight Weight Gain Found to Increase Heart Failure Risk</HD>
<DH>Science: A study says that putting on as little as four
pounds can be dangerous to health. The results are called 'a wake-up
call.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cardiologists have long known that obesity increases the risk of
death from heart failure, but a new study shows that being even
slightly overweight--as little as four pounds over--also increases
the risk substantially.</LD>
<LD>   That increased risk, furthermore, arises from being overweight
itself rather than from fat's effect on hypertension and diabetes. A
15-year study on nearly 6,000 people shows that being overweight
alone is responsible for 11% of cases of heart failure in men and 14%
of cases in women, a team from the Boston University School of
Medicine reports in today's New England Journal of Medicine.</LD>
<LD>   "Most of the time, we think of extreme obesity as a cause of heart
failure," said Dr. Robert H. Eckel of the University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center, a spokesman for the American Heart Assn. "But
these people were not extremely obese.... This is another good reason
to lose weight. And even if you can't lose weight, don't gain any
more because that would put you in a higher risk group."</LD>
<TE>   The new findings are alarming because obesity has reached
"epidemic levels" in the United States and is still increasing, said
Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute, which sponsored the study.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 61% of adults in this country are considered
overweight, according to the study. In particular, 13% of young
children and 14% of adolescents are now overweight.</TE>
<TE>   "The results of this study are a wake-up call to a public health
problem that we may be addressing 10 to 50 years from now when these
obese youngsters become old enough to be at risk of heart failure,"
said Dr. Daniel Levy of Boston University.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 2 million to 3 million Americans suffer from heart
failure, which occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficient
blood to meet the body's needs. Symptoms include shortness of breath,
fatigue and edema (water retention) in the ankles and feet. High
blood pressure and diabetes are major risk factors for heart failure.
In such cases, the walls of the left ventricle--the heart's main
pumping chamber--get thicker and the heart gets flabby and weak,
making it difficult to climb stairs, or even to tie one's shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The death rate from heart failure, moreover, has remained constant
over the last four decades, even while the death rate from heart
disease has dropped by 60%, Lenfant noted.</TE>
<TE>   The new results were obtained from the participants of the
Framingham Heart Study, a landmark epidemiological study that began
in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ramachandran S. Vasan of Boston University and his colleagues
followed 5,881 men and women for 15 years, monitoring their weight
and the development of heart failure. One-third of the women and half
the men were overweight. About 16% of both sexes were considered
obese.</TE>
<TE>   "The debate has been whether it is obesity or other factors
associated with it that is causing the risk," said Dr. Greg Fonarow
of the UCLA School of Medicine. "What this study is trying to get at
is whether obesity in and of itself is a true risk and a true
contributor to the development of heart failure. According to them,
it is."</TE>
<TE>   A limitation of the study was that virtually all of the
participants were Caucasian. Obesity is a major problem among other
ethnic groups, but this study was not able to address those issues.</TE>
<TE>   The team grouped the subjects by their body mass index or BMI,
which is the person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of
their height in meters. A BMI calculator is available at
www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bmicalc.htm. People are considered normal if
their BMI is less than 25, overweight if it is from 25 to 29.9 and
obese if it is 30 and above.</TE>
<TE>   The team concluded that, independent of all other factors, each
1-point increase in BMI caused a 5% increase in risk for men and a 7%
increase for women. For an individual who is 5 feet 10 inches tall, a
1-point increase is equal to 6 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, they concluded, the risk of heart failure was 34% higher
in those who were overweight and doubled in those who were obese.</TE>
<TE>   "Even after we accounted for the effects of all the other risk
factors, there was an independent effect of adiposity [being
overweight] on heart failure," Vasan said.</TE>
<TE>   Heart failure is "a grim prognosis, a bad condition to have," he
said. "This should be an impetus for people who do not have an
optimal BMI to move in that direction."</TE>
<TE>   The team is not sure how obesity increases the risk, Vasan added.
Some laboratory studies have shown that obese rats, for instance,
have deposits of fatty particles in heart muscle cells that lead to
cell death, a phenomenon called lipotoxicity. Or, he added, the extra
weight may simply make the heart work too hard.</TE>
<TE>   Eckel cautioned that other factors are even more important in
raising the risk of heart failure, including age, a previous heart
attack, valve disease and high blood pressure. This combination of
factors can raise the risk much higher in the obese.</TE>
<TE>   "But it is important for people to realize that you can't do
anything about age, heart attack and valve disease, but you can do
something about high blood pressure and you can do something about
weight," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that diet and exercise are beneficial for a variety of
reasons," Fonarow concluded. "The suggestion from this study is that
they may also be able to lower the risk of heart failure."</TE>

<HD>Miller Time Is Also Odom's Time</HD>

<LD>It was supposed to be Dre Day at Staples Center, the time to meet new
Clipper point guard Andre Miller. Then an unexpected, quite welcome
guest joined the party and it reminded you that the Clippers won't
only add Miller for next season, they'll add Lamar Odom.</LD>
<LD>   Alvin Gentry was so happy to see Odom he grabbed his head and
planted a kiss on his cheek.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome back. It was good to see him, even if he still had a soft
brace on his right wrist. Odom basically wasn't a part of the team
last season, when injuries and a drug-policy suspension kept him out
of the lineup for all but 29 games. The Clippers still won 39 games
and made a run at the playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   Next year's squad will add Miller, the 2002 league leader in
assists, and it only cost them their seventh man, Darius Miles.
They'll add Odom, who has career averages of 16.3 points, 7.5
rebounds and 4.9 assists, and it won't cost them a thing--for now.</TE>
<TE>   With Miller, Odom, Elton Brand, Michael Olowokandi, Quentin
Richardson, Eric Piatkowski, Corey Maggette, Keyon Dooling plus draft
picks Chris Wilcox and Melvin Ely and European import Marko Jaric,
this is the best Clipper roster ever. It's the result of three
consecutive great summers for General Manager Elgin Baylor. Team
executives are talking second round of the playoffs, a place this
franchise hasn't seen since it was in Buffalo in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the scary part: It might be the only time you'll see
this group together. Unless the Clippers move to lock up some or all
of them to contract extensions, Miller, Odom, Brand and Olowokandi
could all be free agents next summer. It could take $240 million to
$300 million to keep them all here. And it would require Donald
Sterling to spend it. (Keep an eye on the temperature readings in
hell).</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, Odom's contract was the top priority. Now it's
probably fourth.</TE>
<TE>   When someone asked Baylor how contract talks are progressing, he
mentioned that he feels confident. The feeling is that Miller will
show what he can do this season, then ask for a big contract next
season. So, as Baylor said, the immediate focus is trying to get
Olowokandi and Brand signed this summer.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't mention Odom, and Odom's head sagged. It was as if he
had been forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   It has been that kind of gradual slide for him. The Clippers took
him fourth in the 1999 draft, four spots before Cleveland took
Miller. (Baylor has made a hobby of amassing players from that draft,
like a sports memorabilia collector going after rookie baseball
cards. He also has the No. 1 pick from '99, Brand, and No. 13 pick
Maggette).</TE>
<TE>   Early in his rookie year, Odom looked like the best of them all, a
group that also included Steve Francis, Baron Davis, Wally
Szczerbiak, Richard Hamilton and Shawn Marion.</TE>
<TE>   Francis and Brand passed him that year, and Odom eventually
dropped below many others as the worst pre-draft fears about him came
to light and he couldn't stay away from marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Some people, including yours truly, thought he should be the one
traded, and not the more popular Miles with all of his high-flying
potential.</TE>
<TE>   I've come around, apparently as Sterling did in OKing the Miller
trade. Odom is more versatile and further along in his development
than Miles. And he has this magical charming quality, which makes you
want to believe so badly that he'll get it right.</TE>
<TE>   Odom can be emotionally fragile, but he said he understood the
rationale that it could happen to people much bigger than him.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe Montana was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs," Odom said.
"Joe Montana, man. Wayne Gretzky. Somebody had the nerve to trade
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar from the Bucks to the Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   If they could be moved, why not him?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not being too blunt right now," Odom said.</TE>
<TE>   (Uh, Lamar, please refrain from using the word blunt.)</TE>
<TE>   "I got suspended twice," he said. "I had a hurt wrist, I had a
hurt ankle. I started hearing it. But that's all I was doing, was
hearing it. In this league, you've got to go on what's in front of
you. You can't go with he-said, she-said. I wasn't going to work
myself up or get a negative attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "People around me, even my family members were like, 'They're
trying to trade you? What's wrong with them?' I was kind of laid back
about the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Odom's still here. Instead of leaving, he was welcoming the newest
Clipper.</TE>
<TE>   "Andre, that's my new family member," Odom said. "That's my new
boy. I just wanted to let him know that we're going to be friends as
well as teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "We're cool with him. It's good to let him know that, because, you
know, he did get traded for Darius Miles. I'm sure he knew how we all
felt about each other. Everybody knew that it's a close-knit group.
It was important for me to come down here and let him know that we
accept him, that he's part of the group."</TE>
<TE>   Odom could be the face of this team again if he wants to. They say
Miles sold the most jerseys, but I've seen more of Odom's No. 7--from
coast to coast.</TE>
<TE>   Miller might be from L.A., but he won't own the town. He'll be too
busy hiding from ticket-seeking relatives. And he's too quiet. Odom
probably said more responding to one question than Miller did
answering five during the news conference. He did say he was happy to
be in his hometown and looked forward to playing an up-tempo style.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing you guys are going to find out: Andre is a man of few
words," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's presence means the Clippers are getting down to serious
business. He looks prepared for the part. He shaved off his Afro on
Tuesday and donned a sharp black suit and gold tie Wednesday so he'd
be presentable for the news conference.</TE>
<TE>   Odom wore a Seanjohn shirt. But at least it had a collar, which is
more than you could say about his news conference attire in the past.</TE>
<TE>   If Odom can leave his problems in the past as well, he can be a
part of the Clippers' future ... which is looking better than ever.</TE>

<HD>Angels Can't Change Pace</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Unable to adjust from Wakefield's knuckleball to
hard-throwing relievers, they lose to Red Sox, 2-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the clubhouse, a collective yawn. After weeks of anticipation, the
Angels finally made their big trade Wednesday, a deal greeted with
shrugs and nods in the clubhouse, not cartwheels and ovations.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't notice anything different in here," Darin Erstad said.
"It doesn't feel any different."</LD>
<LD>   In the front office and among the players, the Angels insisted
they were good enough to win the American League West without any
roster additions. But all the moves--outfielder Alex Ochoa coming in
trade, catcher Bengie Molina coming off the disabled list, catcher
Jorge Fabregas going and infielder Jose Nieves expected to
follow--counted for nothing on the scoreboard.</LD>
<TE>   And nothing on the scoreboard was exactly what the Angels produced
for seven innings Wednesday at Edison Field. By the time Troy Glaus
hit a home run in the eighth inning, the Boston Red Sox had two runs,
good enough for a 2-1 victory that moved the Red Sox into a tie with
the Angels in the American League wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels also dropped two games behind the Seattle Mariners in
the AL West. In losing two of three games to the Red Sox, the Angels
lost a series for the first time since July 2-4.</TE>
<TE>   One night after Pedro Martinez dazzled the Angels with his
fastball, Tim Wakefield did the same with his knuckleball, a 1-2
punch that can throw off a hitter's timing for days. And, after five
innings Wednesday, the Red Sox replaced Wakefield with a parade of
hard-throwing relievers--Rolando Arrojo, Alan Embree and Ugueth
Urbina--forcing the Angel hitters to adjust from 70-mph pitches to
95-mph pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie John Lackey pitched heroically for the Angels, giving up
one run in 6 1/3 innings. In the eighth inning, the Red Sox added an
unearned run. The Angels started the week with the fewest errors of
any team in the league, but they made three Tuesday and two more
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, not long before the 1 p.m. trading deadline, the Angels
acquired Ochoa from the Milwaukee Brewers in a five-player deal. The
Angels sent Fabregas, the only other major leaguer in the deal, to
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels lose one of their starting outfielders to injury,
then Ochoa will become a vital replacement, because their outfield
depth evaporated with injuries to Jeff DaVanon and Julio Ramirez.</TE>
<TE>   For now, though, the Angels will use Ochoa in a variety of
roles--right-handed pinch-hitter, pinch-runner, occasional right
fielder. That makes Ochoa a nice-to-have player, not a must-have
player, as his new teammates pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   "The one area we could maybe have used a little help in was the
bench, and we got a solid bench player," Jarrod Washburn said. "If we
wouldn't have made a trade, I would have been happy with that."</TE>
<TE>   Said Tim Salmon: "It isn't big, earth-shattering stuff. I don't
know if it's something we needed. But it strengthens us, no doubt,
and gives us some depth on the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon figures to be the outfielder most affected. When Ochoa
starts, he is expected to do so most often in right field. That means
even more time for Salmon at designated hitter, not his preferred
assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gotten to the point where I've accepted it," he said. "I
recognize it's what's best for the club."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, concerned about altering clubhouse chemistry, made
sure Ochoa had a similar attitude before completing the trade. "We're
kind of an ego-less club," General Manager Bill Stoneman said.
Erstad, the team leader, said he didn't know much about Ochoa other
than that he was a "good guy."</TE>
<TE>   Nieves had a good attitude too, even as he was on the brink of
losing his roster spot. The arrival of Ochoa, expected today, makes
the seldom-used Nieves expendable, but Wednesday he was just hoping
he could stay and play with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a company, and I'm one of the employees," Nieves said.
"I'd like to play more, but it's not like I'm demanding anything. I
know my role."</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Turn It Around</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After a slow start by Nomo, offense comes alive
in 11-5 victory over Reds. Beltre hits two homers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers had another scary first chapter Wednesday night, a
familiar story line featuring shaky starting pitching, wasted
opportunities on offense and a potentially costly mental blunder on
defense.</LD>
<LD>   On this evening, however, there was a happy ending.</LD>
<LD>   The Cincinnati Reds squandered a two-run lead and wasted an early
bases-loaded opportunity in the Dodgers' 11-5 victory before 23,258
at Cinergy Field.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers broke form in rallying after an opponent scored first,
retaking the National League wild-card lead by a game over the San
Francisco Giants and remaining five games behind the Arizona
Diamondbacks in the NL West.</TE>
<TE>   They overcame the early problems of starter Hideo Nomo (11-6), the
offense and an embarrassing mistake by third baseman Adrian Beltre,
enabling a runner to tag up and advance to second in the second after
a batter fouled out to him.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo led many Dodgers in atoning for early mistakes, continuing to
solidify his status as the club's most consistent starter. He kept
the Dodgers in the game and took charge after escaping a bases-loaded
jam in the second, getting Ken Griffey Jr. on an inning-ending
grounder with the Reds leading, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   That momentum shift was exactly what the Dodgers, and especially
the bullpen, needed a night after Kazuhisa Ishii was chased in the
third. Nomo has a reputation as a fighter on the mound, and he got
the Dodgers off the ropes with the Reds seemingly poised for a
knockout punch.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been the Rock of Gibraltar of our pitching staff," said
Manager Jim Tracy, whose club is 16-35 when an opponent scores first.
"This guy has been a model of consistency for our pitching staff the
entire season."</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander managed to work six innings despite throwing only
54 strikes in 96 pitches, including 30 in the first and 75 through
four innings.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up five hits and two runs, but allowed only two
baserunners in his final four innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers stranded leadoff batter Dave Roberts at third in the
first after he singled and stole second, but then the offense
uncharacteristically woke up.</TE>
<TE>   They got consecutive home runs from Paul Lo Duca and Shawn Green,
Nos. 7 and 28, respectively, in taking the lead for good, 4-2, in a
four-run fourth against Cincinnati starter Brian Moehler (1-1).</TE>
<TE>   After the Reds closed to within 4-3, Beltre did his part, hitting
his 12th homer as the Dodgers broke open the game with five runs in
the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre hit No. 13 the next inning for his second career
multi-homer game, and also made a highlight-reel, over-the-shoulder
catch along the left-field line in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca and Beltre, who appears to be emerging from a season-long
slump, each had three hits and three runs batted in to pace the
15-hit attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers had four homers after hitting two in their previous 12
games, taking the second game of the series and improving to 4-4 on
the 13-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just feeling more comfortable now," said Beltre, 12 for 29
with two homers, two triples, a double and 10 runs batted in on the
trip. "Everything is going good."</TE>
<TE>   Well, except for his mental lapse in the second.</TE>
<TE>   With one out and runners on first and third, Aaron Boone fouled
out to Beltre at the camera well in front of the dugout, and Todd
Walker went from first to second as Beltre seemingly forgot he was
there.</TE>
<TE>   "I caught the ball and looked at the runner on third, he was
there, then I looked at the runner at first, and he was there,"
Beltre said. "The guy at third was walking like he was going to home
plate, so I focused on him.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see [Walker] running. By the time the guys [yelled], it
was too late. I didn't want to make that throw to second, because the
guy on third was going to score. With two outs, I didn't want to risk
that."</TE>
<TE>   Adam Dunn walked to load the bases, but then Nomo made his big
stand against Griffey.</TE>

<HD>A Sport That Is on Thin Ice</HD>
<DH>Commentary: Alleged involvement of Russian mafia in Olympic
figure skating puts judging under microscope again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Was the arrest of a reputed Russian crime figure on charges he
attempted to fix the outcome of the Olympic pairs and ice dancing
competition at Salt Lake City merely another dip into the judging
cesspool exposed in February by French figure skating judge
Marie-Reine Le Gougne?</LD>
<LD>   Or has it opened a new and more treacherous pit, one that could
swallow the last of figure skating's tattered credibility?</LD>
<LD>   No matter that International Skating Union President Ottavio
Cinquanta has pushed through a series of judging reforms intended to
minimize the deal-making and vote-swapping Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov
allegedly tried. More than five months after the pairs judging
scandal threatened to devour the Olympics, five months after Russians
Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze pasted smiles on their faces
and shared gold-medal glory with Canadians Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier, the integrity of figure skating judging has again become
front-page news.</LD>
<TE>   And that can't be good</TE>
<TE>   "I think the credibility has always been somewhat in doubt within
the tight-knit skating fraternity," veteran coach John Nicks said.
"But now that has expanded, and many, many more people will have more
questions that we in the business have had for years."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's announcement left many questions unanswered, including
some that could blow the sport apart.</TE>
<TE>   Tokhtakhounov was taped making a series of calls to "unnamed
conspirators" during the Games that "lay out a pattern of conduct
that connects those two events," U.S. Atty. James Comey said of the
pair and ice dance competitions. Who were those conspirators? Judges?
Skating federation officials? Referees? Other reputed Russian mafia
henchmen? All of those possibilities are frightening.</TE>
<TE>   If the corruption lies largely within the sport, if Tokhtakhounov
was a lone wolf out for personal gain--in his case, a visa that would
have permitted him to reside in France--maybe it can be cleaned up.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Cinquanta's hasty but earnest efforts will have an impact.
Maybe the new judging system for International Skating Union events,
in which 14 judges will rate skaters' performances but only nine
scores randomly chosen by a computer will count toward the final
score, will minimize the chances for vote trading. Involve too many
people, and someone inevitably will talk, and the plot will be
revealed.</TE>
<TE>   But if the corruption is coming from outside and Russian crime
figures have their tentacles into figure skating, the implications
are chilling.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps 10 years ago, when the Russian economy was disintegrating
and the country's best hockey players began flocking to North
America, alleged Russian mafia figures were suspected of blackmailing
players by threatening to harm families and friends back home if
players didn't share their big, fat NHL paychecks. It was discussed
only in whispers, because players were too afraid of reprisals to
enlist the help of U.S. or Canadian authorities.</TE>
<TE>   A player would appear at a game or practice with a black eye or a
bruised leg, reluctant to say how it happened. Many terrified players
simply kept quiet and paid off their blackmailers.</TE>
<TE>   No evidence has become public that suggests Russian crime figures
approached skaters. Lynn Plage, a publicist for the Champions on Ice
tour--whose cast includes Russian Olympic medalists Irina Slutskaya,
Alexei Yagudin and Evgeni Plushenko--said Wednesday the skaters told
her they didn't know Tokhtakhounov and were as surprised as everyone
else about his arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Nor, apparently, did the ISU know of Tokhtakhounov's alleged
misdeeds. Erik Christiansen, an attorney for Le Gougne, said an FBI
agent asked her during the Games if she knew Tokhtakhounov. According
to Christiansen, Le Gougne said she had never met him. Like
Christiansen, Le Gougne's other attorney, Max Miller, said the ISU
never brought his name up during its two-day hearing into Le Gougne's
Olympic deeds.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne and Didier Gailhaguet, president of the French ice
sports federation, were each suspended for three years and banned
from the 2006 Winter Olympics for their part in the pairs judging
scandal. If any judge, referee or federation official is found to
have behaved improperly in the ice dance judging and the victory of
France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat is proven to be
tainted, a lifetime ban for all involved is in order. No less.</TE>
<TE>   No one paid much attention when Lithuanian ice dancers Margarita
Drobiazko and Povilas Vanagas filed a protest over the outcome of the
Olympic ice dance finale and their fourth-place finish, wondering why
they skated well but didn't pass two couples who fell and stayed
ahead of them. Maybe they were on to something.</TE>
<TE>   "All of our concerns were justified. Hopefully, something is going
to change," said John Domanskis, the Newport Beach plastic surgeon
who was Lithuania's press attache at Salt Lake City. "Obviously, we
feel vindicated, but I don't know how much good that is.... You
always think the Olympics are so clean, but there are things
underneath that people are not aware of."</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating obviously can't police itself. And while there are
issues of greater concern to national security than finding alleged
mobsters who fix sports events, bravo to the feds for attempting to
clean up at least a little corner of the ice.</TE>

<LD>Almost scoreless in Anaheim. Is that a zero or a halo over the Big A
at Edison Field?</LD>
<LD>   Mouths will be flapping today about how the Angels didn't do the
big deal at the trading deadline Wednesday and how they scored one
run in two nights against the Red Sox.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels didn't get a Cliff Floyd. Boston did, along with a 2-1
win over the Angels, which means the Red Sox are tied with Anaheim
for the AL playoff wild card.</LD>
<TE>   The New York Yankees, who come to Edison tonight for four huge
games, get whatever they want. Need a starting pitcher? Get Jeff
Weaver, an ace in Detroit even if he's been shaky in pinstripes. The
Angels get what is cheap and unspectacular and maybe helpful in an
understated way.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Bill Stoneman offered backup catcher Jorge
Fabregas, a well-liked clubhouse mentor to the Molina brothers, for
Alex Ochoa, once a phenom-to-be outfielder for the Mets and now a
has-been for Milwaukee, plus minor league catcher Sal Fasano, who is
already on his way to Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa brings some speed to the defense and a right-handed bat for
the bench. So if your Angel fan friends show up today wearing a "The
Red Sox got Cliff Floyd, the A's got Ricardo Rincon and all I got was
this T-shirt and Ochoa," tell them to chill.</TE>
<TE>   It's OK.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes a little something is better than a lot of something.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have a glaring weakness," closer Troy Percival said.
"How about asking 'What did we do in the off-season?' You know?
That's when we addressed our weaknesses. We got our pitchers (Kevin
Appier and Aaron Sele). We got our DH (Brad Fullmer). That's when we
did our work. In the off-season."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are good. Fun good, young good, professional good. Good
because there is no ego guy in the infield, the outfield, in the
bullpen or the starting rotation. Good because they come from behind
to win, 31 times, which indicates a certain physical toughness and
mental fortitude found on championship teams.</TE>
<TE>   What if the Angels had given up a couple of minor league pitching
prospects for Floyd, as the Red Sox did? Or had given up those
prospects and maybe a starting pitcher for Cleveland's power-hitting
first baseman, Jim Thome? And then Scott Spiezio could have played
some second base and Adam Kennedy might have been a great guy off the
bench and the lineup would have been so much deeper?</TE>
<TE>   "But Cliff Floyd has a place to play with the Red Sox," Angel
outfielder Tim Salmon said. "The Red Sox had a hole and it really
comes down to what are you having to give up? Do you go out and get a
Bartolo Colon but give up a Jarrod Washburn? Yes, you can get a Thome
but what will you have to give up?"</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have come to this spot where it matters what they did
at the trade deadline because they are probably one of four teams
(with Seattle, Oakland and Boston) in a battle for two playoff spots.</TE>
<TE>   They got to this spot because a pitching staff was developed
slowly, with careful tending. It took Washburn three years to learn
about using the strike zone but now he understands it. Ramon Ortiz
can be brilliant and exasperating, but his talent is unquestionable
if only his mind will catch up. Appier and Sele are pros. Percival is
having an All-Star season. Again.</TE>
<TE>   They got to this spot without anybody having a career year. No one
is playing above his head and a couple of guys could play better.</TE>
<TE>   What if third baseman Troy Glaus takes off? He's a streak hitter,
a power guy who is overdue for a hot month, the kind of homer-crazy
month where he carries a team. And it would help if he kept his eye
on the ball. His eighth-inning error gave Boston an insurance run and
seemed to take the heart out of the Angels. Glaus was booed. He
deserved it. Then he hit a home run in the bottom of the eighth.
Bases empty. Cheers were scattered.</TE>
<TE>   It's probably silly to play what if, but what if the Angels had
traded pitcher John Lackey last year at the deadline because they
thought they could sniff out a wild-card spot? Would it have been
worth it to lose a young pitcher with the maturity of a veteran and
the naivete of a rookie who doesn't understand what the big deal is?
Lackey was impressive again Wednesday, allowing one run in 6 1/3
innings. He might have made it out of the seventh if Spiezio had made
a good throw to shortstop David Eckstein and gotten lead runner Doug
Mirabelli. Or even if he had made the safe and easy play and gotten
batter Rey Sanchez at first. Since he did neither, Lackey left.</TE>
<TE>   There is also the strike possibility. Stoneman said a "pessimistic
man" might consider that there may be no playoffs this year and that
it would be foolhardy to dump young talent for a run to something
that won't exist in a month. Stoneman also said he was "optimistic"
about the season playing all the way out.</TE>
<TE>   But Stoneman's inner pessimist might have urged caution.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels proved over the last 10 days that they can hold their
own with Oakland and Seattle, that they can beat their division
rivals at home and on the road. That's as important as a two-game
losing streak to the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   And as disappointing as the loss? Only 28,227 came to watch two
teams play a meaningful game on the last day of July. An extra bat or
arm helps. So does a packed stadium full of noisy rooters. Complain
about that, then, Angel fans.</TE>

<DH>Excitement over Lisa Leslie's slam dunk energizes WNBA but
also symbolizes gap between men's and women's game</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Cooper heard the knock on the WNBA, just like you.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of fans I talk to, some would say, 'Well, we don't want to
come because there's nobody dunking,' " Cooper said.</LD>
<LD>   "She shut that up."</LD>
<TE>   Whether Lisa Leslie's one-handed slam Tuesday night at Staples
Center--the first dunk in a women's professional game, though not the
first by a woman in competition--was a watershed moment or a
historical footnote remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain. It earned style points.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like, surreal, because they say women can't get over the
rim like that, but she put that one in," said Cooper, the Sparks'
coach and former Laker player. "I mean, it didn't go in by a hair or
a fingernail, it didn't go in clanking off the rim. She dunked the
basketball like a true pro is supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   It has been a long time coming.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised by her dunk because of her athleticism and her
desire to excel," TNT commentator and former NBA coach Hubie Brown
said. "I am surprised it took so long."</TE>
<TE>   The first dunk by a woman in competition was 18 years ago, when
Georgeann Wells of West Virginia broke the barrier in 1984. Only two
other college players have followed, Charlotte Smith of North
Carolina and Michelle Snow of Tennessee--both now in the WNBA, where
no one had managed a dunk in the league's six seasons until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie, now 6-foot-5, first dunked as a 6-4 high school
freshman--starting with a tennis ball, then a volleyball, then a
basketball--in a lark that began during a rainy-day track practice
inside the gym at Inglewood Morningside High.</TE>
<TE>   After she arrived at USC, there was such anticipation Leslie would
dunk in a game the school produced a poster of her dunking, but the
moment never came despite an occasional attempt.</TE>
<TE>   She tried in the inaugural WNBA game in 1997, and hung the ball up
on the rim, leaving her gun-shy.</TE>
<TE>   There was even a growing impatience evident at the WNBA All-Star
game last month when Leslie dunked in warm-ups, but not in the game.</TE>
<TE>   In her mind--and on the piece of paper where she and her trainer
wrote down her personal goals--Leslie had made her plan concrete:
Dunk in a WNBA game this season.</TE>
<TE>   What had been associated in her mind with track--after all, she
first learned to dunk practicing her approach to the high jump in the
gym--Leslie made into part of her basketball repertoire.</TE>
<TE>   "When I practiced with Magic [Johnson], I had to try to dunk two
or three times a day, to make it part of my game--while I'm playing
basketball, to actually think about it," Leslie said.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think it's not really a part of our game. Boys have that
desire to want to dunk. They did have the desire way more than girls
do because it just never seemed like something we could truly fathom.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I think of Sheryl Swoopes' son. He has a little
basketball court, and all he does, he says, 'Lisa, let me dunk, let
me show you.' He's doing windmills. It's already engraved in their
head that to dunk is just the highlight of basketball. Whereas for
girls, it's our shooting technique or to be able to make baskets and
free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a sexist approach to the sport sometimes, but men
aren't encouraging little girls to work on their 'hops'. They're
encouraging them to work on their jump shots and the fundamentals of
the game, and I think that's the biggest difference."</TE>
<TE>   People used to talk about the limitation of the size of a woman's
hands, but the WNBA ball is only 28 1/2 inches in circumference, an
inch smaller than the NBA ball.</TE>
<TE>   The larger issue seems to be that the dunk has not been a focal
point of game action, more a trick to try in practice like a
half-court shot.</TE>
<TE>   Even for the few women who can dunk, the situation has to be
right, which explains why it took so long for one to happen in a
game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like warm-ups, where you can kind of plan it and no
one's underneath the basket, in your way," Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   "In a game, you're tired, and you have to be on a breakaway. The
women don't have the luxury of the physical strength that men have,
where with a quick pick and roll a guy can catch it underneath the
basket and go up and spring up and dunk."</TE>
<TE>   With one out of the way, Leslie wants more.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm all fired up about it," she said. "I'll definitely look
to try more. To me, I think the biggest fear was just missing. Now
that I made it, even if I go for it and miss, at least it's validated
that I can dunk now."</TE>
<TE>   Others will try to follow.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Margo Dydek of the Utah Starzz, at 7-2. (She's the closest
to the rim," Leslie said.) Or Sylvia Crawley of the Portland Fire,
who won a dunk contest in the defunct ABL. Or the players who did it
in college--Snow, of the Houston Comets, or Smith, who plays for the
Charlotte Sting.</TE>
<TE>   Whether women's dunks will ever become a routine sports highlight,
who can say?</TE>
<TE>   Steve Tello, a senior vice president for Fox Sports Net, pointed
out that unusualness is what makes news.</TE>
<TE>   "On any given night during the NBA season, there are many dunks.
Most of them do not make the air," Tello said. "The incredible
athletic feat which Lisa Leslie accomplished [Tuesday] tells us that
the women's game is progressing."</TE>
<TE>   Progress is sometimes dubious, said consultant David Carter of The
Sports Business Group, based in Redondo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I mean, let's be honest, this isn't breaking the
four-minute mile, but it may have some symbolism," Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   "I really believe it's a mixed blessing for the sport. It shows
tremendous athletic prowess and the great strides that have been made
athletically, but it also shows the gap between the men's and women's
game.</TE>
<TE>   "Get back to me when they stop calling traveling. That would be
equality."</TE>

<TE>   Throwing It Down</TE>
<TE>   Though Lisa Leslie's dunk Tuesday at Staples Center was the first
in WNBA history, there have been precedents at both the college and
professional level:</TE>
<TE>   Georgeann Wells, a 6-foot-7 sophomore at West Virginia, became the
first women's college player to dunk, on Dec. 21, 1984, in a game
against Charleston, then dunked again three games later.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte Smith of North Carolina, a 6-foot forward now with the
Charlotte Sting, dunked against North Carolina A&amp;T in 1994, only
three days after the 10th anniversary of Wells' first dunk.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Crawley, a 6-5 center with the Colorado Xplosion's and now
with Portland of the WNBA, won the slam dunk competition at the
American Basketball League all-star game in 1998 while blindfolded.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee's Michelle Snow, a 6-5 center now with the Houston
Comets, dunked twice as a junior, then became the first player to
dunk three times as a senior on Jan. 17, 2002, against South
Carolina.</TE>
