<HD>Mobile Video on a Roll</HD>
<DH>Yesterday's crudely installed back-seat TVs and VHS players
are being replaced by sleek, integrated systems. The trend is hitting
all family-vehicle segments.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The drive-in theater may be nearing extinction, but the driving
theater is rapidly evolving into a standard feature of today's
automobiles.</LD>
<LD>   Watching television on the road used to be a guilty pleasure in
big recreational vehicles or converted vans. Installation was often
crude, with clumsy 9- or 13-inch televisions, bulky VHS players and
their obligatory wood frames with peeling fake-walnut veneer.</LD>
<LD>   We put up with it because the TV succeeded where counting license
plates didn't--in keeping children happy on long trips.</LD>
<TE>   When the advent of smaller video screens allowed cleaner
installation, owners of upscale minivans and sport utility vehicles
started asking mobile-electronics stores to install video baby
sitters in their back seats.</TE>
<TE>   "Mobile video is our single biggest growth area," said John
Haines, purchasing manager of the 35-store Al &amp; Ed's Autosound chain.
"In some stores, it's the No. 1 product category."</TE>
<TE>   The Consumer Electronics Assn. predicts that more than 400,000
mobile video units will be installed this year.</TE>
<TE>   Automobile manufacturers began offering integrated rear-seat
entertainment systems in 1999 with the Oldsmobile Silhouette.</TE>
<TE>   Today, all but three minivan manufacturers include
factory-installed mobile video as an option, and by the 2003 model
year, those three--Kia, Dodge and Chrysler--will have factory
programs in place.</TE>
<TE>   Upscale SUVs such as the Infiniti QX4 and GMC Envoy already are in
the video zone. In the pickup market, Ford became the first to offer
a rear-seat entertainment system--in its F-150 SuperCrew--at the end
of last year.</TE>
<TE>   The lone holdout was the family sedan segment, but this year
Saturn built 1,000 special-edition L300 sedans (and wagons as well)
with a $3,550 DVD player option. "They sold out immediately," said
Saturn spokesman Chuck Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   DVD has eclipsed VHS as the standard player format. Its compact
size allows convenient mounting, and the discs are easier to manage
than tapes.</TE>
<TE>   Mobile video is a big-ticket item at sound shops because customers
often upgrade the audio system, add video games or include a
navigation unit. Even 5.1-channel surround sound--an exotic feature
usually found in the home theater--has been adapted to the
automobile.</TE>
<TE>   "All you need is a 12-volt popcorn maker," quips Howard Becker of
Oxnard-based Becker Automotive Designs Inc., one of the nation's
leading luxury vehicle conversion companies. With a customer base
that reads like Vanity Fair's post-Oscars party list, Becker offers
anything-goes, cutting-edge mobile audio and video systems that can
easily top $25,000. His systems usually are designed with enough
monitors, multiple players and intricate switching controls to enable
each passenger to play video games or watch different movies at the
same time.</TE>
<TE>   The social implications of this modern wizardry cannot be ignored.
Extending family cocooning to the automobile may be a noble gesture,
but it could bring on separation anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like a chauffeur," says Becker, who owned a Chevrolet
Suburban fitted with six screens, five different video and game
sources, 15 speakers and six headphones when his children were
younger. "Even my wife got in the back seat to watch movies until I
mounted a screen on her sun visor."</TE>
<TE>   More electrical gadgets and quality entertainment systems are in
the future.</TE>
<TE>   Satellite radio and MP3 capability already are factory options,
and wireless integration of cell phones, PDAs and other networking
electronics is near. Upgraded navigation systems will include
real-time traffic reports as well as telematics to notify parents if
their teenagers drive to restricted locations.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers also are teaming with respected audio companies such
as Bose, Harmon Kardon, Pioneer, McIntosh and Mark Levinson to lure
discriminating audiophiles. And Lincoln is the first auto maker to
have its audio system certified by Lucasfilm THX.</TE>
<TE>   All this digital and auditory pleasure has a downside: driver
distraction. Most states forbid drivers to watch entertainment
programs on dash-mounted screens, but customers often pressure
installers to bypass lockout measures.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers and audio companies are using methods both subtle
and active to keep drivers' eyes on the road. Menu-driven programs
will become simpler to operate and control buttons more convenient.</TE>
<TE>   "Each knob could have a specific texture so drivers can
distinguish them quickly," suggests Cindy Moreen, marketing manager
for Mopar Accessories.</TE>
<TE>   Says Michael Townsen, vice president of marketing for mobile
entertainment at Pioneer Electronics: "Voice activation will soon be
used to control audio and video functions."</TE>
<TE>   He notes that an upcoming Pioneer product will handle 600 voice
commands for navigation, video and audio systems.</TE>
<TE>   Then drivers who are feeling ignored can at least talk to their
dashboards while everyone else in the vehicle is watching a flick or
playing a favorite video game.</TE>

<HD>For Dealerships, It's a Matter of Show Business</HD>
<DH>Auto makers find that showrooms with just the right
ambience can be as important to customers as appealing vehicles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vehicles aren't the only things that must look appealing to entice
car buyers. Auto makers and dealers spend millions trying to get just
the right ambience in their showrooms too.</LD>
<LD>   Typically, dealerships strive for a look that reflects the cars
and trucks they sell. Mitsubishi, for example, has developed a set of
interior and exterior design elements that it is asking dealers to
incorporate in their showrooms.</LD>
<LD>   The company has one of the youngest buyer profiles in the business
and wants its dealerships to reflect that.</LD>
<TE>   "Our showrooms are critical to our brand image," says Pierre
Gagnon, president of Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America.</TE>
<TE>   The Mitsubishi look, says company spokeswoman Janice Little, "is
young, sophisticated, fresh." The showroom designs call for extensive
use of light birch furnishings and paneling, big glass exterior walls
and interactive video kiosks that computer-savvy customers can use to
design their cars from available options and accessories.</TE>
<TE>   "Light spikes" 25 feet high illuminate the buildings and outdoor
parking areas, and each redesigned or new dealership will have a
three-dimensional, 6-foot-high Mitsubishi "triple-diamond" emblem in
bright red positioned near the entrance to make sure customers know
where they are.</TE>
<TE>   At Land Rover, new dealerships reflect an outdoor theme, with
rugged landscaping and lots of stone and wood. Several have test
tracks.</TE>
<TE>   New Saab dealerships are done in Swedish modern, with lots of
teak, to reflect the General Motors-owned brand's Scandinavian
heritage.</TE>
<TE>   The latest look from GM's Hummer unit is Army chic--in honor of
the Hummer's military roots.</TE>
<TE>   Although the first Hummer showrooms are being allowed to open in
shared quarters with the dealers' existing GM brands, the auto maker
is requiring Hummer dealers to build dedicated showrooms during the
next few years.</TE>
<TE>   The design, a curving metal roof arching over a two-story glass
entry framed by a giant "H" made of steel girders, was inspired by
the corrugated tin Quonset huts that populate military bases, says
Michael DiGiovanni, Hummer division general manager. In addition to
lighted signage, the brand name "Hummer" is stenciled on each roof in
giant capital letters.</TE>
<TE>   But the military look is softened with soaring glass walls and a
contemporary, open interior laid out so customers can walk around,
and under, the various vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The new Hummer facilities will put all the service, vehicle
preparation and delivery areas under one roof, leaving the building's
exterior for customer parking and a little something extra for those
who don't intend to limit their Hummer driving to the highways.</TE>
<TE>   John Bergstrom, owner of Bergstrom Hummer in a Milwaukee suburb,
describes the store he is building as "an adult amusement park" and
notes that "it sits on a full 5 acres and has a test track around the
perimeter."</TE>
<TE>   Such test tracks, which will include water courses, fallen logs,
rocky inclines and deeply potholed mock riverbeds for prospective
Hummer buyers to ford in the vehicles, will be a feature of each of
the new dealerships, DiGiovanni says.</TE>
<TE>   Bergstrom's will be the first to open, an event scheduled for July
10.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Californians will get to try the Hummer experience--and
eyeball the Hummer look--late this year or early next with the
opening of the next two showrooms: Hummer of Valencia and Mark
Christopher Hummer in Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever you think of Army chic, we'll wager there won't be a
Hummer of Beverly Hills any time soon.</TE>

<HD>Score Another for Hyundai With U.S. Customers</HD>
<DH>Price, value and warranty push South Korean auto maker
ahead of Japanese brands in new-car buyer survey. Honda slips.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. continues to come on strong with its
lineup for the North American market, racking up huge sales increases
for its Hyundai and Kia lines the last two years and winning
accolades from auto reviewers for such vehicles as the Hyundai Santa
Fe sport utility vehicle and the Kia Sedona minivan.</LD>
<LD>   Now the customers are speaking.</LD>
<LD>   Hyundai has outscored traditional heavyweights, including Toyota,
Honda and Nissan, in the annual customer satisfaction ratings
announced Tuesday by AutoPacific Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Two Hyundai models and a Kia took top honors in their
classifications in AutoPacific's vehicle satisfaction scores.
Hyundai's Santa Fe tied with the Toyota Highlander for top points in
the mid-size SUV category. The Hyundai Sonata took first place among
mid-size sedans, and the Kia Sedona was rated tops among minivans.</TE>
<TE>   The top-of-class awards are less significant, though, than
Hyundai's overall finish as 15th among 36 nameplates rated by
AutoPacific in its survey of 34,000 new-car buyers. In addition to
besting the top three Japanese brands, Hyundai finished higher than
Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Chrysler, Ford and Saturn, among
others.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota Motor Corp., however, captured more first-place awards than
any other auto maker, with six for various Lexus products and two for
Toyota models. In all, 20 brands finished at or above the industry
average of 656 points, and 16--including Honda--fell below.</TE>
<TE>   AutoPacific's ratings are one of three leading buyer satisfaction
scorecards released each year. The widely followed initial quality
survey by J.D. Power &amp; Associates is scheduled to be released next
month, and San Diego-based Strategic Vision also will issue its buyer
survey in May.</TE>
<TE>   All three attempt to rate vehicles based on new owners' praise and
complaints, although each uses a unique formula to arrive at its
ratings.</TE>
<TE>   AutoPacific's scores are heavily weighted toward new owners'
enthusiasm for a vehicle and the buying experience, so newer cars and
trucks tend to do better than older models, said George Peterson,
president of the Tustin-based auto industry marketing and consulting
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Honda, for example, fell below the industry average in overall
satisfaction scores this year largely because its Accord, though the
best-selling mid-size sedan in the U.S. last year, has not been
updated in several years.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't mean people don't like it or that there were a lot of
problems" with the Accord or other Hondas, Peterson said. New owners
simply didn't score important attributes such as exterior styling as
highly as did owners of all-new models such as the Sonata or Nissan's
Altima. Honda fell from 11th place overall last year to 23rd place in
the 2002 ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "We also suffer a little because demand is so high that consumers
have to pay full price and have to wait for the car in many cases,"
said Art Garner, a spokesman for American Honda Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   Key attributes rated in the vehicle satisfaction scores include
styling, overall quality and performance, ride and handling. Other
factors include satisfaction with the dealership, vehicle warranty
and financing package.</TE>
<TE>   "Hyundai's products are quite competitive now," Peterson said,
"but what put them over the top were price, value and warranty
issues." Hyundai and Kia offer 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain
warranties.</TE>
<TE>   Cadillac was the top brand in AutoPacific's ratings for the second
straight year, followed by Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar and Lincoln.
BMW, Acura, Volvo, Audi and Infiniti filled out the top 10 in that
order.</TE>

<HD>State Data Now on Web for Used-Car Shoppers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Venturing into the used-car market has always been a big gamble,
exposing consumers to lies about a vehicle's ownership history,
odometer reading and even major accidents that left permanent damage.</LD>
<LD>   But California has begun to make public its vast databases that
should enable consumers to find facts about the cars they would buy.</LD>
<LD>   There are two great repositories of vehicle data in California:
the Bureau of Automotive Repair and the Department of Motor Vehicles.
The bureau has made huge strides toward opening its records to the
public in the last year, and the DMV says it is planning to do the
same thing.</LD>
<TE>   In recent months, the bureau has announced that it is posting the
smog-test histories of all vehicle registered in the state on its Web
site (www.smogcheck.ca.gov), indexed by either the vehicle
identification number or license plate.</TE>
<TE>   And under legislation introduced this year by state Sen. Jackie
Speier (D-Hillsborough), the DMV would have to make available some of
the history of vehicles registered in the state, including whether it
has been declared a total loss by an insurer, purchased by an
automotive dismantler or classified as unrepairable.</TE>
<TE>   The bureau's Web site is already running. It gives an abbreviated
history for a vehicle by showing each time it has been smog tested,
as well as the location and date of each test and the pass/fail
record.</TE>
<TE>   The data can be used to determine whether a used car was
originally sold in California, the counties in which it was driven
and the approximate dates it was bought and sold, as each sale is
accompanied by a smog test.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is not as complete as the Internet vehicle histories
sold by private companies, the bureau's data can provide some
important milestones in a vehicle's history, and it is available for
free.</TE>
<TE>   "We designed it with the intent of educating consumers," said
acting bureau chief Patrick Dorais. "It provides important
information for somebody buying a used car."</TE>
<TE>   The site is getting about 20,000 hits a month, Dorais said,
meaning consumers are grasping the importance of the information in
shopping for used cars.</TE>
<TE>   The new Internet database is combined with several others the
bureau has posted on the Web for consumers. Among them is a listing
of licensed repair garages, complete with complaints filed against
the businesses and any disciplinary actions taken by the bureau.</TE>
<TE>   An even bigger treasure trove of information exists at the DMV,
but so far the agency has not posted any vehicle-specific data on its
Web site. But DMV chief Steven Gourley met last week with Speier and
agreed to support the effort, according to officials in Speier's
office.</TE>
<TE>   Under Speier's legislation, SB 1743, the state would tighten its
sloppy control of salvage vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   A state investigation of the auto body industry disclosed in
hearings in January that 43% of auto body repairs involve fraudulent
billings, much of it involving totaled vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The DMV would be required to disclose to the public, at no cost,
the identities of vehicles that have been totaled or classified as
unrepairable by insurers or been sold to dismantlers.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Miyao, deputy DMV director, said the agency is looking at how
to satisfy the requirements of Speier's bill, preferably by posting
the information on the department's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Miyao said he hopes the DMV can join a federation of states,
operated by the Assn. of American Motor Vehicle Administrators, that
exchanges data on vehicle histories, including odometer readings on
cars when they are sold.</TE>
<TE>   If the DMV would loosen the strings on its data, it could, for
example, post on the Internet a vehicle's entire ownership history.
It could show when an out-of-state vehicle was first registered for
use in California. Given the problems with interstate auctions of
lemons and wrecks, such data could provide a warning to potential
buyers.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, wouldn't it be useful if the DMV would post on
the Internet the driving history of individuals?</TE>
<TE>   State and federal law prohibits the DMV from disclosing the
addresses of individuals, but it would not necessarily prohibit

<HD>Asian Breakfast Cereals: Eating Outside of the Box</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Breakfast cereal in the United States means something crunchy scooped
out of a box from the supermarket, a bowl of granola or perhaps
oatmeal, cooked in haste in the microwave.</LD>
<LD>   In Asia it's a different story. Breakfast cereal could be rice
soup in Thailand, wheat porridge studded with nuts, curry leaves and
chiles in India, a semolina cake soft with bananas in Myanmar, a ball
of rice stuffed with coconut and brown sugar in Sri Lanka or a
powdery mixture of roasted barley and dried fruits in Nepal.</LD>
<LD>   Interesting traditions surround these foods. Thai khao tom--rice
soup embellished with meat, hot chiles and other toppings--is eaten
at either end of the day, says Vibul Wonprasat of Venice, artistic
director of the annual Thai Cultural Day in Los Angeles. "Thais
believe liquid is easier to digest in the morning, before working,"
he explains. "Lunch is a heavier meal. When working late at night,
Thais like to have liquid food before going to bed."</LD>
<TE>   Wonprasat, an artist, takes special pains in preparing khao tom.
He cooks the rice in bottled water to simulate the rainwater that
Thais collect in huge urns for kitchen use. Broken jasmine rice,
available in some Asian markets, softens and breaks down into a
creamy puree ideal for porridge. The label may say "broken rice" or
specify jasmine broken rice and may also include the Vietnamese name
for the broken grains, cao thom.</TE>
<TE>   Garlic-flavored pork meatballs garnish Wonprasat's soup, along
with cilantro and a dash of black pepper. Side dishes of fish sauce
and sliced chiles soaked in vinegar provide additional seasoning.</TE>
<TE>   In south India, one might breakfast on upma, a wheat porridge that
includes vegetables, chiles, black mustard seeds and curry leaves.
Vasanti Jayaswal of West Los Angeles makes upma in the style of
Bangalore, although she is from Trivandrum in the state of Kerala. To
give a nutty flavor, she includes a small amount of lightly browned
Indian dal, or roasted cashews can also be added.</TE>
<TE>   Leilei Thein of San Diego calls her Burmese banana cake banana
shwe gye. In Burmese, "shwe gye" means semolina, which she uses
instead of regular flour. Made with coconut milk as well as
evaporated milk, the sweet cake is as likely to show up at breakfast
as at other times of day. "In Myanmar, no distinction is made between
what is served for breakfast or for afternoon tea," explains Thein,
who grew up in Mawlamyine (formerly Moulmein) in southern Myanmar.
"We eat a lot of snack food at breakfast time too."</TE>
<TE>   Bhante Walpola Piyananda, abbot of the Dharma Vijaya Buddhist
Vihara in Los Angeles, tells a legend about the origin of Sri Lankan
kiribath (milk rice), which is rice cooked with coconut milk and
salt. "This is sacred food to Sri Lankans, as well as delicious," he
says. "It is the last food that the Buddha ate before being
enlightened. A servant girl saw him meditating and perceived him as
god. She ran to her mistress, who then prepared kiribath for the holy
person and brought it to the Buddha. He was enlightened one day
later."</TE>
<TE>   For auspicious days, kiribath rice would be served for breakfast,
spread flat on a platter and accompanied by jaggery (brown sugar),
treacle and bananas.</TE>
<TE>   In a variation, the rice is molded in small cups and then filled
with coconut in jaggery syrup. This recipe, called coppa kiribath,
appears in the "Ceylon Daily News Cookery Book," which has been
continuously reprinted since it was first published in Colombo in
1929.</TE>
<TE>   Barley sattu could be called Nepali granola, the way Narayan
Somname prepares it. Somname, a Nepali chef working in Japan, sent
the recipe to a friend, Bijay Niraula, who is president of the
Himalayan Arts and Cultural Council of the Pacific Asia Museum in
Pasadena. Somname mixes powdered hulled barley grains with raisins,
cashews, coconut, sugar candy, cinnamon and cardamom.</TE>
<TE>   "Sattu can be eaten with both cold or hot milk," Niraula says. "It
can also be mixed with plain yogurt." Powdery rather than crunchy,
sattu is handy food for travelers and campers. The labor involved in
pounding the grains to a powder, as is done in Nepal, would
discourage most cereal lovers from trying this dish. However, the
recipe works well with barley flour from a natural foods store.</TE>
<TE>   Adding raisins, nuts, coconut and spices also breaks with Nepali
tradition. There, sattu is frugal food, eaten plain or mixed with
water. But Somname's fancy version is a lot more palatable and just
might find a place on an American breakfast table.</TE>

<TE>   Vibul Wonprasat's Khao Tom</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 15 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Although this rice soup is popular for breakfast, it makes a good
one-dish meal any time.</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup rice vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 or 2 serrano chiles, sliced</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound lean pork</TE>
<TE>   4 cloves garlic, chopped</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons fish sauce, plus more for serving</TE>
<TE>   1 cup broken jasmine rice</TE>
<TE>   Water</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon oil</TE>
<TE>   Cilantro leaves, minced</TE>
<TE>   Pepper</TE>
<TE>   Combine the rice vinegar with the sliced chiles and let stand so
the chiles become pickled.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, place the pork on a cutting board. Top with the garlic
and the fish sauce. With a Chinese cleaver or other sharp, heavy
knife, chop the meat and garlic together until finely minced, almost
pasty.</TE>
<TE>   Place the rice in a large saucepan, add 3 cups of water and cook
over low heat until creamy, about 30 to 35 minutes. The rice will
soften and break down, like a puree. Keep adding water as needed so
that it stays fluid like a soup. Stir in 1 teaspoon of salt. Keep
warm over low heat.</TE>
<TE>   Shape the pork mixture into small patties 2 to 3 inches wide. Heat
the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry the patties in batches
until browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes a side.</TE>
<TE>   Ladle the rice soup into 4 large soup bowls. Place 3 or 4 pork
patties in each bowl. Garnish with cilantro and pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Serve with fish sauce and vinegar-chile mixture, letting diners
season their own soup.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nepali Barley Cereal (Barley Sattu)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   Dry and powdery, sattu is handy for campers. Add liquid when
eating to turn it into a moist cereal. Barley flour is available in
health food stores. You can use packaged flaked coconut, if desired.</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound barley flour</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup raisins</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup raw cashews, coarsely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup shredded fresh coconut</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</TE>
<TE>   Dry-roast the barley flour in a heavy skillet over medium heat,
stirring, until lightly toasted but not browned, 10 minutes. Cut the
raisins, cashews and coconut into tiny pieces the size of a rice
grain. Combine the raisins, cashews, coconut, sugar, cinnamon and
cardamom with the toasted barley flour. Serve this in bowls as a
cereal. To eat, add cold or hot milk, or mix it with plain yogurt.</TE>

<TE>   Banana Shwe Gye Cake</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 20 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 1/2
hours, plus 8 hours standing</TE>
<TE>   Leilei Thein of San Diego explains that the cake will be moist,
not fluffy. It should stand overnight, until cold, to firm up before
cutting. "Shwe gye" is Burmese for semolina. Semolina can be found at
specialty markets and health food shops.</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   2 cups semolina</TE>
<TE>   2 (131/2-ounce) cans coconut milk</TE>
<TE>   Water</TE>
<TE>   1 (5-ounce) can evaporated milk</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs, beaten</TE>
<TE>   11/2 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   4 ripe, soft bananas, mashed</TE>
<TE>   1 cup (2 sticks) butter or margarine</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon poppy seeds</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat a 9-inch square baking pan with
nonstick cooking spray and set the pan on a foil-lined baking sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Roast the semolina in a dry skillet over medium heat, stirring,
until the color changes, 10 minutes. Combine the coconut milk, enough
water to fill 1 coconut milk can, evaporated milk, eggs, sugar and
bananas in a large pot and heat over medium heat until barely
simmering, about 4 to 5 minutes. Slowly pour in the roasted semolina,
mixing well to avoid lumps. Cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly, until thick. Addthe butter or margarine while stirring.</TE>
<TE>   Pour the batter into the pan and bake until a toothpick inserted
in the center comes out clean and the top is evenly golden brown, 1
hour. Sprinkle the top with the poppy seeds. Place under the broiler
and broil 2 minutes. Cool to room temperature, cover and let stand
overnight. Cut into diamonds to serve. Refrigerate any leftovers.
Reheat to room temperature before serving.</TE>

<TE>   Vasanti's Upma</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   Vasanti Jayaswal advises roasting the cream of wheat first because
this reduces lumping. Some cooks like to add dried red chiles. If
using these, add them along with the curry leaves. Brown mustard
seeds, urad dal, chana dal and curry leaves are available at Indian
markets.</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup quick-cooking cream of wheat</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons oil</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon split peeled urad dal</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon split chana dal</TE>
<TE>   10 to 12 curry leaves</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup chopped onion</TE>
<TE>   1/4-inch piece ginger root, minced</TE>
<TE>   Chopped or sliced serrano chile, to taste</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup frozen mixed vegetables, thawed, or diced cooked fresh
vegetables</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</TE>
<TE>   2 cups water, divided</TE>
<TE>   Cilantro leaves</TE>
<TE>   10 to 15 split cashews, lightly roasted, optional</TE>
<TE>   Roast the cream of wheat in a heavy skillet over medium heat until
light brown, stirring, about 8 to 10 minutes.Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a wok over medium-high heat.Add the mustard seeds
and fry until they pop, about 10 seconds. Add the urad and chana dals
and cook until lightly browned, 1 minute. Add the curry leaves and
stir until fragrant, then add the onion, ginger, chile and
vegetables. Cook until the onion is translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.Add
the salt and 1 cup of water and boil 30 seconds. Add the remaining 1
cup of water and lower the heat to a simmer. Pour in the cream of
wheat slowly to prevent lumping. Cook and stir constantly until done,
2 to 3 minutes. If too dry, add more water carefully. Do not let the
water level come above the cream of wheat. The mixture should not be
soggy.</TE>
<TE>   Remove from the heat, cover and let stand 5 minutes. Serve
garnished with cilantro leaves and nuts, if desired.</TE>

<HD>The Goat Cheese Revolutionaries</HD>
<DH>The Chabots have turned the ideals of Paris '68 into
something delicious.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>VALENSOLE, France</DL>
<LD>The heart of Haute-Provence isn't chic. Peter Mayle hasn't lived
here, the International Herald Tribune doesn't list local villas for
summer rentals and no cultural festivals are staged anywhere close
by. But on the high, arid, wind-swept plateau between the
Mediterranean and the Alps, about a 90-minute drive northeast of
Marseille, the French revolt of 1968 has made its last stand and,
perhaps, achieved its most enduring legacy: the creation of wonderful
goat cheeses, many of them rescued from oblivion.</LD>
<LD>   When the massive street demonstrations in Paris more than three
decades ago failed to spark a permanent upheaval, a cadre of
left-wing activists retreated to Haute-Provence to become goat-cheese
makers. It took Gallic genius to discover profound links between
revolution and gastronomy and to bridge the gap between ideology and
pragmatism. Land in Haute-Provence was cheap, and goat herding seemed
easy (just send the animals out to pasture and plot revolution, these
Paris intellectuals figured). And the market for goat cheese seemed
inexhaustible.</LD>
<LD>   If a socialist utopia could not yet be achieved in the
cosmopolitan cities, perhaps it could be carefully nurtured in the
isolated countryside, where communal life appeared more plausible in
closer proximity to nature.</LD>
<TE>   For most of these back-to-the-land idealists, the romance ended
after only a few years. Goat herding and cheese making are a lot
harder than they imagined. But among those who succeeded are Charles
and Simone Chabot, goat-cheese makers par excellence whose products
are bought by the finest restaurateurs. They had an advantage over
many of their ideological peers because they were born into peasant
families--Charles in Haute-Provence, Simone in nearby Savoie--and
grew up with a deep knowledge of farm life that wasn't eroded despite
almost 20 years spent in cities.</TE>
<TE>   I first heard about the Chabots some years ago at La Bastide de
Moustiers, a restaurant owned by Alain Ducasse, whose establishments
in Paris and Monaco have each been awarded three stars by Michelin.
The several courses of my lunch at La Bastide, an inn bordering a
lake in Haute-Provence, were excellent. But it was the platter of
local cheeses that I found most memorable. They included a
banon--creamy as a ripe Camembert at its core, with a thick, moldy
crust, wrapped in a chestnut leaf--and a tomme a l'ancienne, drier,
but just as rich and properly aged.</TE>
<TE>   The real shock for me was to discover they were goat cheeses.
Normally I avoid goat cheese, having experienced too many cheaper
varieties with an ammonia-like aftertaste. Yet these cheeses were
ravishing. Lighter than any cow or sheep banon or tomme I had ever
eaten, they actually left a trace of sweetness on my palate.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked the maitre d' for more details on these cheeses, he
told me about the Chabots and mentioned that their farm was only 40
minutes west. I took down this useful information and determined to
someday seek them out. Last spring I finally made the journey, and it
wasn't a moment too soon. Only a few months later, the Chabots, who
are preparing to retire, sold their goat herd. For now they continue
to produce cheese from milk purchased from neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Getting to the Chabots' farm, La Petite Colle ("the little hill,"
in local Provencal dialect), is a gratifying if difficult drive,
along a road that winds past fragrant lavender fields and then up
through thickly forested hills with glimpses far below of the
tranquil Durance River and the medieval market town of Manosque on
the water's edge.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, at 600 feet, the terrain levels to a plateau, which last
spring was an abnormally lush green after a rare week of rains. The
fields are mostly sainfoin, a hybrid of rye and wheat that is the
mainstay of the goats' diet. But there are also patches of wild
plants and stands of oak, juniper and olive trees. The Chabots'
property occupied no more than 50 acres, but they had the permission
of neighbors to graze their 100 goats on fallow land nearby.</TE>
<TE>   It was early evening when I reached the end of the dirt road in
front of the cheese workshop, where the Chabots and their four
employees were hosing down the floors and closing up for the day.
Charles and Simone invited me into their adjoining residence, a
converted 16th century farmhouse built on a slope. Its bottom level,
once a stable, is now an ample living room with a fireplace large
enough to roast an entire goat. (May the Chabots forgive the
blasphemy!) Above the mantel is a Picasso drawing of a satyr looking
like--what else?--a goat.</TE>
<TE>   The Chabots, both in their early 60s, offered me a glass of local
wine. Charles, of medium height with piercing gray-green eyes, was
born a short distance to the north, one of eight siblings. His mother
had hoped he would become a priest. He had the suitable fervor,
although it took a more radical, secular direction. For years he
taught social sciences at schools in Paris and other cities. It was
at his last teaching post, in Aix-en-Provence, that he met Simone, a
petite, soft-spoken woman of steely resolve who worked for the town's
social welfare department.</TE>
<TE>   As hopes for the big, urban-based revolution receded, the Chabots
focused on a smaller one in the countryside. Helped by loans and
their savings, they bought La Petite Colle in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "Land was cheap," said Charles. "Farmers were telling their
children to head for the cities because it was no use trying to make
a go of farming on less than 100 hectares [250 acres]." Together with
a score of other neo-ruraux ("new rurals"), former city dwellers with
similar left-wing notions, the Chabots formed a cooperative. Its aim
was to safeguard traditional agriculture in the region from larger
agribusinesses and vacation house developers, and, equally important,
to rescue long-lost local cheeses and those in danger of
disappearing.</TE>
<TE>   In France, cheese--like language--has a north-south divide. In the
south, cheeses were traditionally made using a sweet curd (caille
doux) technique, which still prevails in much of the eastern
Mediterranean, including Greece and Syria. In the north, the lactic
curd (caille lactique) technique reigns supreme. But in recent
decades, typical southern French cheeses such as perrail, tomme
d'Arles and Saint-Felicien have been in retreat before the more
acidic northern cheeses, including chabichou, Chavignol,
Sainte-Maure, Valencay, Selles-sur-Cher and other grandes
appellations of the Loire Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays almost all southern cheese makers are only taught the
northern caille lactique method," said Charles, who has childhood
memories of the north's "colonial" attitudes toward both the cheese
and the language of the south. He remembers, for instance, when his
parents hung bags of banon high up in trees to dry and age--a
practice, since abandoned, that his northern French schoolteachers
mocked.</TE>
<TE>   "And how well I recall being punished as a child for speaking the
southern dialect at school," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Chabots spent five years just learning and reinventing the
caille doux techniques, some of them thousands of years old. They
interviewed their own families and elderly neighbors, and they filled
the gaps with their own experiments.</TE>
<TE>   Caille doux cheeses, Simone said, are prepared at lower
temperatures and with more enzymes than caille lactique cheeses, and
the curd is compacted under higher pressure. The doux varieties are
curdled for only three hours before being placed in molds, while
lactique cheeses may be allowed to curdle for as long as 48 hours.
"That's why caille doux cheeses tend to be only a third as acidic as
the lactiques," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked Charles about the supposed dangers of caille doux
cheeses--they are prepared at temperatures well below
pasteurization--he bridled. "Sure, we could pasteurize our cheeses,
but it would destroy their taste and turn them into the standard
commercial varieties you buy in a supermarket," he said. "Bacteria,
in several varieties, are essential to good cheeses. And besides, the
cleanliness of our cheese-making facilities more than compensates for
the lack of pasteurization."</TE>
<TE>   Early the next morning I met up with the Chabots in Manosque for
the Saturday market. The small, cobbled square in the walled town
offered a cornucopia of lettuce, carrots, asparagus, eggplants,
artichokes, oranges and strawberries. Peasants in caps and cord
slippers sat on their sacks of potatoes. Old men in berets conversed
with caporal cigarettes bobbing in their mouths.</TE>
<TE>   The Chabots had the largest of the five cheese stands in the
marketplace. The stands were placed almost equidistant from one
another--and not only for territorial, economic purposes. Alas, a
revolution breeds its splinter groups, its Jacobins and Girondins,
its Stalinists and Trotskyites. Most of the cheese mongers once
belonged to the same radical cooperative, which had broken apart for
bitter ideological reasons. A few of the former members hadn't spoken
to each other for 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Although the disputes were explained to me in great detail as I
wandered around the square, I must admit I cannot remember their
substance any more than I can tell you today the differences between
Robespierre and Marat. But I do know that the main conflict concerned
the revisionist views of some cheese makers who used the northern
"colonialist" caille lactique techniques in making traditionally
southern cheeses.</TE>
<TE>   Not only was this a betrayal of the cheese revolution, but, as
pointed out by the Chabots, it contradicted ancient local
archeological finds about original cheese-making methods in
Haute-Provence. "The evidence is irrefutable that caille doux was the
traditional method of banon and other cheeses here, and still, some
people refuse to admit they are wrong," said Charles, gesturing to a
cheese monger at the other end of the square.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, back in the tranquillity of their farm, I
understood the depth of the Chabots' convictions as I sampled a
platter of more than a score of their cheeses--accompanied simply by
boiled potatoes, green salad, sweet green onions and, of course, red
wine.</TE>
<TE>   We started off with three different banons, prepared by Charles.
The first was very young and soft, with a subtle taste. The other two
were more aged, with thicker crusts and creamier interiors. Charles
picked up a slice of the oldest and showed me its golden marble
interior. It was delicious, dry and slightly piquant, thanks to the
action of the tannins in its chestnut-leaf wrapping.</TE>
<TE>   Next followed an assortment of tomme a l'ancienne, also prepared
by Charles. The younger ones were flaky and almost tart, the more
aged varieties quite rich and dry. At the Chabots' suggestion, I
occasionally bit into a green onion to clear my taste buds, like
munching ginger between sashimi slices. I particularly liked two
cheeses recreated by Simone from her research: a Saint-Mayeul, creamy
yet slightly chunky, and sweeter than banon; and a sublime du Verdon,
with a musty washed rind crust and a powerful, ripe, creamy taste
inside, which Simone attributed to a longer curding process than
usual.</TE>
<TE>   There was more to come--slightly acid galoubet molded into small,
bluish cylinders; truffle-shaped truffes de Valensole, a mild, dry
cheese named after the nearest village and made by the caille
lactique technique ("You see, we aren't ideologically rigid,"
remarked Charles when I raised my eyebrows in surprise); and another
lactique, a breast-shaped, cinder-colored tetoun de Sainte-Agathe (in
honor of a favorite local saint who suffered unspeakable mutilation
in her martyrdom) with a creamy, almost spicy flavor.</TE>
<TE>   But the talent and passion of the Chabots could not be measured by
their cheeses alone. Equally important was the way they handled their
goats. They spent 16 hours a day herding the animals through
pastures, hills and woods. The goats ate almost 200 different plant
varieties, which lent complexity to their milk. And all the while,
they viewed the lovely mountains on the horizon, including the famous
Sainte-Victoire painted by Cezanne.</TE>
<TE>   The Chabots insisted that the quality of their cheeses depended on
how gently they treated their animals. They knew each by name. Goats,
they avow, have fabulous memories: They remember every slap, every
shout, every insult. And bile never makes for good cheese.</TE>

<LD>Beets are known for their sweetness. When they are roasted, their
flavor intensifies to a rich, earthy one. They need little in the way
of added fat to taste good; here, they're marinated in a horseradish
vinaigrette.</LD>
<LD>   The red beet is the most common variety. But you can buy colorful
heirloom yellow, white and variegated beets at farmers markets and
specialty stores. They look pretty mixed together in this dish.</LD>
<LD>   Beet greens are nutritious and can be steamed and served with the
beets, if you wish. Steam the greens about five minutes.</LD>

<LD>Produce starts coming on strong in spring, so April begins the prime
season for launching new farmers markets--20 are scheduled this
season. The Diamond Bar Saturday market, which began April 6, was one
of the earliest. It has been getting bigger every week.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, Atkins Nursery of Fallbrook brought small,
exquisitely juicy and flavorful white-fleshed loquats--one of the
great joys of spring, but too delicate to sell commercially. The
stand also sold Oroblancos (a tad past peak), Bearss limes and
macadamia nuts.</LD>
<LD>   Lisa Dahlberg, the 20-year-old daughter of the market's manager,
sold several kinds of honey, including fragrant orange blossom and a
darker, almost molasses-like avocado and eucalyptus mix. Luis Guevara
of Chino had Pinkerton avocados, a seedling of Hass with a long neck,
small seed and fine, buttery flesh, along with tart Nagami kumquats
and Eureka lemons.</LD>
<TE>   H&amp;H Citrus of Mentone sold good navel and blood oranges, Gwen
avocados and Maui onions. From Mira Loma, Tang Lian of Bih Shan Farm
brought oyster, shiitake and reishi (turkey tail) mushrooms, as well
as crisp pea sprouts.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Farms of Ontario offered Camarosa strawberries, including
some picked that morning; they were fairly sweet and juicy for this
often mediocre variety. Leticia Cabral sold cilantro, turnips and
large fava beans from Ontario and Chino. Irma Frutos, whose family
farms in Orange, had carrots, beets and romaine and red-leaf lettuce.</TE>
<TE>   Last year California law changed to permit grape growers to sell
their wines at farmers markets. Kirby Wyllie, who farms 3,000 acres
of grapes in the San Joaquin Valley, took advantage of this to offer
eight varietal wines, from Chardonnay to Zinfandel. Although he's not
allowed to pour samples, he said sales at the markets he attends have
been brisker than expected.</TE>

<LD>Thai food is very versatile, in addition to being good. I adapted a
recipe for pork and basil over rice by substituting extra-wide rice
noodles. The result is a one-dish meal.</LD>
<LD>   You could even substitute tofu for the pork, if you prefer.</LD>
<LD>   Simple pickled cucumbers round out the dinner, followed by fresh
fruit for dessert.</LD>
<TE>   You'll find some of these ingredients handy when making other
dishes.</TE>

<HD>Hot Goods Rule at the Barbecue Show</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>California may be the capital of backyard cooking, but we don't have
a monopoly on it. At Hearth, Patio and Barbecue Expo 2000, a huge
trade show of "indoor hearth and backyard living" products at the
Anaheim Convention Center recently, there were brands from South
Korea, Taiwan, mainland China and even France.</LD>
<LD>   No fewer than four of the barbecue makers were Canadian. "We have
an intense 41/2-month barbecue season in Canada," said Alan Jackson,
president of Jackson Grills.</LD>
<LD>   A couple of manufacturers offered electric barbecues, and two were
showing electric pit barbecues or smokers. Karen Lunsford was handing
out barbecued ribs from the Cookshack Smokette II, made in Ponca
City, Okla. "You just close the door, set the temperature and walk
away," she said.</LD>
<TE>   High-end gas-fired barbecues have been getting bigger and bigger
(Dynasty has a model that can cook 50 hamburgers at a time) and
acquiring ever more features of a kitchen range. Several companies
also offer matching refrigerators for your outdoor kitchen. Patio
dishwashers are probably next.</TE>
<TE>   The same trend toward non-grill outdoor cooking can be seen in the
turkey deep-fryers and crab boilers that have become common in the
last five years. More such developments are on the way.</TE>
<TE>   Take EVO's flat-top grill. It looks like a patio umbrella table
without the umbrella--one that happens to have a steel surface 36
inches across and big black knobs to control the two muscular-looking
concentric burners under the griddle top.</TE>
<TE>   "The food doesn't stick the way it does to a rack," said inventor
Bob Shingler, "and it can't fall through."</TE>
<TE>   On a much more modest level, Little Griddle Inc. was debuting the
Griddle-Q, a line of stainless steel griddles that fit onto most gas
barbecues. "My husband invented it for our Boy Scout troop," said
Vicki Button, "and over the years our friends kept asking him to make
them for them. This is our first trade show."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, people also want to make pizzas in their backyards.
Several companies had pizza stones for barbecues, and Llonari Corp.
was showing a gas-fired brick pizza oven mounted on wheels so you can
fire it up anywhere on the patio.</TE>
<TE>   With all this bringing of indoor activities to the patio, it's
natural that the fireplace has migrated out there too. A lot of firms
were showing patio hearths, seven of them also making the tall,
chimneyed Mexican-style clay oven called a chimenea. Naturally, most
of them were rigging chimeneas up for use as barbecues, too.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the Finnish company Rakennustempo Oy, maker of
the Tundra Grill--a big, elaborate patio hearth complete with hood,
grill rack, three frying pans mounted at three heights and two
vertical broiling boards for cooking planked fish.</TE>
<TE>   But with all these high-tech and high-fashion developments, it's
good to know the trade show still had room for Buster's Drunk Chicken
Roost, "manufacturer of the finest beer can chicken cooker on the
planet." Hey, however you cut it, barbecue is barbecue.</TE>

<LD>Grilled salmon is a family favorite, especially in spring, when
Chinook (or king) salmon is in the markets. Grill steaks or filets
that are 3/4- to 1-inch thick, allowing about 6 ounces per person for
dinner, and save about 3/4 pound to make this main-course salad later
in the week.</LD>
<LD>   When grilling salmon, prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or
gas grill. Brush the salmon with olive oil and rub it with a little
salt and pepper. To keep the fish from sticking, brush the grill
grates well with oil. Place the salmon skin-side up over the flame
and cover. After about 5 minutes, turn the salmon over and grill,
covered, until opaque all the way through. The timing will depend on
the thickness of the fish.</LD>

<TE>   Grilled Salmon Salad With Potatoes and Dill</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 40 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   12 baby red boiling potatoes</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 shallot, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound grilled salmon</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill</TE>
<TE>   1 ripe avocado, cut into 1/2-inch dice</TE>
<TE>   1 large bunch watercress</TE>
<TE>   Place the potatoes in a saucepan, add cold water to cover and
bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add 2 teaspoons of salt, and
reduce the heat so the water just simmers. Cook the potatoes until
tender when pierced with a fork, about 12 to 15 minutes. Drain the
potatoes and run them under cold water until cool enough to handle.</TE>
<TE>   While the potatoes are cooking, whisk together the shallot,
mustard, sugar, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, the lemon juice
and olive oil in a small bowl. Add pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Cut the potatoes into thin slices and place in a large salad bowl.
Use a fork to flake the salmon into bite-size pieces. Add to the
salad bowl along with the dill and avocado. Cut off and discard the
tough stems of the watercress. Coarsely chop the rest and add to the
salad bowl. Gently toss the salad with the dressing. Divide the salad
among 4 plates. Serve immediately.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: About 15 years ago, SOS printed a recipe for enchilada
sauce that contained Mexican chocolate. I've lost my copy and
wondered if you would print it again.</LD>
<LD>   MARTYNN RAFFERTY</LD>
<LD>   Coventry, England</LD>
<TE>   DEAR MARTYNN: This recipe ran in 1989. These enchiladas--and their
sauce--were from the restaurant La Villa Taxco in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cheese Enchiladas Acapulco</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 35 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1  1/2
hours</TE>
<TE>   Mexican chocolate and mole sauce are available at most Latino
grocery stores and well-stocked supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   ENCHILADA SAUCE</TE>
<TE>   5 cups chicken broth or water</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons chile powder</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons grated Mexican chocolate</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons canned mole sauce</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup lard</TE>
<TE>   5 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   Combine the broth, chile powder, garlic powder, oregano and cumin
in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer 20
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the chocolate, mole sauce and about 1/4 cup of the hot
liquid from the saucepan in a blender and liquefy. Return to the
spice mixture and mix well. Season to taste with salt.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the lard in a separate skillet over medium heat. Stir in the
flour until smooth and cook, stirring, until golden, about 6 to 8
minutes. Stir in a small amount of the liquid from the spice mixture
until smooth.</TE>
<TE>   Return to the spice mixture and mix well. Bring again to a simmer,
reduce the heat and simmer until the flavors meld, 20 minutes,
stirring occasionally to prevent lumps from forming.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ENCHILADAS</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons lard, shortening or vegetable oil, plus more as
needed</TE>
<TE>   8 corn tortillas</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound Jack cheese or Cheddar, shredded</TE>
<TE>   Enchilada Sauce</TE>
<TE>   1 bunch green onions, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 (3.8-ounce) can sliced black olives</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the lard in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the
tortillas to soften slightly, about 15 seconds a side. Add more oil
or lard if the skillet becomes dry. Drain the tortillas on paper
towels.</TE>
<TE>   Sprinkle about 1/4 cup of the cheese down the center of each
tortilla and roll. Place seam-side-down in a 2-quart rectangular
baking dish. Finish with the remaining tortillas.</TE>
<TE>   Cover the enchiladas with Enchilada Sauce and sprinkle with the
remaining cheese. Bake until the cheese is hot and bubbly, 15 to 25
minutes. Garnish with the green onions and olives. Pass the leftover
sauce when serving.</TE>

<LD>Edmond Fallot has been making Dijon mustard since 1840. It's actually
made in Beaune--pres Dijon, "near Dijon," as the label is careful to
explain. This near-Dijon mustard is made the traditional way with
stone-ground mustard seeds and verjus (unfermented grape must).</LD>
<LD>   Ochre in color, this smooth mustard has a nice snap of acidity and
a moderate amount of heat, making it ideal for vinaigrettes or in a
dressing for celeri remoulade, say. It's wonderful in a ham sandwich
too (though no match for Philippe the Original's fire-breathing
mustard).</LD>
<LD>   At Oakville Grocery, look for Fallot moutarde packaged in a tin
pail. Not only do you get a larger 15.8-ounce jar, you can use the
colorful pail to keep your collection of small gadgets.</LD>

<KH>Cook's Walk</KH>

<DH>Take a walk through the restaurants, shops and cafes of
Anaheim's bustling Little Arabia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Armenian food, you go to south Glendale or east Hollywood. For
Persian food, it's Westwood or Reseda. For Arab markets and
restaurants, the local capital is Anaheim. The three-block stretch of
Brookhurst Street from Ball Road to Orange Avenue is home to three
Arab markets, two restaurants, two cafes, a butcher shop and a
bakery.</LD>
<LD>   All the Middle Eastern cuisines have a lot in common, so the
markets stock much the same ingredients that you'd find in a Persian
or Armenian store (as well as some Indian ingredients, particularly
condiments), and the restaurant menus are a lot like Armenian
menus--hummus, tabbouleh, shish kebab, baklava. What makes them
specifically Arab? They all have at least a few ingredients or dishes
you're not likely to see elsewhere, and some feature tombak, the
special aromatic tobacco for smoking in a water pipe.</LD>
<TE>   This is the densest collection of Middle Eastern food businesses
in Anaheim, but there are others. If you go a mile south, you'll find
a bright new market named Ta'ami at Brookhurst Street and Katella
Avenue. If you head half a mile west on Ball Road instead, you'll
come across Alexandria Restaurant &amp; Fish Market, Al Sham Pastry,
Sarkis Pastry, Anaheim King Market and a Zankou Chicken all in the
same mini-mall at Gilbert Street. Little Cairo Restaurant and Janna,
a tiny Lebanese eatery with a pool table, are a mile farther west at
Dale Street. No surprise, this part of Anaheim is known as Little
Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the businesses have hung American flags in their windows,
but you do sense a little unease in the neighborhood. Not so much in
the markets, which draw canny shoppers from a variety of ethnic
groups and look quite busy. The restaurants, by contrast, seem to be
patronized mostly by people speaking Arabic, and business sometimes
looks quiet in some of them.</TE>
<TE>   The owners of these businesses are mostly from Syria, Lebanon,
Jordan and Palestine, which share a common repertoire of dishes. You
can count on seeing olives and olive oils, rice by the sack, bulgur
wheat in all its grades, rosewater and orange blossom water, yogurt,
fresh flatbreads and filo pastries in the markets.</TE>
<TE>   You'll also find syrups and honeys, inexpensive produce, canned
Mediterranean vegetables and pickles, a surprising range of European
cookies and handsome displays of halal meat (slaughtered according to
Islamic law). All the markets carry Arab ingredients such as zaatar
(a seasoning of wild thyme mixed with tart ground sumac berry), jamid
(spiced buttermilk solids, often added to sauces) and Arab-style
cheeses. The stock is mostly the same in all the markets, but each
place also carries some unique items.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the street are two cafes of the sort you'd find in
Damascus or Amman: male hangouts for drinking Turkish coffee
(typically flavored Arab-style with cardamom) and perhaps having a
pastry, but mostly for chatting, watching Arabic TV, playing
backgammon and smoking the narghile, or water pipe, which has
returned to fashion in the Arab world during the last 15 years. If a
non-Arab walks into one, the patrons' reaction is likely to be
guarded but mostly just very surprised.</TE>
<TE>   1. The pioneer business in the neighborhood was Al Tayebat
Grocery, located on the west side of Brookhurst just south of Ball
Road. Owner Sami Khouraki, a onetime Kmart manager, opened the store
20 years ago. A few years later he took over the space next door and
doubled the size of Al Tayebat (the name means "good things").
Khouraki is from Aleppo, Syria, and likes to emphasize Aleppo's
traditional role as the center of trade between Europe and the Middle
East. He maintains a Web site where you can place orders.</TE>
<TE>   The south half of the shop, the produce department, mostly stocks
the same fruits and vegetables as your local supermarket, at least at
this season of the year, though it is likely to have ridged cucumbers
(miqta; the Armenian ghoota) and peeled garlic cloves by the 5-pound
sack. North of that is a freezer case full of filo and puff pastry,
samosa pastry ("samosa pad"), frozen quail and the Middle Eastern
vegetables moloukhiya (a green also known as Jew's mallow) and colcas
(qulqas, a potato-like root also called taro).</TE>
<TE>   Past that there are six aisles of staples such as oils,
condiments, canned vegetables, syrups and pastas. Against the far
wall are fresh breads, a little selection of Middle Eastern cooking
utensils and a cubbyhole stocked with spices and sacks of rice. Along
the west wall are a large halal meat department (whole lambs, $1.99 a
pound) and dairy cases featuring domestic Akkawi cheese (like a dense
feta, but less salty) and the creamier Nabulsi, not to mention many
fetas and string cheeses.</TE>
<TE>   Both narghiles and narghile tobaccos are for sale near the door.
The impulse items at the cash register are likely to be frozen quail
and bulk dates and walnuts. This is the largest market in the
neighborhood and has the greatest number of unique items on its
shelves, such as makdous (walnut-stuffed eggplants pickled in olive
oil).</TE>
<TE>   Al Tayebat Grocery, 1217 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim. (714)
520-4723. Also online at altayebat .com. Open 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday
through Saturday; closed Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   2. On the other side of Brookhurst, there's a mini-mall with a
restaurant and a cafe, not to mention a bookstore (about evenly
divided between Arabic books and Arab pop-music recordings), a travel
agency, a hair salon, an Islamic fashion shop and even a dental
office.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant, Kareem's, is a plain little place with little
decor apart from a poster of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. The
menu is the usual tabbouleh-falafel sort of thing, but you can get
some less usual varieties, such as hummus garnished with fried meat
and pine nuts. Msabbiha is hummus topped with whole garbanzos;
qudsiyya is much the same but topped with boiled fava beans instead.
The breakfast menu offers shakshouka, a dish of eggs scrambled with
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Kareem's Restaurant, 1208 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim. (714)
778-6829. Open 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   3. Hidden away in the corner of the mall is Al-Karnak, a small
cafe/hangout open in the evenings. Food is limited to coffee, snacks
and soft drinks.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Karnak, 1220 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim. (714) 991-6800. Open 4
p.m. to 1 a.m. daily.</TE>
<TE>   4. A block north of Ball Road, at the corner of Brookmore Avenue,
there's another cluster of businesses: a music and video store, a
jewelry shop, a clothing store, a hair salon and two food businesses.</TE>
<TE>   One is a restaurant, Al-Rayan Middle Eastern Cuisine. It's a
rather grand place inside, all in geometrical patterns of purple and
white with a dais and microphone for parties or musical performances.
On weeknights, the menu is the usual hummus and tabbouleh-type
appetizers, various kebabs and nightly specials, such as musakhkhan
(stewed chicken with sumac) on Wednesdays.</TE>
<TE>   On the weekends, it puts out an impressive buffet of a dozen or
more cold dishes (which might include cauliflower frittata or braised
kidneys as well as more familiar dishes such as stuffed grape leaves
and stewed eggplants) and four or five hot ones, such as roast
chicken, cabbage rolls or peppery okra stew. Behind the buffet table
there are stations where you can get chicken soup, pastries and
coffee or tea.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Rayan Middle Eastern Cuisine &amp; Pastry, 808 S. Brookhurst St.,
Anaheim. (714) 491-2768. Open noon to 10 p.m. daily.</TE>
<TE>   5. Next to Al-Rayan stands a business with a sign in Arabic script
reading Al Sanabel Bakery (the name means "the ears of wheat"). You
might expect pita bread and baklava here, but you won't find either
one.</TE>
<TE>   Basically, this is a sort of Lebanese pizza parlor. The wall
behind the counter is covered with photos of lahmajoun-like
flatbreads topped with tart zaatar (with or without white cheese or
yogurt cheese), meatballs, chicken or spinach. Even more
lahmajoun-like are lahm bi-'ajin, with a topping of ground meat in a
little tomato sauce, and sfiha ba'albakiyya, similar but tangy with
pomegranate juice.</TE>
<TE>   There are also toasted sandwiches ranging from American-style tuna
to sandwiches of yogurt cheese with mint and olive oil, two kinds of
Middle Eastern sausage or brains with garlic sauce and tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of baklava, you might find similar filo pastries with rich
cream fillings that have been fried instead of being baked. But most
of the pastries are cookies or syrup-soaked cakes. Buttery semolina
cookies (ma'mul) with date or walnut fillings are usually available,
and sometimes you can get little rod-shaped pistachio-filled cookies
called karabij, which you dip in rose-scented natif, which is
something between a thick sauce and a frosting.</TE>
<TE>   Al Sanabel Bakery, 816 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim. (714) 635-4353.
Open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.</TE>
<TE>   6. Al Basha Cafe, located just across the street, is the other
cafe in the neighborhood. Its sign says it serves sandwiches,
pastries and fruit juices as well as coffee, but the customers mostly
seem to be making use of the water pipes the management provides--a
perfumed wave of tobacco smoke rolls right out its door.</TE>
<TE>   Al Basha Cafe, 809 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim. (714) 991-1112.
Call for hours.</TE>
<TE>   7. Two blocks farther north, a number of businesses are scattered
around the corner of Brookhurst Street and Orange Avenue. Sahara
Falafel has been in the mini-mall at the northeast corner for seven
years. True to its name, it covers its walls with a mural of the
desert complete with Bedouins and pyramids. Arabic news and
entertainment play continuously on the television set over the
counter, but there are only a few tables, and this is mostly a
takeout business.</TE>
<TE>   There's more to the menu than falafel, good though it is. In fact,
the place is better known for its roast chicken with garlic sauce and
its shawarma (gyros) sandwiches, chicken and beef.</TE>
<TE>   Sahara Falafel, 590 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim. (714) 491-0400.
Open 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday-Thursday, 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.
Friday-Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   8. Al Huda Grocery opened four months ago in the next mini-mall to
the north. It has aisles of frozen convenience foods, spices and
oils, pickles and condiments, syrups and cookies and coffee and tea.
There are also coffee beans at the counter, along with pastries. The
rest of the space is produce.</TE>
<TE>   One of the unique products it sells is Zaatar Albitoti, a richer
version of the usual thyme and sumac seasoning which adds anise,
fennel, coriander, cumin, peanuts, chickpeas and sunflower seeds.</TE>
<TE>   Al Huda Grocery, #6, 518 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim. (714)
776-4242. Open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.</TE>
<TE>   9. Next door is Al Huda Meat Market, which advertises halal
Australian sheep as well as beef and chicken. In the window there's a
diagram of the cuts of lamb in English and Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   Al Huda Meat Market, No. 7, 518 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim. Open 8
a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.</TE>
<TE>   10. The second-oldest Arab food business in the neighborhood is
Sindbad Ranch Mid East Groceries located at the northwest corner for
12 years. The owner, Abdo Khouraki, is the brother of the owner of Al
Tayebat. He keeps his market open an hour later than Al Tayebat most
nights and closes on Mondays, instead of Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   Frozen foods are on the right as you enter, pastries and breads
and bulk rice on the left. There are aisles of syrups, confections,
pickles and canned vegetables, a halal meat counter and, of course, a
produce section. Among the unique products here are canned Iranian
tuna and Moroccan sardines.</TE>
<TE>   Sindbad Ranch Mid East Groceries, 521 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim.
(714) 533-3671. 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to
7 p.m. Sunday; closed Monday.</TE>
<TE>   11. Just south of Orange Avenue, looking a little lost among its
neighbors--a Sichuanese restaurant, a laundry and a chiropractor's
office--is Petra Restaurant. It's a fancy place like Al-Rayan,
complete with a dais and microphone, and larger than it seems from
the outside; it looks as if two rooms have been joined where a
decorative archway now stands. The walls are decorated with a big
photomural of a tropical sunset.</TE>
<TE>   Its food is quite good, with particularly juicy chicken and kofta
(ground beef) kebabs. At end of a meal, you can get Arab coffee
scented with cardamom.</TE>
<TE>   Petra Restaurant, 611 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim. (714) 774-7999.
Open 4 to 10 p.m. Monday-Friday, 1 to 10 p.m. Saturday, 1 to 9 p.m.
Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Babbo Boys Unravel the Joyful Anarchy of Italian Wines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like most wine fans, I got my feet wet in Bordeaux, mainly because
it's so seductively easy to understand. In fact, it was designed that
way more than a century ago with an easily memorized classification
that makes it the most approachable of all wine regions. Like Circe's
island intercepting Odysseus, Bordeaux is set up to gently interrupt
a voyage of exploration, to make itself the center of a wine lover's
world, to tell impressionable and passionate neophytes what to think,
and what to drink.</LD>
<LD>   Soon enough, mounting curiosity broke the spell. Like Odysseus, I
set off again, leaving a trail of purple footprints in the direction
of Burgundy's sensual landscape--and beyond, toward the endless
viticultural charms of Italy.</LD>
<LD>   Odysseus was Greek, of course, and legend has it that a Greek god,
Dionysus, introduced the vine to Italy. Be that as it may, the
proto-Italian Etruscans embraced viticulture in antiquity, and Italy
has never looked back.</LD>
<TE>   Modern Italy, with some two million wine-bearing acres in 21
regions, might be described as one big wine estate. But that would be
missing the point. The vast boot-shaped vineyard is made up of
countless distinctly individual plantings, most of them relatively
small plots attached to villages, castles and family farms. Each has
its own story, though not always a happy one--grapes are subject to
the shifting fortunes of agriculture to some extent--and all those
stories make up a cultural fabric that gives the greater Italian
vineyard endless layers of complexity and inflection.</TE>
<TE>   Italian wines are not classified very well, and the details are
anything but easily memorized. Even hard-core wine nerds are hard
pressed to recall, for example, the grape varieties typically blended
in your everyday Valpolicella (and if you just rattled off "Corvina,
Rondinella and Molimara," you may want to consider getting a life).
And yet wandering the Italian winescape, glass in hand, is a
marvelous odyssey that is only made more delightful by the occasional
scary episode.</TE>
<TE>   The essential guidebook to that exploration has just been
published. "Vino Italiano: The Regional Wines of Italy" (Clarkson
Potter, $35), by Joseph Bastianich and David Lynch, is the Italian
wine book Americans have been waiting for.</TE>
<TE>   Chief among its many charms is that it makes sense of Italian wine
via celebration, rather than pedantry. These days, wine is too often
presented as an isolated phenomenon, something to be studied,
quantified, rated and ranked apart from its place in a life well
lived. But early on, the authors state their intent to expand the
basic concept of terroir--the "total natural environment" of a
vineyard--to include the human factors that influence the character
of wine from a given place.</TE>
<TE>   There is no attempt to impose order on what even the Italians
happily admit is something akin to chaos. Instead, Bastianich and
Lynch embrace the ambiente, or cultural environment of the vine. They
show us around like a pair of Italian uncles, urging us to eat and
drink while filling us in on stuff that makes the experience even
more enjoyable.</TE>
<TE>   This avuncular tone is set in the vignettes that open each
chapter. They show us a slice of regional daily life, especially life
at table, which leads to an illumination of the area's wines.</TE>
<TE>   In one, they invade the Marche in search of crudo (Italian raw
fish) and find their way to a seaside osteria where the chef is "a
wild-eyed, somewhat blissed-out character named Moreno" whose kitchen
sends out "plates of delicate raw fish in architectural
presentations, drizzled with olive oil." In the next, they attend a
soccer game in Lazio (Italy's sixth most productive wine region) and
celebrate the victory of Rome over the regional team with a carafe of
fragrant, refreshing Frascati.</TE>
<TE>   They break an arduous hike to eat mocetta (ibex/chamois
prosciutto) and artisan Fontina cheese in Alto-Aldige, a wine
district so rugged that viticulture there "seems more like an
endurance sport than a way to make a living." Not coincidentally, a
white wine from this region in the shadow of Mont Blanc is described
as tasting like mountain spring water flowing through a meadow filled
with wildflowers.</TE>
<TE>   Historical revelations are woven into the stories in a way that
illuminates why the people--and their food and wine--are the way they
are. In the chapter on Basilicata, for example, we learn that there
are three strong theories about the origin of Aglianico grape, all of
them involving the ancient Greeks.</TE>
<TE>   In Veneto, Bastianich and Lynch speculate on the source of the
locals' fondness for horse meat. And sometimes the most telling bit
of history is the lack of one, as when we learn that the name of
Tuscany's celebrated white grape, Vernaccia, means "indigenous."</TE>
<TE>   Italy has some 800 wine grape varieties. Many are found nowhere
else in the world, and all of them, on some level, express Italian
culture. There are hundreds of defined production zones on several
levels of specificity. Piedmont alone has 50 Denominazione Origine
Controllata, or DOC, zones. Tuscany has 40. How many can you name?</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry about it. An appendix provides a glossary of Italian
wine terms, a roster of grape varieties and a precise directory of
wine zones by region. You may turn to those pages often, but you
won't spend much time there. All the good stuff (including recipes
from Bastianich's restaurateuse mom, Lidia) is up front.</TE>
<TE>   Bastianich co-owns an impressive roster of New York restaurants,
including Babbo, Esca, Becco and Felidia. Lynch is wine director at
Babbo. He is also a James Beard Award-winning writer on the subject
of wine. That may explain his knack for imparting knowledge and
insight painlessly.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining the arcane mysteries of Italian wine laws, for example,
Lynch confides that Italian wine producers "have lots and lots of
laws, which they delight in creating, revising and, most especially,
debating. But obeying them is another story."</TE>
<TE>   He gets off some pretty good wine descriptions, too: "A glass of
young Aglianico," he writes, "is dark and feral, like the wolves that
still roam the hills in these parts, greeting you with a low, tannic
growl."</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, says as much about the subject as it does about
the author. Who would write something like that about a Pauillac?</TE>

<DH>1997 Terrabianca "Campaccio" Toscana, Tuscany.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is a real beauty from Tuscany's extraordinary 1997 vintage. It's
a hand-hewn, sinewy wine with a long, sweet finish and changes in the
glass, taking on nuances through the evening. Though it's drinking
beautifully now, it can easily age a decade or longer. The earthy
blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon tastes of ripe
black cherries. It would be brilliant with grilled and roasted meats,
feathered game and an aged Pecorino.</LD>
<LD>   About $25. At Larchmont Village Wine &amp; Cheese in Los Angeles,

<DH>It Sure Sounds Like Another British Invasion</DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surrounded by posters of British bands, including Coldplay and
Travis, visiting actress Anna Friel gives the transatlantic take on
Southern California: Until recently, her countrymen loved to loathe
Los Angeles, depicting it with stereotypes such as "cultural
wasteland," she says.</LD>
<LD>   But lately, the city has become a coveted destination for Brits.</LD>
<LD>   "There's been an English exodus to Los Angeles," she says, as she
browses through CDs at Melrose Music on a recent afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   At the counter, a guy in a black 1998 World Cup T-shirt arranges
and rearranges comics, pretending not to notice the tiny actress in
the back of the store, there to promote the summer movie "Me Without
You," which charts the friendship of two girls over three decades.
She stars as Marina.</TE>
<TE>   Picking up a Depeche Mode disc, Friel points out that even those
morose New Wave Brits have made the leap West.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, she has spent the last couple of weeks hanging out with
members of the band in Santa Barbara, where songwriter Martin Gore
lives.</TE>
<TE>   "The city has found its own," she says. "The culture and style
here is unique."</TE>
<TE>   As she leaves the store to get coffee at a nearby cafe, Friel
ponders the similarities between Melrose Avenue and Portobello Road
in Notting Hill, London, and, as if on cue, a couple of British
friends stop by to say hello.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot more people have learned to love L.A.," she says, adding
that two dozen friends have already made the move. "There's no need
to go back.... You could live the same life here as in London."</TE>
<TE>   Racking Up the Frequent Flier Miles</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Jeremy Northam, also held forth on geography. In this
case, an actor's itinerary. "Since January, I've been from London to
New York, back to London, back to Toronto, back to London, to Berlin,
back to London, grabbed a short holiday, back to London, came out for
three weeks here, back to London for a week, and then back here," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   The outdoor patio at the Four Seasons hotel is a fitting setting
for a guy in transit, and Northam pauses, while lighting his third
cigarette. "I haven't acted in nine months," he says with mock panic.
"I've forgotten what it's like. I've forgotten how to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Northam racked up the air miles promoting "Gosford Park," in which
he played matinee idol Ivor Novello. Now, he is doing publicity for
"Enigma," a World War II movie that opened last week. In the movie,
produced by "Saturday Night Live" executive producer Lorne Michaels
and Mick Jagger, Northam is Wigram, a sardonic secret-service agent
who is part of the group of scientists and academics trying to crack
the German code Enigma.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the whirlwind publicity tour, Northam isn't the object of
too much stargazing on American streets, he says. The line he hears
most is: "'I didn't recognize you. You look much younger in the
movie,'" he cracks. "It's always good for the ego."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Mingles With Wax Figures</TE>
<TE>   In one corner of the enormous shopping mall, well-dressed
professionals, uniformed Catholic schoolchildren and the mayor of Los
Angeles, James K. Hahn, buzz around an exhibit of Madame Tussaud
celebrities made of wax.</TE>
<TE>   Hours earlier, Hahn had released his $4.81-billion annual budget
without ruffling any feathers. (The budget essentially maintains the
status quo.) So he had time to leave his downtown office and venture
to the Westside for an appearance in conjunction with the A&amp;E Network
television show "Biography." (The network is celebrating the show's
15th anniversary with a multimedia exhibit of the personalities it
has profiled, and Friday was the traveling exhibit's launch.)</TE>
<TE>   After weaving through throngs of autograph-seeking schoolchildren,
Hahn takes the Westside Pavilion stage, thanks the event sponsors
(too numerous to name here) and lauds Los Angeles as "the greatest
city in the world." The crowd cheers. Behind him, several television
screens flash photos of Leonardo da Vinci and Frank Zappa.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn honors several "community heroes" with awards from
"Biography." Among them: Olympic speed skater and gold medal winner
Derek Parra, cancer research fund-raiser Lilly Tartikoff and the
members of El Camino High School's academic decathlon team.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the crowd leaves Hahn and moves toward the wax figures
that line one wall. Albert Einstein stands between Madonna and Arnold
Schwarzenegger, and Secretary of State Colin Powell is positioned
next to George Washington. Powell and Einstein look remarkably
authentic. "It's very creepy," says a woman in a red A&amp;E shirt. "You
should have seen it when they brought them in. You know, the head is
transported separate from the body."</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, one student poses with Powell's figure. Then he points to
the petite blond figure of a pop star in a sequined leotard and
fishnets. "Now get one of me with Madonna," he says to a chaperone.
The nun refuses. Another visitor comments on Madonna's lack of
authenticity. "We do get a lot of complaints about her," says Madame
Tussaud's New York general manager, Danielle Terry. The problem, she
says, is that Madonna hasn't posed in person for sculptors. "We have
approached her," Terry says. "We're just waiting for a response."</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the exhibit, Hahn, one of the few live
celebrities at the event, checks his watch. "I'm sorry, I'm going to
have to go," he tells a group of schoolchildren. A moment later, he's
heading back downtown.</TE>

<KH>THE GUY CHRONICLES</KH>
<HD>The Kind of Party That Turns Life on Its Ear</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS ERSKINE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Someone is turning 40.</LD>
<LD>   "Really? Him?" I ask when we get the invite.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes, him," my wife says.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought he was at least 50," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, the birthday boy looks about 30, but what are you going
to say? "Hey, the guy looks great for 40"? You're not going to say
that. Once I remarked how good this same guy looked in his driver's
license photo. Felt funny about it for days.</TE>
<TE>   So it's going to be a big party, the kind you and your wife
prepare to attend a week ahead of time, make sure the kids are set
and you don't forget to feed them before you rush out of the door,
hard shoes on concrete.</TE>
<TE>   You make extra sure you have the right clothes and that one of you
is committed to not drinking too much, a subject of two days of
debate.</TE>
<TE>   "You drank last time," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "No, you drank last time," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "No, you drank last time," she says, which is probably true, what
with all the pressure I'm under.</TE>
<TE>   Because here's what my wife does for party clothes: She looks in
her closet, screams, then slams the closet door, scaring the cat and
making the dog all jumpy till he knocks over a vase, which crashes to
the floor like a gunshot, setting off car alarms up and down the
street and drawing sheriff's cars and helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened?" one of the kids will ask.</TE>
<TE>   "Your mother just looked in her closet," I'll explain.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," they'll say, then go back to their e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what I do for clothes: I look in the closet, then smile.</TE>
<TE>   It's a closet alive with color, shades of brown mostly, the color
of footballs and baseball infields, cigars and raccoons. Great color,
brown. Wore a brown tux to my wedding. Married a brown-eyed girl.
Never went too wrong with brown.</TE>
<TE>   "Dad, you dress," my oldest daughter recently noted, "like a
sportswriter from 1985."</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "That wasn't really a compliment," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "That wasn't really a thanks," I said.</TE>
<TE>   It's going to be a big party, fancy as a wedding, held at Casa Del
Something in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Open bar. Big buffet. Women slender as pencils, some of them
famous and drop-dead gorgeous.</TE>
<TE>   There'll be fancy hors d'oeuvres on silver platters. Giant shrimp,
some of them drop-dead gorgeous. Overlooks the ocean, this party.
When a guy makes it all the way to 40, you pull out all the stops.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to wear my black dress," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll look great," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wear my black dress," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course you can't," I say.</TE>
<TE>   For there is this rumor that one of the other moms might be
wearing leather pants. Some of the moms can pull it off, which kind
of unnerves the moms who can't.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I'll probably just wear my leather pants," the other mom
reportedly said a few days before the party, sending shock waves
across our oversexed little suburb. Leather? How do you compete with
leather? Under their breath, several mothers cursed.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever you wear will be fine," I tell my wife.</TE>
<TE>   "No it won't," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it won't," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going shopping," she says.</TE>
<TE>   And off she goes shopping with our college-student daughter, who's
back in town just to help her mother find something a little hip and
sexy.</TE>
<TE>   Remember in the old "Batman" show the sense of doom you felt when
the Joker and the Riddler teamed up? That's how I feel watching these
two go off shopping for something hip and sexy.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's Mommy going?" asks the little girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Hunting," I say.</TE>
<TE>   They are gone for hours. My wife calls only to ask that we
transfer laundry from the washer to the dryer and to be sure the
other two kids graduate on time and lead upstanding lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's Mom?" the boy wants to know.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably London," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Shopping?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll be home soon," I lie.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the shoppers return. They carry their loot in thick,
glossy bags, the kind the expensive stores hand out, with soft rope
for handles. Heavy bags worth more than most of my shirts. You could
make an entire baseball bat with the wood used in one of these bags.
You could probably make a chair. Then you'd at least have something
to show for it.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you get leather pants?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't find leather pants in April," my wife explains.</TE>
<TE>   You don't? I never realized leather was so seasonal. Seems to me
you see it all year long.</TE>
<TE>   "When do you find leather?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   "December," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, December. I've always associated leather with
Christmas. Easter is the lingerie holiday. Christmas is for leather.</TE>
<TE>   So we're almost ready to head to the party, where I'll engage in
some of the most inane cocktail party chatter you could ever imagine.
I'll speculate about what's really in California rolls and borrow the
old Woody Allen line on sushi, about not eating anything that's
merely unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   At the party, my wife and I will start out together, drift apart,
then hook up again at the end, a metaphor for marriage overall. On
the way home, she'll sleep a mother's sleep.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom's going to look great," says our older daughter as she pulls
blouses from the shopping bags.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course," I say.</TE>

<HD>Stay in Your Car Long Enough and You Can Lose Your Schlep</HD>

<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not so long ago--and due to circumstances beyond my control--I found
myself walking a mile, maybe two, while carrying three plastic sacks
full of produce, a diaper bag and my medium-sized purse. At the
halfway point, various muscle groups in my neck lodged a formal
complaint, and by the time I got where I was going, my shoulders were
on fire and my wrists were numb. Humiliated, I was forced to admit
the ugly truth--after a dozen years in Los Angeles, I have lost the
ability to schlep.</LD>
<LD>   From the time I made my first solo trek to first-grade, my book
bag and square metal lunch box amiably bumping my knees for five
blocks, I have been an inveterate schlepper. I attended a college
made up of a half-dozen quadrangles and even more far-flung
buildings, and still I tended to take the long way home even when my
backpack bulged with Econ 101 texts and I carried plastic bags with
the still-warm chapters from Kinko's. After that, I moved to New
York.</LD>
<LD>   In New York, schlepping is an art. Kids like me sail through some
Midwestern town and think they can run with the big dogs, and they
are just wrong. I remember the first time I noticed a woman, who
could not have weighed 110 pounds, scuttle by me positively draped
with bags: tote bags and oversized purses, a travel pack and what
looked like a small suitcase. I assumed she was either a photographer
or on her way to the airport.</LD>
<TE>   But then I looked around and realized I was surrounded by these
women, all moving through crowds with a speedy grace that defied the
sacks and satchels hanging from their forms.</TE>
<TE>   After a day or so, I realized these bags were urban necessities.
It made no sense to return to your outer borough apartment after work
only to return to Manhattan for dinner, so women tended to pack for
the day--extra shoes, extra tights, a book or two for the subway,
maybe even a change of clothes if there was a chance you might not
make it back home.</TE>
<TE>   It took a lot of practice, but soon I was darting through crowds
with the best of them, canvas totes and straw Kenyan bags hanging
from every limb. I remember once walking from 69th Street to my Park
Slope apartment--a distance of almost eight miles--while carrying a
purse, a backpack and two shopping bags. It did not seem at all an
odd thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   Now, of course, I have a car, and so I sigh for the glory years
when it was nothing to walk 10 blocks decked out like a Sherpa with
four bags of groceries and my laundry.</TE>
<TE>   Although its very term belies it, there is a beauty to schlepping,
not unlike that of a woman carrying a jug of water on her head. But
after a decade in L.A., it's not just the schlepping muscles that
have atrophied, it's the attitude.</TE>
<TE>   With two children under the age of 5, I do enough bending and
lifting and carrying; certainly, I'm in no danger of becoming a
package-trailing "get that will you, darling?" diva. Part of it, of
course, is age--about the same time you become too old to ask your
friends to help you move, you also become less willing to use your
body as a wheelbarrow.</TE>
<TE>   But mostly, it's L.A. Though I have yet to encounter a truly
laid-back person in this town of double espressos and vibrating
message centers, there is definitely a public luggage limit. Here, no
points are given for the number of straps you unhitch from yourself
when you land at your cubicle.</TE>
<TE>   If New York leans over your shoulder in the morning and says, "You
could probably return those library books on the way to the
movies--you'd only need one more bag," L.A. tosses them in the back
of the car and says with a shrug, "Why schlep?"</TE>

<LD>Satellites to the Rescue</LD>
<LD>   A ship on the ocean is swamped by a giant wave. A small airplane
loses power and crash-lands on a mountain field. A snowmobile in
Alaska breaks a tread and its rider is lost far from civilization.
How do the brave people who rescue folks in peril find out where they
are?</LD>
<LD>   Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking, called SARSAT for
short, uses two types of satellites to help people and even their
pets.</LD>
<TE>   * Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, nicknamed
"GOES," fly in place. They never stray from their spots above Earth.</TE>
<TE>   * Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites, called "POES," are in
constant motion. They orbit Earth several times a day.</TE>
<TE>   The main job of these satellites is to track environmental
conditions around the world. But GOES and POES also hear special
distress signals from ships, planes and individuals. The satellites
send the information to a control center in Suitland, Maryland. The
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, an agency of the
federal government, operates the center. The agency learns who's in
danger and where the emergency is. Then it sends the Coast Guard or
the Air Force to save the day!</TE>
<TE>   SARSAT has helped locate and rescue more than 12,800 people
worldwide and 4,300 people in the United States. The Air Force and
Coast Guard have also rescued dogs and other pets that were traveling
with their families when disaster struck.</TE>
<TE>   Find out more about SARSAT at www.sarsat.noaa.gov. Also check out
the Space Place Web site at spaceplace.nasa.gov/goes/orbits.htm to
learn how these satellites orbit Earth and how GOES can hang over one
spot all the time.</TE>

<HD>Activism Is Part of Fashion Magazine's Makeup</HD>
<DH>Beauty isn't the only cause addressed by Marie Claire--it
also tackles grave issues, getting some readers politically involved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN SANDLER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine a woman sitting in her corner office. Neat stacks of
magazines and windows over Broadway form a backdrop. A mane of long
blond highlights frames her large brown eyes that grow even larger as
she leans forward to stab a finger at a headline in the latest issue
of her magazine. Under the heading "What Women Want," red and black
type asks: "Why Are These Mass Murderers and Rapists Still Free?" A
box on the page appeals to readers to sponsor a survivor of war in
the Balkans or in Rwanda, or to write the White House to insist the
Bush administration cooperate with war crimes tribunals. The page
even lists Web sites for related activist organizations.</LD>
<LD>   The woman in this office could only be Gloria Steinem. Except she
isn't. She's Lesley Jane Seymour, the editor of the top-tier fashion
magazine Marie Claire. Perhaps against all odds, Marie Claire is the
title that women's rights activists often mention when they talk
about what publication has done the most to interest women in
feminist causes over the past few years. However, the magazine never
publishes the f-word. "I use it personally, but I would never put the
word 'feminism' in the magazine," says Seymour, a self-described
feminist in a tight white skirt and pink patent leather sandals with
sky-high heels.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this month in New York, Seymour chaired the anniversary
celebration for Equality Now, an international women's rights
organization, which marked its 10 years of activism with an evening
of feminist performance and speaking. It's unlikely to see a fashion
editor's name printed in a program above ones like Eve Ensler and
Rose Styron, especially one with Seymour's resume. Her career has
bounded through the editorial offices of publications many feminists
view as pinnacles of stiletto-hawking woman-hating --magazines like
Glamour and Vogue.</TE>
<TE>   And indeed, Marie Claire looks no different from any of the
lip-glossy women's titles. But if you scan the cover of each issue,
skimming down the current issue's pitch for articles such as "Men
Confess: What Makes Him Commit--or Not" and the usual "sexy swimsuit"
roundup, you'll find a cover line that seems out of place. It's a
Day-Glo green banner that reads, in color-me-radical language "World
Campaign: Stop War Criminals From Walking Free," a tease for the page
Seymour now turns, exposing an ad for pills that purport to "Increase
Breast Size ... Guaranteed!"</TE>
<TE>   It's just this duality that is the secret of Marie Claire's
success, both as a publication and as a tool for women's rights
activism. Jessica Neuwirth, the president of Equality Now, says that
Marie Claire has brought in more new members over time than any other
source. "Every time they list us as a way for people to take action,
we get a huge response from people who stay with us. And,
importantly, in many cases these are people who weren't previously
aware of those issues."</TE>
<TE>   Because Marie Claire is read by many women who aren't exactly on
Ms. magazine's subscription list, women who buy the magazine for
their seven-year horoscope end up learning about the sex slave trade
in China just by flipping idly past a few cosmetic ads.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of our calls came from high school girls or women who wanted
us to speak at their sorority lunches, women who specifically said
they had read about us in Marie Claire," says Masuda Sultan, a board
member of Women for Afghan Women, one of several groups that saw a
spike in interest after they were listed alongside an April story
about young Afghans prostituting themselves to survive.</TE>
<TE>   Marie Claire has been running this sort of international story in
each issue since its American launch six years ago. After Sept. 11,
scores of readers wrote in that they were the only women they knew
who were well-versed about the Taliban, thanks to the magazine's
previous coverage. And since the fall, when Seymour took over the
editorship from industry iconoclast Glenda Bailey, the magazine now
features a national "reportage" story alongside each international
one.</TE>
<TE>   Seymour is hardly attempting to turn her title into a Ms.
competitor. "We're trying to avoid the taint of old feminism, the
feeling that you have to be on the feminist bus or off it," she says.
And Seymour, who reads e-mail that her readers send her directly,
says they're not exactly looking for a movement rag, just a smarter
beauty magazine. "They're saying, 'Don't throw it in my face--I don't
want to look like an intellectual egghead freak,'" Seymour says. And
yet, in reader polls, it's the news stories that rank highest among
features.</TE>
<TE>   This phenomenon breaks all rules in the magazine industry. While
other women's titles sometimes run some tough stories--especially
since Sept. 11, as has been often noted--Marie Claire is the only
member of the fashionista pack to include monthly international
reporting about something other than, say, Milan's Prada show. It's
certainly the only one with an activist thread that runs though each
issue, from the front-of-the-book "You Need to Know" page that
regularly features political letter-writing campaigns, to the "how to
participate" box alongside each issue story. But the real phenomenon
is this: They're making a fortune doing it.</TE>
<TE>   Steinem herself will tell you that the reason magazines shy away
from what she calls "progressive, feminist reporting" is that
advertisers often refuse to sell lipstick next to stories about
African sex slavery or abortion rights activism. Traditionally, they
have shied away from placement near any story that might be a downer
in these magazines. But if you check out that April feature on Afghan
women, you'll see that Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Miu Miu were happy to be
sandwiched between columns about brutality and heartache. "It's the
opposite of everything you learn in publishing. They want their ads
here because of this. Where else in the world could I put the word
'rape' on the cover? We'd be sunk everywhere else. But this is what
sets us apart. Activism is a selling point."</TE>
<TE>   Seymour says that Marie Claire has become a known quantity for
this type of reporting. And, as an institution, it's always been that
way. Marie Claire debuted in France in 1937, in the mission of mixing
life's harsher realities with beauty and fashion coverage. The
magazine began to spawn international editions, of which there are
now 26, South Africa's being the most political, listing
international stories as the top billboard on each cover. Six years
ago, Bailey, then editor of British Marie Claire, brought the title
stateside with an insistence on maintaining international reporting
in a seemingly unfriendly market. Through Bailey's famously dogged
leadership, Marie Claire quickly carved an identity as a commercial
fashion rag that featured a profile of a Somalian woman who had been
a victim of female genital mutilation.</TE>
<TE>   The commingling of "serious" stories amid the "what's hot now"
pageantry is a reflection of women's reality to some people, and an
abomination to others. Not surprisingly, the notion that a women's
magazine requires beauty tips to make its own identity is anathema to
Andrea Dworkin, author of "Heartbreak: The Political Memoirs of a
Feminist Militant." "Having progressive content is fine, but when I
look at the New Republic or I look at the Nation, I don't see the
same concern for men--that they're worried about their eyebrows being
too thick or the jowls under their chin. There's something about
being assimilated by beauty culture that is nothing but hostility to
women," she says. "And I don't know why they need it."</TE>
<TE>   For pleasure, answers Seymour, who compares her magazines not to
those workhorses of the intelligentsia, but to men's titles. "For
women, the equivalent of sports is beauty, and, just like in men's
magazines, you can still have that equivalent and still be political
and smart," she says. "The thing that drives me nutty is that when it
comes to men's magazines, nobody blinks an eye. But if a women's
magazine has fashion and beauty, then it can't be serious. Why would
we have this tension with women's magazines and not when it comes to
men's magazines?"</TE>
<TE>   Though some feminists recognize the duality, it doesn't faze them.
"A willing reader can handle reading about women in Afghanistan and
still have the quick tips for firming up for before bathing suit
season," says Jennifer Baumgardner, co-author of "Manifesta," a book
about young women and feminism. "That's the thing," she says. "We all
engage on a lot of levels." Julie Shah, a founder of the Third Wave
Foundation, an organization of young feminists, concurs. But though
she's comfortable with fashion and beauty coverage--"That's all
personal, not political; you should see how I dress"--she's
frustrated with how far Marie Claire's stories go. "Like, I wouldn't
call this story deep," she says of the recent Afghan prostitution
story, "and it fits into how the media portrays women as victims. And
that's where my ambivalence lies--they may be opening readers' eyes,
but they could be doing it in a smarter way."</TE>
<TE>   But that's the price of their enormous readership, says
Baumgardner. "Anything they talk about is effective, even if the
message is less advanced in terms of theory and politics--I
appreciate that they have a much broader audience" than traditional
feminist publications, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Raising the quality of the stories is on Seymour's agenda of
gradual change she'd like to make in the magazine, as is slowly
inching their presence onto the cover. Not as the lead, she says, but
certainly higher up. To try to sell the magazine for its serious
content would be isolating, even if it's what readers say is what
they value, she says. And that's best for activists and advertisers
alike, she says. "To reach women, to change the world, you can't just
talk to five women; you need to reach 500,000 women. And Marie Claire
is the doorway to those women," she says. "We give a good dose of
fantasy and reality," she says, flipping past a picture of a
rail-thin model in a $300 Gucci bikini. "It's an incredible car crash
of high and low, or serious and light, and it makes no sense--but
it's working."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories about Sherlock Holmes continue to
inspire an apparently ceaseless flow of what in TV-land would be
labeled spinoffs--adventures featuring each of the great detective's
supporting players, from Dr. Watson down to the once-mentioned
bloodhound Toby. Of these additions, none is quite as audacious as
Laurie R. King's series on the detective's wife, Mary Russell, the
sixth of which is "Justice Hall" (Bantam, 337 pages, $23.95).</LD>
<LD>   The audacity stems from the fact that Doyle made no mention of a
wife. Rather, his cerebral sleuth was famously indifferent to such a
union (save for one chaste fling) if not a closet misogynist. King
adds to the odds against matrimony by portraying Russell as an
ultra-modern woman (for her day), as difficult and opinionated as
Holmes and young enough to be his granddaughter.</LD>
<TE>   She's only 15 when they meet in 1994's "The Beekeeper's
Apprentice," which is set in 1915. King tells us that Holmes is in
his 50s, but in Doyle's "His Last Bow," set in precisely the same
time frame, he was then "a tall, gaunt man of 60." Mary Russell has
barely reached her majority when they fall in love in "A Monstrous
Regiment of Women." Their next two novels, "A Letter to Mary" and
"The Moor," set in 1923-24, have them settled down to wedded life in
Sussex, but book five, "O Jerusalem," carries them back to 1919,
when, still unmarried, they journey to British-occupied Palestine on
spy business.</TE>
<TE>   "Justice Hall," which places the couple in post-"Moor" 1923, is
closely tied to that Holy Land adventure. They discover that the two
vividly rendered Arab guides on that perilous trip, Ali and Mahmoud,
are, in reality, British noble-born cousins named Alistair and Marsh,
working for Holmes' brother, Mycroft. They now seek Sherlock's help
with a family matter concerning heirs and duties of succession.</TE>
<TE>   The mystery element is as complex as the titular estate is vast,
involving a World War I military execution for cowardice in France,
birth claims, skulduggery and, of course, murder. But strangely, the
fun here doesn't come from the unraveling of whodunit, nor from the
incredible deductions of the great detective. This is Mary Russell's
show and whether the remarkably capable lady is describing the
interior of castles and estates, explaining the rules of succession,
putting up with the pettiness of the upper classes and the vulgarity
and deceit of the lower, stalking evildoers or simply making do
without the crime-solving aid of her often-absent spouse, she is
never less than fascinating company.</TE>
<TE>   Sex, Murder, Mayhem and Hidden Treasure</TE>
<TE>   Les Standiford's "Bone Key" (Putnam, 319 pages, $24.95) begins
with a ship sinking off Key West in a storm in 1931. As soon as its
mysterious cargo is transferred to a safe place on shore, a killer,
trusting in the bromide that dead men tell no tales, begins to bump
off all the boat hands. Before he fully completes his task, Mother
Nature intervenes with a torrent and flood that enables a sole seaman
to escape. It shouldn't give away too much of the plot to say that
the survivor is still around in 2002 to fill series hero John Deal in
on the homicidal happening of long ago.</TE>
<TE>   Deal and one of his associates, Russell Straight, have traveled
from his stamping grounds in Miami to Key West for a business meeting
with a powerful contractor who's pretty much the king of the Keys.
The meeting is delayed when Deal and Straight stop a redneck cop from
stomping a young street hustler to death and get thrashed and thrown
in jail for their trouble. Bailed out by the contractor, they barely
begin talking shop when Deal discovers that his long-ago first love
is the big man's mistress. From there, it's a brief sprint to edgy
sex, murder, mayhem and a hidden treasure worth a fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Florida crime writers seem to fall into one of two categories--the
Carl Hiaasen school, in which over-the-top satire sometimes sinks the
suspense, and the school that slavishly duplicates John D.
MacDonald's mixture of unabashed heroism, ultra-sick villainy and
wistful nostalgia for the state's pre-greedhead days. Standiford,
while in the MacDonald camp, wisely eschews the late author's
cynicism for contemporary life and concentrates more on keeping his
hero real while putting him through Travis McGee-like paces.</TE>
<TE>   In "Bone Key," Deal is punched, kicked, shot at, partially
concussed and tossed through glass windows and still has the stamina
for romance and retribution. But the reader is continually reminded
that he is more earthbound than the usual superhero. Estranged from
his wife, he has a young daughter who is never far from his thoughts
and he seems unable to escape the shadow of a larger-than-life father
whose sway over him remains undiminished by death.</TE>
<TE>   The other prominent characters are well-rounded, too, particularly
the powerful and laconic Straight. At book's end, it seems that Deal
will be leaving him behind in Key West, but Standiford, the director
of the creative writing program at Florida International University,
knows what works in fiction and it likely won't be long before the
two are pairing up again.</TE>

<LD>Maria and her younger brother Alfonso are spending the afternoon in
the mountains of Southern California with their Uncle Ruben, who is a
nature guide.</LD>
<LD>   "Today I'm going to show you how to make plaster casts," Uncle
Ruben told them. They looked at each other, puzzled.</LD>
<LD>   "What's that?" Maria asked.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a way of making a record of an animal track," Uncle Ruben
responded, "so first we have to find some animal tracks."</TE>
<TE>   They walked along a trail to a stream where the animals get their
water.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," he said, kneeling down.</TE>
<TE>   The children got on their hands and knees. They saw what looked
like a little handprint in the mud.</TE>
<TE>   "That's from a raccoon," Uncle Ruben informed them. He then
pointed to some tracks that looked like two elongated ovals, side by
side. "Those are made by a deer," Uncle Ruben said. "Now let's make
casts."</TE>
<TE>   From his pack, Uncle Ruben removed a bag of dry plaster, a water
container and two small cups. Into each cup he poured dry plaster and
then water. He gave each of them a small twig and said, "Stir it real
well, until the plaster is soupy."</TE>
<TE>   They mixed until Uncle Ruben said it was done. Maria then poured
her wet plaster into the raccoon track, keeping the plaster just
around the track.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Alfonso poured his plaster into the deer track.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we wait awhile," Uncle Ruben said.</TE>
<TE>   They had lunch and came back in two hours.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben checked to see that the plaster was hard, and then
Maria and Alfonso carefully picked the dirt out from their plaster
casts.</TE>
<TE>   "See," Uncle Ruben said, "you now have a three-dimensional record
of these animals."</TE>
<TE>   "This is great," Alfonso said.</TE>

<HD>Through a Lens, Darkly</HD>
<DH>A bitter conflict is seen anew in rare images captured by
North Vietnamese photographers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Dispatches," his nightmarish memoir of covering the Indochina
War, journalist Michael Herr describes Vietnam as "a dark room full
of deadly objects." Now, nearly 27 years after the war's frantic
finish, another door to that room has swung ajar, revealing not just
a hidden chamber but an entirely new wing, lined from top to bottom
with images that are alternately beautiful and brutal, revealing and
beguiling:</LD>
<LD>   A pair of Viet Cong guerrillas laying mines in the Mekong Delta,
their chiseled faces taut with resolve. A forlorn villager helplessly
cradling a 15-year-old girl's lifeless body. Communist troops
outflanking a desperate squad of South Vietnamese soldiers, probably
recorded in the last few seconds before they died. A young woman
rationing fish sauce to a crowd of North Vietnamese peasants, in a
scene full of quiet luminance as an old Dutch Master painting.</LD>
<LD>   Taken from the new book "Another Vietnam: Pictures of the War From
the Other Side" (National Geographic, $50), these striking images
view the 30-year conflict from the looking-glass perspective of
America's erstwhile enemies, the North Vietnamese. Co-edited by
American photographer Doug Niven, "Another Vietnam" contains many
pictures that have seldom been glimpsed by Western eyes.</LD>
<TE>   Though a few ran in Hanoi newspapers and journals during the war,
many others never were printed, either because they were deemed
technically unexceptional or they didn't fit the Communist
government's propaganda line. The book, Niven says, seeks to
resurrect not only a cache of historic images but the names of the
largely anonymous photographers who made them, names like Vo Anh
Khanh, Mai Loc and Nguyen Dinh Uu.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing I noticed is, after all these movies and all the books
we've read, and all the Time-Life collections of pictures from the
war, I still didn't have a picture of what the enemy looked like. It
was this faceless enemy living in the jungle and it was very
abstract," says Niven, 39, speaking by phone from his Santa Cruz
home. "The wonderful discovery I made was that it wasn't just people
wearing black pajamas."</TE>
<TE>   With the book's publication in February, a war that seemed to have
bequeathed its cultural legacy to posterity decades ago has popped
open like "an enormous Pandora's box," writes Niven's collaborator,
Tim Page, a legendary British-born Vietnam combat photographer. Niven
believes the newly rediscovered photos add a crucial dimension to a
war that was exhaustively covered by Western media at the time and
has since been replayed through pop culture--but almost always from
an American point of view. "The Vietnamese government is still
struggling to arrive at an 'official' version of the war," Niven
says. "Maybe we in America are struggling with the same issue."</TE>
<TE>   By chance, another exhibition of Vietnam War imagery is on view
through June 30 at the Perfect Exposure Gallery in Koreatown. "Nick
Ut: From Hell to Hollywood" examines two sides of the work of veteran
Associated Press photographer Huynh Cong "Nick" Ut, who was born in
what was then South Vietnam but has lived in Los Angeles since 1977.
Splitting its focus between the Indochina War and Ut's frequently
humorous candids of Tinseltown celebrities like Sly Stallone, O.J.
Simpson and Robert Downey Jr., "From Hell to Hollywood" juxtaposes
third-world agony with first-world absurdism.</TE>
<TE>   Included is a haunting series of photos Ut took on the afternoon
of June 8, 1972, in Trang Bang village, 30 miles northwest of Saigon.
Ut witnessed the accidental napalm bombing of Trang Bang by South
Vietnamese pilots and the subsequent flight of refugees from the
fiery destruction. The central figure in his most famous image, which
won a Pulitzer Prize, is of a 9-year-old girl, Kim Phuc, screaming in
pain as she runs naked down a country road.</TE>
<TE>   By many accounts, Ut helped saved Kim Phuc's life by driving her
to a doctor for help. The two subsequently became close friends,
touring the world together to talk about the photo and the events
that produced it. She calls me 'Uncle Nick,'" says Ut, 51, a
friendly, unassuming man who still carries around shrapnel fragments
in his left leg. "Sometimes I look at her picture, I cry by myself."
Despite the trauma of those years, Ut says, he'd like to cover the
current war in Afghanistan. "But it's too cold for me. Plus today the
pictures are like propaganda. I don't think you see any more pictures
like the Vietnam War."</TE>
<TE>   For many who experienced it directly, the Vietnam War is like a
delayed-fuse bomb that detonates long after its initial hit,
exploding across space and time. And to the hundreds of thousands of
South Vietnamese immigrants living in Southern California, the war is
no artistic abstraction. For them, every image of the conflict is
politically loaded, a painful reminder of friends and family lost,
homes destroyed, lives torn apart.</TE>
<TE>   Some vowed that the war's "ghosts" would be laid to rest by
Grenada, by Panama, by Operation Desert Storm. Instead they rose
again after Sept. 11 in the debate over whether the deserts of
Afghanistan might morph into another American military "quagmire."
Vietnam is a war whose next chapter is constantly being rewritten,
whose photographic icons, even now, are being reshuffled and
reedited.</TE>
<TE>   That's not surprising, according to Susan D. Moeller, a University
of Maryland journalism professor. In her book "Shooting War:
Photography and the American Experience of Combat" (Basic Books,
1989), Moeller writes that at least since the Spanish-American War,
still photography has bared "the essence of war for Americans." Even
in today's media climate of sound-bite saturation and 24-7 video
streaming, she argues, still photographs retain a unique ability to
encapsulate the way we experience and remember wars. "Still
photography has contributed the most icons of war to our
consciousness," Moeller writes. "Photography ... transports war into
the safety and intimacy of our living rooms ... it brings war home."</TE>
<TE>   To American viewers, the photos in "Another Vietnam" may seem to
have arrived through a time warp, beyond the black hole of our
omniscient media culture. While a number of images had been preserved
by the Vietnam News Agency and its successor, the Vietnam Artistic
Photographers Assn., many others were stashed away in closets and old
ammunition cases or stuffed under sinks. If the photographer bothered
to preserve his work at all, it was likely to be some faded,
yellowing prints or a handful of negatives tucked in a plastic bag.
Niven says he had to "sit and drink a lot of tea" with the
photographers before they'd trust him and open their scrapbooks.</TE>
<TE>   North Vietnamese photographers shared many obstacles with their
Western equivalents, Niven says, including censorship and the
constant threat of being booby-trapped or blown away. But they had
additional problems. Instead of lightweight Nikons and Leicas, most
hauled around bulky, 1940s vintage Kodak press cameras, or East
German models with a single fixed lens. Film was always scarce, and
unlike their Western counterparts they couldn't hop a helicopter back
to their editorial offices.</TE>
<TE>   One photographer judiciously made a single roll of film last the
entire war. Another, Nguyen Dinh Uu, rode his bicycle back and forth
between Hanoi and the Demilitarized Zone that formerly separated
North and South Vietnam, logging hundreds of round-trip miles while
dodging bullets and bomb craters. As far as formal training, Niven
says, the photographers ran the gamut from those who'd trained in
Moscow or Eastern Europe to those who'd barely picked up a camera
before.</TE>
<TE>   "A number of these guys were familiar with composition and
lighting and contrast," Niven says. "So when they saw a situation
that had those elements and also the elements of war and telling a
story, they wanted all those elements to work together at the same
time."</TE>
<TE>   Those formal skills unite impressively in images such as Le Minh
Truong's pictures of NVA troops descending a cliffside stairway in
Quang Binh Province, or ascending a canyon through shafts of sunlight
in the Truong Son Mountains, along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. They're
also present in Vo Anh Khanh's stunning print of a makeshift Viet
Cong operating theater in a mangrove swamp, an image whose grave
subject matter is softened by its exquisite half-tones and almost
hallucinatory composition.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the photos are unabashedly propagandistic--smiling
peasants serenading troops, young women making lethal booby
traps--meant to illustrate the Communist narrative of a national war
of liberation. "North Vietnamese images are really in that sort of
communist socialist-realist tradition," professor Moeller says. "They
look so mannered and studied to our eyes."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Moeller says, many early images of the war made
by Western photographers were "literally wrapped in the flag." "You
have stories told by Larry Burrows of photos he was forced to take
for Life magazine, of making the American flag really prominent in
pictures of U.S. boats going up and down the Mekong."</TE>
<TE>   From the 130 images in "Another Vietnam," Niven says, he hopes
that a few "will be added to our collective memory," images on a par
with those by Western photographers that are pinned to America's
moral consciousness: Malcolm Browne's 1963 photo of a Buddhist monk
setting fire to himself to protest the war; Eddie Adams' picture of a
South Vietnamese general executing a Viet Cong prisoner on a Saigon
street during the 1968 Tet offensive; or Ut's photo of Kim Phuc.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a good five pictures in this book that deserve to
be put on the same icon level," Niven says. "That was one of my goals
from the beginning, because I think many of these pictures are as
good as their counterparts." But others might prefer to see those
images stay buried.</TE>
<TE>   On a late spring afternoon in East L.A., Gilbert Guyenne welcomes
a reporter to his business, Mimosa Nursery, a bower of exotic fruit
trees, water plants and caged Asian singing birds spread under a row
of power lines. "If something is involved with the North Vietnamese
we stay away," says Guyenne, who was born Nguyen Dung Tien in the
former South Vietnam, fled the country when Saigon fell to the
communists in 1975 and is the author of two novels dealing with
Vietnamese history, "Mercenaries" and "Black Gold."</TE>
<TE>   Seated at a low concrete bench with his co-worker Ho Dang, who
worked as a photographer for the South Vietnamese army during the
war, Guyenne gingerly flips through a copy of "Another Vietnam,"
never letting his eyes linger for more than a second or two. Ho Dang,
who says he knows Ut, describes the Kim Phuc image "a true picture, a
true story."</TE>
<TE>   "But recently the North Vietnamese used that picture [to get] more
sympathy for the Vietnamese people, that a bad thing happened to the
Vietnamese people," Ho Dang protests. "We are journalists, so we
respect the truth. What really bothers me is if someone tries to bend
the picture. That really hurts me, that really bothers me."</TE>
<TE>   Smiling and shaking the reporter's hand, Ho Dang says he must get
back to work. "He is not upset," Guyenne insists. "We are not upset
at all." But a few minutes later Ho Dang wanders back. "I'm too
emotional," he says. "I can't do my job."</TE>
<TE>   Tapping the book with his finger, he faces the reporter with a
look of pained finality. "I have a question," he says. Suppose an
image went out from Afghanistan of another young girl like Kim Phuc,
a victim of a U.S. bombing raid. "Now how would you feel if Osama bin
Laden said, 'The American people have to take responsibility for
that?' So that's a real picture, but Osama bin Laden made the picture
like more and more important, try to take advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "My question is, how do you feel? And do you think the American
people will be happy to see it?"</TE>
<TE>   Ho Dang's eyes are red. Somewhere, a door closes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>'West Wing' Hails the Real-Life Chiefs</HD>
<DH>Television* In tonight's episode, billed as a
'documentary,' political figures discuss their time in the White
House.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bartlet is taking the night off, but Presidents Clinton,
Ford and Carter will be standing in for him.</LD>
<LD>   Billed as a "documentary" tonight, NBC's hit drama "The West Wing"
takes an unusual form, featuring interviews with the aforementioned
former presidents as well as Nixon administration Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger and former White House staffers like Clinton aide
Chris Engskov, upon whom the character of aide Charlie Young (Dule
Hill) is loosely based.</LD>
<LD>   "We were interested in their feelings about that period of their
lives when they were in the West Wing," said Thomas Schlamme, one of
the show's executive producers, who directed the episode. "We didn't
want a sound bite or a scoop. There was nothing surprising other than
how human it all is, which is the essence of our show."</LD>
<TE>   The interviews were shot over the past two months by Bill
Couturie, who won an Oscar for his 1989 feature documentary about the
AIDS quilt, "Common Threads: Stories From the Quilt," and was
nominated for an Oscar for his 1991 short subject documentary
"Memorial: Letters From American Soldiers." Couturie and his crew met
with Carter in Atlanta, Clinton in Harlem and Ford in Rancho Mirage.</TE>
<TE>   The crew also spent several days in Washington this last winter,
camped out less than two blocks from the White House in
Constitutional Hall, interviewing Karl Rove, President Bush's
right-hand man, as well as Democratic strategist Paul Begala and
former White House spokespeople Marlin Fitzwater and Dee Dee Myers,
both of whom now serve as consultants on "The West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   Myers, who was the first to sit for the 90-minute session with
Couturie, said the interviews reflect a consistent theme among West
Wing staffers, regardless of administration, party or ideology.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in the White House, you think you've done something
that no one else has done. In a way, that's true, no one's won the
election you have. But you end up learning painful lessons, and
there's a process of rebuilding," she said. "When you work there you
think the whole world revolves around what the president has to say
that day. When you leave, you realize that's not at all true."</TE>
<TE>   Fitzwater, who served as press secretary during the Reagan and
Bush administrations for a 10-year span beginning in 1983, spent more
than an hour with Couturie in winter but on Monday said he was not
sure which of his recollections, if any, made the final cut.</TE>
<TE>   "I told stories about the briefing with my Soviet counterpart
during the arms control talks and what it was like to warn CNN that
they might be in danger if they stayed in Baghdad" during the Persian
Gulf War, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In similar fashion, Engskov, who was 27 when he became an aide to
Clinton and spent seven years in the White House, said he put off
telling his mother about his participation in the special episode
until Tuesday, fearing his interview wouldn't make it into the show.</TE>
<TE>   Now in its third season, the Emmy Award-winning show remains a
ratings giant for NBC, drawing more than 17 million viewers each
Wednesday, the kind of reach that gives series creator Aaron Sorkin
tremendous freedom at the network. Tonight's "Documentary Special"
marks the second time he has leveraged the program's ratings heat to
deviate from its usual format. On Oct. 3, he reacted to the terrorism
of Sept. 11 with a special episode in which the characters delivered
detailed monologues on the history of terrorism, Islamic
fundamentalism and racism. The show's opening credits were replaced
with phone numbers for charities benefiting victims of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary is broken into four segments, each with a distinct
theme. For the most part, Schlamme said, the titles were phrases
lifted from one of the interviews, like "Mt. Rushmore," the heading
for a block of interviews that deal with power. It was taken from
White House advisor David Gergen's opinion that there is a certain
hubris to every new president, and that each newly elected commander
in chief invariably thinks "that there is room for one more head on
Mt. Rushmore."</TE>
<TE>   "The West Wing" airs tonight at 9 on NBC. The network has rated it
TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<HD>Injecting Life Into a Familiar Boogeyman</HD>
<DH>Movies* The latest 'Friday the 13th' installment puts Jason
in outer space in the year 2455. But his creator says the slasher
series' future is limited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK DAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1979, movie producer Sean S. Cunningham was struggling to support
his family and pay the rent. The modest success he'd had seven years
earlier with Wes Craven's "Last House on the Left" had evaporated,
and he was failing to find distribution for a children's soccer
comedy he'd made.</LD>
<LD>   Cunningham made a list of titles that would make the film more
appealing to potential buyers. One of those titles was "Friday the
13th." He couldn't use it for his soccer comedy but, believing that
any movie with a title like that would sell, Cunningham took out a
full-page ad in Variety announcing the start of "the most terrifying
film ever made." He had no money, no script and absolutely no idea
what the film would be about.</LD>
<LD>   "This was just a potboiler. [It] was just going to pay the rent
until my soccer movie really took off," Cunningham says from the
patio of his Encino home. "It turned out just the reverse was the
case."</LD>
<TE>   Although the soccer movie has never seen the light of day, "Friday
the 13th," the story of a group of teenagers butchered one by one
while staying at a remote summer camp, grossed more than $100 million
worldwide when it was released in May 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Made on a budget of $500,000, it was one of the most profitable
films of the year and became, along with "Halloween," one of the
defining films of the 1980s horror subgenre known as the slasher
movie. A seemingly never-ending stream of sequels followed, the
latest of which, "Jason X," will be released Friday by New Line
Cinema.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham "wasn't creatively interested or passionate about
making a 'Friday the 13th, Part 10,'" "Jason X" director James Isaac
says. "What did excite him was the concept that it doesn't have to be
a certain thing. You can take this franchise and make anything you
want out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Not wanting to get bogged down in the repetition that had nearly
choked the life out of the concept, Cunningham, Isaac and
screenwriter Todd Farmer tossed around new ideas for the series and
its star, hockey mask-wearing killer Jason Voorhees. The idea they
settled on: Jason in outer space.</TE>
<TE>   Set in the year 2455, "Jason X" transplants the requisite group of
teenagers from the traditional summer camp setting to the
now-abandoned planet Earth, where they discover Jason's cryogenically
frozen body.</TE>
<TE>   After taking him on board their spaceship, they head for home.
Along the way, Jason thaws and gruesome deaths naturally ensue.
Although teenagers are ostensibly the heroes of the films, it's no
secret that the fans are rooting for Jason and measure the success of
each installment by the manner in which he dispatches his victims.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason X," with a higher body count than any other film in the
series, will be difficult to top. Several of the deaths--involving
liquid nitrogen, an extra-large drill bit and other tools--are
showstoppers, but at a time when even commercials boast amazing
special effects, severed heads don't have the same effect they once
had.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't rely on the circus of special effects anymore,"
Cunningham says. "You can only compete with the unexpected story."</TE>
<TE>   In that respect, the filmmakers accept that they headed down a
worn path. In the 22 years since the first "Friday's" release, the
relatively limited idea of the slasher film has been deconstructed
("Scream"), parodied ("Scary Movie") and thoroughly run into the
ground (multiple sequels to "Friday the 13th," "Nightmare on Elm
Street" and "Halloween").</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to change the principal reason that people go to
the" movies, Cunningham acknowledges. "But you could certainly dress
it up and make it look different and better and treat it with a
little more respect."</TE>
<TE>   For the daunting task of giving Jason a face-lift, Cunningham
hired a relatively untried director--albeit one with impressive
credentials--to helm the $13.5-million feature. Isaac, a longtime
visual effects man for decidedly highbrow horror director David
Cronenberg, brought along several members of Cronenberg's creative
staff, notably Academy Award-winning makeup effects artist Stephan
Dupuis and even Cronenberg, in a cameo role. Their participation
wasn't guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   "I called a few people that I'd worked with," Isaac explains. "I
said, 'I've got this project and I want to direct it.' And they're
excited. They say, 'What is it?' and I said, 'It's "Friday the 13th
Part 10."'" Enthusiasm disintegrated into "wait a minute."</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham tries to distance himself from many of the negative
connotations associated with "Friday the 13th." After the success of
the first film, he says, he wanted nothing more to do with dead
teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very innocent in the business," he says. "I didn't want to
keep making 'Friday the 13th' over and over again. I didn't realize
what people wanted was more of the same."</TE>
<TE>   Without Cunningham, producer Frank Mancuso Jr. gave the public
what it wanted. Again and again. Between 1980 and 1989, eight
"Friday" pictures were released to steadily diminishing returns.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham eventually got the rights back in the early '90s in the
hopes of collaborating with his old friend Craven, the director of
"Last House," on a film starring their creations, Jason and Craven's
Freddy Krueger of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent a long weekend trying to think up what the concept would
be and I just could not figure out anything that wouldn't be 'Abbott
and Costello Meet Frankenstein,'" Craven says.</TE>
<TE>   "They're both villains. You can't have them against each other
without wanting to root for one or the other, and I don't know who
you'd want to root for there."</TE>
<TE>   While "Freddy Vs. Jason" languished in development, Cunningham
produced "Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday" instead. The film
grossed only $15 million domestically, and it looked as if lack of
interest would succeed in doing to Jason what axes, guns, drowning
and toxic waste had failed to do.</TE>
<TE>   "The Jason budgets have been getting smaller and smaller," Isaac
says. "Eventually the franchise will die out and become one of those
franchises that go right to video. My feeling was: Let's treat it
like a real movie. Let's not just default to the lowest common
denominator. If you approach a movie like you're going to do a
low-budget slasher, then that's what you end up with."</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham is also determined to take the high road. "We
consciously decided not to be self-deprecating or self-referential.
We're not making fun of the genre or the people in it or the people
who like it." Longtime fans of the series, those who enjoy, as
Cunningham tactfully puts it, "more circus than story," won't need to
worry too much: All involved concede they're not doing "2001" here.</TE>
<TE>   Kane Hodder, the stuntman-turned-actor who has played Jason more
times than anyone else and probably feels the deepest connection with
the character (he has the word "kill" tattooed inside his lower lip),
doesn't think the changes are too dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   "People were concerned at the beginning--'Oh, it's Jason in
space,'" he said. "But if Jason's still the same, then who cares
where it happens?"</TE>
<TE>   The gamble seems to be paying off, in anticipation anyway. At the
official "Friday the 13th" Web site (where the discussion topics have
titles such as "Jason: Feeding on Fear?" and "The Adventures of the
Hockey Mask: A Look at the History of Jason's Famous Mask"), the fans
seem split.</TE>
<TE>   Although some don't appreciate their favorite boogeyman's being
tinkered with, most seem willing to support the film no matter where
he goes. As one clear-eyed poster puts it, "This may be disappointing
to a number of fans [who] would like to remember Jason as the
menacing woodsman, but the Jason of today is the only Jason we've
got."</TE>
<TE>   Development continues on "Freddy Vs. Jason," although it seems
they're closer to a rumble than ever. Cunningham hopes to start
shooting by the end of the year. After that, Jason's days (or at
least Cunningham's involvement in them) may be numbered.</TE>
<TE>   "Horror films are meant and designed for younger people, certainly
younger than I," says the 60-year-old producer. "The central issue
[they] deal with is fear of untimely death. I'm not worried about
untimely death anymore. I'm worried about timely death."</TE>
<TE>   "Jason Goes to Tampa" anyone?</TE>

<LD>Maybe it was the cannoli.</LD>
<LD>   If so, it wouldn't be the first time a man lost his head over the
crisp, delicate pastry shells stuffed with sweet mascarpone filling
and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Didn't "The Godfather's" Clemenza
urge an underling who had just carried out his kill order to "leave
the gun, take the cannoli"?</LD>
<LD>   When filmmaker Adam Rifkin became acquainted with Donnie
Montemarano and his home-cooked Italian dishes at a Monday night
football party more than a year ago, he fell under a spell. It was as
if the indie director had met muse and dream chef rolled into one.
Week after week he returned to Montemarano's kitchen, where the
63-year-old charismatic cook, onetime capo in an organized crime
syndicate on New York's East Side and former federal convict,
entertained with food and war stories.</LD>
<TE>   The pasta puttanesca was good, but the banter was better. Whether
Montemarano and his boyhood pal Vinny Argiro, 62, set out to argue
politics, reminisce about growing up on the same street in Brooklyn's
Park Slope neighborhood or debate the merits of L.A. pastry shops,
their dialogue crackled with the kind of pizazz screenwriters dream
about.</TE>
<TE>   "I came for the food, but the company was so good that I kept
coming back," Rifkin remembers. It soon occurred to him that
Montemarano and Argiro were two characters in search of their own
movie.</TE>
<TE>   They now have it in "Night at the Golden Eagle," a stylish
neo-noir film that Rifkin wrote, directed and co-financed with
producer and fellow gourmand Steve Bing. In the film, which opens
Friday in limited release, Montemarano and Argiro play fictional
characters loosely inspired by their real selves, and their chemistry
on screen lends a lived-in charm to an otherwise intensely dark
picture.</TE>
<TE>   Montemarano makes a remarkable debut as Tommy, an ex-con
protagonist all too eager to stumble back on the wrong side of the
law on the day of his release from prison. He's the kind of guy who
can only play roughhouse and wreaks havoc on all those around him,
especially his reformed lifelong buddy Mic, played by Argiro. The
story unfolds against the backdrop of the title's Golden Eagle, a
crack-house hotel in downtown L.A. where ghosts of faded Hollywood
glamour, pimping and murder are all among one night's attractions.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent spring afternoon, the two leading men, the director
and the co-producer converged in Montemarano's sunny Art Deco
apartment in Westwood to talk about the movie. The setting was the
well-stocked kitchen where "Night at the Golden Eagle" was hatched.</TE>
<TE>   For most movie casts, reunions are rare, but in this case it was
the replay of a weekly ritual: Montemarano and Argiro cooking and
swapping repartee, with Rifkin and Bing piping up every now and then,
but for the most part, eating and listening.</TE>
<TE>   Scene: Montemarano is in the throes of preparing what everybody
agrees is a "low-key" lunch, which comes with four courses and
dessert. Below a battery of copper pots lined on the shelves of the
kitchen cabinet, a large cooking stove has five burners going. Out of
the industrial-size fridge, Montemarano whips out a bag of turkey
sausages, fresh cuts of salmon and Chilean sea bass. He juggles the
pots with the panache of a chef, even though his hands are sometimes
unsure and things almost slip out of his grip.</TE>
<TE>   Montemarano (stirring sauce in a monstrously large pan): "I never
acted a day in my life. I had no idea I could act."</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin: "I told him, 'Did you see the movie "Babe"? That pig
looked like a good actor, didn't he? You and Vinny are natural
actors, just like the pig in "Babe."'"</TE>
<TE>   Montemarano: "I would just listen for my cue to come up. I was
oblivious to everything else going on in a scene.</TE>
<TE>   Argiro: "If I wanted to trip him up, I would say the script lines
in my own words, and he would lose it."</TE>
<TE>   Rifkin (nibbling on French baguette topped with slivers of Fontina
cheese and salami): "Donnie didn't realize he was acting, but in fact
he was."</TE>
<TE>   Montemarano: "That's because my character in this movie was easy.
Do I know how to curse? Yes! Do I know how to yell? Yes! Really, it's
just, 'Say the words!' A lot of words, if you ask me."</TE>
<TE>   The scene continues until all the cooking is done and everybody
files into the dining room to eat.</TE>
<TE>   Montemarano towers at the head of the table. He looks fit in spite
of the array of health troubles that have plagued him since
childhood. He wears glasses with a thin gold frame, a gold watch and
a gold necklace. His hair is thinning, but he has powerful arms. A
faded tattoo peeks from under the sleeve of his Taj Mahal concert
T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Only in the five years since he's been out of prison has
Montemarano begun going to rock concerts. He even checked out the
Rolling Stones on their last U.S. tour, and you know what? He enjoyed
it.</TE>
<TE>   In his earlier years, Montemarano was involved with the Colombo
family, one of New York's organized crime clans. According to
mid-'80s court documents, he rose to the rank of crew leader, or
capo, under don Carmine Persico, and was known by the underworld
moniker Donny Shacks. Tried in 1987 on charges of extorting money
from New York City construction companies, he spent more than a
decade in federal prisons serving part of an 18-year racketeering
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   It was behind bars that Montemarano took up cooking. He would fry
onions and steam broccoli in his cell, on the back of an iron turned
upside down.</TE>
<TE>   "Cooking took my mind off where I was," he says with a sigh. "It's
a joy to cook food and see people enjoy it." Yet he cannot enjoy it
much anymore. He's on a special diet because of longtime heart
troubles--which was why the day's menu was steamed fish for himself
and pan-fried turkey sausage for guests. He lost his bladder in 1985,
and a bout with cancer in prison proved so debilitating that it
resulted in Montemarano's early release on probation in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if he drew on experience to play the small-potatoes
ex-con in "Night at the Golden Eagle," Montemarano said all Tommy and
he had in common was a prolonged stint "on vacation." He certainly
didn't share his character's basic philosophy. "This guy was robbing
gas stations and stealing cars. He was a low-class criminal; he made
$2,500 a week," Montemarano says, wincing in distaste. "He wasn't in
the Mafia."</TE>
<TE>   "But both you and Vinny said that you knew guys like that,"
director Rifkin interjected, and Montemarano agreed that they did.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Montemarano is reluctant to discuss his onetime
connection with the mob and looks almost pained by any mention of it.
That's because he made a break with his past, he declares; now he
sticks to the roles of father, grandparent, friend and host in real
life, and breaks the law only on screen.</TE>
<TE>   If trouble seems to seek out the character Montemarano plays in
the movie, it has clung to the actor himself.</TE>
<TE>   Montemarano landed back in jail last year for allegedly violating
the conditions of his parole. After four months in custody, he was
released on bail at a February hearing where "Golden Eagle"
co-producer Bing carted a prototype of the movie's poster to court
and showed it to the judge. For the time being, Montemarano whiles
away in his apartment, where he has been under house arrest,
awaiting, his lawyer explained, a resolution to his pending charges.</TE>
<TE>   Montemarano may be grounded, but his acting career is taking off.
Casting agents have gotten word of his performance in "Night at the
Golden Eagle," according to Bing, who says, "Donnie's been terrific,
and he and Vinny will surely be in more of our projects. It's been a
second career for someone in his 60s, and he's still shocked about it
himself."</TE>
<TE>   Shocked maybe, but not averse to it. "Being in a movie was such
fun," Montemarano says. He enjoyed the ambience on the set, which was
familial and relaxed. "I never worked a day in my life, and I was
there 17 hours a day," he quips.</TE>
<TE>   His own taste in movies favors old Hollywood pictures like "Gunga
Din" and "Goodbye, Mr. Chips," and John Wayne flicks. As for Francis
Ford Coppola's seminal Mafia trilogy, Argiro says, "I can recite
every line from 'The Godfather' I and II. 'The Godfather' III, I
refuse to watch again."</TE>
<TE>   "'GoodFellas' was terrible! How can you root for a rat?" he
marvels.</TE>
<TE>   Having finished the main courses, the table seems ready to debate
the truly important matters. Like who portrays mobsters best in the
movies. "The best Mafia guys are played by Jewish men like James
Caan," proclaims Montemarano. (Caan has a cameo role in the film.)</TE>
<TE>   How about Al Pacino?</TE>
<TE>   He's good all right, accedes Montemarano, "but he also made a good
cop in 'Serpico'!" Pacino's record as cinematic mobster is thus
deemed inconclusive, and with that, the assembly attacks dessert:
cannoli shipped from a Brooklyn pastry shop that has been stored in
the freezer and thawed to delicious, airy perfection.</TE>

<HD>Material Weighs Down Triple Helix's Strengths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Boston-based piano trio Triple Helix, founded in 1995, is clearly
something special. Pianist Lois Shapiro, violinist Bayla Keyes and
cellist Rhonda Rider have a splendid musical chemistry going for
them, with virtually perfect dynamic balance, a firm collective sense
of rhythm, and fervor and authority when needed.</LD>
<LD>   That said, Triple Helix's concert in LACMA's Bing Theater on
Monday night--the first of two programs this week--was uneven in
quality, but for that, blame some of the material, not the committed
performers.</LD>
<LD>   Neither of the Triple Helix commissions by two composers from the
Boston area, Arlene Zallman and Lee Hyla, struck any sparks upon
first hearing. Zallman's three-movement Trio "Triquetra" veered from
a relatively severe atonal opening movement toward a scherzo/trio
that had faint echoes of Bartok.</LD>
<TE>   But at least this piece had some discernable shape, whereas Hyla's
one-movement Piano Trio (a world premiere) was an incoherent
succession of disconnected, sometimes abrasive and obsessive
episodes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Triple Helix had no trouble with Bright Sheng's imaginative
Four Movements for Piano Trio, in which Chinese folk influences meet
Stravinsky-like energy and percussiveness head on, producing a
viable, vital third stream all its own. At the evening's close,
Triple Helix unfurled its conception of Shostakovich's devastating
wartime Piano Trio No. 2, with an effectively scrappy edge in the
Scherzo, a heavyset yet not quite brutal pace in the Klezmer-streaked
finale, and a cool, neutral, almost demoralized bleakness elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Triple Helix plays an all-Beethoven program tonight at 8 in the
L.A. County Museum of Art's Bing Theater, 5905 Wilshire Blvd. $5-15.

<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 1960s, when the average U.S. household received a mere handful
of TV channels, a popular show reminded viewers to tune in next week,
"Same 'Bat-time,' same 'Bat-channel.'"</LD>
<LD>   Yet today, the buzz in television has become less about adhering
to regimented schedules than serving a ready-when-you-are programming
buffet--making a single show available almost immediately at
different times, on multiple channels.</LD>
<LD>   Television's new math is increasingly rooted in this concept of
instant reruns, tailor-made to people who can't be bothered to set
the VCR, or who don't have the time or inclination to be locked into
that same-time, same-station routine. Although the strategy is not
new (HBO plays its series up to four times a week), it appears to be
taking hold more firmly than ever before. Consider Fox's serialized
drama "24," which the network broadcast twice a week for an extended
stretch in addition to repeating it on the FX cable channel.</LD>
<TE>   Other examples include "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit" playing
on USA after NBC, ABC's daytime series "The View" joining A&amp;E's
prime-time lineup, the WB network's "Charmed" repeating on TNT and
plans for next-day reruns of NBC's "Late Night With Conan O'Brien"
this fall on Comedy Central. In fact, ABC parent Disney justified its
pricey acquisition of the cable channel since-christened ABC Family
in part because it creates a second venue to repeat such ABC shows as
"Alias" and "According to Jim."</TE>
<TE>   Prone to obscuring their actions behind a veil of gobbledygook, TV
executives have coined various unwieldy terms to describe this
practice, from "repurposing" (which sounds like something birds do
when feeding their young) to "multiplexing," which is only slightly
more accurate but at least more appetizing.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the jargon, the concept represents a decidedly low-tech
solution to the problem of rising programming costs--namely, find a
few shows that people like and run the sprockets off them within days
of the network premiere to bring in more money right away.</TE>
<TE>   Some will doubtless conclude this amounts to much ado about
nothing, a second chance to watch series you made a point of missing
in the first place. Still, with potential viewers juggling busier
lives and more leisure-time options--combined with people's
diminished willingness to blithely sit through reruns in the summer,
as they did when the major networks were the only game in town--some
executives characterize the shift as a fundamental concession to
changing lifestyles and viewing patterns.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to find a way to make television more convenient and more
consumer-friendly," said Jamie Kellner, chief executive of Turner
Broadcasting, who oversees the WB (a network part-owned by Tribune
Co., owner of the Los Angeles Times) as well as AOL Time Warner's
basic cable channels. "Nobody else puts it on once and says you have
to be there."</TE>
<TE>   The odd part about this new formula is that it has such an
old-fashioned feel to it, running counter to assumptions that Space
Age technology will revolutionize television. Among these innovations
are personal video recorders such as TiVo and Replay, devices that
make it far easier to digitally save and record programs for later
viewing (as opposed to fiddling with videotapes), inspiring TiVo's
Burger King-like slogan, "TV your way."</TE>
<TE>   Another long-awaited promise is "video on demand," which would
transform television into a sort-of video jukebox, allowing viewers
to punch up whatever program they wanted to see--perhaps for a small
fee--whenever they wanted to see it.</TE>
<TE>   It all sounds fabulous, but at present personal video recorders
are found in less than 1% of U.S. homes, with market leader TiVo
reporting a subscriber base of 380,000. In addition, many within the
industry remain skeptical of video on demand, seeing any widespread
adoption as being years and years away--which is pretty much what
they were saying about it years and years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Far from being forward-gazing and gadget-driven, multiplexing
seems more suited to technophobic types who still can't set the time
on their VCRs--as well as a financial throwback to the aforementioned
'60s, when independent TV stations possessed little money to buy
programming. Born out of necessity, as a result, was the
"Million-Dollar Movie," where stations like Channel 9 in Los Angeles
ran the same film every night of the week, until you were expecting
"King Kong" to commandeer a plane, grab Fay Wray and high-tail it
back to his island.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Bell, president of Irvine-based Freedom Broadcasting, which
owns several network-affiliated TV stations, explained the idea then
was to add up rating points to sell sponsors--just as the current
strategy relies on accumulating audiences through multiple telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   "All of that stuff we used to do, because we had to" is being done
again now, Bell noted, "to compensate for the way the audience has
dispersed."</TE>
<TE>   There are bugs to work out in this approach, among them coming to
terms with actors, writers and directors generally convinced (not
without reason) that their share of profits is diluted by
strip-mining hit programs--TV's most precious renewable resource--for
short-term gain. It's also unclear whether too many repeats undermine
ratings on the main network--siphoning viewers from the Tuesday
airing of "24," say, who know they can catch the cable telecast.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, research thus far suggests that encore showings of
programs such as "Charmed" bring in additional viewers who might not
tune in otherwise. And as Kellner points out, most series today reach
a relatively small percentage of the population, increasing the
likelihood that repeats will be fresh to an audience that in the
average U.S. home gets to choose from among 80-plus
channels--including "Batman" reruns, appropriately enough, which take
wing again beginning Monday on TV Land.</TE>
<TE>   "New viewers are getting to see these programs," Kellner said.
"That has to be good for the business."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but it's hardly the futuristic scenario many envisioned.
Instead, TV's corporate crusaders appear armed not with some belt
full of high-tech gizmos, but rather the dynamic duo of extra channel
space no one can afford to fill and a trusty old remote control.</TE>

<LD>   Keillor Opera Targets Marital Monotony</LD>
<LD>   Garrison Keillor, host of public radio's "A Prairie Home
Companion," has written an opera that is set to premiere May 24 in
concert with Minnesota's St. Paul Chamber Orchestra.</LD>
<TE>   The story of a tax man and his teacher-wife trying to instill
romance into their marriage, "Mr. and Mrs. Olson" will be presented
at the Ordway Center for the Performing Arts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's May," Keillor told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. "He is
thinking about the lawn. She is thinking about divorce. In search of
companionship, or something, she goes into an online chat room and,
there, meets a man whose mind appeals to her--his thoughts about
living life boldly and hurling yourself forward, though you know
you'll make mistakes and hurt people."</TE>
<TE>   The opera will star local soprano Maria Jette, who's a regular on
Keillor's radio show, along with mezzo-soprano Alexandra Hughes,
tenor Mark Thomsen, baritone Robert Orth and bass Brian Jauhianen.
Andy Stein, resident violinist on "A Prairie Home Companion," wrote
and arranged the music.</TE>

<TE>   'Soprano' Actor Pleads Guilty to Petty Larceny</TE>
<TE>   Robert Iler, who plays the rebellious, pot-smoking son of mob boss
Tony Soprano on HBO's "The Sopranos," pleaded guilty Tuesday to
mugging two youths and stealing $40.</TE>
<TE>   Iler, 17, admitted to misdemeanor petty larceny in return for a
sentence of three years' probation. He was granted youthful offender
status, and his record will be sealed. A co-defendant, Alban Selimaj,
17, entered the same plea.</TE>
<TE>   The two were originally charged with second-degree robbery for the
incident July 4. A conviction on that charge carries a penalty of up
to 15 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Bonet a No-Show</TE>
<TE>   for 'Cosby' Reunion</TE>
<TE>   One member of the Huxtable family won't be attending next month's
reunion of "The Cosby Show." Lisa Bonet, who played teenage daughter
Denise Huxtable on the NBC sitcom from 1984 to 1991, said she turned
down the offer to take part because she thought the new program
lacked artistic merit.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole experience and energy behind it felt disingenuous and
motivated by corporate profit," the 34-year-old actress told People
magazine. "I was not feeling the love. It was a take-it-or-leave-it,
with-or-without-you offer, and I felt devalued and disrespected."</TE>
<TE>   NBC said Bonet wasn't participating because she was too busy. The
May 19 special, "The Cosby Show: A Look Back," will include clips and
taped interviews with Bill Cosby, Phylicia Rashad and the show's
now-grown child actors.</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   MTV, Stuntmen Announce Nominees</TE>
<TE>   Now that the Oscars are behind us, it's time for some less serious
award shows.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 MTV Movie Award nominees for best picture are "Black Hawk
Down," "The Fast and the Furious," "Legally Blonde," "The Lord of the
Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" and "Shrek." More fun are its
categories for best kiss and best fight.</TE>
<TE>   The best kissers? Heath Ledger and Shannyn Sossamon ("A Knight's
Tale"); Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott ("American Pie 2"); Renee
Zellweger and Colin Firth ("Bridget Jones's Diary"); Mia Kirshner and
Beverly Polcyn ("Not Another Teen Movie"); and Nicole Kidman and Ewan
McGregor ("Moulin Rouge"). Vying for the pugilistic title: Angelina
Jolie vs. a robot ("Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"), Christopher Lee vs.
Ian McKellen ("Lord of the Rings"), Jet Li vs. himself ("The One");
and Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan vs. the Hong Kong Gang ("Rush Hour
2").</TE>
<TE>   The show will be taped at the Shrine Auditorium on June 1 and will
air on MTV June 6.</TE>
<TE>   "Rush Hour 2" also led the pack in the second annual World Stunt
Award nominations, with the ceremony to be telecast on ABC on May 31.
The movie's nine nominations included three for best high work and
one for best water work. Seven nominations each went to "Apocalypse
Now Redux" and "The Fast and the Furious."</TE>
<TE>   DVD Rentals Tower Over Last Year</TE>
<TE>   Consumers rented more DVDs in the first quarter of 2002 than in
any other three-month period since the format's introduction--and
more than they did during the entire year of 2000, the Video Software
Dealers Assn. reports.</TE>
<TE>   The digital format accounted for $633.7 million in rental revenue
during the first three months this year, up 126% from the same period
a year ago, the association said. DVDs now account for nearly 30% of
the home video market, it said.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Following on the heels of colleagues such as Connie Chung, Aaron
Brown and Jeff Greenfield, ABC legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin has made
a move to CNN. He'll continue as a staff writer at the New Yorker....
Alfonso Cuaron ("Y Tu Mama Tambien") will serve as guest director for
the 2002 IFP Los Angeles Film Festival, hosting a two-day filmmaker
retreat and programming films for the June 20-29 event that have
inspired his work.... Robin Roberts has been named the news anchor
for "Good Morning America." ... Philanthropist Elizabeth A. Sackler
bought Judy Chicago's feminist installation "The Dinner Party" and
gave it to the Brooklyn Museum of Art last week.... "Metamorphoses"
was named best play and "Urinetown" best musical at the 2002 Lucille
Lortel Awards, honoring off-Broadway shows. Both have moved to
Broadway.</TE>

<HD>Long Path to Overnight Success</HD>
<DH>Movies* After 15 years, Tony Gayton sees his first two
produced screenplays debut within a week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD NATALE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Screenwriter Tony Gayton is sitting alone in a corner of the Beverly
Hills restaurant Maple Drive in a kind of veiled panic, looking as if
he's just about to take his SATs and forgot to bring two No. 2
pencils. He's giving the interview process the old college try,
though he makes it clear he prefers writing to being written about.
Nonetheless, he is aware that it's one of the perquisites of the
overnight success it has taken him 15 years to achieve.</LD>
<LD>   Gayton's first two produced screenplays are debuting back to back,
within a week of each other: "The Salton Sea," a postmodern film noir
starring Val Kilmer, is based on a spec script he wrote three years
ago; "Murder by Numbers" is a suspense tale starring Sandra Bullock,
about two brilliant teens who are out to outwit the police with a
perfect crime (shades of the infamous Leopold &amp; Loeb case of the
1920s), which Castle Rock Entertainment hired him to write after the
company's purchase of "Salton Sea."</LD>
<LD>   Although his fortunes have turned around, not much has changed in
his daily routine, which consists of sitting down at the computer,
getting up again, taking a walk along the bluffs near his Palos
Verdes Peninsula home and then, after he has wasted as much time as
he can, getting back to work. One sure sign of progress: He's deleted
the Solitaire and Hearts software from his computer.</LD>
<TE>   A graduate of USC's film school, Gayton turned to screenwriting as
a way of eventually wending his way into the director's chair. He
worked briefly as an assistant to larger-than-life writer-director
John Milius ("What a raconteur. I could listen to him talk all day
and sometimes I did," he says with a laugh), who signed Gayton to his
first writing deal back in the mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, "it's been an uphill battle," says the
youthful-looking 43-year-old, whose only telltale signs of age are
twin tufts of gray at the temples. "I had good years and bad years.
You can be a good writer, but you also need some luck."</TE>
<TE>   Gayton had luck, but not always the right kind. The good years
were marked by descents into the various circles of development hell
on scripts he wrote solo or with his older brother, screenwriter Joe
Gayton ("Uncommon Valor"), all of which came to naught. During the
dry spells he tried walking away. He spent a few months teaching
physical education at a high school in Compton only to be lured back
by another development deal.</TE>
<TE>   On another break he directed a "kamikaze-style" documentary
"Athens, Georgia: Inside/Out," which featured R.E.M., the B-52's and
poet the Rev. Howard Finster, a project that was personally
satisfying but drained his wallet and "took me out of the loop for a
year." In Hollywood terms 12 months can be a lifetime, and he fell
into the trap "of writing what I thought they wanted, which is not
always a bad thing, but if you're not careful, you can lose your
voice."</TE>
<TE>   Just as he was contemplating chucking it all again, he sat down to
write something for himself, the unlikely, uncommercial-sounding "The
Salton Sea," a dark, convoluted story, some of which is told in
old-fashioned voice-over narration. The plot construction is almost
as quirky as that of "Memento," though "Salton" was in the can long
before that sleeper-hit film was released last year.</TE>
<TE>   In a business where "no" is the most frequently uttered word,
"there were a million reasons for people to say no to my script," he
says. He did it for the exercise and the possibility that "it would
be a good writing sample and I might get an assignment or a rewrite
out of it." Instead, Castle Rock immediately bought it, asked for
only minor changes--"I rewrote maybe 10 pages"--and before it was
even in production, signed him to write another script, which turned
out to be "Murder by Numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Although the latter is more conventional, both films feature
flawed protagonists, with closets full of skeletons, who are
desperately searching for redemption. Thematically, says Gayton, such
complex heroes are his obsession. "They're people who are looking
into the abyss, fighting monsters and trying to make sure they don't
become monsters too."</TE>
<TE>   "Salton" is definitely the riskier of the projects, so rather than
blanketing the nation with the movie, Warner Bros. is opening it
today in exclusive engagements in a handful of cities for a month to
see if it will catch on. "It's not an easy film for a studio, not the
kind of product you can bottle and sell," he says. "I mean, how many
movies do you have to actually see to figure out what's going to
happen? The TV spots usually tell you everything."</TE>
<TE>   "Salton" defiantly refuses to show its hand. The central
character, played by Kilmer, is almost impossible to thumbnail,
because his identity keeps shifting throughout the film, a deliberate
ploy on Gayton's part, of which he is duly proud. "It's my best
script. I think I've finally hit my stride," he says. "It happens
later for some people."</TE>
<TE>   "Murder by Numbers," which he was assigned, would appear to be
more of a regular police drama. But Castle Rock principal Rob Reiner,
who brought Gayton the idea and originally planned to direct it, gave
Gayton a great deal of latitude. "He let me write it as if it was a
spec script," which is written independently and then sent to
producers and executives for sale. "He was never over my shoulder,
second-guessing me, which allowed me to bring in a strong first
draft."</TE>
<TE>   As the script evolved, the character of Cassie, the police
detective, was beefed up "to attract a star"--which it did, Bullock.
He voices no objection to shifting the focus from the teenage
murderers (for plot-phobic readers, "Murder" is not a whodunit),
creating two parallel story lines, each with its own elements of
psychological suspense. "Screenwriting is like no other art form,"
Gayton says. "The screenplay is a blueprint, and writers who complain
about that should either direct or write a novel if they want the
final word."</TE>
<TE>   As with "Salton Sea," the twists in "Murder by Numbers," which
opened Friday to a mixed critical reception, converge at the end and
comment on each other. The challenge, says Gayton, was to "trigger
them [for the audience] along the way without being too on the nose."</TE>
<TE>   With two credits under his belt, Castle Rock had enough confidence
to hire him for another script, as yet to be determined. In addition,
Gayton and his brother have sold a pitch, an action comedy, and are
awaiting the signing of a director before they proceed.</TE>
<TE>   He also hopes to reach into his desk drawer and pull out another
fraternal collaboration, the story of a down-and-out boxer whose
comeback turns out to be a match against his own son. Gayton is
realistic about its chances. "What was the last boxing film that
actually made money?"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he could attach himself as director. But now that he is
finally approaching the position of having enough clout to direct his
own projects, Gayton is hesitant. With a 5-year-old daughter and a
second child imminent, he says he wants to be sure before making that
commitment. "I still feel the need and there are stories I want to
tell. But because I have a family, and I know how hard the work is,
I'm not ready to commit a year of my life to being away from them
until the right thing comes along."</TE>
<TE>   Until then, he is resigned to the solitary confinement of a
writer's life, staring at a blank screen, procrastinating and waiting
for the muse to filter through his fingers until he finally taps out
the words "Fade Out."</TE>

<LD>By all appearances, the big broadcast networks jumped on every
reunion special they were pitched for this year's May ratings sweeps,
which begin Thursday. But gossip has it that the nets were, in fact,
selective, rejecting after careful deliberation a stack of proposals,
including:</LD>
<LD>   "TV's All-Time Stinkers and Jaw-Dropping Disasters." A cavalcade
of megaton bombs through the years, including "Supertrain," "Pink
Lady ... and Jeff," "Mr. T and Tina," "Life With Lucy," "The Brian
Benben Show," "Central Park West," "Platypus Man," "Wind on the
Water," "The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer" and "Woops!"</LD>
<LD>   "Love That Bob: A Tribute to Robert Conrad." An hour devoted
entirely to shows that starred or co-starred the pugnacious actor,
including "Hawaiian Eye," "The Wild Wild West," "Assignment Vienna,"
"Black Sheep Squadron," "A Man Called Sloane," "The D.A.," "The Duke"
and "High Mountain Rangers."</LD>
<TE>   "TV Co-Stars of Actors Who Made It Big in Movies." Featuring Peter
Scolari of "Bosom Buddies"; Pam Dawber of "Mork &amp; Mindy"; Stephanie
Zimbalist of "Remington Steele"; everybody from the cast of "St.
Elsewhere" except Denzel Washington; everyone from the cast of
"Welcome Back, Kotter" except John Travolta; everyone from the cast
of "B.A.D. Cats" except Michelle Pfeiffer; and everybody from "Party
of Five" except Neve Campbell and Jennifer Love Hewitt.</TE>
<TE>   "TV's Taboo Smashers." A survey of breakthrough moments in TV
history, including Archie Bunker's flushing "terlet," Maude Findlay
calling her husband a son of a female dog, and "NYPD Blue's" historic
baring of male buttocks.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'Mary' Reunion." Regrouping the casts of Mary Tyler Moore's
1978 comedy-variety hour, which included Dick Shawn, Swoosie Kurtz,
Michael Keaton and David Letterman; her revamped 1979 comedy-variety
hour, with Keaton, Dody Goodman and Joyce Van Patten; her 1985
newspaper sitcom, with Katey Sagal and James Farentino; and her 1995
newspaper drama, with Joe Morton, Kelli Williams and Gregory
Harrison.</TE>
<TE>   "20 Years of Must-Flee TV." Restocking NBC's vaunted
Thursday-night lineup hasn't been easy, as evidenced by this
retrospective of "Madman of the People," "The Single Guy," "Union
Square," "Inside Schwartz" and other losers.</TE>
<TE>   "Look What's Talking." An hour's worth of clips from series that
featured animals with a magical gift of gab, including "Mr. Ed"; "Mr.
Smith," a talking orangutan; Cleo the basset hound from "The People's
Choice"; and Tequila, the bulldog, from "Tequila &amp; Bonetti." (Now
that the new CBS show "Baby Bob" has become a hit, don't be surprised
if someone really proposes this last one for the November sweeps.)</TE>

<HD>Public Stations Get 'Connected'</HD>
<DH>Television* A weekly newsmagazine focusing on California
issues premieres Thursday in all of the state's seven markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Californians often seem too spread out and diverse to have much in
common, don't tell that to the state's public television executives.
They've set out to unite California behind stories and issues through
a weekly TV newsmagazine.</LD>
<LD>   "California Connected" will premiere Thursday at 9 p.m. in the
seven distinct television markets across the state. Idealistic? Yes.
Possible? Apparently.</LD>
<LD>   "To my knowledge, it's the first time that all seven markets have
ever linked up," said Al Jerome, president and CEO of KCET in Los
Angeles, the headquarters for the program. Jerome said he and the
other station chiefs agreed to the collaborative venture to provide
the show the greatest impact.</LD>
<TE>   "There's nothing more important for a public television station
than to deal with the major problems and issues facing the state,"
Jerome said.</TE>
<TE>   The one-hour show will focus on such topics as education, the
environment, health care and the arts and will include studio
segments and reports from the field produced by KCET, KQED in San
Francisco, KVIE in Sacramento and KPBS in San Diego. Stations in
Eureka, Fresno, Redding and San Bernardino (which serves part of the
market reached by KCET) will also carry the program.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel pretty strongly that stories unite," said Marley Klaus,
the executive producer of "California Connected" and a former "60
Minutes" producer. "There are many issues that apply to all of us."</TE>
<TE>   Those include state laws, an area frequently given little time on
commercial stations. "Almost everything does lead back to Sacramento.
It's completely uncovered in local television because people think
that it's boring, and we plan to show them that it's not," Klaus
said.</TE>
<TE>   The series also won't stop at reporting on important bills going
through the legislative process, she said, but will tell viewers
exactly where and how to get involved. The "Get Connected" minute is
a news brief that will air daily, with information about what
decisions are being made the next day.</TE>
<TE>   The show's Web site, www.californiaconnected.org, will include
background information on these decisions, along with meeting places
and e-mail addresses of involved parties.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just that we're reporting on what has happened and what
is going to happen, but what are the implications for the future,"
Klaus said.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well, Jerome expects the program's format to be copied
by public television networks in other states. Texas, he said, has
already expressed interest.</TE>
<TE>   The series will be anchored by David Brancaccio, host of Minnesota
Public Radio's "Marketplace." Former CNN producer Bob Melisso is the
senior producer.</TE>
<TE>   A news program about California wouldn't be complete without a
diverse lineup of reporters, including David Garcia, a seasoned
environmental reporter for Southern California television stations;
Hena Cuevas, a former CNN correspondent who reported from several
Latin American countries; and Jon Beaupre, an award-winning
broadcaster for National Public Radio and the BBC News.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very ambitious project," Jerome said. "What excites me is
at a time when commercial broadcasters are doing less and less public
affairs, less substantive reporting of major issues, this is a time
for public television to step up and show that we can be an
alternative."</TE>
<TE>   Added Klaus, "What we really hope is [that] people become more
actively involved in the decisions that are made that affect their
lives."</TE>
<TE>   "California Connected" premieres Thursday at 9 p.m. on KCET.</TE>

<LD>The Food Network, tonight at 7 and 10, blends one part cooking show,
one part restaurant review and one part travelogue, whips it all to a
froth and, voila, a new series, "$40 a Day," is served.</LD>
<LD>   Hosted by the bubbly Rachael Ray of the network's popular "30
Minute Meals" program, the new show offers tips on how to eat well on
a modest budget while traipsing through some of the most glamorous
locales in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Although tonight's debut episode puts Ray's $40 daily spending
limit to the test in Northern California's wine country, the Food
Network opted to send a review copy of a scheduled May1 show based in
the Florida Keys. Future shows include fast-paced stopovers in Paris,
Rome and San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   The key to success, according to Ray, is getting chummy with the
locals to find out where the real people eat. Then, dispensing with
the menu, she simply asks restaurant proprietors to whip up one of
their more reasonably priced specialties.</TE>
<TE>   The host seems to be having the time of her life as she tours
points of interest, learns the history of the various dining spots
and then invades the kitchen for recipes. Along the way, she asks a
local for a push on a tire swing, thanks a man for taking a photo for
her with a hearty "Yeah! You rock!" and high-fives a chef while
shouting, "Right on!"</TE>
<TE>   A Key lime pie breakfast sets her back $2.95. Lunch consists of a
jerk chicken salad on a tortilla ($9.25), and dinner is curried conch
with fried plantains, shrimp hash cake and peas and rice ($15.50).</TE>
<TE>   As the sun sets on a seaside tavern, she orders a $7.50 rum
runner, bringing the day's total to $35.20. Even though no tips or
taxes are mentioned in this episode, watching Ray at work within the
"$40 a Day" system is a real treat.</TE>

<HD>A Lowly Turnout for Reruns</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With networks squirreling away original episodes for the rating
sweeps beginning Thursday, many top hits were in reruns last week,
and all four major networks saw their audience decline compared with
the same stretch in 2001, based on viewing estimates issued Tuesday
by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   CBS' Thursday tandem of "Survivor: Marquesas" and a "CSI: Crime
Scene Investigation" repeat paced that network to victory, while NBC
owed much of its success to the "Law &amp; Order" franchise, with a rerun
of the flagship series Sunday after spinoff "Law &amp; Order: Criminal
Intent" winning its time slot against the CBS movie "Two Against
Time" and ABC's "The Practice." Lost among ABC's other problems this
season, in fact, is a steep decline by that legal drama, which has
seen its audience drop sharply versus a year ago, when "Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire" fed into it instead of the drama "Alias."</LD>
<LD>   Better news for ABC has surrounded midseason replacement "The
Bachelor," which won its time period last week and saw its ratings
continue to expand Monday of the current week by nearly 2 million
viewers. Yet despite the network's gains in that hour, ABC's "Once
and Again" concluded its three-year run last Monday with more of a
whimper than a bang ratings-wise, trailing NBC's "Crossing Jordan" by
more than 5 million viewers in its time period.</LD>

<LD>A man rumbled through my neighborhood, gunning his Harley, rattling
windows and setting off car alarms.</LD>
<LD>   I'm a pretty sound napper, but pressure-waves from his unmuffled
engine triggered old earthquake instincts. I leaped off the couch.</LD>
<LD>   This, I presume, was the intended reaction.</LD>
<TE>   My head cleared and I thought of two things. I thought of the
children I sometimes see at the grocery store. At age 4 or 5, when
you need attention and if you don't get it ... well, you start
insisting on it, wailing at the top of your lungs or grabbing for a
jar of pickles to drop on the linoleum. Second, I thought of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Is there more to straight-pipe Harleys than the impulse of kids?
Perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   I interviewed a few of these aging biker juveniles at my local
Starbucks. When they quit trying to menace me--and how menacing,
really, can 40-something junior executives and contractors be, even
when prettied-up in HD leathers?--they offered the excuse: safety.</TE>
<TE>   We're hard to see, man, we gotta make ourselves heard so as to not
get ambushed by an SUV.</TE>
<TE>   Which, naturally enough, raises the question: If these boys and
girls are so all-fire concerned about road safety, why ride a
motorcycle? Or why wear the smallest, least-protective beanie helmets
they can find just as long as the helmets resemble something from the
Nazi Reich? If they want to be seen, why not also wear reflective
orange or pink? Etc. Etc. Just curious. Anyway, these aren't
conversations that go down very well at Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings me to Enron. I wouldn't tilt against the windmill of
these self-aggrandizers except the straight-pipe Harley phenomenon
strikes me as another way in which social aggression has made its way
up the food chain in our culture. No longer are our outlaws the weak
and powerless.</TE>
<TE>   I came of age in the '60s generation, so I know something about
"self" and striving for individuality. I used to worship at that
altar along with all the other iconoclasts who were my friends. But
we started to drift away, or at least I did, just about the time we
learned that individuality is usually just another type of
conformity--and never so much as with the costume and ritual of the
motorcycle noisemakers.</TE>
<TE>   I know a middle-age woman in an investment club whose favorite
stock is Harley. She is pretty sure there is no end to the supply of
aging grade-schoolers who will pay $20K so they can throw the
equivalent of a public tantrum every time the weather is fair and
they feel the thirst for a double latte. She cringes like the rest of
us, but not without some hope of gain.</TE>
<TE>   Did you know that studies show that straight pipes actually reduce
the performance of these machines? That's what I'm told by some of my
knowledgeable friends in sport motorcycle circles, which is a
different culture for the most part, thank you. Most full-size
Japanese or European motorcycles can run circles around these
lumbering iron swine--or do we prefer the formal term, hog? It's all
about ear-splitting aggression and little else, you see. Just sign on
to the Harley-Davidson Web site and listen.</TE>
<TE>   I'm happy to report that the mainstream motorcyclists, including
the American Motorcycle Assn., have finally broken ranks and turned
against the straight-pipe gang. The old T-shirts that read "loud
pipes save lives" are being matched with those reading "loud pipes
risk rights." Better late than never.</TE>
<TE>   Can I mention that straight pipes and unbaffled mufflers are
flat-out illegal? More, as the AMA puts it, "manufacturers work hand
in glove with the aftermarket companies to create illegally loud
exhaust systems." Or is this beside the point these days? The law is
government, government is regulation, regulation is oppression, so
listen up! Anyway, cops hang out at diners and doughnut shops, not
Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   Back to Enron. Before the bankruptcy, I remember the uncommon
pleasure those Houston electricity traders seemed to take in seeing
Californians on the hook during power shortages. It wasn't enough for
them to ride high. They wanted everyone else to wriggle and squirm.
Ditto the gentlemen and ladies with the straight pipes.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc said its first-quarter loss widened but that
it expects to be profitable for the year.</LD>
<LD>   The company posted a loss of $90.8 million, or 37 cents a share,
compared with $17.5 million, or 8 cents, excluding a one-time cost of
$382.3 million a year earlier for a change in film-accounting rules.
Sales fell 8.4% to $315.1 million.</LD>
<LD>   MGM said in February that recent film releases, especially
"Rollerball" and "Hart's War," hadn't met expectations and cut its
first-quarter and 2002 profit forecasts. Two other important films
for MGM this year will be "Windtalkers" in June and the James Bond
movie "Die Another Day" in November.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of the Santa Monica-based company rose 20 cents to $16.49
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   MGM expects to report a narrower loss and higher revenue in the
second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Daniel Taylor said. The firm
is likely to turn a profit in the third and fourth quarters, he said.</TE>

<HD>Dick Clark Files Suit Over Planned Museum</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dick Clark Productions Inc., founded by the former host of "American
Bandstand," sued a developer after a planned music-themed museum fell
through.</LD>
<LD>   Dick Clark claims that Queens Seaport Development, the operator of
the Queen Mary in Long Beach, breached a 1999 accord to develop "Dick
Clark's Great American Music Experience." The developer last year
told Clark that it couldn't raise the money to build and operate the
museum, the suit said.</LD>
<LD>   Clark claims Queens Seaport breached a contract to pay him a
minimum fee of $2.9 million, a $15,000 monthly consulting fee and a
cut of the museum's admission and sales. The suit seeks at least $10
million in punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages.</LD>
<TE>   Queens Seaport couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>

<LD>Major U.S. air carriers, counting on a resumption in business travel
to stem billions of dollars in losses after the Sept. 11 attacks, may
have to look for relief elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   The Business Travel Coalition, an advocacy group for corporate

air-fare spending by 16.5% in 2001 from a year earlier and more than
half said they want to cut costs even more in 2002.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. residents felt more of a pinch from last year's recession than
previously thought, with incomes rising more slowly than estimated
earlier, according to government data.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department said personal income rose 3.7% last year,
less than the 4.9% reported last month.</LD>
<LD>   On a per-person basis, the gain was 2.7%, a sharp slowdown from
the 5.8% rise in 2000 and the smallest increase since the last
recession in 1990-91. Still, it was enough to keep consumers ahead of
prices, which rose 1.6%.</LD>

<LD>DuPont Co.'s first-quarter profit fell 3.4% as the second-largest
U.S. chemical maker cut prices and sold less paint, fibers and
plastics.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $479 million, or 48 cents a share. Sales fell
10% to $6.14 billion, the seventh consecutive quarterly decline.</LD>
<LD>   DuPont has eliminated thousands of jobs over the last year as
sales of its chemicals, paints and fibers were hurt by slow consumer
demand for cars, electronics, clothing and durable goods.
First-quarter sales fell in DuPont's divisions that make automobile
paint and chemicals used in electronics, packaging and carpet fibers.</LD>
<TE>   DuPont shares fell $1.51 cents to $44.84 in New York Stock
Exchange trading, after earnings were released.</TE>
<TE>   DuPont, based in Wilmington, Del., said it will restate results
later this year, writing down the value of acquisitions, including

billion.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Libbey Inc., the biggest U.S. food service glassware maker, was
barred by a federal judge from acquiring part of rival Newell
Rubbermaid Inc.'s Anchor Hocking unit for $277.5million.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton in Washington ordered a
preliminary injunction sought by the Federal Trade Commission, which
said the purchase would reduce competition.</LD>
<LD>   Walton said the FTC's concerns are enough to halt the deal until
the case can be heard on its merits.</LD>
<TE>   Libbey has "begun study of and consideration of all of our
alternatives in order to determine our course of action," Chief
Executive John F. Meier said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Libbey, based in Toledo, Ohio, rose 17 cents to $34.95,
and Newell shares rose 31 cents to $31.86--both on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Amazon.com Inc.'s first-quarter loss narrowed as sales of books,
movies and music rose in the United States and the world's largest
Internet retailer benefited from cost cutting.</LD>
<LD>   The loss narrowed to $23.2 million, or 6 cents a share, from
$234million, or 66 cents, a year earlier, Amazon said. Sales surged
21% to $847.4 million.</LD>
<LD>   The company also announced that Borders Group Inc., the
second-biggest U.S. bookseller, agreed to let Amazon customers pick
up some online purchases at its stores. Borders will record the sales
of items ordered online and picked up at its stores, and Amazon will
get a commission. Amazon also will manage a new Web site for Borders'
Waldenbooks division.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Seattle-based Amazon rose in after-hours trading to as
much as $15.23 after the financial results were announced. The shares

when it struck a deal in 1999 to buy Platinum Technology Inc., the
two sides said.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department sued the world's No. 4 software maker last
year, alleging that Computer Associates International and Platinum
had agreed that Platinum would limit price discounts and other terms
to customers during the mandatory pre-merger waiting period, a
violation known as "gun jumping."</LD>
<LD>   As part of the settlement, Computer Associates will be prevented
from agreeing on prices, approving or rejecting proposed customer
contracts and exchanging prospective bid information with future
merger partners.</LD>

<HD>10 Years After the Riots, We Stick With Our Own</HD>
<DH>Put money behind efforts to bridge the racial divide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years ago next week, while Los Angeles was in the midst of the
worst looting and burning the United States has seen in the 20th
century, Rodney King asked, "Can we all get along?" King's simple
question was a heartfelt plea to actively work for racial tolerance
and understanding. A decade later there are troubling signs that far
too many still haven't heeded that plea.</LD>
<LD>   A decade after the riots, which were sparked by the not-guilty
verdicts in the trial of the four LAPD officers who beat King, the
bitter truth is that the personal lives of too many Americans still
seem too tightly manacled by race. Los Angeles County reflects that
pattern of racial balkanization in which whites, blacks, Latinos and
Asians remain socially isolated from each other. This does little to
foster understanding and respect for diversity.</LD>
<LD>   I see it every day on my job. I work for a public agency. There
are no visible racial barriers, antagonisms or incidents. There are
strict prohibitions against discrimination and an actively enforced
affirmative action program.</LD>
<TE>   There are black, Asian and Latino supervisors. Minorities are
well-represented in the professional and skilled positions within the
agency.</TE>
<TE>   During the lunch and coffee breaks, however, it's a different
story. The interracial mix abruptly halts. Each group stakes out its
respective turf. Blacks sit at one table talking and eating. Whites
sit at another, Latinos and Asians at others.</TE>
<TE>   No one seems to give a second thought to this separate but equal
clustering. It's just friends "socializing" with those they feel most
comfortable with.</TE>
<TE>   When I leave my office to go home, I pass the neighborhood school.
With the exception of a small but growing number of Latinos, the
students on the playground are all black.</TE>
<TE>   My neighbors are a good mix of professionals, businesspeople and
skilled workers. But other than a couple of older whites, they are
all black. At the market the shoppers are nearly all black. My son
and daughter's social contacts are exclusively black.</TE>
<TE>   It's the same for young blacks and Latinos in South-Central Los
Angeles and young whites in the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys.
They don't see and experience a nation where people of different
ethnic groups work, go to school, play and live together as friends
and neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The tensions aren't just between blacks and whites. Many Latinos
believe that blacks are out to exclude them from Civil Service jobs
and prevent them from attaining greater political power.</TE>
<TE>   Many blacks engage in immigrant-bashing and claim that Latinos are
out to grab jobs and funds for welfare, health and education services
from them.</TE>
<TE>   Many Koreans whose stores suffered the brunt of the burning and
looting in 1992 regard blacks as lazy and crime-prone. And many
blacks claim that Koreans are racist and accuse them of exploiting
the black community.</TE>
<TE>   The lingering racial divide, however, can be bridged. The Los
Angeles City Council should revive its "day of dialogue" forums,
which brought together community leaders and residents from
throughout the city to discuss their problems and needs.</TE>
<TE>   The city's public officials and business leaders should increase
funds and programs for business and boost housing loans, social
services and recreation programs in South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   And the Los Angeles Police Department must finish the job of
reform by ending racial profiling, weeding out corrupt and brutal
officers and implementing more and better community policing.</TE>
<TE>   There is still much work to be done before anyone can answer yes
to Rodney King's decade-old question.</TE>

<HD>Immigrant Prejudice, French-Style</HD>
<DH>Hatred comes in many forms in France; anti-Semitism is but
one.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONI L. KAMINS</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The spate of anti-Jewish violence in France is frightening, and the
reaction of some of France's leaders, who seem to be in denial, is
even more so. Does this mean France is rife with anti-Semitism? The
answer is not simple.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, France has had a terrible history with Jews. Jews have lived
in France roughly since the 5th century, and for most of that time
they were subject to government-sponsored vilification of their
faith, mass expulsions, forced conversion to Roman Catholicism,
crippling taxation, humiliating legal oaths, segregation in cramped
ghettos, proscriptions from living in France's major cities and both
systematic and random violence and murder.</LD>
<LD>   The end of the 19th and early 20th centuries brought the Dreyfus
affair, World War II and the German occupation and saw France
collaborate with the Nazis in committing heinous crimes against Jews.</LD>
<TE>   Despite all that, it is France's disgraceful relationship with its
Muslim population that in large part accounts for the current
violence.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Muslims from France's former colonies in North Africa
have settled in France. But the French, who are loath to accept
anyone or anything they perceive to be non-French, have not made them
welcome, to say the least.</TE>
<TE>   The French don't want North African immigrants in France. They
have relegated them to living in what are known as the banlieue, or
suburbs. But if this term conjures up bucolic bedroom communities
within easy reach of Paris, Lyon or Marseille, think again. The
banlieue are largely made up of government housing projects, soulless
places where the residents have little contact with the rest of
French society except for cohorts of a mind-numbing bureaucracy.
Unemployment is high, education is an afterthought and being arrested
for suspicion of this or that is common.</TE>
<TE>   The disdain and contempt in which these people are held by French
society is palpable. The level of alienation that exists in the
banlieue simply cannot be overstated, and it is difficult for those
unfamiliar with France to understand it.</TE>
<TE>   While Jean-Marie Le Pen of the far-right National Front, who will
face incumbent Jacques Chirac in a presidential runoff next month, is
an anti-Semite, he is above everything else anti-immigrant. And in
France anti-immigrant means anti-North African Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   Also resident in the banlieue are Jewish immigrants from North
Africa. They are victims of many of the same social forces as the
Muslims, but a well-developed Jewish communal infrastructure helps to
mitigate those forces.</TE>
<TE>   The violence against Jews and Jewish establishments occurs against
this backdrop and in the banlieue, not in the middle of Paris. The
anti-Jewish character of the violence is there, but to say that it is
strictly an expression of Muslim anti-Semitism obscures the complex
nature of the situation.</TE>
<TE>   The synagogue firebombings and attacks on soccer players and
school buses are as much anti-social, anti-establishment and
anti-French as they are anti-Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   The Jewish community should not ignore what is going on in France,
and along with the French government it should ensure that the
violence does not continue or escalate. But neither should it
overreact. Boycotting France and French products would be an
overreaction.</TE>
<TE>   Although it may be tempting, calling the current violence the
seeds of another Holocaust is reckless. It panders to fear and
ignorance and fosters a simplistic view of the world and the Jewish
community in particular.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how many French officials make negative remarks about
Israel, there is a difference between crimes being committed by a
handful of alienated outsiders and crimes committed as an expression
of official government policy.</TE>

<HD>Is Democracy Always Worth the Trouble?</HD>
<DH>Once the coup occurred, U.S. support of Chavez was
optional.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGEL RABASA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the United States' attention is focused on the Middle East and
Afghanistan, it's also important to remember that we have vital
long-term strategic interests in Latin America and that those
interests are best served by stable and democratic governments. This
is why the recent coup and counter-coup in Venezuela, one of the
world's leading oil producers, deserves more attention.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1990s, Latin America experienced a strong, regionwide trend
toward democratic governance that encompassed every country in the
region except Cuba. Although Latin American democracies remain under
pressure, the democratic trend has held.</LD>
<LD>   But what happens when a democratically elected president is
working to undermine democratic institutions? What if that same
leader is working to undermine global U.S. strategic interests? And
if that president's behavior oversteps the bounds of tolerance of
major sectors of the population and is overthrown, what course of
action would be in the best interests of the United States and of
Latin American democracy?</LD>
<TE>   Should the U.S. refuse to deal with the new regime and demand the
deposed president's restoration? Work with the successor government
and seek an early return to democracy? Take no action?</TE>
<TE>   These questions need to be kept in mind in considering the
dilemmas the Bush administration faced in the botched coup attempt in
Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   The spectacle of a democratically elected leader working to
undermine democracy is unfortunately common. In Latin America there
was the case of Argentina's Juan Peron, like Hugo Chavez a former
military officer with great appeal among the poor. Peron, though
elected, ran what was in effect a dictatorship and in the process
devastated the country's economy. His overthrow in 1955 was no loss
to democracy. Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori's self-coup
in 1992, in which he closed the Peruvian Congress and awarded himself
full powers, was another case in point.</TE>
<TE>   Upon coming to power in 1999, Chavez launched what he calls the
Bolivarian revolution, which was supposed to redress the inequities
in Venezuelan society. In fact, it amounted to a Peronesque attempt
to destroy the checks and balances inherent in a democratic
constitutional system. Chavez also moved to extend his control over
independent sectors of society, including labor organizations and the
media. The concentration of political power was part of a vision that
included opposition to economic liberalization, anti-Americanism and
sympathy for Fidel Castro and Colombian guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's moves to extend his reach to two key institutions laid
the groundwork for the failed coup. The first was his attempt to gain
control of the powerful Confederation of Venezuelan Workers. The
union's leadership resisted and prevailed in a vote for control of
the organization. The second was Chavez's firing of key managers and
the packing of the state-owned oil corporation's board of directors
with his supporters. Employees responded with a strike that came
close to paralyzing oil production.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis escalated with a general strike declared by the
Confederation of Venezuelan Workers and the industrialists'
federation, mass demonstrations demanding Chavez's resignation, the
killing of 15 demonstrators by Chavez supporters and the president's
ouster by the military.</TE>
<TE>   There are no credible indications of U.S. encouragement or support
of Chavez's overthrow. That would have been inconsistent with U.S.
international obligations. But once the coup took place, was the
United States obliged to support Chavez's restoration? That was the
position of a majority of Latin American countries in condemning the
coup. Some no doubt acted on principle; others perhaps did not wish
to give ideas to their generals.</TE>
<TE>   But given his history, restoring Chavez to power was not
necessarily in the best interests of Venezuelan democracy. Seeking to
moderate the new government and a rapid return to real democracy
would have been an eminently defensible policy.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Chavez is back in the presidential palace, the United
States has to make the best of a bad situation. An effective approach
would consist of a two-pronged strategy. The Bush administration's
offer of normal relations with Chavez if he is willing to work toward
reconciliation in Venezuela and cooperation with the U.S. would be
one prong. The other would be strengthened support of civil society
sectors in Venezuela because their continued independence offers the
best hope for the survival of Venezuelan democracy.</TE>

<LD>No one should feel much safer after the California Supreme Court's
wise decision Monday to uphold the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors' 1999 ban of gun shows at the county's fairgrounds in
Pomona.</LD>
<LD>   Each year, 4,500 such firearms flea markets nationwide flood
neighborhoods with guns purchased by hunters, collectors, violent
criminals, people with severe mental illness, citizens seeking a
means of self-defense and individuals with no easily understood
reason for desiring a weapon.</LD>
<LD>   It was the pistol, shotgun and rifles purchased by two people in
the last category that persuaded lawmakers that the so-called "gun
show loophole"--no waiting period, no background check--is a matter
of life and death.</LD>
<TE>   In those two now-infamous 1998 purchases, the young man and woman
showed IDs verifying that they were over 18 and bought weapons at
Denver-area shows. Soon thereafter, they gave or sold the weapons to
two minors: Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris.</TE>
<TE>   Four months later, Klebold and Harris used the guns to kill 12
students and a teacher and to shoot more than two dozen others before
killing themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday was the third anniversary of that slaughter, and the
loophole survives, spilling ever more weapons into a market that
remains ludicrously laissez faire. Federal law requires that handgun
buyers pass a background check before taking weapons home, a
reasonable request for hunters, collectors and other legitimate
consumers. But that law applies only when a firearm is bought at a
gun store. Sales at gun shows, the bazaars held every weekend of the
year around California and other states, are exempt.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's Columbine massacre prompted many in Congress to try to
close the background check loophole, but they failed in the face of
opposition from the gun lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Now, three years later, a bipartisan group of senators is trying
again. They have introduced two bills requiring background checks for
handguns bought at gun shows, and the sponsors are hoping to attach
them to bigger legislation on whose coattails they might ride to
passage.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Reed (D-R.I.) is pushing one measure and John McCain
(R-Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) are co-sponsoring
another. The McCain-Lieberman bill is more lenient. Its definition of
"gun show" includes fewer of these events than does Reed's bill, and
it would subject gun buyers and sellers to shorter waiting periods.
But these differences are less important than keeping weapons away
from the people who want a gun but not the slightest scrutiny.</TE>

<LD>Israel's furious attacks on Palestinian towns have bought a relative
calm, but that must not be confused with lasting peace. Unless both
sides start talking again about how to build a Palestinian state,
sooner rather than later, there will be more suicide bombings, more
reprisals, even deeper hatred of one people for another, more risk
that the conflict will spread.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said Tuesday that the campaign
to root out terrorists on the West Bank opened the door to
peacemaking with Palestinians and to "regional peace." He pronounced
himself "optimistic about the future." We can't share that optimism.
Not if Sharon keeps offering shopworn rhetoric of the kind in his
televised speech to pro-Israel Americans: a complete end to violence,
a long-term truce between Israelis and Palestinians and eventually a
final settlement. Those are the old ideas that have produced violence
from Palestinians promised a state of their own and unwilling to wait
until Sharon decides when they can achieve it.</LD>
<LD>   The odious suicide bombing that killed two dozen Israelis at a
Passover dinner March 27--by Israel's count, the 1,424th attack of
various types in two months--spurred Sharon to lash out with
bulldozers, tanks and helicopters. He then defied President Bush's
demand for an immediate withdrawal and kept the attacks going for two
more weeks.</LD>
<TE>   Much of the savage fighting took place in the refugee camp in
Jenin, which a Palestinian fighter said Sharon had called a ''nest of
cockroaches.'' The fighter termed it a ''nest of angels.'' Some
angels. People seeking Israel's destruction filled storehouses in
Jenin with weapons and ammunition. In tiny rooms, men packed
gunpowder and fertilizer into canisters that some bomber would use to
blow apart Israeli men, women and children.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian ambush that killed 13 Israeli soldiers in the
Jenin refugee camp two weeks ago sparked frenzied retaliation, with
Israeli bulldozers destroying houses, sometimes before people could
escape, and troops preventing rescue workers from reaching the
injured. Some residents reported being used as shields and forced to
open doors that soldiers feared had been booby-trapped.</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty International said its preliminary review of the attack
indicated "serious breaches" of human rights, "including war crimes."
Israel vehemently disputes that, saying it tried to spare civilians
and targeted only terrorists. But after keeping out reporters during
the siege, it is now objecting to a United Nations fact-finding team.
It should welcome the U.N. investigators. Israel, after all, is a
democracy that has been willing to hold its institutions accountable.
After the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, a court of inquiry found
Sharon, then the defense minister, indirectly responsible for a
massacre of hundreds of refugees by Christians allied with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   More than 400 Israelis and more than 1,000 Palestinians have been
killed since attacks resumed in September 2000, following Yasser
Arafat's eleventh-hour rejection of the peace plan the United States
had brokered. Still, this week's violence has been less than during
Israel's three-week West Bank offensive.</TE>
<TE>   In Spain, Israeli and Arab officials agreed Tuesday after two days
of talks that there could be no "military solution" to the Middle
East conflict. Now the U.S. and other nations need to charge into
this tiny opening and push both sides to put as much energy into
political negotiations as they have into bloodshed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After Sept. 11, the government and airlines properly rushed to
institute sweeping security measures to restore public confidence in
flying. But the hours-long lines and delays created by random
searches of passengers are not enhancing security. Homeland Security
Director Thomas J. Ridge is correctly urging that the airlines and
government move quickly to establish a "trusted fliers" program that
would both speed up travel and bolster security checks.</LD>
<LD>   As Ridge outlined the program Monday, the airlines would create a
card to be issued to passengers who voluntarily joined a "trusted
flier" program and paid a modest fee. Passengers would supply
extensive background information showing they did not pose a security
risk, and the airlines could use commercial databases to double-check
identities. Once cleared, the trusted fliers would receive a card
containing a biometric identifier so that no one else could use it;
biometric identifiers used elsewhere have included fingerprints and
iris scans. The process would allow the screeners to devote their
major resources to focusing on the potential bad apples.</LD>
<TE>   The Air Transport Assn. of America, which represents the major
airlines, has endorsed such a program but wants the federal
government, not industry, to run it. It also wants aviation officials
to have access to government data, including arrest records and
customs files. A database program of this kind is already in use in
Israel, where El Al, the national airline, checks government
intelligence records for each passenger.</TE>
<TE>   One objection to systems like this comes from civil libertarians
who oppose checking passengers against databases as a step toward Big
Brother. But the airlines are already using the Federal Aviation
Administration's "computer-assisted passenger prescreening system,"
which matches passengers to a profile of suspicious activity. Moving
toward a card would create a more refined system, and it would, of
course, be voluntary.</TE>
<TE>   Another cautionary note comes from John Magaw, chief of the new
Transportation Security Administration, who worries that a terrorist
might devote several years to establishing a frequent-flier
background that appears trustworthy. But occasional rigorous checks
of "trusted fliers" might help improve the odds against this, and no
system is going to be perfect. A government-run program, which has
the powerful databases that the airlines lack, should be tested
immediately.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Columnist George Skelton has clearly joined the ranks of the
misinformed with his diatribe against .50-caliber firearms ("Massive
Rifle Needs Regulation to Keep It Out of the Hands of Terrorists,"
April 18). The legislation that would regulate these rifles is much
more draconian than Skelton lets on.</LD>
<LD>   While the bill allows people to keep their currently owned
rifles--so long as they register them--it also criminalizes the sale
or possession of the .50-caliber Browning machine gun ammunition they
utilize. Of what use is a rifle whose ammunition has been banned?
This creates a de facto ban on the weapons themselves, for they can
never be fired.</LD>
<LD>   How this provision passed the sanity test is incomprehensible.</LD>
<TE>   But ultimately I see no problem with this bill. Should it pass,
gun makers and gunsmiths will simply alter the cartridge
slightly--perhaps making it .49-caliber--and then re-barrel existing
rifles. Problem solved, and perfectly legal.</TE>

<TE>   Skelton quotes from an article I wrote for http://www.KeepAnd
BearArms.com. I reported what is commonly known among the
informed--that millions of good Americans, after enduring years of
oppression as gun owners, have reached the sad but logical conclusion
that only violence will restore the full, free exercise of their
right to own and use firearms. For reporting this fact, Skelton says
I should be denied a proposed California rifle "permit."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not surprised that Skelton's automatic, un-American response
to hearing unpleasant facts is to recommend punishing the messenger.
Nor am I surprised that he used absurd terms like "superguns," "small
cannons" and "monsters" to describe common .50-caliber rifles--even
though many models can be shoulder-fired; nor that he used Clintonian
distortions in saying the guns were "capable of taking out" concrete
bunkers, armored personnel carriers, hovering helicopters or
destroying tanker trucks at 2,000 yards. Such propaganda is normal
for liberal elitists. And I'm not surprised that Skelton didn't tell
readers that my article was about avoiding future violence.</TE>
<TE>   Skelton need not worry about my getting a gun "permit." I would
never apply for a permit to own any gun, any more than I would apply
for a permit to own a Bible, or Torah, or printing press, or to
obtain legal counsel or to assemble with other citizens.</TE>

<LD>If we let the politicians of Nevada have their way we will never
solve the problem of nuclear waste (April 19). They criticize the
president's sensible decision to declare the Yucca Mountain site as
appropriate for disposal of used nuclear fuel because the final bits
of science are not complete.</LD>
<LD>   Yucca Mountain has been studied extensively, and it appears we do
know enough now to move forward. The waste will be removable for up
to 50 years, should there be a problem or we have a better idea. And
this is the same locale where we detonated nuclear weapons above and
below ground for decades. An engineered and monitored underground
facility cannot be a bigger problem than a bunch of radioactive holes
blown in the ground.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, more study for Yucca Mountain is in the schedule. The
president, however, did the right thing by stating that the site is
suitable and that we need to acknowledge we are solving the waste
problem.</LD>

sea level. Set a 24-inch pipe on a gentle slope from one to the other
and let nature (gravity) do the rest. Salinity is not a problem here.</LD>

<LD>Re "The Irresistible Force of a Teacher's Will," April 21: Your story
of a Central Valley teacher who single-handedly prepared her
farm-worker children for success at elite colleges is now saved in my
Islands of Excellence folder. That's a file for reports on superhuman
teachers, extraordinary programs and marvelous schools. I've seen
many such stories in three decades of teaching. They always inspire.</LD>
<LD>   But can we move beyond inspiration? Can we redesign the incentives
involved in taxpayer-funded education to nurture extraordinary
programs, capitalize on rare talent and encourage super-achievers? We
know how such stories end. The phenomenal personality leaves or can't
sustain the pace. The program fades. Eventually, it's heard from no
more.</LD>
<LD>   One way to create a more enduring legacy is to get resources early
on to people like Assistant Supt. Nancy Mellor. We could do that by
letting taxpayer funds follow a child to a school of her parents'
choosing. Why should we let our islands of extraordinary success sink
back into the sea of ordinariness?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While Mellor's efforts to get the children of farm workers
admitted to top universities and Ivy League schools are commendable,
this question looms: When and how did the notion that going to
college should be encouraged regardless of ability come about?</TE>
<TE>   The article states that although many of Mellor's students
accepted to Oberlin College had much lower SAT scores than the
average student there, her tenacity and lobbying gained them
admission. What about the students who did attain high test scores
and also worked hard? Looking at it from this point of view, their
spots were taken from them.</TE>

<TE>   It is impossible to measure the influence that Mellor has had on
the lives of her students. I can identify with her, because I had a
teacher very much like her in the eighth grade who instilled in me
the will "to be anything that I wanted to be." I decided I wanted to
be an airline pilot. I am now 74 years of age and retired from
American Airlines after 33 years as a pilot. God bless Ms. Mellor.</TE>

<LD>Stanley Weiss is certainly right that the U.S. isn't wedded to cheap
Saudi oil (Commentary, April 19). Yes, cheap oil. Isn't the U.S.
getting it for $25 a barrel and then charging more than triple that
amount as taxes? Thus, the government is making threefold what the
Saudis are getting. Isn't that cheap?</LD>
<LD>   Personally, I wish that our oil would be saved in its wells for
our next generations, or at least so that the Saudis are relieved
from being a buffer producer for the sake of keeping oil prices
inexpensive for the West. When I evaluate the present oil situation I
can't help but remember a statement by the late Shah of Iran 40 years
ago: He said that oil is too precious to burn.</LD>

<TE>   Weiss correctly points out that "The U.S. Isn't Wedded to Saudi
Oil." Yes, but we're still going steady. Oh, if we just had the
opportunity to pare down our dependence to the point that Saudi
opinion would no longer be a consideration in the formulation of U.S.
foreign policy. Voila, we can produce a significant portion of the
Saudi fraction by drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</TE>
<TE>   But this remedy has been snatched from us by an outbreak in the
U.S. Senate of the dreaded "caribou fever" (April 19). As expected,
senators from cold states were particularly vulnerable: Maine, New
Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and Illinois were hit hard. Senators
from warm states like Georgia, Hawaii and Louisiana appear to enjoy
natural immunity.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Shadow Falls Over Hope," Commentary, April 22: Kudos to Glenn
Yago for setting the record on Yasser Arafat straight. Yago and his
team rightfully wanted to maximize the potential economic benefits of
a real peace in the Middle East. Venture capital was available. Ideas
abounded. But Arafat would not listen without a final status
agreement. Instead, the people he leads still live in refugee camps
(for more than 50 years!). Instead of creating job opportunities,
Arafat finances suicide bombers who are eager to blow themselves up
knowing that their families would qualify for Saddam Hussein's blood
money.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat missed the boat by launching this bloody intifada. He could
have had a major influx of capital in order to better the lives of
his people. But then again, a leader who finances suicide bombers
doesn't really value life anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Cheryl Zwiren</LD>
<TE>   Flushing, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yago's assertion that economic viability alone could eliminate the
Palestinian plight and revive peace in the region is overly
simplistic. You have to realize that the Palestinians need their
priceless freedom and dignity before $$$. After 35 years of
consistent lies, persistent occupation and broken promises, the
Palestinians have clearly stated that enough is enough.</TE>
<TE>   What Yago sees as "Arafat's war" is nothing but warfare tactics
carried out by bitter, hopeless and humiliated people to restore
their long-stolen land and dignity. With or without Arafat, the only
solution to put out the Palestinian uprising is to eliminate the
cancerous occupation and to create a Palestinian sovereign state.
Once that is accomplished, a financial solution will definitely make
sense to the Palestinians and to us all.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail El-Shareef</TE>
<TE>   West Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To the people of the Mideast: It's time to dump both Ariel Sharon
and Arafat and deal yourselves a new hand before they get you all
killed. Let those two go off in a field somewhere and go at it mano a
mano if that's what they want. It's time for a new deal--new
leadership. Those two guys are intractable.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, our president's plan to give more money to the
Palestinians to rebuild their infrastructure will only result in more
cost-effective targets for the Israeli tanks, which are now wasting
good ammo shelling worthless rubble. The U.S. should cut off all
funds to both Israel and the Palestinians until they come to their
senses.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Reimert</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The April 21 commentary by Ralph Reed explaining the Christian
right's total support of Israel represents the triumph of ideology
over morality. Reed and other apologists consider the Middle East in
black-and-white terms; i.e. the Israelis can do no wrong and the
Palestinians can do no right. The humanitarian impulse he describes
for the Jewish people apparently does not exist for the suffering
Palestinians, even if some of them may be fellow Christians.</TE>
<TE>   Reed and other toadies for Israel are part of the problem, as they
are more radical in their political views than most of the Israeli
electorate. Hence, they do nothing to promote peace or love of fellow
man. Not very Christian!</TE>

<LD>The corporate brand-naming game has only just begun ("In the Name of
Profits," editorial, April 20). We may soon see a city hall renamed
"Burger King Hall." We may arrange to meet one another at the corner
of Froot Loops Avenue and Eastman Kodak Road. The real breakthrough
will come when cash-strapped families accept payment to name their
children after corporate donors. After all, there is a tradition of
naming children after a rich relative in the hope of being remembered
in the will; why not get the cash now?</LD>
<LD>   Philip Morris Johnson is obvious, but how about Verizon Jones? Or
Safeway Smith? Cingular Wireless Adams? Then there's Lucky Strike
Donahue, Ebay Harris, Nabisco Schultz. The possibilities are endless.
So, apparently, is what the public is willing to tolerate.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Alberto Beltran Garcia, 80, a noted painted, engraver and political
cartoonist in Mexico, died Friday at a Mexico City hospital of
complications from a cerebral hemorrhage.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Mexico City, Beltran began studying art when he was 15 and
soon landed a job drawing illustrations for several local publishers.
His illustrations were so popular that readers began snapping up
books that contained his work, bolstering a publishing industry that
was struggling through a prolonged sales slump.</LD>
<LD>   In the late 1940s, Beltran began drawing political cartoons and
illustrations for leading daily newspapers in Mexico City and across
the country. Later he used his industry connections to found the
now-closed, image-driven newspaper El Popular. He also helped start
the Mexico City daily El Dia.</LD>
<TE>   Beltran turned his attention to painting, engraving and sculpting.
In 1956, he won Mexico's National Engraving Prize and was invited to
a number of Latin American conferences on painting and engraving.</TE>

<HD>Jay Chiat, 70; Groundbreaking L.A. Ad Man</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jay Chiat, the advertising executive whose firm created the
drum-beating Energizer bunny and introduced Apple as the "computer
for the rest of us," died of prostate cancer early Tuesday at his
Venice beach home. He was 70.</LD>
<LD>   Chiat was credited with making Los Angeles an advertising
powerhouse in the 1980s and 1990s with a new "West Coast style" of
subtle logos and strong messages.</LD>
<LD>   In one of his firm's most famous campaigns, Chiat/Day emblazoned
billboards in Los Angeles and 10 other cities during the 1984 Olympic
Games with awe-inspiring pictures of famous athletes such as Carl
Lewis, Joan Benoit and John McEnroe. The only sales pitch was
oblique: just a small Nike swoosh in one corner.</LD>
<TE>   Another Chiat/Day ad, one of the most studied in American
marketing, unveiled the Apple Macintosh during the 1984 Super Bowl.
The commercial featured a woman smashing through a giant image of Big
Brother--but no picture of the new machine or description of its
capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "You have an individual who was remarkably creative and had a
unique way of establishing an identity for products," said David
Stewart, a professor of marketing and dean of faculty at the Marshall
School of Business at USC. "He was a definer of a particular style
within the industry, a West Coast style with a strong personality At
this moment, there is no one who is doing it as well."</TE>
<TE>   Chiat's creativity, however, often conflicted with the realities
of running his agency. Even in the notoriously volatile world of
advertising, Chiat/Day stood out for its ability to alienate clients,
many of whom left the firm. He also made poor business decisions,
loading the agency with debt in a bid to broaden its reach.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Chiat sold the agency in 1995 to Omnicom Group Inc.,
which merged the agency into its TBWA Advertising unit, Chiat/Day
employed 850 people but was heavily encumbered and no longer working
with Nike, Apple or American Express Co.</TE>
<TE>   Chiat was born in the Bronx and grew up in New Jersey, where he
attended Rutgers University. A stint in the Air Force brought him to
California, where he began as a copy writer for an agency in Orange
County in the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   He joined forces with writer Guy Day in 1968, creating the agency
that bears his name. Once there, Chiat discovered what might have
been his greatest talent: leading.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the spiritual creative director," Chiat told The Times in
1985. "[I create] the right environment for creativity."</TE>
<TE>   An art and design aficionado, Chiat created environments that got
almost as much press as he did. Chiat had architect Frank Gehry
design Chiat/Day's former headquarters in Venice, most notable for
the enormous pair of binoculars that serve as the agency's entrance.</TE>
<TE>   IBM had pioneered the "virtual office" of temporary spaces, with
no permanent offices; Chiat took it one step further. Employees had
lockers in which to store personal items and their choice of places
to sit.</TE>
<TE>   Designed, one Chiat employee said, to "stir the creative juices,"
the new office invited workers who came in to the headquarters to
shoot pool, beat a punching bag, hang out in the "clubhouse" meeting
area or get a massage.</TE>
<TE>   Doing work meant plugging in a laptop computer and phone and
setting up shop for the day in a wild surrounding of comfortable
furniture and changeable spaces.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a frustrated architect," Chiat told a Times reporter in 1999.
"I have a need to build environments because I believe an environment
impacts the quality of work and the kind of people you can attract."</TE>
<TE>   Known for being fiercely hard-driving and opinionated, Chiat
nonetheless had egalitarian ideals--all aimed at stoking the
creativity he prized.</TE>
<TE>   When he ran the firm, his seemingly endless demands on employees
caused some to dub it "Chiat/Day &amp; Night." Yet during the summers,
employees were allowed to take every other Friday off. On the last
Friday of the month, Chiat held a lunch or party for everyone from
receptionists to top executives.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Clow, the chairman and worldwide creative director for
TBWA/Worldwide and TBWA/Chiat/Day who called Chiat his teacher, told
The Times several years ago that Chiat was "the original 'It's not
good enough' guy."</TE>
<TE>   Stories of the egos at the agency telling clients to do campaigns
their way or find another agency was a charge Chiat said years later
was overblown. Still, Chiat built his office as a democracy of space,
with no offices and no executive washrooms.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the agency, Chiat remained eager to participate in
the next big thing. In 1998, he signed on for a brief stint running
Screaming Media, to jump-start the content provider he invested in
along with former American Express chief executive Jim Robinson. He
held the title of chairman emeritus when he died.</TE>
<TE>   "He taught us to be brave and smart and love the work," Clow said
in a statement. "His name as well as his passion will always be part
of this agency. And the best thing we can do to honor his memory is
to every day try and do something great...."</TE>
<TE>   Chiat is survived by his wife, Edwina von Gal, three children and
10 grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A family representative said that Chiat's remains will be cremated
and that plans for a private memorial service are still being made.</TE>

<HD>Helen Sobell, 84; Activist Fought to Save Lives of
Rosenbergs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Helen Levitov Sobell, who fought unsuccessfully to save the lives of
convicted spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, then waged a massive and
protracted campaign to free their co-defendant--her husband,
Morton--from prison after his conviction in the notorious Cold
War-era trial, has died.</LD>
<LD>   A tenacious and intellectually vigorous woman who overcame polio
in her youth and earned a doctorate at 62, Sobell died April 15 in a
Redwood City, Calif., nursing home after a long struggle with
Alzheimer's disease. She was 84.</LD>
<LD>   In 1951, she devoted herself to one of the most unpopular causes
of her day: keeping the Rosenbergs out of the electric chair at the
height of McCarthyism. After they became the first Americans executed
for espionage, she focused her efforts on Morton Sobell, charging
that the evidence against him was manufactured and that his 30-year
sentence symbolized the excesses of Cold War mania.</LD>
<TE>   "She tried to make sure her husband wasn't the forgotten man,"
said William Wolf, a New York film critic who handled publicity for
the National Committee to Secure Justice for Morton Sobell, which his
wife headed.</TE>
<TE>   She organized mass meetings, led picketers outside the White House
and traveled widely to solicit support, earning endorsements from
such luminaries as Bertrand Russell and Pablo Picasso. She raised an
estimated $1million for her husband's fight, which included eight
unsuccessful appeals.</TE>
<TE>   She conducted these campaigns in defiance of the norms for women
in the 1950s, balancing her activism against raising two children and
struggling to maintain a relationship with her husband.</TE>
<TE>   "She was always a survivor.... She really was able to invent
herself," said her daughter, Sydney Gurewitz Clemens, an early
childhood expert who lives in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Sobell is also survived by a son, Mark Sobell of Menlo Park, five
grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, a sister and two brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Washington, D.C., Sobell trained as a teacher. In 1938,
she married Clarence Darrow Gurewitz, a Communist Party member, and
became a mother a year later. During World War II, she worked in
Washington as a technician for the Bureau of Standards.</TE>
<TE>   Her unhappy marriage to Gurewitz ended in divorce in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   That year she married Sobell, who had been a radar expert in the
Navy. They moved to New York City, where their son was born and Helen
Sobell returned to school. She earned a master's in physics from
Columbia University in 1950 and worked at Reeves Instrument Co.,
where her husband was employed in secret military projects.</TE>
<TE>   Both Sobells had been involved in radical politics as members of
the Young Communist League and had friends and relatives who were
members of the Communist Party. However, at Reeves, each had signed a
loyalty oath denying any Communist connections.</TE>
<TE>   By 1950, the House Un-American Activities Committee was
intensifying its search for subversives in the government and leaders
of the American Communist Party were being arrested. Having perjured
themselves by signing non-Communist affidavits, the Sobells knew they
could be indicted.</TE>
<TE>   At the close of the school year in 1950, they decided to take the
family on a vacation to Mexico, where they would ponder the future.
Shortly after their arrival, they learned of the arrest of Julius
Rosenberg, Morton Sobell's friend and former classmate, on charges
that he belonged to a Soviet spy ring. Ethel Rosenberg's arrest soon
followed. Sure that Morton Sobell's connection to the Rosenbergs
would surface, the Sobells decided to return to the States and face
the uncertainties ahead.</TE>
<TE>   But their plans for a peaceful return were dashed on the evening
of Aug. 16, 1950, when Mexican agents burst into their Mexico City
apartment and kidnapped Morton Sobell. He was transported to Texas,
where he was arrested on charges that he conspired with the
Rosenbergs to commit espionage.</TE>
<TE>   He was linked to the Rosenbergs by two pieces of evidence: the
testimony of a former neighbor, and his flight to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   At trial he was overshadowed by the Rosenbergs, who were denounced
by the judge as atom spies and sentenced to die.</TE>
<TE>   Before their deaths, Helen Sobell threw herself into the
activities of the National Committee to Secure Justice in the
Rosenberg Case. She appealed for clemency, addressed rallies, lobbied
opinion-makers and raised money for activities such as the
publication of the entire record of the Rosenberg-Sobell trial.</TE>
<TE>   She apparently was so effective that prison authorities told
Morton Sobell they would not ship him to Alcatraz, which was reserved
for the most vicious criminals, if his wife would stop agitating for
the committee. "Helen was a thorn in their sides," he wrote in "On
Doing Time," his 1974 memoir.</TE>
<TE>   She led demonstrators outside the White House until the moment the
Rosenbergs were electrocuted at Sing Sing prison, on June 19, 1953.</TE>
<TE>   After their deaths, she devoted herself to winning her husband's
release.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Rosenbergs' guilt remains a topic of contentious
debate 50 years later, analysts today say the case against Morton
Sobell, based largely on the word of one witness, was flimsy at best.</TE>
<TE>   The petite dark-haired Helen Sobell took her husband's case to the
court of public opinion, traveling around the world to garner
support--and being ejected from France twice in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Although her bout with polio made walking painful, she marched
outside the White House many times to plead for presidential
intervention. "A question, Mr. President--why haven't you freed my
innocent husband?" read one of her placards. Another time, referring
to the Jewish day of atonement, her sign read, "Mr. President: Today
Is Yom Kippur ... Free My Husband, Morton Sobell!"</TE>
<TE>   She was involved in prison reform, winning one of the few
exceptions to the prohibition on visits from inmates' children at
Alcatraz in the late 1950s, when their school-age son--a toddler when
his father was arrested--was finally permitted to see him.</TE>
<TE>   She also garnered some publicity when she petitioned federal
prison officials for a conjugal visit so that she and her husband
could conceive another child. "I think it is a human and natural
request," she said at the time. The petition was denied.</TE>
<TE>   Her activism incurred the scrutiny of the FBI and its director, J.
Edgar Hoover. Through the Freedom of Information Act, she obtained
many pages of her extensive FBI file, which revealed the agency's
machinations against the Sobells, including attempts to weaken their
marriage by informing Morton Sobell of her infidelities.</TE>
<TE>   The effort failed, however, because the FBI did not know that the
Sobells had agreed that she could take on lovers while he was in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   In his memoir, Sobell wrote candidly of the pressures on their
marriage and how they maintained their ardor through letters that one
warden deemed "too erotic" for the prisoner's good. His frankness
about how they managed to be intimate, even when separated by glass
panels, shed light on the emotional life of a prisoner but also "hurt
her very badly," Clemens, her daughter, said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sobells' marriage broke up in 1980, 11 years after Morton
Sobell was ordered released from prison by a U.S. Court of Appeals.
He had served 18 years, with credit for time served.</TE>
<TE>   The year the marriage ended, Helen Sobell earned her doctorate in
computer education from Teachers College at Columbia University. She
moved to San Francisco in 1981 and taught briefly at Contra Costa
College.</TE>
<TE>   She also was active in the Gray Panthers of San Francisco and a
group called Options for Women Over 40 until about 10 years ago, when
she began to show signs of Alzheimer's.</TE>
<TE>   Morton Sobell, who remarried and lives in San Francisco,
acknowledged this week that his wife's prolonged efforts did not
shorten his time behind bars, but "sometimes the fight is the thing,"
he said. Although he wouldn't characterize his former wife as the
fighting type before his arrest, "she developed into one. ... There
are people who rise to the occasion and she was one of them."</TE>

<CX>   Sobell obituary--An obituary of Helen Levitov Sobell in Wednesday's
California section stated that the guilt of convicted spies Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg is still a matter of wide debate. It should have noted
that the U.S. government released intercepted Soviet messages in 1995
that identified the Rosenbergs as atomic spies. The documents appear to
end any doubts about the guilt of the Rosenbergs, who were executed in
1953 for conspiracy to commit espionage.</CX>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Heidenreich, who won two gold medals swimming for the United
States at the 1972 Olympics, has died. He was 52.</LD>
<LD>   Heidenreich died Thursday at his home in Paris, Texas, in an
apparent suicide, according to a police spokesman. Heidenreich had
suffered a stroke last summer and never seemed to regain his health.</LD>
<LD>   Heidenreich won four medals--two gold, one silver and one
bronze--at the 1972 Games in Munich. Although he never gained the
worldwide reputation of fellow Olympian Mark Spitz, who won seven
swimming gold medals in 1972, his name was recognized in Texas, where
he later became a professional swimming instructor.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1972 Games, Heidenreich won gold as a member of the 4 x
100-meter freestyle relay team and the 4 x 100-meter medley relay
team. He won silver in the 100-meter freestyle, finishing second to
Spitz, and bronze in the 100-meter butterfly, finishing behind Spitz
and Canadian Bruce Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas native did his college swimming at Southern Methodist
University, where he was selected an All-American four consecutive
years.</TE>
<TE>   He won 18 individual Southwest Conference titles, one NCAA title
and set the world record in 200-meter freestyle.</TE>
<TE>   He missed going to the 1968 Olympics by one one-hundredth of a
second in the 100-meter butterfly.</TE>
<TE>   Heidenreich graduated from SMU in 1972 with a business degree.</TE>
<TE>   He operated the Aquatic Academy in Dallas and Paris.</TE>
<TE>   He also founded the Academy of Texas Aquatic Champions.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by a son, a brother and a sister.</TE>

<HD>3 Andersen Units Join Rival Firms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>MILAN, Italy</DL>
<LD>Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu will combine with Arthur Andersen's Italian
practice and Ernst &amp; Young will merge with the Malaysian and
Luxembourg affiliates as the two firms divide Andersen's non-U.S.
units.</LD>
<LD>   Deloitte has agreed to link with 12 of Andersen's overseas
practices and Ernst &amp; Young has snapped up 15 after an agreement for
a global merger outside the U.S. between Andersen Worldwide and KPMG
International broke up last month.</LD>
<LD>   Since then KPMG has reached agreements with just three Andersen
businesses--South Africa, Japan and Nigeria. The fragmentation of the
overseas business may benefit both Andersen employees and their new
partners by preserving jobs and warding off lawsuits connected with
the collapse of Enron Corp., industry experts said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's surprising how little KPMG has come away with, but they had
mixed feelings every step of the way regarding liabilities," said
Damian Wild, editor of Accountancy Age, a British trade publication.
"Andersen people have come out best by playing Deloitte and Ernst &amp;
Young off KPMG."</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young has taken over Andersen affiliates in Australia, New
Zealand, Chile, Norway, Argentina, France, Switzerland, Russia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg and
Malaysia.</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte has picked up Andersen's businesses in Taiwan, Britain,
Portugal, Spain, Mexico, Brazil, Belgium, Sweden, the Netherlands,
Canada and Denmark, as well as Italy. The British business is
Andersen's biggest outside the U.S., while the Spanish and Italian
units are the biggest accounting firms in their respective countries.</TE>
<TE>   And PricewaterhouseCoopers has acquired Andersen's business in
China, Hong Kong and in the Middle East, where Andersen operates in
12 countries, according to spokesman John Bunn.</TE>

<HD>Brazil's Economy Seen as Finally Heating Up</HD>
<DH>Monetary reforms and an improving trade surplus have
spurred growth. Hurdles remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a decade of false starts, optimism is running high that
Brazil's economy may finally take off this year and enable the nation
to get closer to its ambition of becoming a major global economic
power.</LD>
<LD>   But there's a political caveat: the rising popularity of a
far-left candidate in this November's presidential election who has
said he would reverse some of the economic reforms of the last eight
years if elected.</LD>
<LD>   Those economic reforms are one of the reasons for the optimism and
are seen as critical to Brazil's turnaround, economists say.</LD>
<TE>   Another key factor behind the positive view is a growing trade
surplus, thanks to rising sales for Brazilian exports such as
automobiles and orange juice concentrate. Also seen as good news is
the decline of inflation due to tough monetary policy enforced by
central bank chief Arminio Fraga, a former associate of financier
George Soros.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty bullish on Brazil. Almost everything is going well,"
said Lawrence Krohn, ING Barings economist in New York.</TE>
<TE>   A recovery would help Brazil fulfill its promise as Latin
America's second-largest economy behind Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Political instability, hyperinflation and skyrocketing budget
deficits, among other problems, have in the past throttled Brazil's
ambition of becoming a leading economic power.</TE>
<TE>   The Brazilian economy is expected to grow 2.5% this year, up from
1.5% last year. That growth comes amid dimmer prospects elsewhere in
Latin America, where the regional economy is expected to grow only
about 0.6%. Mexico will grow only about 1.5%, according to Merrill
Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   Several portfolio strategists are "overweighting" Brazilian stocks
because they see them as the biggest profit opportunities in Latin
America. A strong market performance is expected as a payoff for
sound government economic policy in recent years, the result of tax
and spending reforms from the administration of President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso.</TE>
<TE>   "The government continues to adopt prudent, well-managed economic
policies running primary fiscal surpluses--that's the budget balance
not including debt payments--and keeping inflation low," said Jose
Carlos Faria, head Brazilian economist in Deutsche Bank's Sao Paulo
office. Brazil's inflation rate is expected to be 7.5% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil has shown itself to be virtually immune to the problems of
Argentina, whose economy has been in a recession for nearly four
years.</TE>
<TE>   But the wild card in Brazil, as so often has been the case, is
political. Leftist presidential candidate Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva
has soared in the latest presidential survey, garnering nearly twice
the support of government-backed candidate Jose Serra, a former
health minister.</TE>
<TE>   Amid recent chaos in Venezuela, the prospect of any country
electing another populist firebrand scares investors.</TE>
<TE>   "Lula has expressed the view that he doesn't favor a
market-oriented policy, the opening up of the economy or the type of
policies that enhance productivity and efficiency in areas such as
labor," which Brazil needs, said Sebastian Edwards, a professor at
UCLA's Anderson School.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Heywood, senior analyst at Montgomery Asset Management in San
Francisco, said the outcome of the presidential election cannot yet
be predicted.</TE>
<TE>   Lula "is a populist and he has made statements about wanting to
renegotiate foreign debt," which scares the markets, Heywood said.
"They have seen that movie before in Argentina."</TE>
<TE>   "Lula would be a disaster for the economy and for the markets,"
ING's Krohn said.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil, which imports a third of its oil, also has been hurt by
rising energy prices and the inflationary pressures that has created.
Those pressures have forced the central bank to keep Brazil's
benchmark interest rates at about 18.5%--much higher than they and
investors would like--so as to dampen consumer demand.</TE>
<TE>   Rates that high choke off credit, demand and potential growth,
said Paulo Levy, coordinator at the Institute for Applied Economic
Research think tank in Rio de Janeiro.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the political and inflation fears, Brazil's most
closely watched stock index, the Bovespa, is down 2.6% this year in
local currency terms, better than the 4.1% drop in the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 but still a disappointment for managers who had bet on a
breakout year for Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's main share index is up 16.2% in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the weakness in stocks, Krohn notes that there have been
payoffs elsewhere for Brazilian investors. The currency has slowly
but steadily rebounded in value against the dollar this year, and
Brazilian bonds are among the biggest gainers in emerging markets.</TE>
<TE>   Several years of effective economic management have reduced the
tide of Brazil's fiscal red ink. Its current account deficit--the
trade balance plus the cost of servicing debt--should fall as low as
$20 billion this year from $30 billion in 1999, Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Brazil will receive foreign direct investment matching
that deficit, it won't have to borrow foreign capital to finance it,
another positive for investors.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's trade is finally producing the surpluses that observers
have been expecting since the country's January 1999 currency
devaluation, an event that was supposed to have made Brazil's
commodities and manufactured goods big sellers on global markets.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil last year posted a trade surplus of $2.6 billion, its first
since 1994. The surplus could go as high as $4.5 billion this year,
Levy said.</TE>

<HD>Tax Relief for Californians</HD>
<DH>Legislature: Bills will bring state laws on
retirement-account contributions into line with federal changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California residents, so far locked out of the increased retirement
and tuition savings opportunities afforded by last summer's federal
tax law changes, should get relief soon, state officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Three bills to bring state laws into conformity with the federal
changes are expected to become law by next month. The changes would
be retroactive to Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   A sweeping revision of federal tax laws last summer raised the
limits for contributions to individual retirement accounts, education
IRAs and 401(k), 403(b) and 457 savings plans starting this year. But
California laws didn't automatically conform with the federal
changes, leaving state residents at risk of breaking the law if they
raised their savings contributions.</LD>
<TE>   The state didn't rush to conform to the federal changes because of
the cost: The higher savings limits for the tax-sheltered accounts
will mean about $44 million in lost state tax revenue, at a time when
California is facing a $12-billion budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, "Californians should have the same tax-deferred
retirement savings opportunities that most American workers already
have," said state Sen. Jack Scott (D-Burbank), who sponsored one of
three conformity bills. "It would be wrong for the state to deny them
until next year or beyond."</TE>
<TE>   The federal changes boosted annual IRA contribution limits to
$3,000 from $2,000 and raised maximum annual contributions to 401(k),
403(b) and 457 retirement savings plans to $11,000 this year,
increasing by $1,000 a year thereafter to $15,000 by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the maximum annual contribution to education IRAs was raised
to $2,000 from $500.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the conformity bills--one in the Senate, the other in the
Assembly--would raise savings limits for Californians to match the
federal changes.</TE>
<TE>   The bills are expected to pass this week, then go to Gov. Gray
Davis, who is favorably disposed to sign them, spokesman Russ Lopez
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature already has delivered one conformity bill to
Davis. The change in the law would remove certain restrictions on
public employee pension programs--so-called 457 plans--making the
plans interchangeable with 401(k) savings plans, for example. That is
expected to boost the "portability" of plan assets when workers move
between the public and private sectors.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the law change would allow public employees to buy
service credits in so-called defined-benefit plans--the type of
pension that pays a monthly benefit for life. Lopez said Davis also
expects to sign this bill.</TE>

<HD>Corning to Cut More Jobs, Capital Spending</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Corning Inc., the world's largest maker of fiber-optic cable, said
Tuesday that its planned restructuring to return to profitability
will include a further 12.5% reduction in its work force and lower
capital spending.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Financial Officer James Flaws said the company plans to cut
up to 4,000 salaried workers from its 32,000-person work force.
Corning cut 12,000 jobs last year, mostly hourly workers.</LD>
<LD>   Flaws repeated that the firm's expected restructuring and
impairment charges of about $600million in the second and third
quarters will be about 40% cash.</LD>
<TE>   Although fiber shipments are rising again quarter to quarter, the
pricing environment remains brutal, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concerns continue to revolve around pricing pressures in the
fiber business that can eat at sales growth and profitability even as
units improve off of the incredible lows in" the fourth quarter, said
Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Corning's stock dipped nearly 3% on Tuesday, closing at $6.80
after falling 20 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The company, based in Corning, N.Y., late Monday posted a
first-quarter loss of $90 million, or 10 cents a share, on sales of
$898 million. It also said second-quarter revenue would be up
slightly--but still short of expectations--and repeated it remains
committed to return to profitability in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "Given that our revenues are basically flattening here and having
achieved bottom, we don't expect to see big changes in our production
worker group, but we do expect to see significant reductions of
salaried people at all levels," Flaws told analysts on a conference
call Tuesday. Most of the latest restructuring will occur in
money-losing telecom units, which make up about 70% of revenue.</TE>
<TE>   A Corning official said the firm would try to avoid closing
plants.</TE>

<HD>Ads in Ethnic Media Make Impression</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's ethnic media reach nearly 90% of the state's Latino,
African American and Asian American consumers, according to a study
released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   And in a heads-up to advertisers, the study also showed that about
40% of ethnic consumers polled said they generally pay more attention
to advertisements in the ethnic media than in the general market
media.</LD>
<LD>   By comparison, 33% said they focused more on general market ads,
according to the study released by New California Media, an
association of more than 400 print, broadcast and online ethnic media
organizations.</LD>
<TE>   The study is at least the third released since 1999 to focus on
the growing punch of ethnic media. But industry experts said that
despite its expanding reach, the share of advertising dollars going
to ethnic media remains below 2% of all advertising dollars spent in
the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Funded with $130,000 from several sources including the James
Irvine Foundation and the American Assn. of Advertising Agencies, the
study was conducted by Bendixen &amp; Associates, a Florida-based
research firm.</TE>
<TE>   Based on interviews with 2,000 Asian Americans, Latinos and
African Americans, the study completed in March found that 84% of the
respondents had some contact with ethnic publications or broadcast
outlets.</TE>
<TE>   More than half (53%) said they prefer ethnic TV, radio or
newspapers to their English-language or "general market"
counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   There are signs that advertisers are beginning to pay attention to
sentiments like those.</TE>
<TE>   At Univision's KMEX-TV Channel 34 in L.A., national advertising
has increased in the last six to eight years, said spokeswoman
Patricia Ramos, although she could not provide specific figures.</TE>
<TE>   "Several national advertisers are looking to Latino consumers
because they have the income to buy their products," Ramos said,
citing auto service providers, beauty product companies, food
retailers, restaurant chains and beverage makers.</TE>
<TE>   Liam McGee, president of Bank of America California, said the bank
has "quadrupled" spending in Spanish language and Asian dialect
broadcast outlets for 2002, compared with last year. That outstrips,
proportionately, the spending increase for mainstream media, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the study also found that more than half of the respondents
had incomes of under $40,000 and were renters, demographics that
would dissuade advertisers of some products, acknowledged Sandy
Close, New California Media's executive director.</TE>

<HD>Oil Giant Exxon Mobil's Earnings Tumble 58%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company,
said first-quarter earnings fell 58% as oil and natural gas prices
plunged and the refining industry had its worst profit slump since
the 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $2.09 billion, or 30 cents a share, from $5
billion, or 71 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue
declined 24% to $43.5 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The fuel business had a loss of $28million, compared with a
$1-billion profit, because a mild winter hurt demand for heating oil
and airlines bought less jet fuel after Sept. 11, which reduced
travel. In recent weeks, energy prices and the refining business have
shown signs of improving, Chief Executive Lee Raymond said.</LD>
<TE>   The Irving, Texas-based company earned $2.15 billion, or 31 cents
a share, excluding a $60-million expense related to the 1999
Exxon-Mobil merger. It had been expected to earn 39 cents, the
average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Exxon Mobil fell 50 cents, or 1.2%, to $41.35 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The stock has fallen 5.7% this month and is 2.9%
lower than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   A weak refining market this winter probably will mean larger
losses than expected from the oil industry during the quarter,
Prudential Securities analyst Michael Mayer said.</TE>
<TE>   Rival refiners Phillips Petroleum Co., Sunoco Inc. and Tesoro
Petroleum Corp. have already said they will post losses for the
period. BP, the world's third-largest oil company, said earlier this
month that the refining industry in the first quarter was less
profitable than at any time in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   The combination of declining demand and thin profits from refining
and fuel sales "led to a downstream margin environment that was the
worst since the mid-'80s," Raymond said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts underestimated Exxon's profit decline because the company
"provides no guidance whatsoever on anything," leaving analysts to
gauge its performance based on oil prices, economic conditions and
the results of its peers, said Gerard Klauer Mattison analyst Michael
Young.</TE>
<TE>   Exxon Mobil, the largest U.S. refiner, said it was squeezed by a
jump in oil prices from the fourth quarter, which increased its costs
faster than the company was able to increase prices for fuels such as
gasoline and heating oil.</TE>
<TE>   Exxon Mobil's U.S. refining profit fell 97% to $14million from
$409million. Outside the U.S., the business had a loss of $42million,
contrasted with a profit of $590million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings from oil and gas production fell 47% to $2.01billion from
the same period a year earlier, the company said.</TE>

<HD>Analysts Keeping Eyes on Fiber Optics Sector</HD>
<DH>Outlook: The industry's fate is uncertain as demand for
data networks weakens and bankruptcy filings rise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Continuing troubles in the telecommunications industry are sparking a
new round of bankruptcy filings among the many network operators that
are teetering on the edge of extinction, industry analysts said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Upstart Williams Communications Group Inc., which filed for
bankruptcy protection Monday, is the latest victim among an army of
fiber-optic network companies that have been devastated in the last
year by a combination of falling prices, persistent overcapacity and
crushing debt payments.</LD>
<LD>   Several more network operators, among them Level 3 Communications
Inc., Metromedia Fiber Network Inc., TyCom Ltd. and Broadwing Inc.,
are now widely considered candidates for bankruptcy protection,
depending on their ability to appease their bankers and bondholders,
said Scott Cleland, an analyst with Precursor Group in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   The telecommunications industry as a whole has fallen so far that
investors now wonder about the survival of giants such as WorldCom
Inc., which carries the largest share of this country's Internet
traffic, and grew to be a powerhouse through the purchase of MCI and
other companies.</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, the nation's telecommunications companies were
counted among Wall Street's favorites, considered key to a growing
economy coursing with ever-growing amounts of data and Internet
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The companies and their investors never contemplated an economy so
weak that the newly built networks would be begging for data.</TE>
<TE>   But today, the companies are in deep trouble. A recent report by
Carter Pate of PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that there would be
about 200 bankruptcy filings this year among publicly traded firms,
and that telecommunications companies "will represent a significant
share of those companies."</TE>
<TE>   Pate said many in the communications industry argued with him over
his downbeat projection when it was released at the start of the
year. Now, however, it seems clear that telecommunications companies
are "not out of the woods yet," Pate said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the many fiber-network companies now in Bankruptcy Court are
Global Crossing Ltd., 360 Networks Inc. of Canada, Flag Telecom
Holdings Ltd., ESpire Communications Inc. and others.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say that the companies most vulnerable to bankruptcy
filings now are those that spent heavily to build fiber-optic
networks and have few other sources of income. Their primary source
of income is the sale of capacity on their respective data networks.
With that revenue plummeting and no substantial substitute for
income, debt payments become increasingly difficult to manage.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Level 3 planned to sell its few non-communications
assets to raise cash and pay down debt. Level 3 reported
better-than-expected first-quarter results Tuesday, but with red ink
still flowing, the relative good news has not convinced Wall Street
of the company's staying power.</TE>
<TE>   Metromedia Fiber, meanwhile, said Tuesday that it expects to
restate its 2001 results to a loss of up to $5.36 billion because its
accountants refused to sign off on the company's audit. The White
Plains, N.Y.-based company, which faces possible delisting from
Nasdaq, also defaulted last week on a $30-million interest payment to
Verizon Communications Inc. and may be considered a bankruptcy filing
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "Those pure-plays have it tough, because fiber is a monopolizing
technology, and fiber optic technology advances just undermine
competition," Precursor's Cleland said.</TE>
<TE>   With each improvement to the technology, companies can send
ever-more data down a single strand of glass--a phenomenon that will
continue to exacerbate the industry's overcapacity troubles even if
network construction stayed dormant for years.</TE>
<TE>   But even the most distressed pure-play companies still hope to
survive--if they can restructure their crushing debt load. Tulsa,
Okla.-based Williams said it has struck a deal with its principal
creditors, lenders and bondholders to reduce the company's debt by
about $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Industry watchers, however, have their doubts. "It'll take some
magic and pixie dust to survive," Cleland said. "We're going to see
more and more carnage."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say that companies like Qwest Communications
International Inc., by contrast, have a much better chance of
survival because they have steady income from other sources. Qwest
has a profitable local phone service business, formerly known as U.S.
West. Analysts say Qwest also can raise funds by selling its
directory and other businesses, raising up to $10 billion altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Such moves may buy Qwest and others enough time to make it through
the industry's meltdown. But it's not a guarantee.</TE>
<TE>   "WorldCom is trading under $5 ... who would have thought," said
Vik Grover, a telecommunications analyst at Kaufman Bros. "Wall
Street has walked away from this sector ... and it's not over."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, also
has been buffeted by shrinking demand for network capacity and
telecommunications services, and it has been criticized in recent
months for questionable accounting methods and loans to top managers.
Last week, the company slashed its capital spending budget and said
2002 sales would total about $21 billion, down from $22.6billion.</TE>
<TE>   The company's debt, once a nonissue, is a substantial burden now
that long-distance revenue is in free-fall. On Tuesday, Moody's
Investors Service cut WorldCom's credit rating two levels, a move
that mirrors a similar reduction at Standard &amp; Poor's and leaves the
Clinton, Miss.-based telecommunications provider dangerously close to
junk bond status.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's stock price, which has fallen nearly 80% in the last
year, dropped still lower in recent days. On Tuesday, the company's
shares closed at $3.41, down 60 cents, or 15%. The stock was Nasdaq's
most-actively traded issue, with more than 256 million shares
changing hands.</TE>
<TE>   "People are thinking that this company is going under, I guess,
and that's unbelievable," Grover said. "Now we're walking away from
the bellwethers of the sector ... companies that carry defense and
government data, and that are very crucial to the economy."</TE>

<HD>President of National Golf Resigns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>National Golf Properties Inc., which is pursuing a controversial
merger with sister company American Golf Corp., on Tuesday announced
the resignation of company President James Stanich.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica company declined to provide a reason for his
resignation or say whether there are plans to replace him. Stanich,
the son-in-law of National Golf founder and Chairman David Price,
will remain on the board.</LD>
<LD>   The Stanich resignation is part of the management shake-up that
hit National Golf and American Golf after the companies' February
merger announcement. This month, American Golf Co-Chief Executive Joe
Guerra left after 15 years to "pursue other interests," according to
a company statement. Guerra directed the firm's aggressive expansion
during the 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Despite objections from some major shareholders, National Golf has
agreed to acquire American Golf, which suffered a substantial drop in
business in the wake of last year's terrorist attacks, a weakening
economy and a glut of competing courses. American Golf leases and
operates most of National Golf's nearly 140 courses. The two
companies combined would form the largest owner and operator of golf
courses and resorts, with more than 250 properties worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The merger is opposed by two large National Golf shareholders,
Cliffwood Partners of Brentwood and investment partnerships
controlled by San Francisco-based Farallon Capital Management. The
firms combined own about 18% of National Golf common stock.</TE>
<TE>   Cliffwood and Farallon executives have said the merger primarily
benefits Price and his family, who own major stakes in National and
American, at the expense of other shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   National Golf shares rose 41 cents to $7.92 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hilton Hotels Corp., the No. 3 U.S. hotel company, said first-quarter
profit fell less than expected and raised its forecast for the year
as leisure travel picked up.</LD>
<LD>   Beverly Hills-based Hilton's net income fell 38% to $34 million,
or 9 cents a share, from $55 million, or 15 cents, in the
year-earlier period. Revenue fell 14% to $921 million, Hilton Chief
Financial Officer Matthew Hart said.</LD>
<LD>   Hilton follows Marriott International Inc. in reporting
better-than-expected results as consumers spend more on travel.
Corporate travel, often the most profitable for hotel companies,
still hasn't recovered from last year, preventing hotel companies
from raising room rates, analysts and investors said.</LD>
<TE>   Hilton was expected to earn 5 cents, based on the average estimate
of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call. On the New York
Stock Exchange, Hilton shares rose 60 cents to $16.01, a two-year
high.</TE>

<HD>Fiorina Denies Misconduct  in HP Merger</HD>
<DH>Trial: CEO testifies she didn't mislead investors or coerce
votes. Damaging internal reports introduced by Hewlett lawyers don't
paint full picture, she says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WILMINGTON, Del.</DL>
<LD>Attorneys for dissident Hewlett-Packard Co. director Walter Hewlett
introduced a litany of damaging internal company reports Tuesday that
paint HP's $19-billion merger with Compaq Computer Corp. as a
disaster in the making.</LD>
<LD>   But in the first day of the trial over Hewlett's lawsuit
challenging the merger, HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina denied
misleading shareholders about the financial prospects for the
combined companies.</LD>
<LD>   And in nearly five hours of carefully choreographed testimony,
Fiorina countered allegations that she or other company officers
coerced key institutional shareholders into favoring the biggest
technology merger in history.</LD>
<TE>   She said the documents introduced by Hewlett's lawyers do not
represent the full picture.</TE>
<TE>   "If all you are showing of a movie is a single frame, that can
show a very misleading view of what's going on," Fiorina said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most damaging materials presented by Hewlett attorney
Stephen Neal in his opening arguments was a note titled "Sobering
thought," written in late February or early March by Compaq Chief
Executive Michael Capellas.</TE>
<TE>   "At our course and speed, we will fail," Capellas wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Neal excerpted several other internal reports issued shortly
before the merger vote, all of which suggested that HP and Compaq
executives knew that the integration planning process was not going
smoothly and that anticipated cost savings and profit would be far
below projections.</TE>
<TE>   A report by a team involved in planning the integration process
notes that the "second half of 2002 is pure disaster in terms of
earnings per share," and that further  projections were just as
discouraging.</TE>
<TE>   An e-mail from a key member of HP's financial staff implies that
executives may be denying harsh realities.</TE>
<TE>   "The attached is a frightening reality check," the e-mail notes.
"I see little realistic upside and I am not alone.... I sincerely
hope that we all start acknowledging the realities soon."</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina responded to Neal's questions about the case in terse,
cryptic comments that could barely be heard in the crowded courtroom
of Delaware Chancery Court Judge William Chandler III.</TE>
<TE>   She acknowledged that internal documents from March showed
earnings targets for the combined company at 25% lower than previous
projections, and that HP never disclosed the more pessimistic
projections to its board or to investors.</TE>
<TE>   But Fiorina forcefully defended her actions under
cross-examination by her own attorneys. In a carefully scripted
interchange reminiscent of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, attorney
Boris Feldman walked Fiorina through HP's elaborate process for
planning the integration of the two companies and for validating her
estimates of profit and savings, or "synergies."</TE>
<TE>   Her calculations suggest that "cost synergies were a lot bigger,
certainly, than our own publicly stated case," she testified.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina also refuted Hewlett's claim that 24,000 jobs would be cut
in the merger, sticking to HP's original estimate of no more than
15,000.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of definitive testimony, the credibility of
Fiorina's argument will become key, said Jessie Choper, a professor
of law at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "Could she reasonably have believed, in the light of other
information she had, that the memoranda that her own people generated
were not subject to disclosure?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Neal also led Fiorina through a series of questions about
allegations that HP had engaged in vote buying with Deutsche Bank.
Just before the March 19 voting deadline, HP announced that a
$4-billion line of credit would be co-arranged by Deutsche Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately after, Deutsche Asset Management, the bank's
investment unit, switched 17 million votes to favor the merger.</TE>
<TE>   That situation was enflamed two weeks ago when a voicemail message
from Fiorina to Chief Financial Officer Robert Wayman was somehow
forwarded to a newspaper reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have to do something extraordinary for [Deutsche Bank] to
bring them over the line," Fiorina said.</TE>
<TE>   The message was innocent, she said on the stand.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we had to get on an airplane, maybe we had to get a board
member to talk to them," she said. Fiorina denied that she or any HP
officer so much as suggested that any institutional shareholder be
enticed or threatened with loss of HP business to secure a favorable
merger vote.</TE>
<TE>   HP claimed a narrow victory last week in the shareholder vote to
approve the merger. If it loses in court, the merger vote, which
should be finalized within a week, could be invalidated.</TE>
<TE>   Interest in the trial drew scores of reporters and attorneys--some
of whom paid upward of $20 an hour to young people to stand in line
in front of the courthouse beginning at midnight Tuesday to ensure a
seat inside.</TE>
<TE>   Fiorina, who will be questioned again today by Hewlett's counsel,
said that HP is on track to launch the merged company May 9 if it
prevails in the trial.</TE>
<TE>   The case has been expedited by both sides in light of its
potential for disruption in HP's relations with customers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a maximum time of uncertainty and a maximum moment of
opportunity for our competitors," Fiorina said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Palo Alto-based HP fell 23 cents to $18.04 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Void of High-Tech Spending Could Stunt Recovery</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Discouraging reports add to reluctance of
corporate sector to resume high-tech investments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It's not that there aren't other things to invest in. America has a
long history of finding new gizmos to pump money into, from the steam
engine to streaming video.</LD>
<LD>   But the telecom giants that took another nose dive this week make
some of the very machinery whose purchase by corporate America
promised a happy double whammy: a boost in buying and the prospect of
enhancement in the economy's productivity or efficiency.</LD>
<LD>   So news that companies are still spurning these purchases--leaving
the giants stumbling--left many people shaken.</LD>
<TE>   A failure by the corporate sector to resume its high-tech spending
could stunt the nation's still-nascent recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "It's stopped a lot of business executives and equity investors in
their tracks," said Los Angeles economist Donald H. Straszheim.
"People just aren't going to believe it's time to go back to
investing until telecom begins recovering."</TE>
<TE>   It was Monday's spurt of discouraging telecom reports that
prompted the fresh worries. The bankruptcy filing of once-hot
Williams Communications Group Inc. came atop reports of major layoffs
at wireless equipment maker Ericsson and telecom giant Lucent
Technologies Inc. and a downbeat sales forecast from long-distance
carrier WorldCom Inc</TE>
<TE>   Although better-than-expected results at AT&amp;T Wireless Services
Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. Tuesday helped lift some of the
industry gloom, it did little to restore confidence in the notion of
a quick turnaround in corporate capital spending, which policymakers
such as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan have portrayed as
crucial to recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "What these latest problems show is we still have a long way to go
in unwinding from the bubble years," said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond
market strategist at Miller Tabak &amp; Co. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   As Greenspan and company tell it, the nation managed to dodge a
full-blown recession because of Fed interest rate cuts, a tax cut by
Congress and the Bush administration and, most important, American
consumers who kept on spending through the downturn.</TE>
<TE>   The earliest benefits came in the final quarter of last year when,
instead of shrinking as it had the quarter before, the economy
expanded at a 1.7% annual rate. New benefits probably will appear
Friday when the government releases its initial estimate of
first-quarter growth. Forecasts range from 3% to better than 6%.</TE>
<TE>   Even if growth comes in high, however, virtually every analyst
acknowledges what the recovery really needs to prosper is for
corporate America to go back to investing. But there are few signs
most companies are prepared to do so and little understanding of what
they would invest in.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan has said firms still have plenty of
productivity-enhancing opportunities. And as recently as a year ago,
the Fed chairman was explicit about what firms needed: more high-tech
gear. He appeared to criticize suppliers such as Ericsson and Lucent
for not being ready to provide more than they already were pumping
out.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not that underlying demand for Internet, networking and
communications services has become less keen," the Fed chairman
asserted in congressional testimony a year ago February. "Instead ...
some suppliers ... reacted late to accelerating demand."</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan's enthusiasm for high tech seems almost quaint from
today's vantage point. His continued reliance on a capital spending
revival may be unrealistic, several analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no application that's so compelling right now that
corporate America is going to pour a lot of money into technology,"
said Howard Anderson, a veteran venture capital investor and head of
Cambridge, Mass.-based YankeeTek Ventures. "Companies are doing just
what they should be doing, which is sitting on their hands."</TE>
<TE>   Bullish forecasters assert that there are investments that
companies can make without entering the high-tech quagmire, ones that
will help boost growth and improve corporate efficiency. For example,
heavy-truck sales are rising, said Richard Berner, chief U.S.
economist with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York, and new
semiconductor orders indicate that computer production is climbing.</TE>
<TE>   But these forecasters acknowledge that the economy's well-being
will continue to depend on consumers rather than companies for a
considerable period to come.</TE>
<TE>   Until corporate investment bounces back, the tech and telecom
sectors will continue to languish, and so, some worry, will the
economy.</TE>

<DH>Tech: Trade show's focus on security issues reflects
industry's lowered expectations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once the giddy jamboree of the dot-com craze, Internet World opens
its doors today at the Los Angeles Convention Center with a topic
capitalizing on post-Sept. 11 concerns.</LD>
<LD>   The theme of "Security Matters" covers topics such as
"Cyber-Terrorism," "The Top 10 Hacking Techniques" and "Security
Trends."</LD>
<LD>   A focus on a hot information topic--rather than the sheer frenzy
of the Internet explosion that permeated the event in the late
1990s--is Internet World's attempt to adapt to diminished
expectations. Attendance this year is projected to be well below half
the 50,000 of 1997 as tech trade shows overall have sagged.</LD>
<TE>   "It's turning lemons into lemonade," said Courtney Muller, vice
president of Internet World events, about the choice of security as
the main topic in the wake of September's terrorist attacks. "We took
a bad situation and tried to provide people with the information they
need on the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Although the public can at no charge visit the exhibit
floor--featuring booths from 150 companies, ranging from industry
giants such as America Online Inc. to boutique firms--most of the
security-themed events will take place during the show's conference
portion.</TE>
<TE>   This morning's lectures will, in the spirit of trade shows, have
to be taken with a large grain of salt. Most of the presenters on
security matters sell security equipment, software or consulting
services. It's not to their advantage to downplay potential security
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not just the main systems that are quite vulnerable," said
Tom Haigh, chief technology officer of Secure Computing Corp., which
sells firewalls and other Internet security products. He will be
giving the "Cyber-Terrorism" lecture.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone got into the [Federal Aviation Administration] air
traffic control system, that could be a huge disaster. But there are
fringe systems, too, like the ones that schedule fueling or
scheduling the airplanes. A disruption in the morning in Chicago
could affect the whole country by the afternoon."</TE>
<TE>   But the only example Haigh could cite of real-world, politically
motivated cyber-terrorism was an attempt to enter Defense Department
systems last year in connection with continuing tension in the
Balkans. Haigh said he could not elaborate because of security
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   If only one such attack has occurred, why the huge emphasis on
security?</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that there has not been a big disaster does not mean
there will not be one," Haigh said.</TE>

<HD>Treasury Widens Rules on Money Laundering</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Securities brokers, credit card companies and other businesses that
handle large financial transactions must take steps to ensure they're
not used for money laundering under rules announced Tuesday by the
U.S. Treasury.</LD>
<LD>   Treasury will require financial services firms to use many of the
same anti-money-laundering controls that banks already have in place,
such as having an internal compliance officer, training employees to
detect money laundering and reporting suspicious transactions to the
government.</LD>
<LD>   The rules are part of U.S. efforts to cut funding to terrorists
and drug traffickers and track their movements. A Treasury official
said they strike a balance between obtaining useful information on
suspected terrorists and not creating a burden on businesses. "We
only want to know enough to stop the next calamity," said David
Aufhauser, Treasury general counsel.</LD>
<TE>   The rules will cover mutual funds and operators of credit card
networks such as Visa International, MasterCard International and
American Express within the next 90 days. They also cover money
services businesses such as wire transfer companies and check
cashers, and securities and commodities brokers.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury is still studying how to apply the rules to hedge funds,
insurance firms, dealers of gems and precious metals, pawnbrokers,
loan and finance firms, travel agencies, dealers of cars, airplanes
and boats, travel agencies, telegraph firms and mortgage brokers.</TE>
<TE>   The requirements spring from a law Congress passed in October in
response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Other parts of the law,
known as the USA Patriot Act, require banks to step up monitoring of
accounts held for non-U.S. citizens and requirements on securities
dealers and brokers to report suspicious activities. Financial
institutions will be required to take steps to identify suspicious
transactions, know their customers better and inform the government
when things are amiss.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lockheed Martin Corp., the world's largest defense contractor, said
first-quarter profit more than doubled because of increased sales of
fighter aircraft and military cargo planes.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose to $218 million, or 49 cents a share, from $105
million, or 25 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 26% to $5.97 billion
from $4.75 billion, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   Lockheed delivered two C-130J transport planes in the quarter,
versus none a year earlier, and increased development work for
international sales of the F-16 fighter jet, which is being used in
Afghanistan. It also began work on the $200-billion Joint Strike
Fighter. Shares of Lockheed have risen 80% in the last year as U.S.
defense spending has grown.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a good, solid company with the wind at their back," said
Adam Friedman, asset manager for National City Investment Management.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed reaffirmed its full-year earnings forecast of $2.45 to
$2.50 a share and said 2003 profit should be 10% above 2002 earnings
on higher sales of aircraft, missiles and government services. It
sees free cash flow of at least $1billion in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Lockheed on Tuesday rose $3.08 to $62.20 on the New York
Stock Exchange. They have risen 42% since September's terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the safest company by far in defense," said Erik Becker,
an analyst with Waddell &amp; Reed, which manages $30 billion in assets,
including 9.5 million shares of Lockheed.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. last week raised its ratings on $7.5
billion in Lockheed bonds because of the company's improved finances
and debt reduction.</TE>
<TE>   Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed was expected to earn 47 cents a share
in the first quarter, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at Lockheed's military-aircraft unit rose 56% to $1.3
billion. Profit before interest and taxes rose 23% to $107 million,
helping to more than offset a 38% decline in profit at its Space
Systems unit.</TE>
<TE>   That business still operated at a loss, though the loss has fallen
from a year ago, Chief Financial Officer Christopher Kubasik said.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed also is making progress toward ending a strike by 2,600
machinists at its Georgia aircraft plant, Kubasik said.</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Bob Wood said he wasn't aware if progress had been
made in talks with Lockheed.</TE>

<HD>Fund-Raiser Needs to Accentuate the Positive</HD>

<AU>JEANETTE MARANTOS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suzanne Morgan is living proof that money doesn't buy happiness--or
even freedom from worry.</LD>
<LD>   The 40-year-old professional fund-raiser is making $100,000 a
year, has almost no debt, is happily married with two sons and is
moving from Burbank to Las Vegas to live in a city she loves and to
work at a job she enjoys.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, and there's the $120,000 trust fund for her older son's
college education and the million-dollar inheritance she expects to
get someday.</LD>
<TE>   So, what's to make over? Nothing, said financial planner Ronnie
Kahn, except Morgan's attitude about money.</TE>
<TE>   "She's carrying a lot of negative messages about money that keep
her from relaxing and appreciating all that she's done," Kahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Those feelings surfaced after Kahn suggested Morgan do a series of
exercises to probe her feelings and beliefs about money. It's an
exercise others could benefit from as well, Kahn said. For many,
money is a visceral issue, and exploring deep-seated attitudes and
fears can reveal a lot about how a person handles his or her
finances.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, when Kahn asked Morgan to spend 21/2 minutes writing
down "every word, idea, image, thought or experience that the word
'money' brings to mind," the results weren't pretty.</TE>
<TE>   "Judgment, unhappiness, pain, tired," she wrote, "change in my
pocket, mom's coupon money in the cigar box in the kitchen drawer,
deserving, mom's purse, my electric guitar, paycheck."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan knows she's well off and shouldn't worry, but she can't
help feeling she's just a step from poverty. She feels compelled to
have two jobs, when what she wants is more time to spend with her
family and to work on personal projects.</TE>
<TE>   Her attitudes about money seem to come from her father, a
self-employed electrical engineer who emphasized the importance of
saving and thrift. One of her earliest memories, she said, was when
she was 5 and asked her father for $5 from her college fund to buy a
Captain Action Adventure doll.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to go through this whole ordeal with him concerning paying
it back with interest, and it was clear from his tone of voice that
he was not pleased about this," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan believes that as a child she turned her father's "prudent
use of money" message into a judgment that equates wealth with self-
worth.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents are not like that," she said, "and it's not true for
me rationally, but emotionally, it's like 'poverty is bad, wealth is
good.'"</TE>
<TE>   Morgan's emotional tug-of-war over money obscures the fact that
she has done a good job of managing her finances over the years.</TE>
<TE>   "The basics of financial planning are 'save more, spend less and
don't do anything stupid,' and I think you've done all three," Kahn
said.</TE>
<TE>   It helps that Charles Morgan, her husband since 1998, shares her
frugal lifestyle. Money was never an issue for him when he was
growing up.</TE>
<TE>   "The impression I got from my parents was that some years were
good and some not so good, and you just take it as it comes," he
said. "I just didn't think about money. If I wanted something, I'd
wait for Christmas or my birthday." He studied art in college and
eventually got a master's degree in filmmaking and photography from
the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He stayed in Las Vegas with his
parents, doing art and working part time as an adjunct faculty member
at local colleges. He made about $15,000 a year, "which was fine with
me. It was enough to do what I needed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Now that they're moving back to Las Vegas, he's found another
teaching job that should bring in the same amount of income.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Morgan's wait-and-see attitude is a good foil for his
wife's tendency to worry, Kahn said. He noted that Suzanne Morgan
always is looking to the future, "and sometimes 'future people' work
on fear more than reality. I try to get people to have a financial
vision of where they want to be, so they can be moving toward
something positive instead of moving against fear or pain."</TE>
<TE>   In Suzanne Morgan's case, that could be spending more time with
her children and husband or working on her own art project instead of
promoting someone else's.</TE>
<TE>   It's important for Suzanne Morgan to deal with her anxieties about
money, Kahn said, because they're standing in the way of her dream of
working for herself as a full-time fund-raising consultant.</TE>
<TE>   She's already doing consulting work part time, making $16,000 to
$17,000 a year to go with the $85,000 salary that comes with her new
job managing and building the countywide library arts system in Las
Vegas. Her rational side would like to cut back to one job, but her
emotional side is afraid to let go.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn believes that Morgan, with living expenses of about $45,000 a
year, could easily support her family if she were to do consulting
full time.</TE>
<TE>   But that's a big jump for someone like her, he said, because of
her fears about being poor.</TE>
<TE>   He recommends that she take a week to figure out if she could
attract enough work as a full-time consultant to earn at least
$50,000 a year--as well as how much savings she would need to allay
her fears of impending poverty. Kahn recommends savings of at least a
year's worth of personal expenses, plus six months of business
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   If Morgan can't make the jump now, he said, she can at least set a
goal based on the savings she will need to go into business for
herself.</TE>
<TE>   "The trouble is, you'll have this tendency to say, 'Keep saving,
keep saving. I can't do it now. I'd better wait a little longer,'" he
said. "You'll have to guard against that."</TE>
<TE>   If Morgan decides to keep her new job, she can put the consulting
business on hold and reward herself with gifts of time to play with
her family or to work on a personal project.</TE>
<TE>   Even without the consulting business, Morgan and her husband could
easily put $5,000 a year into a college fund for their infant son,
start two Roth IRAs to reduce their tax burden at retirement and put
the rest of their unspent money--at least $15,000 a year--into a
diversified, conservative portfolio that's about 40% Treasury notes,
23% bonds, 32% equities and 5% real estate investment trusts, Kahn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn thinks that portfolio should average about 7% growth a year.
The Morgans don't need higher--that is, riskier--returns, he said,
because they have so much money to invest each year, and more than 25
years for that money to grow until retirement. Even with an average
increase of just 4% each year, the portfolio would grow to $600,000
by the time they retire.</TE>
<TE>   The main thing is for Suzanne Morgan to be vigilant against
negative messages about money, Kahn said. "Those messages have a way
of keeping us from the positive stuff we really want to do," he said.
"You've got to keep peeling them back, like you're doing now, and go
deeper. Stay on the positive and you'll do great."</TE>

<HD>Nasdaq Sags Near Its Low for 2002</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Slumping tech issues send index down 1.6%, but
broader market fares better.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another technology-stock sell-off Tuesday pushed the Nasdaq market
closer to its 2002 lows, while the broader market finished modestly
lower.</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite index slid 28.39 points, or 1.6%, to
1,730.29, ending near its low for the session as sellers again
hammered many software, Internet and semiconductor shares.</LD>
<LD>   That left the index in danger of falling through its 2002 closing
low of 1,716 reached Feb. 21. If it goes through that threshold it
would be back at levels last seen in October, when the market was
recovering from the three-year lows reached in September.</LD>
<TE>   But many non-tech stock sectors fared better Tuesday, limiting the
damage to other share indexes. The Dow industrials eased 47.19
points, or 0.5%, to 10,089.24. The Standard &amp; Poor's small-cap stock
index slipped 0.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Winners and losers were nearly even on the New York Stock Exchange
in active trading.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts said many investors remain worried that corporate
earnings reports are pointing to a much slower recovery in profits
this year than had been hoped.</TE>
<TE>   Chemical giant DuPont fell $1.51 to $44.84 after reporting
quarterly results and warning that commodity prices remain weak.</TE>
<TE>   "Has the economy turned or is it going back [into recession]?
These are questions people are posing right now," John O'Donoghue,
co-head of listed stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston, told
Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, long-term Treasury yields eased slightly after
the government bought back $1.5billion in debt maturing between 2019
and 2022, $500million more than analysts had expected.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, gold prices continued to edge up, with near-term
futures adding $1 to $304 an ounce in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Internet-related shares led the tech sector lower after
EarthLink said quarterly sales and earnings fell short of Wall
Street's expectations. The stock slid $1.58 to $7.95.</TE>
<TE>   Also dropping were AOL Time Warner, off 76 cents to $19.11, its
lowest since 1998; and United Online, down $1.24 to $8.45.</TE>
<TE>   Other tech shares off sharply included Adobe Systems, down $1.72
to $37.06; Rational Software, down $1.06 to $14.43; National
Semiconductor, down $1.24 to $32.46; and Broadcom, off $1.44 to
$35.46.</TE>
<TE>   * In the telecom sector, which has been hammered in recent days,
some stocks rebounded on better-than-expected quarterly reports from
wireless companies, including AT&amp;T Wireless, which rose 84 cents to
$8.94. Also, Avaya jumped 82 cents to $6.42. But WorldCom Group
continued to plunge, falling 60 cents to $3.41 after its debt ratings
were cut.</TE>
<TE>   * Defense shares attracted buyers after Lockheed Martin reported
strong earnings. Lockheed jumped $3.08 to $62.20, General Dynamics
gained $2.06 to $94.92 and Alliant Techsystems surged $3.43 to
$103.93.</TE>
<TE>   * Other stocks gaining on earnings reports included Gillette, up
$1.47 to $36.32, and adhesives maker Avery Dennison, up $1.80 to
$64.05.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of home builders surged for a second day on continued
optimism about home sales. Centex leaped $3.34 to $58.34 and KB Home
gained $1.45 to $50.33.</TE>
<TE>   * Electric-power company shares were mostly higher, led by
Calpine, up $1.42 to $13.33; Dynegy, up 95 cents to $29.05; and Duke
Energy, up 55 cents to $38.89.</TE>
<TE>   But after the market closed, Calpine said its first-quarter
operating earnings will be below expectations, and that it will sell
up to 60 million new shares to raise capital.</TE>

<HD>Bill Gates Vows to Battle Penalties</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: Microsoft chairman bristles under questioning
from states' trial lawyer in second day of testimony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A day after Bill Gates displayed a kinder, gentler version of himself
in federal court, the Microsoft Corp. chairman returned to the
witness stand Tuesday--this time showing flashes of his impatience
and evasiveness as he vowed to fight harsher antitrust penalties.</LD>
<LD>   In his second day of testimony, Gates alternately dodged questions
from the states' trial lawyer Steve Kuney and, on occasion,
acknowledged Kuney's concerns about the software giant's aggressive
business conduct.</LD>
<LD>   At one point, when Kuney tried to question Gates about Microsoft's
current business practices, the software mogul became so
evasive--asking Kuney about which time period he was referring
to--that presiding U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly
interrupted and instructed him to focus on his present circumstances.</LD>
<TE>   "Tell us about what you are doing now" with your business,
Kollar-Kotelly said.</TE>
<TE>   For a second day, Gates sparred with Kuney over the meaning of the
word "interoperate." During an exchange with Kuney over whether
Microsoft was taking sufficient steps to make its flagship Windows
operating system function better with software made by independent
developers, Gates repeatedly questioned Kuney's use of the word.
"Interoperate generally relates to a specific specification," Gates
said. In the way "you use the term, I would say 'compatible.' "</TE>
<TE>   The emergence of a more combative Gates appeared to unsettle
Microsoft lawyers who only a day ago were reveling in the software
mogul maintaining his composure on the witness stand.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's lead trial lawyer, Daniel Webb, tried to avert some of
the damage by voicing more than a half-dozen objections to Kuney's
questioning of Gates. Kollar-Kotelly sustained many of Webb's
objections. But the questioning appeared to take a toll on Gates, who
at times lapsed into the petulance he displayed in a 1998 video-taped
deposition that many legal experts said helped compound Microsoft's
antitrust woes.</TE>
<TE>   The District of Columbia, California and eight other states want
Microsoft to produce a modular version of Windows that can be
customized by consumers and PC makers. The holdout antitrust
enforcers rejected an out-of-court settlement reached between
Microsoft and the Justice Department in November and are pursuing
tougher restrictions on Microsoft's conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning, Gates termed the states' proposed remedies
vague and overreaching. He added that the states' suggestion that
Microsoft build a modular version of Windows was technically
impossible and would force the company to pull the operating system
off the market. "Whoever wrote this [remedy proposal] apparently
wanted to make this extremely broad," Gates said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gates at times continued to exude a cheerful air Tuesday,
he bristled when Kuney began questioning him about how far he would
be willing to go to modify his company's business behavior.</TE>
<TE>   After testifying Monday that Microsoft had ceased all 12 of the
anti-competitive practices a federal appeals court cited Microsoft
for last year, Gates acknowledged Tuesday that his company had not
yet addressed the commingling of Microsoft software.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington upheld a lower
court finding that Microsoft effectively killed competition from
competing Web browsers by mingling code for Windows with code for
Internet Explorer--the software that enables PC users to browse the
Web.</TE>
<TE>   The appeals court said such commingling was anti-competitive and
prevented computer makers from removing Microsoft's browser and
substituting competing products.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Gates said Microsoft had not addressed the court's
concerns. When asked by Kuney what Microsoft would do if a judge
ordered his company to comply with the states' more stringent remedy
proposal to produce a modular version of Windows in which software
code is not commingled, Gates said he would fight.</TE>
<TE>   That, Gates said, "can't be done. We would make every effort on
the legal front to make sure [the proposal] is not imposed as a
requirement."</TE>

<HD>Ovitz Effort to Sell AMG Intensifies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Ovitz is negotiating to sell or merge his Hollywood talent
management company with one of a number of entertainment companies,
including the Firm, which specializes in talent management in the
music industry, according to sources close to the talks.</LD>
<LD>   Disappointed that his original vision for a broad-based
entertainment venture never materialized, Ovitz, the former president
of Walt Disney Co. and a founding partner of Creative Artists Agency,
has been trying for several months to sell his stake in Artists
Management Group or merge it with another entertainment company.</LD>
<LD>   And, though the current negotiations are considered serious, there
remains a strong possibility that Ovitz will not close a deal any
time soon, sources said.</LD>
<TE>   Partners at the Firm could not be reached for comment. AMG
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz's partners in AMG, Julie Yorn and her brother-in-law Rick
Yorn, are considered key to any discussions about the future of AMG.</TE>
<TE>   Under their leadership, AMG has grown to be one of Hollywood's
largest talent management companies, and their clients--Leonardo
DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Benicio Del Toro and Samuel L. Jackson--are
considered AMG's most important.</TE>
<TE>   The Yorns have 18 months left on their contract and are not
expected to extend their relationship with Ovitz beyond that date,
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Ovitz began meeting with potential suitors last summer. Those
early discussions focused on the sale of his struggling television
venture, Artists Television Group. When no buyer emerged for ATG by
September, Ovitz closed that division, writing off losses that
television industry sources estimate to be close to $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Ovitz has aggressively pursued a wide variety of
potential buyers and partners for the rest of his entertainment
holdings, of which AMG is the most significant.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Ovitz has faced a series of setbacks. This month, the
head of his ill-fated television company filed a $9.6-million fraud,
defamation and breach-of-contract suit claiming Ovitz enticed him to
ATG with false promises. That blow followed the loss of valued client
Robin Williams, who fired AMG and returned to his former talent
agency, CAA.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, StudioCanal, a division of Vivendi Universal, backed
out of its three-year multimillion-dollar pact with Ovitz's film
production arm, Artists Production Group, leaving the unit hobbled
without a financing partner.</TE>
<TE>   During this same period, Ovitz has been slashing costs and
reorganizing his sports management and music divisions.</TE>
<TE>   The effort to sell or merge AMG comes at a critical time in the
talent representation business. Last week, the Screen Actors Guild
voted down a new agreement with talent agencies, raising questions
about the future of that time-honored relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Although AMG is a management company, the lack of an agreement
between actors and agents creates uncertainty for everyone in the
industry.</TE>

<HD>PepsiCo Profit Rises 14%, Beats Expectations</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PepsiCo Inc. said Tuesday that first-quarter profit jumped 14% as
consumers snapped up more of its Frito-Lay snacks and Mountain Dew
Code Red and Gatorade drinks.</LD>
<LD>   The company said earnings before special items rose to $681
million, or 38 cents a share, from $597million, or 33 cents, a year
earlier. The results beat the Wall Street consensus estimate by a
penny a share.</LD>
<LD>   Net income climbed to $651 million, or 36 cents a share, from
$570million, or 32 cents, a year earlier. Sales climbed 4.9% to
$5.1billion for the quarter ended March 23.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Steve Reinemund pointed to strong results in the
company's largest divisions, Frito-Lay North America and Pepsi-Cola
North America, and from Gatorade.</TE>
<TE>   "Our international results were also healthy," he added, "despite
the impact of adverse global macroeconomic conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo said it still expected earnings
growth of 13% to 14% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   PepsiCo shares fell 63 cents to $52.20 on the New York Stock
Exchange. PepsiCo and rival Coke are trading near 52-week highs.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Pepsi and Coke are benefiting from new products,
which are boosting results in the competitive U.S. market even as
many consumers shy away from mainstream colas.</TE>
<TE>   The two top soft drink makers are both showing strength with
lemon-flavored colas. Coke's Diet Coke With Lemon debuted last year,
and Pepsi has both regular and Diet Pepsi Twist.</TE>
<TE>   Pepsi's Mountain Dew Code Red, popular with young adults, will be
followed by a diet version this summer. Pepsi said it also plans to
introduce Lipton Brisk Lemonade, among other products, this quarter.
Meanwhile, Coke will launch Vanilla Coke in the U.S. next month and
is reintroducing its fruit-flavored Fanta brand.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Verizon Communications Inc., the largest local-telephone company,

<HD>Bankruptcy Homestead Limits Set</HD>
<DH>Congress: Lawmakers reach compromise to block debtors from
protecting assets in expensive homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD></LD>
<TE>   Congress aimed a long-stalled bankruptcy-reform bill directly at
EnronCorp. executives Tuesday by deciding to block wealthy debtors
from using luxury homes to shield assets. A compromise on the
homestead exemption portion of the bankruptcy bill cleared one of the
last few stumbling blocks on the bill between House and Senate
negotiators, who have been working almost four years to come to a
deal on the reform bill. Lawmakers say they want to stop wealthy
debtors from using bankruptcy laws to hide their money. Texas,
Florida, Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota have unlimited homestead
exemptions. Some famous and wealthy people, including actor Burt
Reynolds, have written off millions in debt in Bankruptcy Court but
kept mansions.Lawmakers frequently used former Enron executive
Kenneth L. Lay as an example of why they think the homestead
exemption portion of the bill is needed, even though Lay has not
filed for bankruptcy and has not been charged with wrongdoing. Lay
was the politically connected chairman of Enron. Under the
House-Senate compromise, wealthy debtors trying to hide their money
by putting it in property will have capped at $125,000 the amount of
home equity they can keep out of the reach of creditors in court
proceedings if they have committed a crime, caused serious injuries
or death or owe a debt because of a crime such as securities fraud.
The most home equity debtors could shield by relocating would be
$125,000 until they have owned homes in those states for at least 40
months, lawmakers said.</TE>
<TE>   Wynn to Offer Public Shares in New Project</TE>
<TE>   Casino developer Steve Wynn has changed his mind and now plans to
sell public shares in his redevelopment of the Desert Inn. Wynn is
completing financing for the $1.63-billion resort on the Las Vegas
Strip. He had said after buying the landmark Desert Inn site that he
wanted to retain private ownership of the 218-acre project called Le
Reve because of his dislike for short-term, profit-driven equity
markets. He had vowed when he sold Mirage Resorts to MGM Grand two
years ago to never again operate a publicly traded company. Wynn
initially said he would turn to banks, private investors and the bond
market to finance the Le Reve ("the dream") resort on the Desert Inn
site. He explained his change of mind on Monday: "One, normalcy has
returned to the stock market and gaming stocks have regained their
value," Wynn told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. "Two, you really have
to be able to offer a stake in the business to attract top-quality
staff," he said. "This will allow us to offer stock options."</TE>

<TE>   H&amp;R Block Inc.'s $25-million settlement of a lawsuit over the
world's largest tax preparer's refund program was not properly
examined by a trial judge, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday in
overturning the settlement. The U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals
said the trial judge didn't examine with "the care that it deserved"
the fairness of the settlement concerning loans the company arranged
for customers who anticipated tax refunds, wrote Judge Richard
Posner. The proposed settlement concerned allegations that Block and
its banking partner Household International Inc. gouged low-income
customers by providing "refund anticipation loans" at interest rates
that exceeded 100%.</TE>

<HD>Davis Steps Up Beat of Reelection Machine</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor is using his incumbency power against a
foe with no office. Some say he's overdoing it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As Gov. Gray Davis wrapped up a recent press conference at a senior
citizens center, his aides cut off reporters' questions by blasting
an old Glenn Miller tune over the loudspeakers. Never one to miss a
beat, Davis took one of the elderly women in his arms and danced to
"In the Mood."</LD>
<LD>   Though not especially fancy, the footwork underscored that the
Democratic incumbent's reelection campaign is in full swing. With the
November election nearing, the blurry line between politics and
policy is becoming fuzzier by the day.</LD>
<LD>   Among his recent moves, Davis employed the power of incumbency to
send hundreds of thousands of mailers at taxpayer expense touting his
achievements; e-mailed all departments urging that the governor's
image appear on all state Web sites; and churned out scores of press
releases and proclamations, most of them on matters of marginal
significance.</LD>
<TE>   "He has taken all the ideas of Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and
Pete Wilson and value-added to them," said Assemblyman Bill Leonard
(R-San Bernardino), a lawmaker since 1978. "He has taken it to a
higher level."</TE>
<TE>   Exploiting the visibility of the governorship is a particular
advantage for Davis in this year's campaign since his opponent,
Republican businessman Bill Simon Jr., holds no office to use as his
own bully pulpit.</TE>
<TE>   Though Davis would go weeks early in his administration without
making a public appearance, the governor now routinely holds multiple
public events each week.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're running a state, people are going to want to view
every single action in a political light," said Roger Salazar, a
spokesman for Davis' reelection campaign. "You can protest, but
nobody wants to hear the protest."</TE>
<TE>   The administration is taking the most flak for sending out
tax-funded mailers to hundreds of thousands of Californians on themes
that have become stock parts of Davis' stump speeches.</TE>
<TE>   Using such words as "historic" and lauding Davis' "leadership,"
current articles by some of Davis' top aides in government-funded
newsletters herald Davis' achievements on issues ranging from
transportation spending and school construction to energy
conservation and job creation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like having the tax collector as your campaign fund-raiser,"
said state Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine). Johnson has asked the Fair
Political Practices Commission, controlled by Davis appointees, to
review the issue and has urged Davis to reimburse the state.</TE>
<TE>   One article appears under the headline "Governor Davis Invests in
Transportation to Build a Better California." In another mailer, sent
at state expense to 300,000 real estate agents and brokers, Maria
Contreras-Sweet, Davis' secretary for Business, Transportation and
Housing, declares: "At a time when the country is experiencing an
economic downturn, the Governor has created 900,000 new jobs in
California by investing in the state's infrastructure."</TE>
<TE>   "The governor creating 900,000 new jobs? Give me a break," said
Bob Stern of the nonpartisan Center for Governmental Studies in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Stern said the articles contain both "puffery and information,"
but added that the main problem is that they are landing in mailboxes
in an election year, while Simon has no such forum.</TE>
<TE>   California's Fair Political Practices Act, an initiative approved
in 1974, barred such mass mailings in an election year. Proposition
73, a 1988 initiative sponsored by Johnson, sought to prohibit
officeholders from sending out virtually all self-promoting mailings
at any time.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, however, the Fair Political Practices Commission has
adopted regulations permitting mass mailings as long as they don't
promote the politician responsible for sending them.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson called the Contreras-Sweet article "pure campaign
puffery." He estimates that if Davis purchased a list of all licensed
real estate agents in California and sent mailers to them, the cost
could be $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   "They certainly don't discuss any of the failures of the Davis
administration," Johnson said. "Yet this one-sided propaganda is sent
at taxpayer expense."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' Press Secretary Steven Maviglio called Johnson's letter
"politics designed to get a headline" and predicted it would be
"laughed out of the FPPC." He said there "is absolutely no reason"
for Davis to reimburse the state for any costs.</TE>
<TE>   The mailers are only one example of how Davis uses the power of
incumbency. On the day after the primary, an aide sent an e-mail
reminding departments that Davis' image should appear on state Web
sites.</TE>
<TE>   Internet users visiting, say, the Department of Boating and
Waterways site are invited to jump to the governor's home page, where
they can read Davis' official biography, speeches, press releases and
proclamations and follow a link to the Web page of his wife, Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's press operation also is busy these days, churning
out 81 press releases in the first 19 days of April, compared with a
mere 27 during the same period in 1999, Davis' first year in office.
The volume exceeds the number turned out during the entire month of
April last year, in the middle of the energy crisis. Maviglio said
the timing of the e-mail about Davis' Web site was mere coincidence
and attributed the increased number of press releases partly to the
governor making more appointments.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' press relations operation, which holds weekly briefings
detailing the governor's schedule, added a new feature earlier this
year: guest appearances by Davis appointees talking about his
achievements, ranging from tax credits to his campaign against
Medi-Cal fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Many weeks, the aides seem to strain for news that reflects well
on their boss. An aide spent half an hour at one such briefing two
weeks ago describing how Davis would spend $15.5 million to "enhance
the state's internationally recognized ocean and coastal resources."</TE>
<TE>   The entire $15.5 million came from Uncle Sam, not from the state
budget, and the money was inserted into the federal budget last year
at the behest of Rep. George Miller (D-Concord).</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the event earlier this month at the Ethel MacLeod
Hart Senior Center, the governor's second appearance on that day. Not
that there was much to announce, but as the elderly people finished
their lunch, the governor declared he had signed a bill giving
prescription drug discounts to senior citizens. The bill, he noted,
was signed in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he will approve legislation this year to extend the
1999 measure and require advertising to let people know about the
discounts. It has no significant opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, on a day when pharmaceutical companies announced
in New York that they would offer discounts to elderly people, Davis
was getting out a message: He, too, had something to offer this
segment of the population most likely to vote come November.</TE>
<TE>   Davis aides say incumbents in other states are more aggressive. In
New York, for example, Gov. George Pataki was criticized for airing
television ads at state expense touting expansion of a health
program. Davis has no plans to air so-called public service ads
funded at state expense, especially given recent history in this
state.</TE>
<TE>   "The ghost of Chuck Quackenbush still looms," Maviglio said,
referring to the insurance commissioner who was forced to quit office
in 2000 following revelations that he used settlements of government
lawsuits to finance self-promoting television ads.</TE>

<HD>Program Helps Migrant Workers Earn a GED</HD>
<DH>Passing the high school equivalency test is seen by Project
Avanzando's graduates as their passport out of poverty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gustavo Toxqui's hands have welded metal, picked grapes, clutched
oranges, hauled concrete blocks, wielded paintbrushes, gripped mops,
hurled newspapers--and, just recently, grasped a GED certificate.</LD>
<LD>   His hands carry the marks of an immigrant journey that began
nearly 12 years ago in Puebla, Mexico. The General Educational
Development certificate carries the hopes of what he and his wife,
Susana, want to make of their lives in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "Earning my GED has been one of the greatest satisfactions I have
had," Gustavo said. "Learning doesn't come easy for me, but this is a
way to demonstrate to my children that it can be done."</LD>
<TE>   The Toxquis are among nearly 30 former migrant workers who
recently passed the high school equivalency examination as part of
Project Avanzando, one in a smattering of programs in Southern
California designed to help migrant workers leave subsistence labor
to pursue an education.</TE>
<TE>   Project Avanzando, which in Spanish means advancing, operates out
of schools in Rosemead and Santa Fe Springs. Its students take high
school classes over three to five months to prepare for the GED exam.</TE>
<TE>   The program is geared to those who have worked as migrants within
the last two years, offering them free transportation and child care
to encourage attendance. It also provides college counseling.
Forty-two students have graduated since the program began in January
2001, and about a third of them have attended community college.</TE>
<TE>   Pablo Jasis, director of Project Avanzando, said many of the
migrant adult students had been forced to abandon their professional
hopes in their home countries, and they see the GED program in the
U.S. as their passport out of poverty. Although most migrant workers
have other immediate needs to worry about, Jasis said, many have an
incredible hunger for knowledge as well.</TE>
<TE>   "We could multiply [our] program by a hundred and we still would
not be able to meet the needs of the community," he said of Project
Avanzando, which operates on a $300,000 yearly budget.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo, 41, and Susana, 40, are trying to set a good example for
their three sons. "If you want to live better, you have to study,"
Gustavo says to them. "When you have an education, even without
experience, you can say: 'My work is worth so much. I'm worth this
much.'"</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, Gustavo and Susana have worked as
janitors. They start at 4:45 p.m. and end some days at 3:30 a.m.,
only to wake up three hours later to get their children off to
school.</TE>
<TE>   The calluses on Gustavo's thumbs and index fingers attest to the
hours he spends each day clenching a vacuum cleaner, gripping a broom
or scouring floors to pay the bills.</TE>
<TE>   The couple sometimes bring their sons to work to show them the
difficulty of earning a living without an education. Among the places
they clean regularly is a legal building in West Covina, where the
executive office has a view of an impressive house with horses
roaming in the backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "Look how grand that house looks over there," Susana said. "It's
precious." Every time she looks out the window, Susana said, she can
hear her children's voices in her mind saying: "I want a house like
that, with horses."</TE>
<TE>   Education was not always that important to Gustavo. What he now
preaches to his children is the result of a metamorphosis.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, poverty wounded his pride. He struggled to come up with
$3 to buy a pair of shoes for his wife to wear at a baptism ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   He realized that his welding job was not enough to support his
family.</TE>
<TE>   One day, Gustavo kissed his baby boy, Alfonso, goodbye and took
off for the border without saying goodbye to his wife. She had warned
him that if he left, it would be the end of their relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "How could he go when the child was so small?" she asked. "Money
is not what matters. What matters is being together in good and bad
times."</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo slept in a van parked near the Los Angeles Convention
Center and sold oranges during the day. He saved his scant earnings
and sent the money to Susana and their son. Gustavo was determined to
improve his life and reunite with his family.</TE>
<TE>   After two years, he had saved enough to rent an apartment in El
Monte and, in a love letter to Susana, asked her to come with Alfonso
to live with him.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to Mexico to get them, paid a "coyote" to guide them
back and ran with Alfonso in his arms across the frontier. They
survived harsh weather, lack of food and even an attack by thieves.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo was aware that his family had taken a great risk to follow
him. He worked hard at odd jobs, painting, welding and in the fields.
Susana worked just as hard, picking grapes and baby-sitting. But
their goals changed when Susana learned about the federally funded
Migrant Education Program, which offered parenting classes. To
Gustavo, his children's education became a priority. What better way
to motivate them, he thought, than to show them that even their
parents could pursue their academic dreams?</TE>
<TE>   Neither of them knew that many of the credits for courses they
took in Mexico--his in high school and hers in college--could have
been transferred to a community college here. Susana has a psychology
degree from Mexico, but cannot work as a psychologist here without
learning English and going to graduate school. So they effectively
started over.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo has always been good with numbers, and helped his wife
with her math homework. She corrected his grammar and helped him with
literature. It took them three months to prepare for the GED. They
read from the works of Martin Luther King Jr., George Washington,
Miguel de Cervantes and Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   The classes and the test were in Spanish because the exam is meant
to test the students' general knowledge in math and other subjects,
not their English per se, Jasis said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we tried to teach them in English, it would take them about
four years," he said of the preparatory courses. "They would get
frustrated. At least after they earn a GED, they have an
accomplishment, and they are more motivated to study English."</TE>
<TE>   Susana passed the exam the first time. Gustavo was a point short.
He was disappointed, and thought about giving up. But he stuck with
it and passed on the second try. They were able to graduate together.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the push we needed to pursue the dreams that we have
always had," Gustavo said.</TE>
<TE>   Susana's dreams still include working in something related to
psychology or social work. But first she must attend classes to learn
English.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo's dream is to start his own janitorial business, a job
that he at first found humiliating but now appreciates, enough so
that he is willing to turn it into a career.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after earning his GED, he called his father in Mexico to
deliver the news. His father wept and apologized for not encouraging
him to study when he was in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo said he doesn't regret his long journey.</TE>
<TE>   But it isn't over, he said. His most important ambition now is to
see his three sons get an education.</TE>
<TE>   "My greatest dream is to see my children become professionals," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I imagine the day they receive their degrees in whatever they
choose to pursue. That day I will tell them: 'Yes it can be done. You
achieved it. I'm proud of you!'"</TE>

<HD>Angels Are Defeated by Mariners Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>In the wake of another defeat, with the Angels off to their worst
start in franchise history and this season looking bleak, Manager
Mike Scioscia had to answer questions Tuesday night about his future.</LD>
<LD>   "You're always being evaluated," Scioscia said.</LD>
<LD>   "From the first time you're in this position, you're evaluated.
I'm not uncomfortable being evaluated at all.</LD>
<TE>   "It doesn't change anything as far as what I would do or what we
as a staff would do on a daily basis. I don't even think about it."</TE>
<TE>   In a season that already has seen the firings of three managers,
there is no indication Scioscia's job is in immediate danger. But the
Angels started the season with high expectations, and Tuesday's 1-0
loss to the Seattle Mariners left the Angels 101/2 games out of first
place, with a 6-14 record that is the worst in franchise history
after 20 games. They have also lost all six games to the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   This is not exactly what Disney had in mind when it boosted the
Angels' payroll to a record $60 million. At a January ceremony to
unveil the new logo and uniforms, Paul Pressler, the Disney executive
running the Angels and Mighty Ducks, publicly challenged Scioscia to
deliver October baseball to Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said he would operate in coming days as he has in the
past, with faith that the Angels have the talent to climb into
contention and without making short-term moves designed to strengthen
his hold on his job.</TE>
<TE>   "That has absolutely no bearing on what we're going to do here day
to day," Scioscia said. "We still believe in this club."</TE>
<TE>   The club was not good enough to survive one misplay Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Ortiz was magnificent in defeat. He threw the Angels' first
complete game of the season, allowing only five hits and striking out
eight without giving up an earned run.</TE>
<TE>   Only once did a Seattle runner advance past second base, but once
was enough. Mark McLemore, whose grand slam Monday buried the Angels,
foiled them again Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   With one out in the fifth inning, McLemore hit a drive between
left fielder Orlando Palmeiro and center fielder Garret Anderson, an
apparent double.</TE>
<TE>   But McLemore never stopped running and shortstop David Eckstein
hurried the relay throw to third base. As McLemore slid in headfirst,
the throw bounced past Troy Glaus. Ortiz backed up, but the ball
trickled between his legs. McLemore scrambled to his feet, hustled
home and again slid headfirst to beat the throw from Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   McLemore was credited with a triple and Eckstein with the error.
According to Scioscia, the Angels made three mistakes on the
play--Eckstein should have held the ball, Glaus should have blocked
the relay throw if he could not catch it and Ortiz should have
blocked the loose ball if he could not catch it.</TE>
<TE>   "There were three breakdowns on that play. That decided the
ballgame," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   That was because the Angels did nothing against Ryan Franklin, who
made his first major league start.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin retired 16 of the first 17 batters and gave up three hits
over 52/3 innings before leaving to a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus doubled to lead off the ninth inning, but he got no farther
than third base.</TE>
<TE>   Mariner closer Kazuhiro Sasaki threw two pitches that got away
from catcher Dan Wilson, but only one got far enough away for Glaus
to advance.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're looking for breaks to win baseball games, we're in
trouble," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not looking for breaks to win games. You're looking to
play the type of game that will absorb any bad breaks."</TE>

<HD>Cheeks a Fearless Leader</HD>
<DH>Trail Blazers: First-year coach seemed to be in with the
wrong crowd, but Portland's strange mix has settled down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK HEISLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keep thinking, Mo, it's what you're good at.</LD>
<LD>   Back at the Hole in the Wall, or wherever the Portland Trail
Blazers rode off to after Sunday's disappointment against the Lakers,
the little outlaws are planning their next job, er, game.</LD>
<LD>   It's hard to be a Trail Blazer these days, what with their
reputations, inherited and/or merited; with impulse control that runs
the gamut from acceptable to absent, and their high-risk approach to
the game, not to mention public relations.</LD>
<TE>   In real life, they're a basketball team, not as big or scary as
some they've had but still good enough to rally from 13-18 and finish
sixth in the wild West under rookie Coach Maurice Cheeks. They're a
decided underdog in this NBA first-round playoff series but, as they
showed the mighty Lakers 10 days ago in Portland, capable of
surprises.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, with the Trail Blazers, surprise is a way of life.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought they were nuts," says guard Steve Kerr, who
arrived last summer after three years with the low-key San Antonio
Spurs. "This just confirmed it, that's all. But in a good way.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a great time, getting to know a lot of the guys. And I
wasn't sure if I would fit in. I felt kinda weird coming to this
team, especially having been with the Spurs the last three years, a
team that's so opposite....</TE>
<TE>   "In a weird way, it's been one of the most fun years I've had,
just because it's so nuts. It's such a new experience for me. I've
seen it all this year, water bottles flying through the air, chairs,
balls flying into the stands, people throwing Bill Walton dolls onto
the floor...."</TE>
<TE>   Remember that last Laker game at Portland.... Rasheed Wallace, who
plays Sundance Kid to Cheeks' Butch Cassidy, getting upset at a call,
while the Trail Blazers were wiping out a 10-point fourth-quarter
deficit.... Rasheed coming back to the huddle and kicking a chair so
hard, the TV replay showed Kerr, sitting on the bench but facing the
wrong way, ducking.</TE>
<TE>   In Portland, one learns to stay alert.</TE>
<TE>   All but forgotten in the ongoing High Jinks Chronicles is the fact
this remains one of the league's deepest and most versatile rosters.</TE>
<TE>   If Arvydas Sabonis' retirement means they've gone from big and
imposing to slight and overmatched in a conference dominated by huge
teams; if General Manager Bob Whitsitt concedes their championship
window might be closed for the moment; if the pieces don't quite
fit--or come close--they still rose from 13-18, when everyone was
writing them off with their rookie coach, and went 31-8 from the
start of January to the end of March, playing so well with such
esprit, it was not uncommon to hear people from other teams saying
they were the best team in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, you have to take people for what you see them," says the
soft-spoken Cheeks, who prefers to stay positive in a job in which
he's destined to be forever asked about the negative.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe you can keep getting it from third parties,
fourth parties. Certainly, I was getting it from 25 parties about my
guys [before taking the job] but I didn't take that at face value.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know how they would be ... so I had to come in and give
'em a fair shake.... And they gave me a fair shake. And that was
pretty much the way we regrouped ourselves as a team, because we
believed in one another."</TE>
<TE>   Calming this madcap crew that, as another West coach noted, "would
have driven Dean Smith out of coaching," is now considered one of the
season's most impressive coaching jobs.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, Cheeks has become their steadying influence.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, they require a lot of steadying and he's just one
man.</TE>
<TE>   Sins of the Jail Blazers</TE>
<TE>   "We were always adding players to try to match up with Shaq
[O'Neal] and beat the Lakers. Maybe we added one or two too many. The
mix was a little different than the norm. You had a guy like Dale
Davis who went to the finals [with Indiana] and had an All-Star year
and was used to playing big minutes and we asked him to take a backup
role. That was difficult for him. And [Shawn] Kemp, he was a guy who
was capable of helping us but there was the conditioning factor....</TE>
<TE>   "You know, every year, we took steps to get better and for three
years we did. Then it just fell apart at the end."</TE>
<TE>   Former Trail Blazer assistant</TE>
<TE>   Tony Brown to the Detroit News</TE>
<TE>   Everything about these Trail Blazers is a high-wire act,
reflecting their challenge and the risks they've run to surmount
them.</TE>
<TE>   Despite owner Paul Allen's bankroll, superstars don't put them
atop wish lists, as O'Neal did with the Lakers. Nor did the Trail
Blazers finish badly enough--they're the only team that has never
been in the lottery--to luck into Tim Duncan and David Robinson, as
the Spurs did.</TE>
<TE>   So Whitsitt grabbed talent at every opportunity, however immature,
expensive, overweight and/or incompletely thought-out.</TE>
<TE>   In the transition from the Clyde Drexler era, there were
consequences, centering around J.R. Rider's adventures. Throw in Gary
Trent's incarceration for fighting outside a club, Wallace's
unfriendly public persona, a drop in the standings and the
disappointment felt throughout their doting community and you had the
"Jail Blazer" era.</TE>
<TE>   This was addressed by the acquisition of such solid guys as Brian
Grant and Steve Smith and their climb back into the elite, cresting
in the fourth quarter of Game 7 of the 2000 Western Conference finals
when they took that 15-point lead over the Lakers....</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they lost it and everything else, it seemed.</TE>
<TE>   The players turned on Coach Mike Dunleavy. Wallace thought he
should support him more with referees, rather than telling him to
quit getting technicals and ejections. Veterans like Scottie Pippen
wanted Dunleavy to be tougher with the volatile young players.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Dunleavy kept the balls in the air into March, when
they were 42-18, No. 1 in the West, and Whitsitt brought in Rod
Strickland. This was said to have upset the old No. 2 point guard,
Greg Anthony, even more than the starter, Damon Stoudamire, although
Stoudamire clearly gulped at the news.</TE>
<TE>   While Whitsitt discounted the intangible aspect ("I'm not a
chemistry major, I'm a sports major," he said) the bottom fell out in
an 18-14 finish, including a loss to the Lakers in Los Angeles,
during which Wallace threw a towel in Sabonis' face during a timeout.</TE>
<TE>   The team would subsequently ask Sabonis to take a pay cut,
prompting his retirement, but a towel in the face couldn't have
helped. In his native Lithuania last fall, Sabonis noted, "There
aren't players on the Portland team, just names earning millions,"
adding Dunleavy, who had been fired that summer, had failed to "bring
the team's stars down to planet Earth and should have been fired at
midseason."</TE>
<TE>   The postseason lasted three games in a 3-0 sweep at the hands of
the Lakers, with Davis suspended for Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a professional team," Pippen later told the Chicago
Sun-Times' Lacy Banks. "There I was, being a captain of a team with
players who didn't want to show up for work or follow basic rules of
being on time and giving their all in practice and in the games.</TE>
<TE>   "We had players feuding with each other, feuding with the coach
and the coach and players feuding with management. It was an unstable
situation where you just didn't know what to expect every day you
went to work. If it wasn't one thing, it was another, and you'd go to
work expecting the worst.... It's a shame that Dunleavy got fired
because it wasn't really his fault. Dunleavy's a nice guy. But maybe
that was the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Next (gulp) coach.</TE>
<TE>   Sons of the Jail Blazers</TE>
<TE>   Ever imaginative, Whitsitt, disdaining the warmed-over,
recirculated pool, asked the New York Knicks for permission to talk
to Jeff Van Gundy (denied) and approached Minnesota's Flip Saunders,
who said no, before turning to Cheeks from Larry Brown's Philadelphia
76er staff.</TE>
<TE>   A John Stockton-type, efficient, self-effacing point guard, Cheeks
seems so quiet, it was hard to imagine him sitting on anyone, but
there's a competitor in there, determined and so insistent, embattled
as he is at the moment, he can muse that one day he'd like to do what
Phil Jackson has done, eight titles' worth.</TE>
<TE>   Cheeks jumped at the offer. Openings to become a coach are rare
and those in which a rookie coach has enough talent to win, however
volatile, are rarer still.</TE>
<TE>   The key was Wallace. Cheeks had met Rasheed, a Philadelphia
native, a few times. Cheeks' old 76er Coach, Jimmy Lynam, now his
assistant, knew Wallace well, having coached him as a rookie in
Washington. Wallace was already showing his penchant for moods and
outbursts, but teammates and people around him have always insisted
there's a completely different, actually human, Wallace in private,
and Lynam liked him.</TE>
<TE>   "People see the tip of the iceberg and they're gonna now draw
every crevice on it," says Lynam. "You and I know about one-tenth,
one-twelfth is all you see. Yeah, the guy was getting too many
technicals. C'mon, give me a break....</TE>
<TE>   "Maurice made it a project to develop a relationship with Rasheed.
He wanted Rasheed to know it revolved around Rasheed, plain and
simple."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace now expresses his support of the new coach, succinctly, of
course ("Cats really appreciate the way he handles things.")</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's thorny persona, more than anything else, which
perpetuates the Trail Blazer legend and his disinclination to deal
with the media is at the core of the problem. Charles Barkley, who
threw a guy in a bar through a window, was entertaining and became a
folk hero. In Rasheed's case, the image is closer to Darth Vader.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be honest, I didn't like him the first couple weeks I was
there," says Kerr. " ... There was a real period there for a while in
training camp where I wasn't sure. He was yelling at the interim
referees that were coming in town to ref our scrimmages. You've got
to be kidding me. But he settled down and I think he seems happy with
this team....</TE>
<TE>   "I think Maurice had a profound effect on him, just the way he
coached him, the way he treated him and he's been really fun to be
around, ever since that point. Laughs, jokes around, guys on the team
love him."</TE>
<TE>   Not that it was easy for them.</TE>
<TE>   At 13-18 on Jan. 2, they were No. 9 in the West, but Cheeks had
just turned the offense over to Pippen, moving Stoudamire off the
ball, as Brown had done with Allen Iverson. Bonzi Wells was moving
ahead of newly signed Derek Anderson, $49-million deal
notwithstanding, and the Trail Blazers were ready to rock.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't waver," Cheeks says. "Even if I wavered, I didn't let
the guys know that we weren't going to be a good team at some point.
I believe that's what helped us turn around is that I still had
belief that we were going to be a pretty good team.... It's easy,
particularly for a first-year coach, to stop and players can stop and
give up on him. But they didn't do that.</TE>
<TE>   "'Cause I kept hearing all these things about the players I had
around me. It certainly doesn't exist on our team now. The bad stuff
that I hear, it didn't exist and had it existed, you know, 13-18
probably would have been 13-20 or 13-21."</TE>
<TE>   Or 13-59.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that their mix can't be changed or their chemistry
improved. Their transition is ongoing; there's already speculation in
Miami that Pat Riley, looking to rebuild, will shop Alonzo Mourning
with Portland a likely destination.</TE>
<TE>   But the Trail Blazers have business remaining relating to this
season and with them, for better or worse, nothing's impossible.</TE>

<HD>It's Not Easy, but Ishii Wins</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Left-hander gives up six runs in second inning but
hangs on for 9-6 victory over Pirates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Dodger pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii jogged his memory, going back through
his 10 years in Japan, to determine whether the 52 pitches he threw
during Pittsburgh's six-run, six-hit, three-walk second inning
Tuesday night were the most he has ever thrown in one inning.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a lot; it was up there," Ishii said through an
interpreter. "It's definitely in my top 10."</LD>
<LD>   To which General Manager Dan Evans said: "Hopefully it wasn't in
the bottom of that top 10."</LD>
<TE>   And Manager Jim Tracy: "I don't want to see the other nine."</TE>
<TE>   It was ugly, it equaled the most runs the Dodgers have given up in
an inning all season, but it couldn't have been timed better. That's
because it came on a chilly evening when Dodger bats produced season
highs for runs and hits in a 9-6 victory over the Pirates before
13,235 in PNC Park.</TE>
<TE>   With temperatures dipping to 45 degrees by the seventh inning, six
Dodger starters--Cesar Izturis, Marquis Grissom, Brian Jordan, Eric
Karros, Adrian Beltre and Mark Grudzielanek--had two hits apiece to
lead a 14-hit attack, which featured five runs and six hits in the
decisive fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   A Dodger team that ranked 13th in the National League in runs and
began the game batting .228 with runners in scoring position, went
six for 15 with runners in scoring position Tuesday night. Seven runs
came on two-out hits, including Izturis' clutch two-out, two-run
double that turned a 6-5 deficit into a 7-6 lead in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Relievers Giovanni Carrara, Paul Quantrill and Eric Gagne combined
for four scoreless innings--with Gagne recording his eighth save--to
help Ishii improve to 4-0 and become the first Dodger rookie starter
to begin his career 4-0 since Fernando Valenzuela went 8-0 in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing how he got that win," Jordan marveled at Ishii.
"He's either pretty good or pretty lucky, one or the other."</TE>
<TE>   Or pretty resilient. Reliever Guillermo Mota was loose in the
second inning, and Tracy said he was one walk away from pulling
Ishii. The left-hander was so wild catcher Paul Lo Duca had to leap
to catch several high-and-away fastballs, but Tracy stuck with his
starter.</TE>
<TE>   The inning was so long that Grissom, the Dodger center fielder,
found himself "thinking about my kids, wondering if they had a good
day at school," and Ishii threw so many pitches he came within three
of matching the number of pitches fellow starter Odalis Perez threw
on April 10 against San Francisco ... in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   After two singles, a walk, RBI singles by Jack Wilson and pitcher
Jimmy Anderson, a two-run double by Abraham Nunez and a two-run
single by Brian Giles, Ishii was on the brink of disaster when he
walked two more batters to load the bases with two out.</TE>
<TE>   But Ishii struck out Mike Benjamin, the 12th batter of the inning,
on a full-count pitch and, after pitching coach Jim Colborn and
pitcher Hideo Nomo advised him to slow down his delivery, Ishii
blanked the Pirates on one hit over the next three innings before
giving way to Carrara to start the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't have his best stuff, and he could have easily shut it
down," Lo Duca said. "But he battled, he got out of the second inning
and he got the win. So for me, that was his best outing of the year."</TE>
<TE>   It was the Dodgers' best offensive game of the season, too.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 6-3, Lo Duca and Jordan both singled off Anderson to
start the fifth. Karros' RBI single scored Lo Duca, and Adrian
Beltre, whose two-out, two-run double highlighted a three-run first
inning, popped to second for the first out.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek's RBI single to right pulled the Dodgers to within
6-5, and Karros took third on right fielder Craig Wilson's fielding
error. Instead of going to his bench for a pinch-hitter, Tracy
allowed Ishii to bunt Grudzielanek to second, as Karros held at
third. Izturis then poked a two-run double to left to put the Dodgers
in front.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom lined an RBI single to center for an 8-6 lead before Shawn
Green popped to short to end the inning, but the Dodgers added
another run in the sixth on Grudzielanek's two-out RBI single to
center.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Trainers Are Busy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of the trainers running horses in today's opening-day stake at
Hollywood Park can be excused if their minds--and perhaps even their
bodies--are elsewhere. Bobby Frankel, Bob Baffert and Jim Cassidy are
involved in getting horses ready for the Kentucky Derby at Churchill
Downs on May 4.</LD>
<LD>   Meantime, Frankel will try to win today's $75,000 Harry Henson
with the probable favorite, Six Hitter, whose owner, Edmund Gann,
will have one of the favorites for the Derby in the Frankel-trained
Medaglia d'Oro. Frankel--notorious for piling up wins in the second
half of the year, as he did in 2001 when he totaled 36 graded stakes
wins and 18 Grade I's--is off to an uncharacteristically fast start
with 11 graded wins, most in the country.</LD>
<LD>   Other Kentucky Derby trainers with horses in the Henson are
Baffert, who's running Ecstatic at Hollywood for the Thoroughbred
Corp., the same outfit that recently bought War Emblem for a shot in
Louisville; and Cassidy, who trains Henson contender Irish Vale for
the same group of owners who race Ocean Sound, a Derby longshot.</LD>
<TE>   The Henson, named after the late track announcer who called the
races for 25 years, is the centerpiece for the opener of a 65-date
Hollywood meet that runs through July 21. Sometime early in the
season Laffit Pincay Jr. is expected to ride his 3,000th winner at
the Inglewood track. Pincay, 55 and riding better than ever, will
take off to ride Medaglia d'Oro in the Derby. He has won 506 races,
lifting his record total to 9,340, since he broke Bill Shoemaker's
career mark of 8,833 with a win at Hollywood on Dec. 10, 1999.
Pincay, with 2,970 wins, is far ahead of everybody on the Hollywood
victory list.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood will reintroduce Friday-night racing this season,
running all but one of its Fridays--May 3--under the lights.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, in an energy-saving measure, the track scuttled the
Friday nights after running only one. Subsequent twilight cards on
Fridays were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   The first weekend includes 12 stakes races, 10 of them on Sunday
in the third annual Gold Rush day, a 10-race, $1.3-million card for
California-breds.</TE>
<TE>   The $250,000 Cal Fed Snow Chief Stakes might be the richest race
of the day, but the most intriguing is the $175,000 Khaled, at 11/16
miles on the grass. Among the probables are Spinelessjellyfish, who's
trying to win the race for the third consecutive year; Fit For A
King, who has won seven in a row; Native Desert, the overachieving
former $32,000 claimer who, at the age of 9, has earned $1.6 million;
and Hugh Hefner, who beat both Spinelessjellyfish and Native Desert
last month at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the return to Friday nights, other changes this season are
the first running of the American Oaks, a $500,000 race for
3-year-old fillies at 11/4 miles on grass July 6; and the July 14
pairing of the Swaps, Hollywood's premier dirt race for 3-year-olds,
with the 63rd running of the Hollywood Gold Cup, the richest race of
the meet at $750,000. By running the Gold Cup toward the end of the
meet, the race is less likely to collide with the Stephen Foster
Handicap, also a $750,000 race for older horses, at Hollywood's
parent track, Churchill Downs, on June 15.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, bettors who receive the Television Games
Network (TVG) will be able to watch the Hollywood races on cable and
bet at home via telephone or the Internet. TVG will carry all the
Hollywood races, and two hours of that programming will be shown
daily on Fox Sports Net and Fox Sports Net 2. The Fox coverage, which
begins at 3 p.m., will switch to 7 p.m. for the Friday-night cards.</TE>
<TE>   The Thoroughbred Owners of California signed a contract Tuesday
with Hollywood Park that clears the way for the merger of TVG's
coverage with the network's home betting system. Horsemen receive a
share, in purses, of the money bet with TVG. Youbet, another
state-licensed betting company, also has a contract with the TOC.</TE>
<TE>   "A big factor in getting together," said John Van de Kamp,
president of the TOC, "was the broad distribution that TVG will get
over Fox. We'd like to see more, naturally, but this is a step in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Phone betting was legalized in California at the start of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Chris McCarron exercised two Kentucky Derby horses Tuesday at
Churchill Downs. Came Home, the Santa Anita Derby winner and
McCarron's mount in the Kentucky Derby, worked six furlongs in 1:12
3/5, which was more than a second faster than his trainer, Paco
Gonzalez, had wanted. McCarron also worked Ocean Sound, the
third-place finisher in the Blue Grass, who was timed in 1:28 1/5 for
seven furlongs. Alex Solis will ride Ocean Sound in the Derby....
Medaglia d'Oro, who may be the third betting choice in the Derby,
behind Harlan's Holiday and Buddha, worked five furlongs in 1:01 2/5.</TE>

<KH>STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS COLORADO 1, KINGS 0</KH>
<HD>Kings Have Empty Feeling</HD>
<DH>Game 4: Roy stops 32 shots, Reinprecht scores and Avalanche
puts Kings one game from elimination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just in time to send the Kings to the brink of elimination, the NHL's
best defense and No. 1 goaltender finally found their way into the
playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Roy turned aside 32 shots, former King Steven Reinprecht
scored the only goal and the Colorado Avalanche defeated the Kings,
1-0, in Game 4 of their first-round Stanley Cup playoff series
Tuesday night in front of 18,700 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The largest crowd ever to watch a hockey game in California saw
Roy shake a season-long slump against the Kings, giving the defending
Stanley Cup champions a 3-1 lead in the series and ending the Kings'
12-game home unbeaten streak.</LD>
<TE>   Winless in their last eight road games, the Kings face the
daunting task of having to win twice at Denver in the next six days
or see their season end.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, they played most of the third period without
first-line winger Adam Deadmarsh, who suffered a neck strain when he
dived headfirst into the end boards less than a minute into the
period.</TE>
<TE>   X-rays were negative and Deadmarsh will be reevaluated today, but
Coach Andy Murray said he would play in Game 5 Thursday night at
Denver.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who had been 10-0-2 at Staples Center since March 2,
outshot the Avalanche for the first time in eight games this season,
but their 32-25 advantage in shots on goal only added to their
frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "People will talk about this being a defensive game and there were
a lot of physical confrontations," Murray said, "but both goalies
were outstanding. We had a lot more chances than they did, but we
couldn't beat Patrick."</TE>
<TE>   After giving up a league-low 162 goals in the regular season, the
Avalanche gave up three in each of the first three games of the
series. But with a chance to put a virtual chokehold on the series,
it limited the Kings' top offensive players, Jason Allison and Ziggy
Palffy, to one shot between them.</TE>
<TE>   "We played hard, we got all kinds of chances, but Patty played a
great game," said King defenseman Aaron Miller, a former teammate.
"When he's like that, he's real tough. We just weren't going to get
one by him."</TE>
<TE>   The shutout was Roy's 20th in the playoffs, extending his NHL
record. He also is the all-time leader in victories with 140, and in
minutes and games played.</TE>
<TE>   But Roy, who led the NHL with a career-best 1.94 goals-against
average in the regular season and gave up as many as three goals only
21 times in 66 starts before Tuesday, had not played up to his usual
high standard against Kings, giving up at least three goals six times
in seven games. His goals-against average, 1.85 against the rest of
the league, was 3.17 against the Kings. His save percentage, .929
against everybody else, was .866 against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "Every one of the goals we've scored," Murray said before the
game, "the number of bodies we've had around the net has been high.
Most goals, you'll see two or three King jerseys right around
Patrick.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked before the series about making his goal a magnet for
the puck and for bodies. If the puck gets there and we get bodies
there and we get a crowd there, there isn't a goalie in the world
that can stop the puck if he can't see it. If you let Patrick see the
puck, you're never going to score on him."</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring the derisive chants of "Pa-trick, Pa-trick," Roy was
sharp from the start in Game 4, stopping a close-range shot by Eric
Belanger in the opening minute. He made five saves during a
two-minute King power play early in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for the Kings, goaltender Felix Potvin was equal to
the task, for the most part.</TE>
<TE>   But Reinprecht, who also scored the winning goal in Game 2, netted
his third goal of the series on a shot from the left faceoff circle
with 14:03 to play in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   With Avalanche winger Peter Forsberg tied up by Brad Chartrand in
the left corner, Chris Drury corralled the puck and slid a pass to
Reinprecht, who whistled a shot over Potvin's glove and off the
bottom of the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   "I took the pass and I got off a shot, but I didn't know where it
went," Reinprecht said. "It took two or three seconds before I
realized it was a goal."</TE>
<TE>   Roy stopped King defenseman Mathieu Schneider on a breakaway late
in the period.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin made glove saves on point-blank shots by Rob Blake and
Radim Vrbata less than a minute later.</TE>

<LD>Stand this column on its head.</LD>
<LD>   Prop the Kings up against a wall.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Roy is in the house.</LD>
<TE>   Four games into the Colorado Avalanche's first-round series with
the Kings, hockey's best goalie finally showed up.</TE>
<TE>   No coincidence, then, that the Kings' season is about to
disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by the most incredible burly-guy gymnastics this side of
Bela Karolyi, the Avalanche defeated the Kings, 1-0, to take a
three-games-to-one lead with Game 5 scheduled for Colorado on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   On a desperate Tuesday night, the largest hockey crowd ever at
Staples Center oohed and arrghed and gritted 18,700 sets of teeth.</TE>
<TE>   But admit it.</TE>
<TE>   You knew this was coming.</TE>
<TE>   During the first three competitive games of this series, two of
which the Kings could have easily won, you complained about the
officiating, and fretted about the defense.</TE>
<TE>   But you knew.</TE>
<TE>   It was all coming down to the best money goaltender in hockey
history.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later, as happens seemingly every spring, that 6-foot,
180-pound body was going to morph into something the size of Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later, the Kings were going to throw 32 shots on goal,
and 56 shots of any sort, and desperately fight for three hours in
front of a net....</TE>
<TE>   And that net was going to have a door on it.</TE>
<TE>   And that door would be Roy.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday was that time.</TE>
<TE>   "The same thing we've seen around for years," said Colorado's Joe
Sakic, shrugging. "That's just Patty being Patty."</TE>
<TE>   During a second period that decided the game, though, it seemed
something even more. Almost like Patty being Sawchuk, Patty being
Dryden.</TE>
<TE>   During one incredulous two-minute stretch, he stopped five
power-play shots that seemingly flew at him from every mathematical
angle.</TE>
<TE>   Two shots he knocked away with his gloves, including one on a
direct shot from Mathieu Schneider. Three more he stopped with his
pads. All of them were accompanied by giant Staples Center gasps.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the barrage ended, with the game still a scoreless
tie, the Avalanche knew.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in a zone," Sakic said. "When he gets like that, you know
what's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   And what happened was, a couple of minutes later, the Avalanche
scored the only goal of the game when former King Steven Reinprecht
slapped in his third goal of the series through a couple of wandering
King defensemen.</TE>
<TE>   Just wondering, but all those fans who constantly boo Rob Blake,
shouldn't they also start booing the guy who was traded with him?</TE>
<TE>   Many of those fans were busy also chanting, "Pa-trick, Pa-trick."</TE>
<TE>   Even that cartoon character on the giant video scoreboard was
chanting, "Pa-trick, Pa-trick."</TE>
<TE>   At least until the third period.</TE>
<TE>   All that time, somebody should have also been chanting "Zig-gy" or
"Ja-son."</TE>
<TE>   Palffy and Allison, who dominated the Avalanche in Game 3 and are
expected to be consistent leaders, combined for one shot on goal.</TE>
<TE>   Linemate Adam Deadmarsh, who sat out most of the third period
because of a head injury suffered when trying to knock Adam Foote
into the boards--yeah, head missed Foote--had four shots.</TE>
<TE>   None of it was close to the seven goals and nine assists produced
by that line in the first three games of the series.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason was that the Avalanche sent a defenseman to
shadow Palffy at every turn. Another reason was that the Avalanche
essentially tried to knock the snot out of them.</TE>
<TE>   "We played more in-your-face hockey," said Foote.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the biggest reason was Roy, who, no, doesn't mind
listening to his name.</TE>
<TE>   "I hear the fans, but it doesn't bother me," he said with a grin.
"I think Rob is even getting comfortable with the boos."</TE>
<TE>   After a difficult three games, Roy said comfort was his biggest
goal.</TE>
<TE>   "My objective was not thinking," he said, perhaps one key to being
hockey's all-time leader in playoff shutouts with 20.</TE>
<TE>   He led the league during the regular season with a 1.94
goals-against average, the best year of his storied career at age 36.</TE>
<TE>   But he allowed nine goals in the first three playoff games against
a Kings' team that already averaged about three goals against him
each game of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, he walked into the building Tuesday like Greg
Maddux taking the mound with a 6.00 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried not to let negative thoughts get in my head like they did
earlier," he said. "I tried not to think about my butterfly, or how I
was moving, or anything like that."</TE>
<TE>   When somebody asked him to expound on those negative thoughts, the
interview was over.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to talk anymore about that, OK?"</TE>
<TE>   Enough said.</TE>
<TE>   In the final minutes Tuesday, Dancing Boy held up a Roy poster and
tore it in half, the crowd roaring its approval.</TE>
<TE>   It's just as well.</TE>
<TE>   If Patrick Roy plays one more game like this, the Kings certainly
won't be seeing him again until next year.</TE>

<HD>Southern Section Targets Big Spenders</HD>
<DH>Basketball: Large corporate sponsors, especially shoe
companies, could have their spending curbed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Southern Section is taking steps to curb the spending power of
large corporate sponsors, particularly shoe companies that target
high school boys' basketball teams in the Southland.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioner James Staunton said he plans to take a proposal to
the section's executive committee, which next meets on June 5.</LD>
<LD>   Nike and Adidas sponsor about 200 high school teams in the nation,
15 of them in the Southland, typically providing two pairs of
basketball shoes, an athletic bag and a T-shirt for each player.</LD>
<TE>   Selected teams like Santa Ana Mater Dei and Westchester were fully
outfitted, free, last season. Each Westchester player received more
than $1,300 in gear, including five pairs of shoes, and the team's
trip to a prestigious tournament was paid for by a Nike affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   Shoe companies "have taken this into the stratosphere," Staunton
said. "They have plunked down major money that most people would say
is not appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Such donations are legal, although a California Interscholastic
Federation bylaw requires teams to report single-source donations of
more than $500 to a school administrator, usually a principal or
athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   Staunton and others worry that teams that can offer athletes free
gear upset the competitive balance of high school athletics.</TE>
<TE>   He said it is important to distinguish among the types of goods
donated. He considers items used for a number of years--uniforms or
warm-up sweats, for example--more acceptable than shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "If Nike wants to donate shoes to some kids, we would say,
politely, no," Staunton said. "If they wanted to donate uniforms, we
would do that. Uniforms get passed down from year to year."</TE>
<TE>   Staunton said he would work on the proposal with Anaheim Union
School District Athletic Director Tom Danley.</TE>
<TE>   Danley's teams were 618-242 in his 33 seasons as boys' basketball
coach at Anaheim Katella before he left to become the district
athletic director in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids aren't supposed to be getting several hundreds of dollars in
merchandise and literally being bought off," Danley said. "It's not
what interscholastic athletics is all about.</TE>
<TE>   "Somewhere along the line, we've got to say enough is enough. This
is not a mini-fracas. This is a major issue."</TE>
<TE>   Danley said it would be important to set corporate funding limits.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a sugar daddy, you limit them," Danley said. "Maybe
we'll say there is a $1,000 maximum a corporation can sponsor.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to get resentment from elitist teams, but 99% of
teams are not in that category."</TE>
<TE>   After the initiative is presented to the executive committee, it
probably will be forwarded to the section's 83-member council for a
reading at a meeting in October. The proposal then will probably be
put to a vote at the next council meeting, expected to take place in
January. If the proposal passes, the date of implementation will be
decided at that time.</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Slowed Forsberg Still Enough</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second consecutive night, the Kings did a good job of slowing
down Colorado's Peter Forsberg and his linemates. But sometimes being
good is not enough.</LD>
<LD>   Although Forsberg was limited to only one shot on goal and
recorded only one hit, he made a key play that led to Colorado's 1-0
victory over the Kings on Tuesday night in Game 4 of their
best-of-seven Western Conference first-round series.</LD>
<LD>   "I came in on the left side [with the puck] and I really didn't
want to throw it away and get a turnover there," Forsberg said about
Colorado's second-period goal. "So I kept it and went into the
corner. Dru [Chris Drury] picked it up and passed to [Steven]
Reinprecht, who was standing in the slot by himself. He made an
unbelievable shot."</LD>
<TE>   For the Kings, Reinprecht's goal was a heartbreaker, considering
that they basically did what they set out to do defensively against
Forsberg's line.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great shot," King forward Ian Laperriere said. "There's
really nothing we could have done about that. Maybe we could have
done something with the puck in their zone ... I guess we didn't do
as well as we did in Game 3 because that's the line that scored."</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg, who returned to the Avalanche lineup for this series
after being sidelined for the regular season because of foot and
ankle injuries, gave the Kings a major headache in the first two
games. If he wasn't steamrollering down the wing crashing the net,
Forsberg was laying hits on Kings all over the ice on his way to
accounting for five points in helping Colorado to a 2-0 lead in the
series.</TE>
<TE>   But Forsberg wasn't as effective in Monday's Game 3 as the Kings
played as if he had a bounty on his head. "People are saying we're
targeting Forsberg," King Coach Andy Murray said Tuesday morning.
"We're not targeting Forsberg. We were trying to target anything that
had on a maroon jersey ... That's just the way we have to play
against them. And they're trying to do the same thing to us. It's a
physical game out there.''</TE>
<TE>   In his attempt to slow down Forsberg in Los Angeles, Murray
reunited his ''grind line'' of Mikko Eloranta, Brad Chartrand and
Laperriere.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a line that played together for us over the last two
months of the season," Murray said. "They've always done a good job
playing against the other team's top units. They have been effective
in that role."</TE>
<TE>   In Game 3, the ''grind line'' was at their irritating best as they
made life difficult for Forsberg.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to get under his skin," said Eloranta, whose experience
against Forsberg has mostly come when they competed internationally
for Finland and Sweden respectively. "He's such a great a player. I
just try to take him away from his game ... He tries to do the same
thing to me."</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg, who delivered 13 hits over the first three games of the
series, didn't score a point in Game 3 because the Kings prevented
him from building up speed with body checks and all-out effort.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings continued their strong play on Forsberg Tuesday. He was
limited to only one shot on goal in the first, which came late in the
period after Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley gave him some ice time with
Joe Sakic on Colorado's top line.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings tried to keep up their lockdown on Forsberg in the
second but the Colorado forward broke out to make a play that led to
the only goal.</TE>
<TE>   In what started out as a basic play in the Kings' zone, Forsberg
was tied up with Chartrand before sending the puck into the corner.
When it came time to get possession of the puck, Forsberg won the
battle and it landed up on Drury's stick, who then found former King
Reinprecht for the only score of the game 5:57 into the period.</TE>
<TE>   It was the type of play coaches always preach about when they want
their players to do the little things.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that we have to play hard against Forsberg every second
he's on the ice," Laperriere said. "He is the type of player who is
going is get tougher with each game as the series goes on. He's
getting in better shape every night.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't really realize how physical he is. He'll hit people
if he has a chance. I respect him a lot. He works hard out there and
plays fair."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the Kings, Forsberg also makes plays when they
count the most.</TE>

<HD>Gil's Home Runs Power Baltimore</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a night when Frank Castillo had his worst game this season,
Geronimo Gil had the best one of his career.</LD>
<LD>   Gil hit two home runs and drove in three runs, and the Baltimore
Orioles ended the Boston Red Sox's winning streak at six with a 7-5
victory Tuesday at Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   The Red Sox also lost for the first time in nine road games.
Castillo and two Boston relievers gave up 12 hits--five for extra
bases--to a team that had a major league-low .221 batting average.</LD>
<TE>   Castillo (1-1) gave up five runs and six hits in 31/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I just didn't feel comfortable out there," Castillo said. "For
me, you've got to have command. I didn't really get in a rhythm. I
kept falling behind and had to come in."</TE>
<TE>   Gil hit solo drives in the second and fourth innings against
Castillo, and he had a run-scoring single against Rolando Arrojo in
the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Gil, a rookie who was nearly scratched because of a sore left
hand, came in with a .174 batting average and one home run in 104
at-bats before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "The hand was hurting when I came to the ballpark, but it felt OK
swinging and I wanted to play," Gil said.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Cleveland 1--Todd Ritchie (2-1) was dominant and the
White Sox handed the Indians their first home loss this season.</TE>
<TE>   Ritchie gave up three hits--one a home run by Jim Thome--and
struck out a season-high eight in his longest outing this year.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Lee had a run-scoring single against starter Bartolo Colon
(3-2), and Paul Konerko and Mark Johnson each drove in runs in the
eighth when Chicago scored twice and opened a 4-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, Kansas City 0--Jeff Weaver pitched a five-hitter for
his first career shutout, and Randall Simon hit a three-run home run
at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver (1-3) struck out two and walked one. The right-hander had
five complete games last season--all losses.</TE>
<TE>   Simon hit a 2-and-1 pitch by Jeff Suppan (1-3) in the third inning
for his fifth home run.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth time the Royals have been shut out this season,
the most in the AL. It was the Tigers' first complete-game victory
since Steve Sparks beat Kansas City, 2-1, on Oct. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 6, Minnesota 4--Steve Cox homered and Randy Winn hit a
two-run single for the Devil Rays at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays beat the AL Central leaders for the eighth
consecutive time at Tropicana Field.</TE>
<TE>   Cox's solo homer against Brad Radke (2-2) broke a 3-3 tie in the
third inning.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Kennedy (1-1) gave up three runs on six hits in five innings.
Esteban Yan earned his fourth save in as many opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 2, Texas 1--Eric Hinske had a run-scoring double and
scored Toronto's other run at Arlington, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Lyon (1-2) pitched 61/3 innings and Kelvim Escobar got
four out for his third save in four chances.</TE>

<HD>Great Expectations Are Not Met</HD>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The spring training party line from Angel management: With our
off-season improvements, we can compete with the powers within the
division, the Seattle Mariners and Oakland Athletics.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels are 2-11 against the Mariners and A's, results that
raise the question of whether General Manager Bill Stoneman and
Manager Mike Scioscia overrated the impact of the additions of
pitchers Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele and designated hitter Brad
Fullmer. With Sele and Fullmer not playing well, and with Darin
Erstad and Tim Salmon yet to fulfill expectations each would return
to his 2000 form, the Angels do not appear to resemble a
championship-caliber club.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not ready to concede anything to anybody," Stoneman said
Tuesday. "We've got to play better against clubs in our own division.
We're not happy with the way we've played against Seattle and
Oakland.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't doubt the quality of the players we're sending out there.
We've got some pretty talented players. We added guys with talent
without really deleting any, because Mo [Vaughn, traded for Appier]
really wasn't here last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't jelled. We weren't hitting well for a while. Now we've
been scoring plenty of runs to win and all of a sudden the pitching
gives way.</TE>
<TE>   "We're 20 games into the season. We've got 142 left. I have to
admit, I get as frustrated as anybody. But you have to get hold of
yourself and say, what's the right thing to do?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the right thing to do to panic at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia refuses to consider the notion the Angels are not good
enough until the hitting and pitching clicks together.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get going on all cylinders so we see what our club
can do," he said. "Until we do, it's tough to evaluate. We're not
playing close to our potential.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we haven't met the challenge. But I don't see this
club performing like this for the whole year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Clarification: The letter Birmingham, Ala., businessman Donald
Watkins sent to Disney last week, offering $150 million in bank
backing for his $250-million offer to buy the Angels, is believed to
certify a credit arrangement similar to a loan, according to a source
close to the negotiations. The bank is not seeking other investors
for Watkins but rather certifying that it will finance $150 million
for him.</TE>

<HD>Ranger Reverse: Rocker Is Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Rocker was back with the Texas Rangers on Tuesday, even though
the struggling reliever never reported for his minor league
assignment.</LD>
<LD>   The Rangers recalled Rocker because they are desperate for help in
the bullpen. But there are no plans to use him in the closer role he
held when he was sent down.</LD>
<LD>   "For what we have with the problems we are facing in our bullpen,
he gives us as good an opportunity as anybody to win games," Ranger
General Manager John Hart said. "It won't be where the club has
played nine or 10 innings and it's up to him to make or break it."</LD>
<TE>   Rocker wasn't in the clubhouse when reporters went in before the
game with Toronto at Arlington, Texas. Rocker threw only one pitch,
getting Eric Hinske to ground into an inning-ending double play in
the seventh. He was 0-1 with one save and a 9.53 earned-run average
in six previous appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Rocker took the roster spot of 10-time All-Star catcher Ivan
Rodriguez, who will miss at least four weeks with a herniated disk.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, who didn't finish either of the last two seasons
because of different injuries, hasn't played since being scratched
from the lineup April 15 because of back spasms. He was expected to
miss only a couple games before an MRI exam revealed the disk
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Because Rocker is replacing an injured player on the roster, the
Rangers weren't bound by the rule requiring an optioned player to
spend at least 10 days with his minor league team.</TE>
<TE>   Rocker, 27, was optioned to triple-A Oklahoma on April 16 after
blowing a save opportunity by giving up two runs in the 10th inning
of a 6-5 loss to the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of reporting to the RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League,
Rocker stayed in California to work individually on his delivery
mechanics with former Ranger pitching coach Tom House. Current Ranger
pitching coach Oscar Acosta recommended that move, Hart said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Brewer star Paul Molitor has turned down a chance to
interview for Milwaukee's managerial job.</TE>
<TE>   "He said the timing was not right for family reasons," Milwaukee
General Manager Dean Taylor said. "He said he needed to spend the
summer in Minneapolis. He said he was flattered we asked him to
interview."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor didn't rule out contacting Molitor again in the event he
takes the interim tag off Jerry Royster and renews his search for a
full-time manager in the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't talk about the off-season," Taylor said. "The only
thing we discussed was right now."</TE>
<TE>   Royster was selected interim manager when Davey Lopes was fired
last week, and he's a candidate for the full-time job.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Tampa Bay Devil Rays placed left-hander Tom Martin on the
60-day disabled list because of an injury to his throwing shoulder,
and promoted pitcher Travis Harper from triple-A Durham.</TE>
<TE>   Martin appeared in two games, giving up three runs in 12/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida Marlin pitcher Kevin Olsen has begun serving a three-game
suspension for intentionally hitting Philadelphia's Marlon Anderson
earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Twins placed designated hitter David Ortiz on the
15-day disabled list, retroactive to April 19, and recalled catcher
Matthew LeCroy from triple-A Edmonton.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz, who has a sore left knee, is batting .236 with four home
runs and 14 runs batted in.</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS PORTLAND vs. LAKERS: SERIES REPORT/PORTLAND
NOTES</KH>
<HD>Cheeks Likes Game Plan With Tweaks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Trail Blazers hope to give their game plan a few minor tweaks
before Game 2 begins Thursday at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Among their shortcomings in Game 1 was a lack of defensive
pressure on the Laker guards. Instead of extending their defense,
forcing turnovers and creating easy baskets off the fastbreak, the
Trail Blazers let the Lakers come to them.</LD>
<LD>   And they paid a steep price, making only 30 of 82 shots (36.6%)
and dropping Game 1 into the Lakers' laps.</LD>
<TE>   "I think our game plan was fine," Portland Coach Maurice Cheeks
told the Oregonian. "But we didn't execute our whole game plan. We
didn't defend up the court. We didn't do it for whatever reason. I
don't know, maybe we saw too many stars in the stands."</TE>
<TE>   Cheeks also was troubled by the Trail Blazers' impatience in their
half-court offense.</TE>
<TE>   In several instances, particularly late in the game, they settled
for perimeter shots instead of working the ball closer to the basket.</TE>
<TE>   "We took too many quick shots," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pressed for details, Scottie Pippen said: "We went away from our
offense and never established the inside pressure on them that we had
going at the beginning of the game."</TE>
<TE>   However, the Trail Blazers remain hopeful of a victory in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   They expect their adjustments will give them a better chance of
beating the Lakers and tying the best-of-five series before it shifts
to Portland for Game 3 on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "The game was right there for us," Steve Kerr said. "We were down
five [points] with a few minutes to go and we didn't really play that
well."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For what it's worth, the Trail Blazers have lost five consecutive
playoff games to the Lakers, including the by-now famous Game 7 of
the 2000 Western Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers also have been outscored by the Lakers, 437-367,
in those four games plus one memorable fourth-quarter meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   Portland led the Lakers, 71-58, to start the fourth quarter of
Game 7 on June 4, 2000 at Staples Center, and also held a 75-60
advantage with 10:28 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers then went on a 15-0 run over the next 6:28 to tie the
score, eventually pulling out an 89-84 victory. They went on to
defeat the Indiana Pacers in six games for their first NBA
championship since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reserve guard Derek Anderson, whose 22 points in Game 1 kept the
Trail Blazers close until the end, suffered a case of stomach flu and
did not practice with his teammates. His status for Game 2 was not
immediately certain, although it's expected that he will play
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After spending Sunday, Monday and Tuesday nights in Portland, the
Trail Blazers are scheduled to return to L.A. this morning,
conducting a practice this afternoon at Staples Center. Last season,
playing a similar Sunday-Thursday schedule against the Lakers in the
first round, the Trail Blazers stayed in L.A.</TE>

<LD>Jeff Gordon in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch: "Arizona Diamondback
relievers Eddie Oropesa and Miguel Batista ran out of things to do in
the Coors Field bullpen, so they took a field trip to the rocks and
trees that lie beyond the center-field wall at the ballpark.</LD>
<LD>   "The umpires spotted them and halted play until they returned to
the pen.</LD>
<LD>   "'I think they were talking to Bambi out there,' Diamondback
Manager Bob Brenly said. 'Pitchers--you can't figure them out.'"</LD>
<TE>   Or, boys will be boys.</TE>

<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NBA playoff record for consecutive
three-point field goals?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miffed: Ron Artest, Indiana Pacer forward, after learning he had
not received any votes in balloting for the NBA's defensive player of
the year: "Well, obviously somebody needs some lessons. Somebody
needs some bifocals, and it's not me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hailing Hale: Ben Crenshaw, commenting on Hale Irwin's continued
success on the Senior PGA Tour: "He's always been a straight driver,
he's a great iron player, and his putting hasn't skipped a beat.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's his mind that always keeps him in the game, and that's
how he beats you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Neat move: Four female gymnasts from Romania, among them 1992
Olympic silver medalist Gina Gogean, claim former coaches and
officials forced them to declare themselves older than they really
were so they could compete at the senior level. Said Paul Giles of
humormall.com, "Besides the full, twisting double layout, they had to
add a new move, the reverse Danny Almonte."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ripping Rocker: Michael Hiestand in USA Today: "Bob Ryan on ESPN
Sports Reporters, offered this warm adios for pitcher John Rocker,
whom the Texas Rangers have sent to the minors: Rocker is 'an
absolute mental mess, a daily train wreck'" Ryan must be in shock
now. The Rangers recalled Rocker on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Waiting for an encore: Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco
Chronicle: "In a 35-4 rout of Georgetown on Sunday, Virginia Tech
outfielder Brad Bauder had eight hits, including four homers, 14 RBIs
and 23 total bases.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, let's see him keep it up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Something to do: Comedy writer Jerry Perisho: "One night earlier
this month, the Florida Marlins had a home attendance of only 4,500.
At any one time in Yankee Stadium, there are more than that just
throwing used flashlight batteries at opposing outfielders."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1994, David Robinson scored 71 points
to win the NBA scoring title as the San Antonio Spurs ended the
regular season with a 112-97 victory over the Clippers. Robinson
edged Shaquille O'Neal, then with the Orlando Magic, for the scoring
title.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Robert Horry of the Lakers, seven against Utah on
May 6, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Norman Chad for America Online: "With the overall No.
1 pick, the expansion Houston Texans took seven minutes to select a
quarterback (David Carr) they had already signed. I guess they're not
going to run a hurry-up offense....</TE>
<TE>   "One of the tabloids is reporting that an East German family,
seeking political asylum, has been living in Mel Kiper Jr.'s head of

<HD>Gagne Gets Job Done</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>Some eyebrows were raised Saturday night when Manager Jim Tracy had
closer Eric Gagne warming up in the ninth inning with the Dodgers
leading the Padres, 4-1, and two runners on base.</LD>
<LD>   Gagne had saved the three previous games, including a 11/3-inning
effort Friday night. The converted starter had been untouchable in 10
outings, but would Tracy use Gagne in four consecutive games,
possibly running the risk of overextending his young closer before
the team even gets to May?</LD>
<LD>   Giovanni Carrara retired Ray Lankford on a fly ball to end the
game, but Tracy said he wouldn't have hesitated going to his closer.</LD>
<TE>   The reason: Tracy isn't looking so much at innings as he is pitch
counts, and Gagne has thrown more than 18 pitches only once, in a
two-inning effort against Colorado on April 6. Gagne has thrown 15 or
fewer pitches in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   "If what he's getting now is just enough, we won't burn him out,"
Tracy said. "He's accustomed to throwing 110 pitches as a starter,
and he's gone from that to 18. It also takes him only 13 pitches [in
the bullpen] to get ready. I wouldn't call that wear and tear."</TE>
<TE>   The key for Gagne, whose save Tuesday night against the Pirates
was his eighth in eight opportunities, has been his ability to throw
first-pitch strikes. Gagne, who has a 0.00 earned-run average and has
held opponents to a .100 (four for 40) average, and has thrown
first-pitch strikes to 34 of the 41 batters he has faced.</TE>
<TE>   "But it hasn't been strike one over the middle of the plate,"
Tracy said. "It's a well-located strike that makes it difficult for
the hitter. He's done a very good job of maximizing the efficiency of
his pitches, and that has kept his pitch count down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side of the bullpen is 39-year-old Terry Mulholland,
who has a 15.26 ERA and has given up seven homers--half of the
Dodgers' season total--in 72/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   With starters averaging almost six innings a game, Mulholland has
gotten little work in his middle relief role. He will begin pitching
early batting practice to Dodger hitters--simulating game
conditions--in an effort to sharpen his curveball.</TE>
<TE>   With Mulholland guaranteed $3 million, the Dodgers will be patient
with the veteran left-hander, but his struggles make one wonder how
much longer Tracy can continue using him in key situations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important I have trust in him, because there are going
to be days the starters don't go seven innings," Tracy said. "I have
to show confidence in him, and he's going to have to get some outs in
the sixth inning of close games, because I can't use those other guys
every day."</TE>
<TE>   Pirate reliever Mike Fetters thought he'd retire as a Dodger after
signing a two-year deal with an option for a third before the 2001
season. He was extremely disappointed with the trade that sent him to
Pittsburgh for Mulholland and a minor league pitcher July 31.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I took it personally," Fetters, 37, said. "I had no
idea what happened. I thought I did everything they asked, but they
didn't feel I fit in, and I was gone.... The way I look at it is they
didn't want me. So, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't fired up about
facing them [this week]."</TE>
<TE>   The trade isn't looking so good for the Dodgers; Mulholland had a
5.83 ERA in 19 games last season and has struggled in 2002, while
Fetters has a 2.84 ERA in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   "But I would make that deal again if I had the choice," General
Manager Dan Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike wasn't doing the job [6.07 ERA in 34 games], and we were a
very right-handed staff at the time. We had only one left-hander,
Jesse Orosco, and we felt we needed another one."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger ace Kevin Brown, on the disabled list because of
inflammation in his surgically repaired right elbow, threw 50 pitches
off a mound Tuesday and experienced no pain, stiffness or increase in
swelling.</TE>
<TE>   Brown will throw again Thursday and Saturday, and the Dodgers hope
they can activate the right-hander for Tuesday's game against
Cincinnati.... The Dodgers released triple-A outfielder Mark Whiten
on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   TODAY</TE>
<TE>   DODGERS' OMAR DAAL</TE>
<TE>   (2-0, 1.23 ERA)</TE>
<TE>   vs.</TE>
<TE>   PIRATES' DAVE WILLIAMS</TE>
<TE>   (2-1, 2.65 ERA)</TE>
<TE>   PNC Park, Pittsburgh, 4 PDT</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150), KWKW (1330).</TE>
<TE>   Update--Daal, the left-hander who replaced Brown in the rotation,
gave up two unearned runs in 61/3 innings of his first start, a 5-2
win over San Diego on Thursday night. The Pirates are without third
baseman Aramis Ramirez, who is serving a seven-game suspension for
charging the mound against Milwaukee last week.</TE>

<HD>Giambi No Longer on 'A' List</HD>
<DH>Baseball: As expected, fans boo him in return to Oakland,
but he helps Yankees to victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The long hair is gone, the scrubby beard is history and he looks more
like a Brooks Brothers model than a poster boy for the Hell's Angels.</LD>
<LD>   This is Jason Giambi?</LD>
<LD>   He swears he still has all his tattoos and in fact says he has
even added one, but when the newest New York Yankee played against
his old team Tuesday night at the Coliseum, it just didn't look
right.</LD>
<TE>   Giambi doubled, singled and scored a run in a 2-1 Yankee victory
over the Oakland A's, but there was something a lot more personal
going on. It was all very awkward, as if something didn't match.
After six years of seeing him in an A's uniform, the home team's fans
might find that this Yankee thing is going to take some getting used
to.</TE>
<TE>   "Just another game," A's Manager Art Howe said.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi knew better. He expected the fans to get worked up and
that's part of the reason he showed up at the Coliseum almost five
hours before game time.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew today was going to be a circus act," said Giambi, who
obviously knows as much about human nature as hammering fastballs.</TE>
<TE>   They could have had a ringmaster, a guy on stilts and a couple of
mean-looking lions and nobody would have blinked. Giambi signed a
seven-year, $120-million contract with the Yankees in December, so
the reaction of many of the 40,360 fans was predictable in his return
to Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   They booed. They booed when Giambi and the Yankees loosened up
before the game, they booed when he took batting practice, they booed
when he was introduced, they booed when he was in the field and they
booed when he was at bat.</TE>
<TE>   It was a classic reaction and one that Giambi said he understood.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, I've been booed at home," he said. "You don't take it
personally."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, said Giambi, "Everybody loves to hate the Yankees."</TE>
<TE>   One Yankee in particular, it seemed, at least this time.</TE>
<TE>   "SELLOUT" was painted on a sign hung in right field. Another sign
read, "BENEDICT GIAMBI". Someone tossed a handful of dollar bills
from out of the stands and they fluttered toward the screen behind
home plate toward Giambi, who was being booed as he walked to the
on-deck circle.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, the Yankees and A's arranged a news conference
for Giambi in the Raiders' locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "The Yankees ... it's as close to being a rock star as you can
get," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The A's are down to their last Giambi now and Jeremy is
out-hitting brother Jason .353 to .263, but he is no rock star.
Jeremy's success makes Jason happy, but Jason says he is even happier
to be a Yankee. It has nothing to do with money, either, he insists.</TE>
<TE>   Let's summarize Giambi's contract dealings. He wanted a no-trade
clause from the A's coming out of spring training a year ago. He
didn't get one, but got a six-year offer for $90 million. The Yankees
offered him $30 million more than that. The A's then said they would
throw in the no-trade clause that Giambi would have signed eight
months earlier. So he signed with the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a business decision for [the A's], and the Yankees were
over here with seven years and the A's were over here," he said. "I
know everybody wants to bring money into it, but when I sat down and
looked it over, the Yankees were the best fit."</TE>
<TE>   And, he said, there is something else.</TE>
<TE>   "When is the last time we won a World Series around here?" he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Fitting in with the Yankees hasn't been easy for Giambi, who said
he "kind of tiptoed around" for a while, but got a lot of help from
shortstop Derek Jeter and Manager Joe Torre. They encouraged him to
just be himself. It is probably good advice since Giambi being Giambi
is one of the top sluggers in baseball, the American League most
valuable player in 2000 and runner-up to Ichiro Suzuki last season.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is still learning about New York. Only last week, he
drove his car to Yankee Stadium for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "This is definitely different, trust me," Giambi said. "Life has
changed. I'm trying to become comfortable in my own skin."</TE>
<TE>   He could not ask for anything more than being a Yankee, playing in
Yankee Stadium and, if all goes right, playing in October.</TE>
<TE>   As for the booing, Giambi takes it in stride, even at Yankee
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Being the guy, they want big things," he said. "Subconsciously,
I've been putting pressure on myself to produce, but everybody has
confidence in me. I feel like I'm coming around."</TE>

<LD>Hollywood Park opens its 65-day spring-summer meet with the $75,000
Harry Henson Stakes, named in honor of the late track announcer.
Contested at 51/2 furlongs on the turf, the Henson has a field of 10,
including 121-pound highweight Red Briar.</LD>
<LD>   It is not the best race on the card, however. That distinction
belongs to the seventh, a $62,000 allowance at a mile on the turf.</LD>
<LD>   Although it may not be labeled a stakes, the seventh boasts plenty
of quality.</LD>
<TE>   Among the nine scheduled to run are four graded or group stakes
winners--Nicobar, Ladies Din, Startac and Marine. Add Thady Quill,
National Anthem and the speedy Apache Wings and it is a classier
group than the one that lined up in the San Juan Capistrano, a Grade
I, on Santa Anita's final day.</TE>
<TE>   Ladies Din is the richest member of the field, having earned
$1,678,304 in a career that has seen him win 10 of 33, nearly all for
trainer Julio Canani and owners Terry Lanni and Bernie Schiappa.</TE>
<TE>   Startac, a stablemate of the brilliant mare Astra, will be making
his first start of 2002 for trainer Laura De Seroux. Idle since
finishing ninth in the Hollywood Derby on Nov. 25, the Theatrical
colt's biggest claim to fame was a nose win at 11-1 in the
Secretariat, a Grade I, last summer at Arlington Park. That
victory--and three others--all came with former trainer Simon Bray.</TE>
<TE>   The field is completed by longshots Last Parade, who is winless in
six races on the turf, and Hook Call, whose last victory came Feb.
25, 2000, at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Jason Lumpkins. The jockey won six races at Bay Meadows
on Sunday and is second in the standings to perennial leader Russell
Baze.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Patrick Kelly. The New York-based trainer is three for
73 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling The Price Spirit in the
third, using Splendid Nature, Cat In The Country and the entry of
Treacherous Zone-Two Thirty Seven in the fourth and Red Briar, Line
Rider and From A To Z in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Final from Santa Anita: Previous day/meet total: 3/233.
Money: Previous day/meet total: $20.40/$1,353. Total money bet:
$1,468.</TE>

<HD>Murray Doesn't Sell Palffy Short</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Jason Allison is the Kings' answer to Shaquille O'Neal, as Coach
Andy Murray suggested last week, then who is Ziggy Palffy's
counterpart?</LD>
<LD>   "I guess you could call him a short Kobe [Bryant]," Murray said of
the Slovak winger, who had four goals and three assists in the first
three games of the opening-round series against the Colorado
Avalanche. "You know, a lot of flair and, obviously, tremendous skill
level and finishing ability. Both make a lot of money....</LD>
<LD>   "We've seen this before from Ziggy. I'm not surprised by it. It's
just [that] you'd like to see it for 82 games. It would be a treat.
That's the bottom line with Ziggy: I still don't think he realizes
how good he can or could be."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After benching Jaroslav Bednar and Lubomir Visnovsky in favor of
Nelson Emerson and Andreas Lilja in Game 3, Murray made another
change Tuesday night, inserting right wing Steve Heinze and benching
Cliff Ronning.</TE>
<TE>   "Cliff hasn't been feeling real well of late," Murray said before
the game, "so we're giving him a break. He's just not 100%. He could
play, but it's a coach's decision as much as anything.</TE>
<TE>   "Nelson Emerson came into the lineup and was very hungry. We would
hope that Steve Heinze would come in with that same type of
determination.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought Emerson was strong."</TE>
<TE>   Said Emerson, who had played in three of 19 games before Monday
night: "When I had my concussion early in the year, I could have
probably shut it down and retired. This is why I came back, just to
play in a game like [Monday]."</TE>
<TE>   Heinze, who had played in one of the Kings' previous 10 games,
hadn't scored a goal since Jan. 15. He scored 15 in the regular
season, none in his last 27 games.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Steven Reinprecht touches the puck at Staples Center, no one
boos.</TE>
<TE>   When his Avalanche teammates call to him in the dressing room,
they often yell, "Hey, throw-in."</TE>
<TE>   That could be changing if Reinprecht continues playing as he has
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Last season's trade between the Kings and Avalanche is usually
called the "Rob Blake trade." Sometimes, it is known as the "Adam
Deadmarsh-Aaron Miller deal." Reinprecht's role seemed to be as the
answer to a trivia question.</TE>
<TE>   Or so it seems around the Avalanche dressing room.</TE>
<TE>   "When the guys want to joke around, they call me 'throw-in,' stuff
like that," Reinprecht said. "I guess there's no changing that. It
was a pretty big trade."</TE>
<TE>   That may be changing. Reinprecht scored six minutes into the
second period Tuesday and the Avalanche went on to win, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   He has brought some much-needed offense to an Avalanche team that
was without Forsberg during the regular season and Milan Hejduk since
Feb. 28.</TE>
<TE>   Reinprecht was fourth on the Avalanche with 19 goals and tied for
fourth with 46 points. In the playoffs, he has three points,
including the game-winning goal in a 5-3 victory in Game 2 against
the Kings on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the King fans boo Blake.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good thing that they save that for Blakey," Reinprecht
said. "At least, that's how I feel.</TE>
<TE>   "The trade is behind me and I don't dwell on it. I got to win a
Stanley Cup. I just want to continue my progress as a hockey player."</TE>
<TE>   That progress has been significant, in the eyes of one teammate
who had not seen Reinprecht play this season until the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a whole different player now," Forsberg said. "He has some
dangerous wheels on him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reinprecht's development as a player hasn't surprised the King
hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot has been made about the fact it was Rob Blake for Adam
Deadmarsh and Aaron Miller," Murray said. "People have kind of
forgotten about Steven Reinprecht. I tried to remind people at the
time of the trade that Steve Reinprecht is a very good player."</TE>
<TE>   Reinprecht had 12 goals and 29 points with the Kings before the
trade.</TE>
<TE>   "[The Avalanche] asked for him," King General Manager Dave Taylor
said. "I think their people liked him as much as we did when we
signed him as a free agent out of Wisconsin. He's a clever offensive
player."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Foster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Viscous hits have been common in the series.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the history between the teams, including a seven-game
playoff series last year and four rough games this season, it's not a
surprise that tempers are flaring.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some big hits out there," Colorado captain Joe Sakic
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've kind of developed a dislike for one another. Especially
with the way the games have been.... Guys are skating hard so when
you do see hits, they're bigger because of that."</TE>

<KH>NBA PLAYOFFS PORTLAND vs. LAKERS: SERIES REPORT/LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Report: West Close to Job in Memphis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Laker since 1960, when he arrived a rookie guard from West
Virginia, Jerry West is close to leaving the organization for
Memphis, Tenn., where he would run the basketball operations for the
Grizzlies, an NBA source has told the Memphis Commercial-Appeal.</LD>
<LD>   Those close to West insist that the Hall-of-Fame player and
builder of two Laker championship eras has not struck a deal with
Grizzly owner Michael Heisley. West continues to mull whether he
would return full time to the game, and whether the Grizzlies or
Atlanta Hawks would be a favorable destination, those sources said.</LD>
<LD>   "There's not a deal that's signed, there's not a deal in
principle, there's not a deal in place,'' a source familiar with the
discussions said.</LD>
<TE>   According to the Commercial-Appeal, West is expected to be named
president of the Grizzlies, with control over all basketball
decisions. Dick Versace, who has that title now and has three years
left on a five-year deal, would be demoted to general manager. Under
orders from Heisley, Versace fired general manager Billy Knight last
week.</TE>
<TE>   West, 63, resigned from the Lakers nearly two years ago, citing
health reasons, but gradually resumed scouting and advisory roles,
and was a valued consultant to his protege, Mitch Kupchak, who had
risen to assume West's decision-making position.</TE>
<TE>   After building a five-time champion in the 1980s, when Magic
Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy carried the dynasty,
West retooled the Lakers a decade later.</TE>
<TE>   Led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the Lakers have won the
last two titles.</TE>
<TE>   The best-of-seven first round, a possibility by next year's NBA
postseason, was received with something less than full support
Tuesday in El Segundo, where the Lakers prepared for Game 2 of their
best-of-five series against the Portland Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   While sometimes it seems that the last thing basketball players
want to do is play basketball, center Shaquille O'Neal said it simply
is time to stop tinkering with the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to play the same game that Kareem and Wilt [Chamberlain]
and Bill Russell played," O'Neal said. "This new bull, I'm not happy
with this new-age stuffIf they formed a basketball union with guys
like Kareem and Magic and Isiah [Thomas], and they made the rules up,
I'd respect it and I'd have to let it go. But guys just sitting on
their [butts] all day saying, 'We need to do this, we need to do
that,' that's not good for the game. And it's boring. I will not
participate in it."</TE>
<TE>   And he stood up and left.</TE>
<TE>   While the Lakers would seem to have the most to lose in a short
series, where they'd be more vulnerable to a weaker team that
happened to be playing well, Coach Phil Jackson agreed with O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very disappointed," he said. "It's another money-grabbing
scheme, to play seven-game series.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously everybody wants more money in the pool, especially in
the playoffs, but it's a grind the way it is."</TE>

<HD>Leach Is Retiring as USC's Tennis Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dick Leach, nearing the end of a long and storied career as men's
tennis coach at USC, wondered when he would know it was time to move
on. Would it be a feeling? Some sort of sign? Too many days of
driving 100 miles round trip to USC from his home in Orange County?</LD>
<LD>   A trusted friend told him: "You'll know."</LD>
<LD>   The moment arrived Sunday night. He returned home after an
emotional 4-3 victory at Stanford and couldn't sleep. Leach got up,
wrote a letter to his boss, Associate Athletic Director Daryl Gross,
detailing his plan to retire at the end of this tennis season in
June. "Then I went to sleep," Leach said. "It must have been the
right thing."</LD>
<TE>   Leach took the job in 1980 and in 22 postseason appearances won
NCAA team titles in 1991, 1993 and 1994. Additionally, he coached two
NCAA singles champions--Robert Van't Hof in 1980 and Cecil Mamiit in
1996--as well as three NCAA doubles champions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been wonderful," said Leach, 62, adding he was lucky to have
been able to coach his two sons, Rick and Jon, at USC for four years.
He will stay involved in the program, advising Athletic Director Mike
Garrett and his successor as tennis coach, as well as fund raising,
remaining on the staff as emeritus director.</TE>
<TE>   "That was really nice of 'SC," he said. "They wanted me to stay
longer."</TE>
<TE>   Previously, speculation had centered on Rick Leach taking over for
his father. But the school will go on a nationwide search because
Rick is simply doing too well on the ATP Tour and realized he isn't
suited to the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "He really missed the pro tour [after a year as an assistant],"
Dick Leach said. "He just loves to play. He's still playing at a good
level. After a year, he decided coaching was not for him. When we
were driving home, he would say, 'How in the world have you done this
for 23 years?'"</TE>
<TE>   Rick, 37, has had extraordinary success late in his career. He won
the Australian Open doubles title in 2000 with partner Ellis
Ferreira, and they won the ATP World Doubles Challenge Cup in
Bangalore, India, in February. Leach has won at least one title every
year for the last 16 years, the longest streak among active players
on the tour.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there won't be any shortage of applicants for the position
at USC. Three of Leach's former assistants are coaches at prominent
Division I programs.</TE>

<HD>Jazz Gets the Best of Kings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vlade Divac should have known better. The Utah Jazz are ageless,
resourceful and supremely tough--anything, in fact, but done.</LD>
<LD>   Donyell Marshall had 19 points and eight rebounds, and Karl Malone
had 18 points and 12 rebounds, and the Jazz shocked the top-seeded
Sacramento Kings, 93-86, Tuesday night at Sacramento, tying their
contentious playoff series at one game apiece.</LD>
<LD>   Andrei Kirilenko scored 15 points and blocked five shots as the
Jazz ran out to a big lead during a horrible first-half performance
by Sacramento. Utah then held off the Kings' last rallies to end a
seven-game losing streak against the Pacific Division champion Kings.</LD>
<TE>   After Sacramento eked out a three-point victory in Game 1, King
center Divac said he believed the Jazz were "done" after taking their
best shot at the NBA's regular-season champions.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Kings appeared to be finished with anything
resembling their regular style of play. The Kings shot 30% in the
first three quarters and never caught up to the Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Webber scored 18 points and Divac had 21, but they both
spent the game in foul trouble, with Divac fouling out with five
minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 111, Charlotte 103--Tracy McGrady couldn't have felt any
better. His back barely bothered him and the Magic tied the series
with the Hornets, 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   McGrady scored 31 points, but only four after the third quarter,
to lead the Magic to an overtime victory at Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Game 3 is Saturday at Orlando, where McGrady believes the Magic
can wrap up the series.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everything is in our favor right now," he said. "We have
home-court advantage now and hopefully we can close this thing out at
home."</TE>
<TE>   Teammates Pat Garrity and Troy Hudson took over in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Garrity made a three-pointer to give the Magic a 102-99 lead, and
after four Charlotte misses, Hudson scored on a jumper and made five
free throws to seal the victory. Hudson finished with 26 points and
Garrity had 18. Elden Campbell led the Hornets with 27 points.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women still will earn less than the men at Wimbledon, even though
total prize money at the Grand Slam tournament is going up.</LD>
<LD>   The All England Club on Tuesday announced a 5% increase across the
board in payoffs, pushing the purse to $12.7 million.</LD>
<LD>   The men's champion will receive $756,000 and the women's champion
will get $700,000.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Goran Ivanisevic was paid $720,000 and Venus Williams
$666,000.</TE>
<TE>   The total prize money is $6.29 million for men and $5.32 million
for women, with the rest of the overall fund going to mixed doubles
and senior doubles events.</TE>
<TE>   The discrepancy between men's and women's prize money had narrowed
the last two years because Wimbledon gave the women higher percentage
increases. But not this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Women's Tennis Assn., which has campaigned for years for equal
pay, was disappointed by the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to be concerned over the lack of equality between
women's and men's prize money," said Josh Ripple, chief operations
officer for the WTA Tour. "Over the next year, we will work with
Wimbledon to review the disparity."</TE>
<TE>   All England Club Chairman Tim Phillips said last year he did not
expect to see equal pay in the foreseeable future.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think we're being fair," he said. "We've applied a 5%
increase of both the men's and women's total and the women's total is
a marginally smaller increase. It makes a tiny difference."</TE>

<HD>Koivu's Goal Pushes Montreal Past Boston</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Only a few months ago, Saku Koivu was weak from chemotherapy and in
the midst of a fight with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday night, a recovered and robust Koivu made a deft move to
score the go-ahead goal in the third period to rally the Canadiens
past the Boston Bruins, 5-3, at Montreal.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great feeling to come back like that and win in the first
playoff game in Montreal in four years," said Koivu, 27, the
Canadiens' captain whose health struggle was a source of concern and
inspiration for his team all season.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know what I thought when the puck went in because it all
happened so fast."</TE>
<TE>   The Canadiens lead the best-of-seven Eastern Conference series,
2-1. Game 4 is Thursday at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal trailed, 3-1, after two periods but rallied on goals by
Donald Audette, Doug Gilmour, Koivu and an empty-netter with one
second left by Joe Juneau.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins took the lead on goals by P.J. Axelsson, Bill Guerin
and Nick Boynton.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 6, Toronto 1--Mark Parrish scored two of New
York's four power-play goals and the Islanders won their first home
playoff game in nine years.</TE>
<TE>   The Maple Leafs lead the first-round series, 2-1. Game 4 is today
at Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The Islanders, who scored six consecutive goals, were four for
nine with the man advantage. Toronto was 0 for 8 and is 0 for 18 in
the series.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 3, Carolina 1--Martin Brodeur fell 2:33 short of
posting consecutive shutouts, but the Devils still tied the
best-of-seven first-round series, 2-2, at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The teams will play Game 5 tonight at Raleigh, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   The Devils took advantage of another poor game by Arturs Irbe, who
gave up two soft goals on eight shots in the first period. He was
replaced by Kevin Weekes at the start of the second.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 1, Chicago 0--Brent Johnson shut out Chicago for a third
consecutive game and Pavol Demitra scored at Chicago to give the
Blues a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson tied a league record for most consecutive playoff
shutouts, a mark held by three others, most recently Frank McCool of
Toronto in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, the first goalie to earn shutouts in his first three
career playoff victories, made 27 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Vancouver 2--Steve Yzerman scored the go-ahead goal 56
seconds into the third period at Vancouver, Canada, and the Red Wings
tied the best-of-seven series, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   After losing the first two games at home, the Red Wings return to
Detroit for Game 5 on Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Schilling's Splitter Baffles Braves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Curt Schilling wasn't trying to keep up with Randy Johnson. It only
seemed that way to the Atlanta Braves.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling (4-1) gave up four hits and struck out 10 in eight
innings, and the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Braves, 5-2, Tuesday
night at Atlanta in a game between the teams in last year's NL
championship series.</LD>
<LD>   OK, so Schilling wasn't quite as effective as the Big Unit was
Sunday. Johnson pitched a two-hitter, striking out 17 in a 7-1
victory over Colorado.</LD>
<TE>   "Randy pitches at another level," Schilling said. "The game is
hard enough as it is. I don't go out there with the mind-set that I'm
going to do better than him."</TE>
<TE>   Schilling baffled the Braves, getting eight of his strikeouts on
swinging strikes as he relied on a split-finger fastball much more
than usual.</TE>
<TE>   Andruw Jones hit a home run in the fourth inning for Atlanta and
Rafael Furcal's fly ball in the eighth scored the other run.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Milwaukee 4--Vladimir Guerrero and Brad Wilkerson each
had two-run singles at Montreal and the first-place Expos extended
their winning streak to four games.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos, who played before a season-low crowd of 3,561, also won
for the sixth time in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee lost for the first time in five games under interim
Manager Jerry Royster.</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, St. Louis 3--Vance Wilson, replacing injured Mike
Piazza, hit a go-ahead single to lead Jeff D'Amico and the Mets at
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Piazza had a run-scoring single in the first inning to extend his
hitting streak to eight games, then grabbed his left hamstring as he
was running to first.</TE>
<TE>   D'Amico (2-1) gave up a 452-foot, two-run homer to Albert Pujols
in the first inning but settled down.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 12, Chicago 4--David Bell and Reggie Sanders each
hit two-run homers and Tsuyoshi Shinjo had a solo homer at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Sosa accounted for two of the Cubs' runs with his seventh
home run in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Rueter (2-1) gave up two hits in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 4, Houston 3--Alex Gonzalez's one-out single in the 12th
inning scored Luis Castillo at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo had tripled against Brandon Puffer (0-1) with one out,
giving him a Marlin-record 23.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir Nunez (3-0) gave up two hits in three scoreless innings.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 3, Colorado 2--Barry Larkin returned to the Reds'
lineup, getting a go-ahead RBI single in the fourth and making a
pivotal play at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Larkin threw out Jose Ortiz at third base when Ortiz strayed too
far in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Larkin, who singled twice, has been slowed by pulled muscles in
his side.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 8, San Diego 5--Pat Burrell homered and drove in two
runs at Philadelphia, and the Phillies' ended a losing streak at
four.</TE>
<TE>   Deivi Cruz's grand slam against starter Randy Wolf (1-0) capped
San Diego's five-run first. Wolf gave up five runs and three hits in
five innings. He retired 12 batters in a row after Cruz's homer.</TE>

<HD>Quarter Haunts the Trail Blazers</HD>

<AU>CHUCK CULPEPPER</AU>
<BD>PORTLAND OREGONIAN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The clock was just kidding. It said 0:00, signaling an ending, but it
was just kidding.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth quarter of the Portland-Laker game of Sunday, June 4,
2000, lives on--still the unmentionable elephant in the corner of the
room. See it? It still hovers at Staples Center, above yet another
Trail Blazer-Laker gathering, above the Laker poise that rules
another series but might have looked different if that fourth quarter
had.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Smith, so hot in the third quarter that day, plays in Texas,
yet that fourth quarter breathes on.</LD>
<TE>   Arvydas Sabonis, so bumptious with Shaquille O'Neal that Western
Conference final series, lives so far away he's living night while
we're living day, yet that fourth quarter breathes on.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Dunleavy pops up in the stands at Duke games or in
Boston wearing earphones next to Bob Costas, yet that fourth quarter
breathes on.</TE>
<TE>   That 12-minute little swatch of shock did more than rally the
Lakers from a 15-point deficit, clinch Game 7, arrange their first
NBA title since Magic Johnson started wearing slacks to work, and
funnel them toward a mini-dynasty threatening to drop the mini.</TE>
<TE>   It gave birth.</TE>
<TE>   Out of its chaos came the shouting sense of invincibility the
Lakers carry around the court these days, their second-most important
advantage behind O'Neal. Sure, their 2001 title only deepened their
stripe of cocksureness, but its birth certificate would read June 4,
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, it's easy to forget the Lakers' image before June 4:
playoff knuckleheads. Their exclamation points of today still bent
like question marks then. While Coach Phil Jackson doesn't draw the
line as neatly between June 2000 and April 2002--he views that
quarter as anomaly--he does say, "It gave us a belief that we could
overcome obstacles."</TE>
<TE>   Busy as could be, it also reinforced a sports axiom: To reach the
wide boulevards of victory parades, teams so often must squeeze
through incredibly narrow hallways--you know, show a little Houdini.</TE>
<TE>   Check the recent Super Bowl tournament for details. Look at most
any March Madness. See the 1996 World Series, how a single Jim
Leyritz three-run homer erased an eighth-inning deficit, helped New
York catch Atlanta at two games all, helped the new Yankees realize
their know-how.</TE>
<TE>   Life is tough enough when somebody has scary pitching or Shaquille
O'Neal, without the added trump card of the know-how.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers lead the Trail Blazers, 1-0, their fans chant,
"Three-peat!" and nobody thinks they'll lose, least of all
themselves. How different might things look? Who knows, but the mind
does wonder and wander--back to one thrilling, haunting little
quarter that pretty much altered league history, that's all.</TE>

<HD>Jones' Blood Is Still Racing</HD>
<DH>Motor sports: Racing legend, recipient of Shav Glick Award,
still has that competitive urge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parnelli Jones is disappointed by the one thing in auto racing that
bothers him.</LD>
<LD>   NASCAR doesn't send him a hard card that allows him entry into its
events. Never mind that Jones won plenty of the organization's stock
car races.</LD>
<LD>   "CART sends me a hard card every year. So does the IRL. USAC gives
me a lifetime card," Jones says, warming up to his subject like an
old roadster readying to peel out of pit lane. "NASCAR has never done
anything like that for me. My son [PJ] is driving down there [in the
Busch Series], and I've got to pay $1,500 for a pit pass.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm in the International Motorsports Hall of Fame, the Novi Hall
of Fame, the Midget Hall of Fame, the Sprint Car Hall of Fame, the
Indianapolis Hall of Fame. I would think guys in my position would be
an asset around the races. It ain't the money, it's the principle."</TE>
<TE>   Jones won't have to lay out the cash Sunday before the Napa Auto
Parts 500 at California Speedway, where he will be awarded the third
Eagle One Shav Glick Award for distinguished achievement in motor
racing by a Californian.</TE>
<TE>   Jones joins legendary owner-driver Dan Gurney and NHRA founder
Wally Parks as recipients of the award named for The Times' longtime
motorsports writer.</TE>
<TE>   Jones got his start in the early 1950s, with a fake ID, driving a
jalopy on a dirt track in Gardena Stadium. He won the Indy 500 as a
driver in 1963, and as an owner in 1970 and '71, with Al Unser
driving. He broke the 150-mph barrier at Indianapolis, and he drove
the first turbine-powered race car there. He won the Pikes Peak hill
climb and, with longtime partner Vel Miletich, owned a Formula One
team, with Mario Andretti driving.</TE>
<TE>   Jones won 22 NASCAR West Coast series races, but his finest moment
in stock cars might have been dominating the NASCAR Motor Trend 500
at Riverside Raceway in 1967, though his 1968 effort was pretty good
too. After setting a track record on state-of-the-art Firestone
tires, he says, NASCAR made him use the older style tires he had sold
a day earlier to the other drivers.</TE>
<TE>   "They made me start dead last," Jones recalls. "I took the lead
before the first pit stop, rolled down the window and gave Bill
France [Sr.] the one-lap sign."</TE>
<TE>   A legend in motorsports?</TE>
<TE>   "I am what I am," Jones says in his Torrance office, a huge photo
hanging behind him that celebrates his 1963 Indy 500 victory. "I
still love racing. I go to the races, I watch it all the time on
television. It's such a part of my life, why would I do anything
else?"</TE>
<TE>   He is 68 now, but about two weeks ago turned hot laps around
Willow Springs Raceway, topping 100 mph while filming a commercial
for Speed Channel. He gives rides at racing schools to those who want
to know what it's like to take a lap at speed. There are public
appearances, charity events, and his real estate business.</TE>
<TE>   He drove competitively as recently as last year, driving a Trans
Am car in a vintage race, which may be apropos for a vintage driver.</TE>
<TE>   "Parnelli Jones is a living example of the American rags-to-riches
story," says Glick, who is undergoing minor surgery today and will
miss the weekend racing. "Although he won the 500 only once, he is
still held in awe at the speedway for his daring style of racing.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, he is one of racing's revered senior citizens."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always that way for Rufus Parnell Jones. Before he
dropped out of San Pedro High in the 11th grade, he and a buddy, Bill
Calder, began racing a jalopy on the quarter-mile dirt oval in
Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was only 17, four years too young to race legally. So his
buddy Bill, who had ribbed him by calling him Parnellie after a
schoolgirl named Nellie, made the fake ID and Parnelli Jones was
born.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really comfortable financially--I'm not the world's richest
by any means but I'm reasonably comfortable," says Jones, who made
his fortune as a distributor of Firestone tires for 11 western
states. "I look back and see all the water under the bridge and
almost can't believe that it's me. It's like I'm me, and Parnelli is
somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   Once he got decent engines in those jalopies that ran on tracks in
Long Beach, San Bernardino and Carpinteria, Jones also proved to be
fast.</TE>
<TE>   Folks started calling him "Indy material," and by 1961, he was. He
was the co-rookie of the year, with Bobby Marshman, and sat on the
pole in 1962 and '63. After winning the race, driving for the late
J.C. Agajanian of San Pedro, in 1963, he nearly won again in 1967.
Driving Andy Granatelli's turbine-powered car, he had almost lapped
second running A.J. Foyt when, with 31/2 laps to go, a $7 bearing
broke and his car coasted into the pits. It was his last race at Indy
as a driver.</TE>
<TE>   He and Miletich, who died in 1998, then put together Vel's
Parnelli Jones Racing. With Andretti , Unser and Joe Leonard driving,
it became known as "Superteam" and lived up to its name, winning 53
USAC races. There were plenty more victories for Jones as well, in
SCCA Formula 5000, AHRA and NHRA drag racing and off-road events,
among them the Baja 500 and 1000 twice each.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always a contender for a win whenever he sat in a car, no
matter what kind of car it was," says Gurney, who employed Parnelli's
older son, PJ, as a driver in the CART series.</TE>
<TE>   Says Jones, "Until Roger Penske came along, we were the team to
beat."</TE>
<TE>   As successful as he was, however, there is one thing he would do
different.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have kept my younger son out of racing," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Page Jones suffered a life-threatening head injury in 1994 when
his sprint car flipped and was hit by a trailing car while he was
leading a race in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Parnelli compares the injury to violently shaking a baby. It left
Page, 29, struggling with short-term memory and he compensates by
carrying a note pad with him. He has since driven at Danny McKeever's
race driving school, married last year and is working for his
father-in-law in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   And, Parnelli says, "Page is about ready to get his driver's
license."</TE>
<TE>   "Racing's been very good to me," Parnelli adds. "That's the only
downside I've ever had, really. I just cry sometimes."</TE>

<LD>   Matt Chou and Michael Haier, playing No. 3 doubles, trailed
Carsten Ball and Eric Frisbee, 5-2, but took the next five games to
win, 7-5, and give University (17-2-1, 8-0) a 4-2 lead after one

<LD>Glendora High's Larry Monroe, The Times' player of the year in the

fifth San Gabriel Valley all-star basketball games on Friday at
Pasadena City College.</LD>

<HD>A Baseball Scout's Dream</HD>
<DH>Two dozen evaluators watch pitcher Alex Merricks of Oxnard
face Camarillo slugger Delmon Young.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The chatty horde of baseball scouts that descended upon Oxnard High
on Tuesday turned quiet in the top of the first inning when
Camarillo's No. 3 batter strode to the plate.</LD>
<LD>   Almost in unison, the two dozen scouts lifted their radar guns to
record the speed of the first pitch. The fastball crossed the plate a
few inches below the strike zone, making an unmistakable "pop" as it
struck the catcher's glove.</LD>
<LD>   The scouts checked their guns: 93 mph.</LD>
<TE>   It was this display of pitching power, the scouts said, that drew
them to this Pacific View League matchup between front-runner
Camarillo and second-place Oxnard. The scouts said they had come to
watch Oxnard left-hander Alex Merricks, a 6-foot senior who has
signed with Arizona State and could go in the top rounds of the
amateur baseball draft in June.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, the event was a two-for-one special.</TE>
<TE>   Hitting third and playing center field for Camarillo was Delmon
Young, a fleet 6-3 power hitter considered by some as the Barry Bonds
of high school baseball. Young might have been the top player
selected in the upcoming draft--if it wasn't for the fact that he is
a junior.</TE>
<TE>   "If you polled all the scouts here, I think that would be the
consensus," said Craig Wallenbrock, a former major league scout who
works as a hitting instructor. "He's putting up numbers that are
unheard of."</TE>
<TE>   Coming into Tuesday's game, Young had a .608 average in 79
at-bats, with 14 home runs and 48 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Merricks insisted he would pitch to Young as if he were facing any
other batter.</TE>
<TE>   He followed his low fastball with a 94-mph pitch outside. Faced
with a 2-and-0 count, Merricks threw the next pitch over the plate.
Young responded by smacking a 93-mph fastball past a diving second
baseman and into center field.</TE>
<TE>   It was the only hit Young would collect on the day in three at
bats, dropping his average to .598. Merricks (3-3) also had an
unremarkable game, giving up six runs, three earned, while striking
out seven and walking four over five innings in an 8-2 loss that left
Oxnard (8-12-1) three games behind Camarillo (20-3) in league play.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really pay attention to individual stats," the reserved
Young said. "As long as we're winning, it really doesn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the scouts departed after Merricks left in the fifth, but
by then Merricks and Young had given them a couple of gems to
consider. Merricks' highlight came in the fifth inning, when he
struck out Young on a nasty curveball. He also hit Young with a
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I could have thrown some more strikes today, but overall I
felt good," said Merricks, who has 68 strikeouts in 43 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Young's best play came in the field. After Oxnard's Gabe Aguilar
stroked a line drive to right-center field, he made the mistake of
testing Young's arm by trying to stretch the double into a triple.
Young, who fielded the ball just after Aguilar rounded second, threw
a bullet to shortstop Brad Boyer, whose throw to third beat Aquilar
by several feet.</TE>
<TE>   Merricks and Young both have propedigrees. Merricks has two
cousins playing in the minor leagues, while Young's brother, Dmitri,
plays first base for the Detroit Tigers and is a lifetime .297 hitter
in five full seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Delmon has much more raw power than Dmitri had at the same age,"
Wallenbrock said. "I think Del is ahead of Dmitri for the same point
in time."</TE>
<TE>   Merricks almost missed the opportunity to face Young this season
after transferring to Moorpark in the fall. Merricks attributed the
move to miscommunication with Oxnard coaches over his starts as a
junior.</TE>
<TE>   But Merricks became athletically ineligible after the Southern
Section denied his petition for a hardship waiver, prompting him to
re-enroll at Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo Coach Scott Cline, who watched Young shatter several of
his school hitting records, is ecstatic that his star will return for
another year.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen a kid have a year like he's having right now,"
Cline said. "He's going to break every record there is--if he gets
pitches to hit."</TE>

<HD>It's a Different Kind of Chase Scene</HD>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds aren't ever going to be happy homer
buddies, posing for photo ops, mugging for the cameras, hugging for
the fans, lugging the nation along for a giggle fest and home run
record chase.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds is not Mark McGwire. "It's different between me and Mark and
me and Barry," Sosa said.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds and Sosa chase the home runs for sure, but Bonds won't be
McGwire, a reluctant but ultimately companionable foil to Sosa's
"Let's be friends" approach to the world, to the fans, to his
teammates, to his opponents. "I'm older," Bonds said, "and in
baseball it's the cardinal rule to respect your elders."</LD>
<TE>   He was kidding. Really. Sosa raised an eyebrow, then a second,
when Bonds' cardinal rule statement was relayed. "Who made up the
rules, Barry?" Sosa said.</TE>
<TE>   He was kidding. Really.</TE>
<TE>   It was an uneasy pre-game probing of the psyches of baseball's two
best sluggers Tuesday. Sosa's Cubs and Bonds' Giants met at Wrigley
Field--where earmuffs and two pairs of socks and mittens were de
rigueur--for their first regular-season meeting.</TE>
<TE>   This drew a pack of curious media because in spring training Bonds
and Sosa had exchanged some curiously nasty words over what had
seemed an innocent meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds told Sosa to go ahead and chase Bonds' single-season home
run record of 73. Sosa shared this challenge with Chicago reporters.
Bonds read the replay of his conversation and suggested--kiddingly or
maybe not--that Sosa should quit "running his mouth" so much. Sosa
replied that Bonds was seriously testy and that maybe all those
terrible things that had been said about him in the past were true.
Bonds said Sosa was "childish."</TE>
<TE>   So if we can't have our home run boys as best buddies, this would
be fine, having them as bitter enemies, pushing each other to new and
bigger accomplishments just to spite each other.</TE>
<TE>   But Bonds sat in the visitors' dugout Tuesday and complimented
Sosa on his outgoing personality, his great desire to be loved, his
wonderful talent, and then said that it was Sosa and Alex Rodriguez
who might break the big record, Hank Aaron's total of 755, and not
himself.</TE>
<TE>   "My time is done," Bonds said. "It's not enough time for me and
that's just reality."</TE>
<TE>   He had limped into Wrigley with a sore right hamstring that did
not welcome the windy cold. So what, he said, if he had 575 career
homers or that he had his best year in 2001? He turns 38 in July. He
gets walked all the time. "I have four or five years left and that's
it, I'm done," he said. "You intentionally walk me 100-plus times,
that's time I lost. I don't have seven more years to make up the
differences."</TE>
<TE>   So leave it to 33-year-old Sosa and his 457 homers, or to the
young and powerful A-Rod to take up the chase, Bonds said. Leave him
to chasing a World Series ring.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the stands, all alone, wearing a leather jacket and a
smile, was Ernie Banks, the 71-year-old former Cub great. Banks is
mostly a Marina del Rey resident these days but he wouldn't miss
Sammy and Barry.</TE>
<TE>   "No way," Banks says. "Not two bashers like those two. This is
fine."</TE>
<TE>   It is the show, Banks said, that he is sure we will all follow
this summer. Banks rolled his eyes at Bonds' apparent surrendering of
the Aaron chase to others. "Barry's just talking," Banks said.
"Barry's still gonna chase."</TE>
<TE>   This introspective, gracious, thoughtful, complimentary Bonds
still takes getting used to.</TE>
<TE>   All day Chicago talk radio was filled with a debate about who is
the better player. Even though the Blackhawks were going to be in a
playoff game at the United Center, a big deal since the Hawks hadn't
been in the playoffs for five years, there was no discussion of
hockey, only of Bonds and Sosa.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago fans were fair. Most of them said Bonds was the better
player right now. Since their Cubs are presently awful, since Bonds
was batting over .400 and had two more home runs than Sosa (8-6)
before Tuesday's game, and maybe because the Giants were in first
place and the Cubs were in last place, Chicago's fans were feeling
magnanimous.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a longing for the ferocious back-and-forth battle
McGwire and Sosa engaged in four seasons ago. That was fun, Bonds
said. "I stopped and watched it every day."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping both guys hit one out tonight," Banks said, "and that
the Cubs win. Then I hope they both come back and hit another out
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   What's interesting is that Bonds is becoming more like his rival.
He appreciates the approval of fans and a less contentious, more
professional relationship with the media. "It makes me feel good and
enjoy things I do more," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Much as he was poked and prodded and led on a path to controversy,
he would have none of it. He is here, he said, to win baseball games
and not some battle of home runs, or words, with Sosa. Sosa said
he'll be friends with everybody. Even Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the night, Sosa had a two-run homer. It came with
the Cubs trailing, 12-0. Bonds got hit by a pitch. Many of his
teammates hit home runs instead. The Giants beat the Cubs, 12-4. The
home run race is on. Bonds knows it. Sosa loves it. *</TE>

<HD>Entire Day Turns Out to Be a Big Bust for Kings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was trying to explain to the wife what a tough decision this is: Do
I join the guys in Colorado for the fifth game of the hockey
playoffs, stay overnight in a Denver hotel and miss her?</LD>
<LD>   Or do I cover the unveiling of the 2002 Playmate of the Year at
the Playboy Mansion, and get the chance to come home some time
Thursday night to be with her? Or early Friday morning?</LD>
<LD>   She seemed to think it was a pretty easy decision, and while I
can't remember the last time she packed my suitcase for me, she must
be a little out of practice because she packed like I was going away
for a month or two.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I TOLD Kings' center Jason Allison Tuesday morning at the team's
practice facility I had to decide between the Pepsi Center or the
Grotto, and right away he jumped to conclusions: "So I guess we won't
be seeing you in Colorado."</TE>
<TE>   I can't imagine leaving Allison alone at a critical time like
this. I've taught the guy how to score goals, and frankly nobody
would be going back to Colorado if I hadn't made him into the player
he is today.</TE>
<TE>   For that reason, I thought Coach Andy Murray would try to talk me
into joining the team. "We need you to keep working with Allison," he
said. "I'll give you Allison's cell phone number so you can talk to
him before Thursday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "That way you can stay here, as long as when we come back Friday,
you have pictures."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN I caught sports editor Bill Dwyre pocketing the invitation to
the Playboy Mansion the other day, I had to show him it was in my
name, and nontransferable.</TE>
<TE>   I know there are going to be Playmates from the '50s at the party,
and they'd probably bring some great early-adult memories back for
Dwyre, but I think it's pretty obvious he'd be out of place.</TE>
<TE>   My concern, of course, is I'm not at my best right now with a
scruffy week-old beard, but it was Hugh Hefner who reminded me
Tuesday afternoon that I'm a journalist, and not just another pretty
face.</TE>
<TE>   "You have an obligation to your readers to leave nothing uncovered
so you really have to be here," Hef said.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, that's kind of what I do for a living, too."</TE>
<TE>   Hefner refused to divulge who will be crowned Playmate of the
Year, which would have allowed me to break the story and still go to
Colorado. I told him I spent all day studying the candidates--month
by month, but finally focused my attention on Miss July because of
her measurements--5-6, 106 pounds, and her ultimate ambition is to
become an elementary school teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some other criteria we use in selecting our winner," he
said. "You'll have to see for yourself."</TE>
<TE>   This would mean abandoning the Kings. I told Hefner about my
efforts to help Allison score more, and he said he might have been
able to help.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I'm a big sports fan," he said, while telling me had
recently taken seven girlfriends to a Laker game. "That's a big tab,"
I said, and he admitted, "there is a down side" to having seven
girlfriends, but "you have to weigh the pros and cons."</TE>
<TE>   I don't have a big enough car for seven girlfriends, which would
probably be a con, along with a wife of 29 years who would probably
insist on riding shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN YOU get right down to it, there's no question I'd rather be
at the hockey game. In fact, what could possibly be more exciting
than a hockey game?</TE>
<TE>   "How about frolicking in the Playboy pool?" said a magazine
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a bathing suit," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "No one does," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ALLISON SHOOK his head. "What's the Playmate of the Year got to do
with sports?" I was beginning to feel like Master Kan counseling
young Grasshopper: "The fleeting sand in your hand is a reminder of
how quickly the season can end for your hockey team, you big lug, if
you try to get a grip on things you cannot grasp."</TE>
<TE>   I reminded Allison he has only scored a goal in three consecutive
games once this season, and after scoring the last two games, his
attention should only be on duplicating that feat.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to call your editor and make you go to Colorado," he
said, and now I understand why Colorado's Adam Foote punched him in
the nose the other night.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I'll score two goals tonight," Allison said, and maybe the
Playmate of the Year will ask me to give her a lift home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO ONE scored in the first period Tuesday night, and I blame the
guy who hired the guy with the electric guitar to play the National
Anthem. Instead of a rousing version of the Star Spangled Banner to
capture the excitement in the building, the Kings brought the
festivities to a slumbering halt.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche, using a former Kings' player, found the net in the
second period, and Grasshopper wasn't doing a thing.</TE>
<TE>   After the third period, the largest crowd to ever watch a hockey
game in the state of California went home frustrated. I would imagine
for those of us who will be going to the Playboy Mansion on Thursday,
it's just going to be that kind of week.</TE>
<TE>   However, one way or another, I expect to find the wife waiting for
me Thursday night--with razor in hand.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Associated Realtors:</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, T.J. I saw sign in Staples that said, 'TJ Simers move to
Denver.' I was a student at CU and I know for a fact they already
have some terrible columnists there, and they don't need another."</TE>
<TE>   Did you notice if Tom or Aida were holding up the sign?</TE>

<LD>Argentina's worsening economic crisis has not affected the country's
status as the World Cup favorite but it has angered Coach Marcelo "El
Loco'' Bielsa and his staff, who have threatened to quit if they are
not paid.</LD>
<LD>   Argentina is unbeaten in its last 17 games under Bielsa and his
chief assistant, Jose Peckerman, but the Argentine Football Assn.
(AFA) is behind in payments to the coaches.</LD>
<LD>   Bielsa has said he would resign after the World Cup if the
situation is not addressed, but the cash-strapped AFA is struggling
to meet its obligations, even though it will receive at least $1
million from FIFA simply for appearing in the first round of the
World Cup.</LD>
<TE>   "The AFA is not a money-making machine and owes money to Bielsa
and the rest of the national team staff," Julio Grondona, president
of the AFA and a FIFA vice president, told Reuters on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "In a country like ours, those who have contracts in dollars have
to sit down and evaluate the situation. We are paid in dollars by
FIFA ... but all our other contracts are in pesos."</TE>
<TE>   Ecuador striker Agustin "El Tin" Delgado, who scored nine goals
during qualifying play to steer his country to its first World Cup,
is being allowed to return to Ecuador by his English team,
Southampton, so that he can continue to recover at home from his
latest knee operation.</TE>
<TE>   Before joining Southampton, Delgado played for Necaxa in the
Mexican league.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico has announced two more warmup games before it travels to
the World Cup. Coach Javier Aguirre's team will play Colombia at
Azteca Stadium in Mexico City on May 12, then Bolivia at 3Com Park in
San Francisco on May 16.</TE>
<TE>   Europe</TE>
<TE>   Second-half goals by France's Zinedine Zidane and England's Steve
McManaman earned Real Madrid a 2-0 victory over Barcelona Tuesday in
the first match of their two-game European Champions League semifinal
series in front of 98,000 fans at Nou Camp Stadium in Barcelona.</TE>
<TE>   The second game will be played at Madrid on May 1, and Barcelona
has to win by three goals to reach the May 15 final.</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United of England plays Bayer Leverkusen of Germany in
the first game of the other semifinal series today in Manchester, and
United Coach Alex Ferguson said he is counting on his team
remembering its 1999 European championship.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope our experience helps us," he said. "It's a nervous
occasion. A semifinal is a game that you don't want. You wish you
could go straight to the final."</TE>
<TE>   Germany will be without midfielder Mehmet Scholl at the World Cup.
The 31-year-old Bayern Munich player told Coach Rudi Voeller he was
withdrawing for health reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "He explained his situation to me," Voeller said. "I regret it but
I have to accept it because the reasons for it are perfectly valid."</TE>
<TE>   European soccer's governing body, UEFA, announced that it will
abandon the "golden goal" rule, starting with next season's major
club competitions.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of the sudden-death solution, UEFA will revert to two
15-minute overtime periods and then penalty kicks to settle games  in
which results are needed.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Baggio's rapid return from knee ligament surgery--and the
two goals he scored for Brescia in his comeback game Sunday--has
Italy clamoring for his inclusion on Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's
World Cup squad.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign to include the 35-year-old star of the 1994 World Cup
extended to the weekly magazine Guerin Sportivo, whose latest issue
featured a cover showing Baggio wearing the shirts of the 31 other
World Cup nations.</TE>
<TE>   England's Coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said that he would name his
23-man roster May 7, adding, "There will be many disappointed
football players in this country."</TE>
<TE>   The Swedish coach has been spending his time lately dodging the
tabloid press, which has linked him romantically with TV personality
Ulrika Jonsson.</TE>

<HD>Loyola's Sanchez Has a Net Gain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jamie Sanchez has been at Loyola Marymount long enough to last
through four university presidents, play football at the school and
serve in such roles as assistant soccer coach, head athletic trainer
and assistant athletic director.</LD>
<LD>   But tennis has always come first.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, Sanchez was a popular person on campus after one of the
greatest achievements of his coaching career.</LD>
<TE>   The Lions broke Pepperdine's 14-year reign as West Coast
Conference champion Sunday by beating the Waves, 4-2, to earn the
school's first trip to the NCAA women's tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had to answer phone calls and e-mails all day," Sanchez said
from his office. "Everyone has been congratulating us. It's been
wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   It was an improbable victory. Pepperdine had defeated Loyola, 6-1,
in a dual match in Malibu five days earlier. The Waves put themselves
in position to win Sunday by taking two of three doubles matches to
claim the doubles point. To win the title, Loyola would have to win
at least four of the six singles matches.</TE>
<TE>   With the match tied, 2-2, Edit Pakay and Andrea Lord, Loyola's top
two singles players, lost their opening sets. Pakay rallied to defeat
Charlotte Vernaz, 2-6, 7-6 (4), 6-2), and Lord defeated Veronica
Koksova, 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, to clinch the match.</TE>
<TE>   "They made use of every ounce of ability they have," Sanchez said.
"That [loss] was probably the best thing for us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When UC Irvine announced it would field a women's golf team in
March 2000, Cal State Sacramento assistant coach Kelly Crawford
jumped at the chance to run the program.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford was raised in the Bay Area but was born in Newport Beach
and was intrigued at the opportunity of coaching in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   "We're extremely fortunate that Orange County has so many courses
that are of great quality," Crawford said.</TE>
<TE>   "To be able to have 10 to 12 golf courses to play on and see all
different kinds of holes and conditions really helps out our
golfers."</TE>
<TE>   The Anteaters won the Big West championship by seven strokes over
Cal State Northridge on Tuesday at Serrano Country Club outside
Sacramento. They have finished in the top five in seven of nine
tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Walailak Satarak and Stella Lee, two of five freshmen on the team,
lead the Anteaters with stroke averages of 73.92 and 75.75,
respectively. Satarak has three victories this year, including the
BYU Dixie Classic earlier this month. Lee won the Big West individual
title Tuesday for her second victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stacey Nuveman moved within one home run of the NCAA career mark
with her two-run shot Friday in No. 2 UCLA's 7-0 softball victory
over visiting Oregon State. It was Nuveman's 14th of the season and
84th of her career, right behind record-holders Leah Braatz and Laura
Espinoza of Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   The senior can tie the mark today at home against No. 9
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Seventh-ranked Cal State Fullerton (41-11, 13-2) saw its
nation-leading 32-game win streak end in a 3-2 loss Saturday at No.
18 Pacific. The Titans also lost, 1-0, in eight innings on Sunday,
dropping two of three in the series to fall out of first place, 11/2
games behind Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC won the U.S. Intercollegiate men's golf tournament at Stanford
on Sunday, defeating second-place Stanford by 10 strokes. Trojan
senior Kevin Stadler finished second overall with a three-under-par
54-hole score of 210, five shots behind Stanford's Philip Rowe.
Irvine won the Big West men's title at Serrano Country Club on
Tuesday by 13 strokes over Pacific. Irvine's Ryan Armstrong won the
individual title by defeating teammate Jeff Coburn and Pacific's Matt
Hansen in a three-way playoff.... UCLA's Jamie Dantzscher, who won
the NCAA all-around, vault and floor titles last week, is one of four
finalists for the Honda Award in gymnastics.... Fullerton junior
guard Ryan Dillon will transfer to Azusa Pacific and will be eligible
to play basketball in the 2002-03 season.</TE>

<HD>Salt Lake Winter Games Turn a Profit</HD>
<DH>Olympics: A huge surplus of $56 million will be announced
today, adding to list of U.S.-staged Games that made money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City generated a whopping
$56-million overall surplus, organizers will announce today,
testament to first-rate organizational and logistical plans and a
vivid reminder of the financial possibilities inherent in staging the
Games in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The net surplus, $40 million, will be divided two ways. Most of
the money, $30 million, will go to the nonprofit Utah Athletic
Foundation, which oversees facilities built for the Salt Lake Games.
The rest, $10 million, goes to the U.S. Olympic Committee.</LD>
<LD>   Salt Lake Organizing Committee officials also intend to spend $6
million on local park-related projects, and Mitt Romney, the outgoing
chief executive officer, recently ordered the committee not to draw
down $10 million in federal funds long ago appropriated--in effect
giving that money back to the U.S. government.</LD>
<TE>   The Salt Lake surplus underscores the unique nature of the U.S.
method of staging the Games, which relies on a partnership between
government and a privately run organizing committee.</TE>
<TE>   Three times since the 1980s--Summer Games at Los Angeles in 1984
and Atlanta in 1996, and now Salt Lake in 2002--the U.S. has played
host to the Olympics. Each time the organizing committee has finished
in the black.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. Games registered a $232.5-million surplus. Forty percent
of that money went to the Amateur Athletic Foundation, which has
since given out millions in grants to youth and community sports
activities.</TE>
<TE>   The 1996 Atlanta Olympics ended with a slight surplus, about $10
million. Atlanta's legacy, however, includes a stadium built for the
Games and then reconfigured afterward for baseball, both at
organizing committee expense.</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake surplus is all the more remarkable because only
three years ago, when Romney took over, in the midst of the worst
corruption scandal in Olympic history, SLOC faced a considerable
budget shortage. Salt Lake won the Games after wooing IOC members
with more than $1 million in cash, gifts and other inducements.</TE>
<TE>   A venture capitalist, Romney balanced the budget by cutting
millions--eliminating all items deemed nonessential--and relentlessly
wooing sponsors. Much of the surplus, $47 million, came from a
contingency fund that largely went untouched during the Games.
Another $3 million came from interest savings on bonds. SLOC recorded
$6 million more in excess revenues, largely from booming ticket and
merchandising sales.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people just wanted to be part of the Olympics," Romney
said last weekend at a USOC meeting in Boston. He is now the
Republican candidate for governor of Massachusetts and will resign
his SLOC position today.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. model stands in contrast to that of Olympic hosts
elsewhere, where local, regional or national governments often assume
the role of the organizing committee. The Sydney 2000 Summer Games,
for instance, were essentially run by the New South Wales state
government. Earlier this month, the Sydney organizing committee
announced it would finish with a $51-million loss after accounting
for a $90-million payment to the Australian Olympic Committee for a
fund supporting athletes.</TE>
<TE>   The Olympic Games will not return to the United States until at
least the summer of 2012. With four U.S. cities vying for those
Games--New York, San Francisco, Houston and Washington--USOC
President Sandra Baldwin noted, "We are the only country that
consistently has made at least a small surplus on every Games we've
held."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. chances of hosting the Games in 2012 depend on a variety of
factors--among them, whether Vancouver wins the 2010 Winter Games.
Games in Canada then would diminish U.S. chances in 2012. The
International Olympic Committee will pick the 2010 site next year,
the 2012 city in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Francois Carrard, the IOC's director general, declined to comment
Tuesday on U.S. chances. But he observed, "The fact that [the Salt
Lake] Games went extremely well is certainly a very positive note for
the future of Olympism in North America."</TE>
<TE>   The IOC was entitled to $4 million of SLOC's surplus. It donated
its share to the Utah Athletic Foundation, bringing the foundation's
total to be announced today to $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   Carrard said, "It was absolutely natural to express our
gratitude."</TE>
<TE>   The $30 million raises the foundation's endowment to $70 million.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago, SLOC had delivered $40 million from a legacy fund
built into its budget. Utah officials aim to promote Salt Lake as a
premier winter-sports training base.</TE>
<TE>   SLOC's $56-million overall surplus, on revenues of $1.274 billion,
does not take into account the considerable role taxpayers play in
staging a U.S. Games.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, security costs for the Salt Lake Games, much of it
picked up by taxpayers, totaled more than $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government provided nearly $400 million in direct funding
for the 2002 Games; the state of Utah put up another $225 million. In
all, the Games cost about $1.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Some say the Olympic accounting should also include indirect
costs, specifically an additional $1.1 billion in government funding
allocated to highway and rail projects in and around Salt Lake that
would have been done regardless of the Olympics but were accelerated
because of the Games.</TE>

<HD>Navy Sinks Last Chance of Airport at El Toro</HD>
<DH>Land use: Site will be sold for parks and development, with
details up to Irvine. The decision ends 8 years and $54 million of
planning by Orange County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burying any chance of an airport at the closed El Toro Marine base,
the Navy said Tuesday that it will sell the sprawling Orange County
property for parks and other limited development.</LD>
<LD>   Just what is built will ultimately be the decision of local
officials--specifically the city of Irvine, the Navy said. Irvine has
petitioned to annex the 4,700-acre base; 424 of those acres are
already within city limits.</LD>
<LD>   "This marks the beginning of a tremendous opportunity for the
people of Orange County and best meets the mandate of the base
closure law to return this property to productive local use,"
Secretary of the Navy Gordon England said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors reacted to the news by canceling
contracts with 15 consultants working on the proposed international
airport, except for two advocacy firms that specialize in dealing
with the Navy and federal bureaucracy. Supervisors Todd Spitzer and
Tom Wilson--both longtime El Toro airport opponents--were the only
two of the five-member board who objected to continuing those two
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement ends eight years and $54 million worth of
planning by the county for a commercial airport at El Toro, which
opened in 1943 and closed in July 1999. Local voters approved airport
zoning for the base in 1994 but rescinded that last month through
Measure W. The new zoning calls for a park, open space and limited
development.</TE>
<TE>   The decision also dashes the hopes of regional planners, who saw a
new airport at El Toro as both an economic stimulus and a way to take
the pressure off other Southern California airports.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Cynthia P. Coad, chairwoman of the Orange County
Board of Supervisors, H. T. Johnson, the Navy's assistant secretary
for installations, said the goal is to move El Toro "into private
hands so that it can be placed on the tax rolls for the benefit of
the citizens of Orange County and the city of Irvine."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who made the final decision on El Toro, will be in Orange
County on Thursday to meet with county and Irvine officials on a plan
for selling the property. In a letter to Irvine Mayor Larry Agran,
who hopes to build a large urban park at the base, Johnson said the
Navy wants to agree on a plan that includes city zoning and a
development plan by May 31.</TE>
<TE>   The property will be sold through the General Services
Administration, which sent appraisers to view the base last month.
The Navy will end its El Toro lease with the county on June 30 but
will honor several subleases, including those for a golf course,
stables, farming and recreational vehicle storage.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's statement stressed that the Federal Aviation
Administration would have no further role in the fate of the base--a
blow to elected leaders from Los Angeles and Ontario who flew to
Washington last week to ask the FAA to stop the Navy sale.</TE>
<TE>   Anticlimactic, Yes, but Airport Foes Ecstatic</TE>
<TE>   The Navy announcement was anticlimactic in Orange County, where
most local officials saw it as a confirmation of last month's public
vote. But there were no guarantees that a sizable park would be
built--the centerpiece of Irvine's rezoning campaign--or how much of
the land might end up in the hands of Irvine for public use.</TE>
<TE>   Still, south Orange County officials who have fought for years to
prevent the airport were jubilant.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the last stake in the heart of the airport," said Irvine
Councilman Chris Mears, who met last week in Washington with Johnson
and Irvine City Manager Allison Hart. "Irvine will be the master
planner of the base in concert with the Navy. Who the land is sold to
and how, those are the details to be worked out."</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy has listened to the will of the people of Orange County
and come to the right decision for El Toro," said Allan Songstad,
chairman of the nine-city El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, which
opposed the county's airport plan.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's statement didn't mention the possibility of moving the
Marine Corps' West Coast boot camp to El Toro--an idea that continued
to circulate Tuesday. In a statement, Marine Corps Commandant Gen.
James Jones said the Navy's decision "allows for a timeline that
provides the Marine Corps sufficient time to study future possible
land uses for El Toro."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors have welcomed the possibility of the
Marines' return, although it would take federal legislation to reopen
the closed base. San Diego politicians are split on the idea of
shifting the boot camp to El Toro. Reps. Randall "Duke" Cunningham
(R-Escondido) and Darrell Issa (R-Vista) say it could allow San Diego
to expand Lindbergh Field, which is adjacent to the boot camp.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy said that the city isn't encouraging
the Marines to leave the depot, but "we remain ready to evaluate
alternative land uses if the Marine Corps decides to move [the boot
camp] to El Toro."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Land Will House the Homeless</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors also will ask the Navy to allow 852
single-family houses on the base to be used for low-income housing
and transitional living for the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine's plan calls for the homes to be used by faculty, staff and
other employees of Cal State Fullerton, which wants to build a new
campus at El Toro, and UC Irvine. Some 165 of the homes already are
planned for housing for the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   What happens to the homes--part of 1,188 total housing units on
the base--is "going to be the Navy's call," Mears said. As with other
closed bases, including the Marine helicopter base at Tustin, the
houses could be sold.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge now is to create a master plan for the redevelopment
of the base that involves the coordinated transfer of property to
individual buyers, Mears said. A park still is planned, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The city intends for 88% of the land to remain in public uses,
including the university and a nearly 1,000-acre wildlife sanctuary
already established by the Navy. Another 70 acres will go to the
Department of Justice for FBI training.</TE>
<TE>   At least one airport proponent held out hope Tuesday that the
Navy's intentions would change if a proposed initiative to revive an
airport at El Toro qualifies for the Nov. 5 ballot. Retired airline
pilot and Villa Park Councilman Bob McGowan said backers hope to
restore airport zoning to the property before it is sold.</TE>

<HD>Loophole Shields Backers of Racial Privacy Measure</HD>
<DH>Finances: Campaign laws allow use of nonprofit to keep
names from being made public.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A group pushing an initiative to bar California from collecting
racial data may get the measure on the ballot as early as this
fall--but the donors who bankrolled the effort have never been
publicly revealed, and may never be.</LD>
<LD>   Under a major loophole in campaign finance laws, the political
campaign led by University of California Regent Ward Connerly--the
man who spearheaded the successful 1996 initiative to abolish
affirmative action at California schools and government--has not had
to disclose most of its financial backers.</LD>
<LD>   That is because the group has essentially laundered roughly 90% of
its $1 million in contributions through a type of nonprofit
organization that is not required to reveal the names of contributors
under federal law. The nonprofit organization received the money from
donors, then transferred it to a political action committee. Thus,
the legally required disclosures from the PAC list only the nonprofit
group as the contributor, not the individual donors.</LD>
<TE>   In similar fashion, this year's successful campaign against a
ballot measure to extend term limits and a group that ran ads
critical of Gov. Gray Davis during the energy crisis last year kept
donor names secret under the same loophole.</TE>
<TE>   All California political campaigns are supposed to disclose the
identities of donors who give more than $100 as part of the state's
Watergate-era Political Reform Act.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the spirit of that law, a number of organizations,
including the League of Women Voters and Common Cause, asked Connerly
to disclose the donor names behind his latest effort, the Racial
Privacy Initiative. But Connerly has not, and a rival campaign to
defeat the initiative is considering a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "Ward Connerly is hiding the donors, and his intent is to hide the
data," said Abdi Soltani of the Californians for Justice Education
Fund.</TE>
<TE>   The group is part of a coalition of health officials, educators,
labor unions and civil rights groups that is forming to oppose
Connerly's initiative on grounds that race-based data are needed to
combat diseases and disparities in the educational system, among
other things.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the Racial Privacy Initiative submitted nearly 1
million signatures to county elections officials around the state,
hoping to qualify the measure for the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Nguyen, the executive director of the American Civil Rights
Coalition, the nonprofit group that has funneled $897,400 to
Connerly's political action committee and is listed as the official
sponsor of the initiative, declined to discuss the disclosure issue
Friday, saying that it has been referred to an attorney. He said the
campaign will disclose in its next public report that it has spent
nearly $2 million on the signature phase of the campaign alone.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to set a precedent, either for ourselves or some
other nonprofit engaged in the political process," Nguyen said when
asked why the group has chosen not to name its donors.</TE>
<TE>   The group believes California should stop collecting data on race,
ethnicity and national origin to end what it sees as an obsession
with race that is preventing the state from moving forward on an
array of civil rights issues. It points out that a growing number of
Californians decline to identify racial backgrounds on college
applications, and argues that the state's racial complexity is too
profound to be so simply categorized.</TE>
<TE>   "The initiative is a unique and tremendous opportunity to unite
the state and insist that we are all individuals and all Americans,
not a Balkanized collection of hyphenated Americans," Nguyen said.
"With the end of racial divisions, we could do a much better job of
addressing discrimination."</TE>
<TE>   Nguyen dismissed arguments that the initiative would affect the
work of public health professionals or police. He noted that it
contains an exception for data collected for medical research or
treatment, and that it allows the Legislature to carve out other
exemptions.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative is significant, not only because it would prevent
state and local governments from collecting any race-based
information, but also because it could potentially influence the
tenor of this fall's gubernatorial contest, as 1994's Proposition 187
did. That measure to slash government services to illegal immigrants,
which passed but was later derailed by the courts, was endorsed by
Gov. Pete Wilson and became a major factor in his reelection.</TE>
<TE>   However, Connerly is asking elections officials to count all of
the roughly 980,000 signatures the group turned in instead of
conducting a sample to determine whether the group met the
requirement of 670,000 valid signatures, the more common approach. An
individual count could drag out the process beyond June 24, the
deadline to make this fall's ballot. If it does not make the November
ballot but still qualifies, the initiative would appear on the March
2004 ballot, the next statewide election.</TE>
<TE>   Connerly has rebutted speculation that he asked for a full count
because he was pressured by worried Republican Party officials to
keep the initiative out of the same election as the governor's race.
Whatever the case, it is clear that if it appears on the November
ballot, Davis and his Republican challenger, businessman Bill Simon
Jr., will both be pressured to take sides on the issue.</TE>

<HD>A Big Hole in Regional Plans</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Projected capacity was iffy even with El Toro
included. Most other airports, including John Wayne, will have to
pick up considerable slack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Navy put an end Tuesday to plans for an airport at the former El
Toro Marine base in Orange County, forcing regional airport planners
to face a cold reality: The numbers don't add up.</LD>
<LD>   Those who favor a regional solution to the growing demand for air
travel in Southern California had hoped El Toro would ease the burden
on aging Los Angeles International Airport. An El Toro airport could
have accommodated up to 30 million passengers by 2025. With that
option gone, Southern California aviation planners must redistribute
the load among the region's other major airports.</LD>
<LD>   One likely impact, officials said, will be pressure to ease
traffic restrictions at Orange County's John Wayne International
Airport.</LD>
<TE>   Redistributing the air traffic load presents a significant
problem: Most of the region's facilities have limitations--ranging
from air quality to federal restrictions to local opposition--that
hinder their growth. If aviation planners can't overcome the hurdles,
experts agree the region could lose valuable international air
service to other states.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy announced Tuesday that it will retain the option of
selling all or part of the former Marine base but leave the ultimate
decision on how the property is developed to local officials.</TE>
<TE>   That puts even more focus on last year's 25-year forecast for
regional airport growth, compiled by the Southern California Assn. of
Governments, which attempted to spread 167 million annual passengers
among 11 regional airports. Despite a drop in traffic after Sept.11,
forecasters agree growth will resume next year. But all the airports
face major challenges to expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Not the least of these is Los Angeles International Airport, which
served 50% more passengers last year than it was designed to handle.
Mayor James K. Hahn has proposed capping the airport at 78 million
passengers per year--a plan many say isn't likely to hold up because
the airlines control service at the world's third-busiest airport.</TE>
<TE>   "For airlines like United and American there's a good percentage
of their passengers that go into Los Angeles and connect to somewhere
else," said Michael Boyd, who heads the Boyd group, an aviation
consulting firm. "If you spread it out it means the airlines will
start to go elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   This is precisely what Hahn hopes to do. The mayor has proposed
redistributing passenger growth that would have gone to El Toro among
the region's other airports, such as Ontario International Airport in
San Bernardino County and Palmdale Airport in northern Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, along with officials from communities near LAX, lobbied
federal officials last week in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the El
Toro airport plan alive.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor is disappointed; he believes El Toro should be built,"
said Troy Edwards, deputy mayor. "But Ontario is ready and eager to
serve some of those passengers."</TE>
<TE>   Ontario served about 6.5 million passengers last year, but it
could not easily accept millions of additional passengers a year. For
one thing, Air Quality Management District restrictions limit the
facility to 12 million passengers a year. And even with two new
terminals, Ontario could grow to only 10 million to 12 million
without adding facilities and a new runway, officials agree.</TE>
<TE>   Ontario residents and politicians have lobbied for years to add
flights at the airport, but they cringe at the notion of absorbing 20
million to 38 million passengers a year if El Toro isn't built. Those
figures were devised by the Assn. of Governments as part of two
scenarios in its 25-year forecast that left El Toro out of the mix.</TE>
<TE>   "Can we go up to 38 million? Wow, I don't know," said Ontario
Mayor Gary Ovitt. "We're real concerned about our quality of life in
the future. We don't want to end up like El Segundo and some of those
other cities that are negatively impacted by LAX."</TE>
<TE>   Airlines Don't Like Palmdale as Plan B</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale Airport, which hasn't had commercial aviation service
since 1997, would take 2 million to 4 million passengers a year by
2025, according to the SCAG alternative that eliminates El Toro. But
airline representatives have repeatedly said they're not interested
in flying to the far-flung facility. Aviation planners said such
reluctance could be overcome if federal officials intervened.</TE>
<TE>   "The airlines don't want to go to Palmdale because they have
capital investments in existing facilities,' said Los Angeles County
Supervisor Don Knabe, who also heads the Southern California Regional
Aviation Authority. "But with strong direction from the Federal
Aviation Administration or the Transportation Security
Administration, they may want to move there."</TE>
<TE>   Other local airports said they were unsure they could take up the
slack by accepting more international flights.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that there is a demand for growth, especially in
longer-haul flights, that activity would be concentrated by the
airlines at LAX and Ontario and John Wayne," said Victor Gill, a
Burbank airport spokesman. "Burbank fits into a niche play. The
constant growth occurs in West Coast short-haul segment."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego officials said the city's Lindbergh Field is not an
alternative to El Toro, particularly since the 526-acre facility is
near capacity at 15.8 million passengers a year.</TE>
<TE>   The SCAG forecast that eliminates El Toro from the regional
aviation pot also carries daunting messages for local officials. If
the Orange County airport isn't there to absorb some regional
aviation growth, Southern California can bet on losing air service to
communities like San Francisco, Phoenix and Las Vegas, experts agree.</TE>
<TE>   The region would most likely lose international flights--thus
threatening LAX's status as the gateway to the Pacific Rim--to other
major airports in the West. Passengers on these flights would then
take commuter aircraft to Los Angeles, or connecting flights to other
cities around the country.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if LAX were capped at 78 million passengers and
Ontario took 20 million by 2025, the region would serve 19million
fewer passengers than forecast, forcing airports outside Southern
California to take up the slack, said Hasan Ikhrata, SCAG's manager
of transportation planning.</TE>
<TE>   Without El Toro, it's also likely that airports such as Long Beach
and John Wayne would have to accept more passengers. Each has local
restrictions on growth--the only airports in the country that avoided
a 1990 federal ban on such limits. Space at Long Beach Airport is
scarce because of a 1995 federal lawsuit settlement that limited the
number of commercial takeoffs at the airport to 41 per day. That was
in response to local efforts to reduce noise.</TE>
<TE>   John Wayne Restrictions May Be Threatened</TE>
<TE>   John Wayne's restrictions are contained in a 1985 agreement,
approved by a federal judge, that expires Dec. 31, 2005. This
agreement limits the airport to 8.4 million passengers annually.
Orange County supervisors have proposed increasing the limit to 9.8
million by 2015.</TE>
<TE>   But regional aviation proponents say the airport may have to be
prepared to take even more.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some conversation about John Wayne growing regardless of
caps," said Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice). "Arguably, although more
human beings are going to be living in the Inland Empire, the demand
for air travel is growing the fastest in Orange County, and all those
people can't be exported to LAX."</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's decision on Tuesday underscored a rift between
officials in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Los Angeles lawmakers
say Orange County must take its fair share of regional aviation
growth, with or without El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Although Orange County generated 20% of all regional aviation
demand in 1997--the latest year for which figures are available--it
served only 9.4% at John Wayne. In contrast, the same year Los
Angeles generated 58% of the regional demand, but served 81%.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation planners hope a bill by Assemblyman George Nakano
(D-Torrance) will help mend the inequity. The bill, which is
scheduled to be heard by the Assembly Appropriations Committee next
month, would give preference for regional transportation funds to
counties that meet their regional aviation needs. Under the bill,
SCAG would determine whether counties are meeting the requirements of
its transportation forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   "We maintain that it's high time Southern California had true,
equitable and fair distribution of the burdens related to aviation,"
said Becki Ames, Nakano's chief of staff. "This issue of putting
equity into the process lets us put some teeth into us moving forward
together toward a truly regional plan."</TE>

<LD>Despite strong reservations about the process that led to Police
Chief Bernard C. Parks being denied a second term, Los Angeles
residents generally accept the decision, according to a new Times
poll.</LD>
<LD>   And despite weeks of tension between Parks and Mayor James K.
Hahn, who sought Parks' ouster, the approval ratings of the two men
remain about the same as they were a month ago.</LD>
<LD>   Among all residents, 46% said they approved of Hahn's work, with
23% of those polled saying they did not. Parks received the positive
appraisals of 50% of those questioned; however, 31% said they did not
approve of his performance as chief.</LD>
<TE>   The poll, which was conducted April 18-22 and supervised by Los
Angeles Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus, surveyed opinions of 1,163
city residents, including 262 African Americans. It has a margin of
sampling error of 3 percentage points; for blacks, it is 6 points.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of those polled disagreed with the commission's
decision to hold Parks' job interview behind closed doors, rather
than in public, as Parks requested. And more residents, 63%, said
Hahn was wrong to voice his disapproval of Parks before the Police
Commission took the matter up.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the commission's decision to start with," said Sylmar
resident Teddy Goad, 68, who participated in the poll and agreed to a
follow-up interview. "Hahn should have stayed out of it completely."</TE>
<TE>   Woodland Hills resident Lucretia Brown, 46, said she wanted the
meetings between Parks and the commission held in the open.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that they are hiding something," she said. "It
would be nice to let the public know exactly what is going on."</TE>
<TE>   And yet, despite concerns such as those about the process, half of
the respondents said they agreed with the commission's decision; 34%
disagreed. "Really, it didn't seem like [Parks] was keeping up
officer morale," Goad said.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, people living in the San Fernando Valley were more
accepting of the commission's decision to oust Parks, with 57% of
those interviewed from that part of the city agreeing with the move,
while 24% disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   Just over a year ago, a poll taken before the March election for
mayor found that 61% of voters surveyed had a favorable impression of
Hahn, then the city attorney. Since then, his standing with the
public has suffered, according to a Times poll last month. But the
new survey suggests that it has stabilized even as Parks and his
supporters sharply criticized the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   In the last month, Hahn has "managed to stop the downward spiral,"
Pinkus said.</TE>
<TE>   A gender gap also is emerging in residents' assessments of the
mayor. According to the poll, Hahn is far more popular with men in
the city than with women. More than half the men surveyed said they
liked the job Hahn was doing, compared to 40% of the women
interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   However, Hahn's standing with blacks remains precarious, with many
feeling betrayed by his decision to oppose Parks. More than four out
of 10 blacks surveyed said they disapproved of Hahn's performance,
compared with 32% who gave him good marks. Blacks were the only
racial group to give Hahn negative marks.</TE>
<TE>   Some Blacks Criticize Hahn's Performance</TE>
<TE>   "I respected the fact that he stood by his decision," said Angela
Ammons, a 36-year-old African American woman from Van Nuys. "He can
think for himself. The only thing I questioned was that I heard that
he said during his campaign that he said he would support the chief.
Maybe he should have waited until he got all the facts."</TE>
<TE>   Ammons said she concluded that Parks did not deserve a second term
after she talked to an LAPD officer about low morale and recruitment
difficulties in the department.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't happy with [Parks'] performance," Ammons said. "How do
you run a successful police department with no policemen?"</TE>
<TE>   Carlene Gillestie, a 29-year-old African American woman from South
Los Angeles, said she supported Parks. She said Hahn misled voters
who believed he would back the chief's reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "He said during the campaign that he was with Parks," Gillestie
said. "Now all of a sudden he's changed and he's not backing him?....
I just didn't feel like they judged Parks on his job performance."</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment was widely shared among poll respondents. Half of
the people surveyed believed that the commission opposed Parks
because of politics, not because of his qualifications. And 25%
thought commission members acted because they did not think the chief
was right for the job.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Parks announced his retirement, formally ending his
quest for a second term and dropping his threats of a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   With that, the city government has turned to the question of who
should replace him. Hahn and the Police Commission will lead that
effort, and one important issue will be whether to promote a
candidate from within the LAPD or recruit one from elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about their preferences, 52% of those surveyed said they
want someone appointed from the department, while 26% preferred an
outsider.</TE>
<TE>   "People who have worked for years in the department deserve a
chance at top billing," Goad said. "I think they should chose from
someone inside the building."</TE>

<TE>How the Poll Was Conducted</TE>
<TE>The Times Poll contacted 1,163 adults in the city of Los Angeles
by telephone April 18-22. The main sample was supplemented with
an additional sample of 125 African Americans, increasing that
subgroup to 262, which was then weighted to its proportionate
share in the city. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of
all exchanges in the city of Los Angeles. Random-digit dialing
techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers could
be contacted. The entire sample was weighted slightly to conform
with census figures for sex, race, age, education and area of
city. The margin of sampling error for the city of Los Angeles
is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for African Americans it
is 6 points. For certain subgroups the error margin may be
somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by other
factors such as question wording and the order in which
questions are presented. Interviews were conducted in English
and Spanish. Asians were interviewed as part of the entire
sample, but there were not enough to break out as a separate
subgroup.</TE>

<HD>Prop. 98 Could Drive State's Budget Shortfall Even Higher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The prospect of a budget shortfall of $20 billion or more grew more
likely Tuesday with the release of new federal data that suggest the
state will owe California schools $830 million more than Gov. Gray
Davis has assumed.</LD>
<LD>   The need to increase school funding in tight fiscal times is
related to Proposition 98, the 1988 ballot measure that earmarks 35%
of the state general fund for public schools.</LD>
<LD>   New data released by the federal government showing a decline in
individual personal income levels--a factor used to calculate the
amount schools receive from the state under Proposition 98--may force
the state to increase school spending in the 2002-03 fiscal year by
$830 million more than Davis estimated.</LD>
<TE>   The governor set aside $31.4 billion in general funds for schools
in his January spending plan, which he is in the process of revising
amid a backdrop of diminishing state revenues. As of Tuesday,
personal income and corporate tax receipts for April were down $3
billion from the nearly $8 billion collected through the same date
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Dwindling tax receipts combined with an increase in refund claims
and rising expenses apparently will result in a budget shortfall of
$20billion or more, up from the $17.5-billion shortfall previously
forecast. So far, state officials have compensated for about $4.3
billion of that amount through spending cuts, budget changes and by
refinancing debt.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate school-related matter, the California teacher's
union is amending a closely watched bill that would give teachers
bargaining rights for decisions over textbooks and other curriculum
issues. School administrators on Tuesday reiterated their opposition
to the bill.</TE>
<TE>   School administrators and teachers, concerned about Proposition
98's ramifications, also called on Davis and lawmakers to consider
opposing approaches toward education spending. Both groups welcome
the notion of more education funding, but school administrators say
they are open to a one-year suspension of Proposition 98 to help the
state deal with its growing budget gap.</TE>
<TE>   A suspension, which would enable state officials to temporarily
reduce the amount the state must pay schools, is preferable to
accounting changes that might leave schools with less money in the
future, the administrators say.</TE>
<TE>   "The state is in a position that requires us to be sensitive to
what is now the biggest budget deficit in state history," said Kevin
Gordon, executive director of the California Assn. of School Business
Officials. "Our goal is to figure out a way to honor Proposition 98
without being a piggy about it."</TE>
<TE>   But Wayne Johnson, president of the California Teachers Assn.,
said his group will fight efforts to suspend Proposition 98.</TE>
<TE>   "For school administrators not to stand up and defend the
institution they supposedly administer is baffling," Johnson said.
"Particularly when schools are underfunded to begin with."</TE>
<TE>   Davis warned last week that he may not be able to meet the funding
level for schools required by Proposition 98.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Turnage of the state's nonpartisan legislative analyst's
office advised lawmakers Tuesday that they could address growing
Proposition 98 requirements levels by suspending the funding formula,
cutting current-year school spending or tapping an account that holds
unspent Proposition 98 funds to the tune of $535 million.</TE>
<TE>   The state could also count certain child-care expenses as part of
the schools' funding to free up another $770 million--an option
opposed by school administrators. An $836-million federal funding
boost for California schools could also help soften the blow to
California coffers if state officials are able to meet federal rules.</TE>
<TE>   The two groups also squared off Tuesday over amendments to the
collective bargaining bill being sought by the teacher's association.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is set for a hearing this evening in the Assembly
Education Committee. Davis came out against the bill, AB 2160,
sponsored by Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles), saying he
favors local school districts considering teacher input outside of
the collective bargaining process.</TE>
<TE>   In an apparent nod to Davis, the California Teachers Assn. floated
amendments Tuesday that would establish "academic partnerships"
consisting of parents, teachers and school board members.</TE>
<TE>   Partnership members would have three months to agree on
items--ranging from textbook selection to other curriculum
issues--covered in AB 2160. If they failed, the items would be kicked
over to the collective bargaining process.</TE>
<TE>   "This would set up a process to try and deal with these issues
without collective bargaining," Johnson said. "But if you can't do
it, there has to be some teeth to make it happen."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon, of the school administrators group, said the proposal
lacked credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "All the union has to do is stall an issue for three months and
then it gets to be bargained, which is exactly what they wanted to
begin with," Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson brushed aside that suggestion, noting the negotiations
would be done in public.</TE>
<TE>   "If teachers were being arbitrary and capricious, to drag it into
collective bargaining, I think that would backfire," he said.</TE>

<HD>Glendale Won't Lower Flags for Armenian Event</HD>
<DH>Observance: City seeks to avoid flap of last year when
colors were put at half-staff to mark Day of Remembrance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KRISTINA SAUERWEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Breaking tradition and ending months of controversy, no American
flags will be lowered on Glendale's city buildings during today's
worldwide observance of the Armenian genocide.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the foothill community--home to the highest proportion of
residents of Armenian descent of any city outside of Armenia--will
host an evening of educational lectures and a video, songs and an art
exhibit to commemorate the most solemn day in the Armenian community.</LD>
<LD>   Roughly one-third of Glendale's 190,000 residents are of Armenian
descent.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to educate the community and pay our respects," said
Glendale Mayor Rafi Manoukian, whose grandparents survived the
genocide.</TE>
<TE>   City officials did not want to repeat the flap that ensued last
year when then-Mayor Gus Gomez, like his predecessors, ordered the
American flag flown at half-staff at city buildings on the Armenian
Day of Remembrance.</TE>
<TE>   The gesture led to an unsuccessful attempt to recall the mayor and
sparked underlying ethnic tensions in Los Angeles County's
third-largest city.</TE>
<TE>   City's Commemoration Approach Is Praised</TE>
<TE>   "The city's heart was in the right place, but lowering the flag
diverted attention from the genocide," said Levon Marashlian, a
history instructor at Glendale Community College. "It gave some
people an excuse to bash Armenians."</TE>
<TE>   Marashlian, who will participate in tonight's event with a talk on
Americans who supported Armenians during the genocide, praised the
idea of a commemoration.</TE>
<TE>   "It has more substance and depth," he said. "People can learn from
it."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the city formed a committee of 26 residents to
plan a less divisive way to honor the 1.5 million Armenians who died
when Turkish soldiers rounded up and massacred artists, leaders and
intellectuals to "cleanse" the country of non-Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   The Turkish government has denied the 1915 event ever occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those who objected to lowering the American flag last
April said they believe the genocide occurred but questioned the
propriety of the gesture.</TE>
<TE>   "It was inappropriate," said Joe Mandoky, a longtime Glendale
resident who spearheaded the recall effort.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about flag respect," Mandoky said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't do a special favor for one group without taking away
from another group," said Mandoky, a real estate agent who is known
for lugging a giant cross around town as part of his Christian
ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Mandoky, however, supports the city's efforts this year to honor
genocide victims and survivors. "It's inclusive of all groups," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's program at the Glendale Civic Auditorium, scheduled from
5:30 to 9 p.m., is one in a series of weeklong activities that
reflect on the Armenian genocide and other crimes against humanity,
including the Holocaust and atrocities in Rwanda and against Native
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale's "Week of Remembrance" will conclude at 6 p.m. Friday
with a poetry reading, music, dance and a candlelight vigil at City
Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Commemorations also will be held in other parts of Los Angeles
County, home to an estimated 350,000 Armenian Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds are expected to march at 11 a.m. today through Little
Armenia in Hollywood, between Sunset and Hobart boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   California's first lady, Sharon Davis, will attend a 12:30 p.m.
gathering today at the Armenian Genocide Martyr's Monument at
Bicknell Park in Montebello. And between 4 and 6:30 p.m.today, a
demonstration is scheduled at the Turkish Consulate at 4801 Wilshire
Blvd.</TE>

<DH>Advocacy: City attorney's assistance program provides the
support for crime survivors to put their lives back together.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was the darkest hour of Connie Gonzalez's life--March 12, 2001,
the day she was raped.</LD>
<LD>   In the agonizing days and nights after the attack, she wondered if
life would ever be worth living again.</LD>
<LD>   But due largely to the efforts of Esther Niell of the Los Angeles
city attorney's Victims Assistance Program, Gonzalez has rebounded.</LD>
<TE>   "Thank God for Esther," said Gonzales, 34. "If it wasn't for
Esther's support and caring, I don't think I would have made it this
far."</TE>
<TE>   Niell did more than assist Gonzalez emotionally. She helped her
get $1,700 worth of medical care and relocation money.</TE>
<TE>   "She even got me Christmas gifts," Gonzalez said. "I love that
lady."</TE>
<TE>   Niell specializes in calming nerves and guiding survivors through
the days after the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times when the victims are in a highly emotional
state," said Niell, 32, a victims' advocate who works out of the Los
Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood Division.</TE>
<TE>   This week, as America recognizes Victims' Rights Week, Niell will
do what she does all year: visit crime scenes to offer counsel, help
find financial assistance or simply provide a gentle touch.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the city attorney's program helped more than 7,500
victims with financial assistance, supervisor Marlene Ramos said.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, advocates helped them apply for funds under the
state Victim Compensation Plan, which provides up to $70,000 per
person to make up for lost wages as well as pay for medical care,
funeral expenses and psychotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   The program helps those who were "innocent victims of a violent
crime, 100% cooperative with the police, and file their claim within
one year, or three years if they have good cause," Ramos said.</TE>
<TE>   The crimes covered are homicide, robbery, assault, kidnapping,
hit-and-run and rape.</TE>
<TE>   One of Niell's most challenging cases was the double homicide of
the popular owners of Sabatino's Italian Restaurant and Bakery in
North Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Sabato and Eugenie Russo, both 73, were stabbed to death Nov. 22,
2000, in their home.</TE>
<TE>   "The family was devastated," Niell said. "They got support from
the whole community. But some of the people wanted to take justice
into their own hands."</TE>
<TE>   Tensions reached their peak in a packed courtroom during the
arraignment of Israel Cebrera Pulido, 22, who has since confessed.
The case is ongoing.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really, really tense when the family members and friends
got to see the person who killed their loved ones," Niell said.
"Emotions were running very high. Some of the people wanted to kill
him right there on the spot."</TE>
<TE>   Niell simply held hands with the family, calming them as much as
she could. She called in two co-workers to help with the family.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Mike Coffey, the lead homicide investigator at the North
Hollywood station, deals with Niell about three times a week.</TE>
<TE>   "She's very dedicated, very considerate and very compassionate to
her victims," Coffey said. "She really believes in what she's doing."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to paving the way to the state compensation program,
the city attorney's office offers emergency cash for lodging, food
and other essentials.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office has a similar program, Niell said.</TE>
<TE>   "We do everything we can do to help them get their lives back
together," the victims' advocate said.</TE>
<TE>   "For many, it is their first encounter with the police. We try to
explain step by step what's going on.</TE>
<TE>   "I love my job," said Niell, who sees up to 90 crime victims a
month. "It's emotionally draining and stressful, but I can't imagine
doing anything else. If I can help one person, it makes it all worth
it."'</TE>

<HD>Police Probe Links in Long Beach Attacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long Beach police are investigating whether the rapes of two women
early Sunday were committed by the attacker in six other sexual
assaults between 1997 and 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The six rapes that occurred in east Long Beach from 1997 to 1999
have been linked through physical evidence, police said. The most
recent rapes bear similarities to the older ones: The attacker enters
the home through an unlocked door or window, the rapes occur late at
night and the victims are older women, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives also are investigating whether an April 6 rape of a
54-year-old woman near Seventh Street and Studebaker Road was
connected to the 1997-99 rapes, said police Sgt. Steve Filipini.</LD>
<TE>   In those cases, the suspect was described by the victims to police
as a slender white man, between 5 feet 9 and 5 feet 11 and 25 to 35
years of age.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent rapes occurred between 3:30 and 4:30 a.m., both
near Stearns Avenue and Bellflower Boulevard, Officer David Marander
said. In the first attack Sunday, a man entered the home of a
sleeping 74-year-old woman through an unlocked window and raped her,
Marander said. The woman struggled with the suspect, whose face was
covered, and he fled.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later, a man entered the home of a 58-year-old woman
through an unlocked door and sexually assaulted the woman, Marander
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although police have not positively linked all the attacks, there
are enough similarities among the assaults to investigate links,
Marander said. Anyone with information can call the Long Beach Police
Department at (562) 570-7372.</TE>

<LD>A suspected child molester on the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted" list was
arrested at a Westlake motel early Tuesday evening, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Scott Bliss, 37, is suspected of repeatedly molesting a
9-year-old girl in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, said FBI
spokeswoman Cheryl Mimura.</LD>
<LD>   A team of FBI agents, Los Angeles police, sheriff's deputies,
state agents and parole officers tracked Bliss to the Nutel Motel,
Mimura said. Law enforcement officials were led to Bliss by a caller
who saw his profile Feb. 9 on the "America's Most Wanted" TV show,
she said.</LD>
<TE>   Last June, Bliss was charged in federal court on suspicion of
interstate travel to engage in sex with a child and coercing or
enticing someone to travel interstate so he could molest a child, as
well as aggravated sexual abuse of a child, Mimura said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Members of the Los Angeles City Council approved a plan Tuesday to
establish both Cesar Chavez and Columbus Day as holidays for city
employees.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, which must be approved by the mayor, removes the
half-day holiday city employees get on Dec. 24.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, the council set off a heated debate when it allowed
2,000 city employees to take off Cesar Chavez's birthday instead of
Columbus Day. The plan drew criticism from many Italian Americans.
Since then, city leaders have been seeking a compromise.</LD>

<HD>Hahn Proposes Hiring At-Risk Teens for City Jobs</HD>
<DH>Youth: The mayor also urges moving more police officers to
street patrol duty. The two plans are part of an effort to combat
growing gang violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn announced plans Tuesday to hire
at-risk young people for city jobs and to push budget proposals that
would put more police officers on the streets--both as part of an
effort to combat rising gang violence.</LD>
<LD>   So far this year, more than 184 shootings have been linked to
gangs--a 67% increase over the same period last year, Hahn said.</LD>
<LD>   "It's more than a number. It's real people," the mayor said.</LD>
<TE>   In response, Hahn said, 200 city jobs are being made available to
at-risk youth for six-month training periods, with the intention of
hiring many of them permanently.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also asked the City Council to approve $2 million for the
city's Summer Youth Employment program, which offers teenagers jobs
in city offices and parks.</TE>
<TE>   The moves came just days after the mayor submitted his budget for
the fiscal year, a plan that recommends holding fast to current
spending levels in many departments but trims in some areas.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, at least one council member greeted Hahn's latest
proposals skeptically, saying that he questions whether there is
enough money to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   Under the mayor's proposal, "at-risk youth" includes 18- to
21-year-olds who receive public benefits, are teenage mothers or come
from low-income households.</TE>
<TE>   Those young people would be eligible to apply for jobs under the
new hiring program, Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor also hopes to transfer about 100 police officers now
working desk jobs to patrol cars.</TE>
<TE>   That plan is part of the proposed budget, which is being reviewed
by the City Council and requires its approval.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also asked the Police Commission to approve drop-in centers
in city parks for police officers to regularly visit.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Nate Holden said he supports the mayor's proposals, but
worries that there may not be enough money to sustain them.</TE>
<TE>   "On paper, [the proposal to open 200 jobs to at-risk youth] sounds
very good. My question is, how many jobs are available when these
kids are done with the six months?" Holden said.</TE>
<TE>   "In a budget shortfall, we may be laying off city employees, not
hiring them," Holden said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn made Tuesday's announcement at Gates Elementary School in
Lincoln Heights, where a number of shootings have occurred in recent
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Every two months, Gates students practice drills on how to take
cover during a shooting.</TE>

<HD>Seismic Plan for Pasadena City Hall OKd by Council</HD>
<DH>Safety: Funding for the $89-million effort could rely
heavily on the city's water and power agency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pasadena, a city where historic preservation is much like a civic
obsession, will undertake an $89-million seismic strengthening and
renovation of its Beaux Arts City Hall, which experts say would be
destroyed in a major earthquake.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous City Council decision about 1 a.m. Tuesday
culminated more than 10 years of analysis and debate over how to best
preserve the crown jewel of downtown Pasadena, a landmark building
with an enormous dome.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a major step," said Mayor Bill Bogaard of the council's
go-ahead to begin planning and environmental reviews.</LD>
<TE>   "It's as big a project for Pasadena as the renovation of L.A. City
Hall, Oakland or San Francisco--not in dollars, but in complexity of
construction," said City Manager Cynthia Kurtz.</TE>
<TE>   Council members left unsettled how the city will pay for the
overhaul, the costliest public works project in Pasadena in decades.
Council members called for additional financial studies.</TE>
<TE>   Tentative plans call for about $67 million to come from bonds that
would be paid back over 25 years, with annual payments of about $5.6
million. About $3 million a year would be taken from the coffers of
the city's Department of Water and Power. The rest would come from
other general fund sources.</TE>
<TE>   Under today's projections, utility rates will not be increased to
pay for City Hall, Kurtz said.</TE>
<TE>   Under a worst-case scenario, she said, if the city's utility could
not absorb the bond debts and there was no other means to pay them,
the average residential utility bill could be increased as much as
$24 a year.</TE>
<TE>   To reduce the overall cost, the city already has secured a
$7-million federal grant and saved $5.5 million for the project,
which will require moving about 350 City Hall employees out for the
three-year construction period.</TE>
<TE>   Councilmen Chris Holden and Paul Little were not sure they wanted
to burden the utility with paying for about half the City Hall debt.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking about a 25-year obligation," said Little. "We need
to ensure we do not jeopardize the future of the Pasadena my kids
will live in."</TE>
<TE>   But the future of Pasadena's civic center is largely tied to the
vibrancy of its historic downtown buildings--envisioned in 1921 as
the "Athens of the West"--with City Hall, the library and the civic
auditorium all linked by grand boulevards.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the city's new Paseo Colorado opened with a retail and
entertainment complex and apartments built on top.</TE>
<TE>   The $200-million project was intended to invigorate the lackluster
civic center area less than a mile east of the popular Old Pasadena
district.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the debate over the years has focused on finding a way to
strengthen the building and preserve the architecture, which is Beaux
Arts Classicism with Spanish Mission elements.</TE>
<TE>   City Hall is a complicated structure with a seismically weak dome
and arcade area as its centerpiece, connected to three office wings.</TE>
<TE>   A seismic study five years ago found that the building's
three-story wings would collapse into the spacious interior courtyard
in a major quake.</TE>
<TE>   The study said the columns supporting the arched corridors also
could fail and the dome could crash down in a magnitude-7 quake on a
local fault or a magnitude-8 temblor on the San Andreas fault.</TE>
<TE>   Kurtz told council members that if they did not approve the
seismic strengthening, she would be forced to move City Hall
employees to another site for their safety.</TE>
<TE>   The council approved a strengthening program that entails
installing shock absorbers called base isolators--steel plates
layered with a rubber compound--under the building's 272 support
columns.</TE>

<HD>Supervisors Deny Permit for Santa Clarita Mine</HD>
<DH>County: L.A. board contends the gravel operation would harm
the environment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fate of plans for a massive gravel mine outside Santa Clarita is
now in the courts' hands, as Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday
declined to grant a permit for the 460-acre project.</LD>
<LD>   The supervisors, who had signaled their intent in February to
reject the mine, contend the project will harm aesthetics, air
quality and other aspects of the environment, according to findings
released last week in support of their decision. The county also has
been sparring with Transit Mixed Concrete, the company chosen to
extract the federally owned gravel, over the effect of truck traffic
on local roads.</LD>
<LD>   The concrete company has filed a federal lawsuit against the
county, contending supervisors illegally delayed the project, which
has received federal approval. A trial date has not been set in the
lawsuit to be heard by U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian.</LD>
<TE>   Federal law "says the county can impose reasonable environmental
measures," said Brian Mastin, a spokesman for parent company Cemex.
"Is that what they've been doing, or have they just been blocking the
federally approved project? That's what the trial will determine."</TE>

<HD>No Bones About It: This Fictional News Character Was Worth
Resurrecting</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Novelist Michael Connelly is a former L.A.Times reporter, and his new
mystery, "City of Bones," contains an inside joke that would have
amused the late Jack Smith and other L.A. newspaper types of the
1950s.</LD>
<LD>   One of the minor characters in Connelly's book is a sneaky
journalist named Victor Frizbe. Connelly is paying homage to the
memory of Victor Frisbie, a fictional person created by bored
staffers on the old L.A. Examiner in those free-wheeling days.</LD>
<LD>   Frisbie appeared in Rose Parade stories and other "crowd" articles
in which spectators would be quoted. He was identified variously as a
former Australian general ("good show," he said of one parade), as a
retired admiral and once as a drunken tourist who was thrown in jail
on New Year's Eve and thus missed the parade.</LD>
<TE>   When top-level editors learned of Frisbie's nonexistence, he
disappeared from the paper. Disappeared, that is, until the day in
1962 that the Examiner announced it was merging with the L.A. Herald
Express. Staffers then sneaked in a one-paragraph story on the death
of the Bakersfield sportsman (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   It's good to see Frisbie/Frizbe resurrected, as mischievous and as
fictional as ever.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marquee madness (cont.): After a slight intermission, more letters
have arrived about unusual movie combinations, including one from
Bill Burns of Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1930s, he recalled, the old Hollyway Theater at Sunset
Boulevard and Echo Park Avenue featured: BOTTOMS UP AS THE EARTH
TURNS.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Market research, the old-fashioned way: Burns added that he was a
newsboy back then, selling the old Herald-Express in pre-Victor
Frisbie days.</TE>
<TE>   "The owner of the Hollyway used to pay my way to go to the rival
Ramona theater, near Sunset and Alvarado, to count heads," Burns
said. "I would sit on one side of the theater, do the counting, then
move to the other side and finish."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weighing whether to have a drink: Moving along to alcohol, a
natural transition from an item about newspaper folk, Patricia Dunn
of Downey was intrigued by one seller's pricing system (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dig this: I mentioned that Pat Wright, the Libertarian nominee for
lieutenant governor, is running on a platform to legalize ferrets in
this state (if you don't believe me, and I don't blame you, check out
www.ferretsanon.com).</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, a reader who signs himself "Bill of Carpenteria" sent me
an ad for Ferrets magazine and commented facetiously that the
articles it listed "make you want to run right out and get one of
these little guys." Cover stories were headlined: "Stop Devilish
Digging," "6 Great Methods for Saving Your Carpet," and "50+
Emergency First Aid Tips."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: The recent appearance here of a not-so-ancient
pictograph of kayak carriers in Monterey prompted Jens Peermann to
send along a snapshot of a figure on a rock that he calls "Homo Surfa
Dudeum" (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Peermann added: "Although it would be right at home in Southern
California, this one can be found north of Cave Rock on the Nevada
side of surfless Lake Tahoe." The surfer does seem a bit lost.</TE>

<LD>Drag up a chair, and I'll tell you a story, all about how the mayor
of Los Angeles, who was born in a modest home and rose to high
office, instead inadvertently managed to end up killing the big fat
golden goose of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   So far it's a fairy tale not yet come true. It could also be a
sci-fi story, if you believe that the San Fernando Valley gnawing off
its own leg to escape from L.A.'s civic trap is the scariest thing
that could happen around here.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Feb. 5, Jim Hahn pulls the plug on a second term for
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, and the hollering begins.</LD>
<TE>   He betrayed us, black leaders declare. And after all we did for
him. Two ministers whose churches got $25,000 in economic development
grants from Hahn two weeks earlier summon the press and rip up big
mockups of the checks. "Pieces of silver," they declare. "Not for
sale."</TE>
<TE>   The recall-Hahn rumblings begin, and with wide and diverse support
for Parks, the noise reaches across black Los Angeles to some
Latinos, to some Asians--and to the Valley, where the secessionistas
don't care much about Parks one way or the other, but have their own
gripes about Hahn, and are glad to have some reinforcements for
recall.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Police Commission, with its only black member dissenting,
votes to give Parks the hook, and out in front of Parker Center,
there appear the forces of African American indignation: Danny
Bakewell of the Brotherhood Crusade, Maxine Waters, the congresswoman
who just a year ago was hugging Hahn like a proud mom.</TE>
<TE>   There's even talk of taking pickets to the Grove, that vast
mercantile tumor looming over Farmers Market. Its builder is Rick
Caruso, head of the Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   All of this evidently backfires, or fizzles, insofar as it makes
it seem like Parks' deepest support is about race, not merit. This is
ironic because Parks spent his career proving that he is all LAPD
blue. Now he's in the position of O.J. Simpson in that, despite
O.J.'s success in the great white world, in adversity (in his case,
in the face of vast evidence of guilt) Simpson had support only from
the core of working-class African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   What is the heartbeat of this impassioned Parker Center turnout?
Fear. Losing a police chief feels like power slipping away. Gone are
the days of a black mayor and a council that had three solidly black
votes and two more likely ones from districts with many black votes.
That old comfy black-Westside coalition has died of old age.</TE>
<TE>   In 20 years, L.A.'s black population has plummeted by maybe a
dozen percent--black flight to Pomona, Riverside, Santa Clarita, to
better schools, safer neighborhoods. Some blacks left behind imagine
a zero-sum world, black vs. Latino, if they win, we lose what few
goodies there are, health clinics or public housing or the big chairs
at every political table.</TE>
<TE>   Raphael Sonenshein, the political scientist who tracks L.A.'s
ethnic politics, thinks that's perception, not reality.</TE>
<TE>   "The Parks thing is so high-profile, it's being fought as if it's
a last stand, a statement about whether blacks have clout in the
community anymore," when in truth, black leadership in government and
politics is "surprisingly strong."</TE>
<TE>   But Kerman Maddox, the black political consultant who's more
plugged in than an outlet in a college dorm room, thinks blacks have
lost ground in L.A. and in state offices. Younger blacks' support of
Antonio Villaraigosa's mayoral candidacy was a 21st century
cross-ethnic strategy to meet new realities; Hahn's aggrieved black
supporters, he thinks, are latching on to just about anyone who will
give them a seat at the table, even if there's not much on the table.</TE>
<TE>   So where were we? Right--the recall movement runs out of ammo.
There's a bigger-caliber weapon at hand: secession. That'll teach
Hahn a lesson. Politically canny African Americans find common cause
with their old foil, the Valley, the same far-off people who watched
the riot smoke of 1965 and 1992 like it was happening in Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   "This process"--this Parks dust-up--"has definitely helped us
tremendously." Thus says Richard Close, a secessionista and a
commissioner in redrawing L.A.'s City Council districts. In a
Valley-less L.A., all sorts of interest groups "will be able to elect
their community representatives to the new Los Angeles City Council."</TE>
<TE>   And Mayor Magic Johnson, aided by Councilman Bernie Parks, could
preside over the nation's third-largest city--or its fourth-largest
city, lagging behind the appalling Houston, if the harbor and
Hollywood decide to take a hike too.</TE>
<TE>   And this is how true-blue Angelenos end up splitting their beloved
city like a wishbone. Remember that when you break a wishbone, the
only wish to come true is the one made by the guy who winds up with
the bigger piece.</TE>

<HD>Man Gets 51-to-Life for Rape, Kidnap</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 27-year-old ex-Marine was sentenced to 51 years to life in prison
Tuesday for kidnapping a married couple in Sherman Oaks in 1999 and
sexually assaulting the pregnant wife.</LD>
<LD>   A Van Nuys jury in January had convicted Brian Lyn Richie of San
Gabriel of kidnapping, robbery and sexual assault.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Debre Katz Weintraub
ordered Richie to serve a life term for kidnapping, 15 years to life
for sexual assault during a kidnapping, plus 36 years for the other
sexual assaults and robbery.</LD>
<TE>   "It's essentially a death sentence," said his attorney, William J.
Hardy, who had asked the judge to show compassion.</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Dist. Atty. Eduards R. Abele said Richie's crimes
involve "one of the most brutal sexual assaults I have ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   The crimes, he said, "demonstrated a high degree of cruelty,
viciousness and callousness."</TE>
<TE>   Although the victims were not present in court Tuesday, Abele told
the judge that "their preference would be that he never gets out" of
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Abele said Richie and an accomplice, Joseph Navar Downey,
kidnapped the Covina couple at gunpoint as they sat in their pickup
truck in an alley behind a private banquet hall in the 13900 block of
Ventura Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The men stole the couple's money and jewelry, valued at nearly
$2,000, then took turns sexually assaulting the woman, who was three
months' pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   The rapes occurred repeatedly over two hours as the men drove
their victims to various sites in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Downey, 25, was sentenced to two consecutive life terms in May
2000 for the crimes and a similar attack, also in Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "A community that lived in fear at the hands of these dangerous
criminals over three years ago can now take comfort in the fact that
they have been brought to justice," the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   Both victims identified Richie as their attacker, and DNA evidence
linked him to the assaults. His ex-wife and another woman testified
that he also had raped them. Court records also showed that he was
convicted of rape in 1996 while in the Marine Corps.</TE>
<TE>   Richie's mother and brother testified that he was at home asleep
when the crimes occurred.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Priest Named in Abuse Suit</HD>
<DH>Courts: Filing against the Costa Mesa cleric was made in
Northern California. Allegations from 21 years ago are supported by a
policeman's account.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lawsuit filed in a Northern California court Tuesday accuses a
Costa Mesa priest of molesting an adolescent boy 21 years ago and
uses an eyewitness police account of one incident to corroborate the
allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Father Jerome Henson, pastor of St. John the Baptist Church in
Costa Mesa, has been on paid administrative leave since November,
shortly after the allegations of sexual abuse surfaced in a letter
from the accuser's attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Moorhead, the priest's lawyer, said that he hasn't seen the
suit, filed in Solano County Superior Court, but that Henson denies
any inappropriate conduct. Henson is a Dominican priest who served in
the early 1980s at St. Dominic Church in Benicia, Calif.</LD>
<TE>   The Diocese of Orange, which says it wasn't informed of any
incidents in Henson's past when he was hired in 1983, wasn't named in
the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Henson and his Dominican order were among the "John Does" listed
as defendants in the complaint, attorney Laurence E. Drivon said. In
civil lawsuits, state law mandates that clergy and religious
institutions be labeled "John Does" until evidence is provided to the
court.</TE>
<TE>   John Jacobs, in a recent phone interview from California State
Prison, Solano, said he brought the suit seeking unspecified damages
because "I needed to deal with my past and stop feeling like a victim
all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs, 34, is serving a 14-year sentence for burglary. He served
previous sentences for burglary and vehicular manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   All the crimes, Jacobs said, were the result of his drug
addiction.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs said he was a straight-A student, Boy Scout and goalie on
his youth soccer team before the alleged sexual abuse began when he
was 12. He said Henson molested him on a camping trip to Lake Tahoe,
inside the church and in the parish cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   'Now I Know What Drove Me'</TE>
<TE>   His relationship with Henson "destroyed my life," Jacobs said.
"I'm not trying to use what happened to me as an excuse. But at least
now, I know what drove me."</TE>
<TE>   The case has been bolstered by a 1981 police report written by a
Benicia officer who drove past the city's cemetery and saw Jacobs,
then 13, in a compromising position with the priest.</TE>
<TE>   In his report, the Benicia sergeant said the priest had committed
"lewd acts with a 13-year-old juvenile."</TE>
<TE>   He also called the boy an "apparent willing participant," a
statement that Jacobs says sickens him.</TE>
<TE>   "He witnessed what had happened, and he just drove away," Jacobs
said.</TE>
<TE>   The sergeant, who recognized Jacobs as a soccer player he coached
and knew Henson as a priest in his parish, later wrote up the report.
The sergeant, now retired, couldn't be reached to explain why he
didn't stop at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   In a follow-up interview at his home five days after the incident,
the boy denied that anything improper had happened.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs said he was afraid and ashamed at what had happened and,
after a few moments with the detective, ran to his bedroom in tears.</TE>
<TE>   The police report also says that an unnamed cleric, who was
Henson's superior at the parish, said that he suspected Henson had
gotten too involved with young boys and that he would get the priest
"transferred out of the community as soon as possible and also have
his assignments changed so that [Henson] will be working with adults
and not with so many boys."</TE>
<TE>   Henson immediately was moved to a Reno parish.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Western Province of Dominicans, Henson's order,
could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs said both the Catholic parish and his hometown police
department did nothing to protect a 13-year-old boy from sexual
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not trying to sound paranoid" but there was a cover-up, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Announcements about the accusations placed this year in church
bulletins at Henson's last three parishes in Orange County have
resulted in no additional allegations, church officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Henson is the fourth Orange County priest to be swept up in the
nationwide sex scandal involving Roman Catholic clerics.</TE>
<TE>   The Archdiocese of Los Angeles has dismissed 11 priests and
identified other suspected abusers who are no longer in the
priesthood or are dead.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Commission on Tuesday put off a decision on
the selection of an interim LAPD chief to replace retiring Bernard C.
Parks until next week, and also began closed session deliberations on
procedures for finding Parks' permanent replacement.</LD>
<LD>   The commission has authorized the city's personnel department to
seek a headhunting firm to aid in the search for a new chief.</LD>
<LD>   Commissioners are also considering appointing a blue-ribbon
citizens panel to develop criteria for selection of a new chief. The
process might take six months, said commission President Rick Caruso.</LD>
<TE>   The commission will resume consideration next Tuesday of about
eight unnamed candidates for the job of interim chief, including
several current deputy chiefs and commanders, and retired LAPD
officials.</TE>
<TE>   While Parks, who said he will retire next week, is vacationing,
Deputy Chief Michael Bostic is in command. Bostic said Tuesday he
will not apply for the permanent job because it would take too much
time from his family.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A homeless man who told police during a traffic stop that he killed
his wife was sentenced Tuesday to 15 years to life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   A San Fernando jury convicted John Kosmider, 44, of second-degree
murder earlier this month. Kosmider beat Patricia Bowers, 45, to
death on June 29, 2001, in their shack where they lived in the
Tujunga Wash, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Taklender said. After the
killing, he fled to Arizona, where authorities pulled him over for a
broken windshield.</LD>
<LD>   "The first thing out of his mouth was, 'I'm drunk, and you know
what, I killed my wife,'" Taklender said. L.A. County Superior Court
Judge Warren G. Greene imposed the sentence.</LD>

<HD>Priest Is Arrested; Molesting Alleged</HD>
<DH>Church: Two sisters claim elderly Fontana cleric abused
them for four years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BUCK WARGO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A priest at St. Joseph Catholic Church in Pomona was arrested Tuesday
on suspicion of molesting two young sisters when they visited his
Fontana apartment over a four-year period.</LD>
<LD>   Father Honesto Bayranta Bismonte, 72, was arrested at the home he
shares with the girls' aunt in Fontana, said Fontana Police Sgt.
Robert Beltran. Bismonte was being held late Tuesday at the West
Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga. Bail was set at $200,000
and no arraignment date has been scheduled.</LD>
<LD>   The sisters were about 8 and 12 at the time they allege the abuse
began, Beltran said. During an interview with detectives Monday, the
two accused Bismonte of fondling them some 50 times between 1997 and
2001, the sergeant said.</LD>
<TE>   The abuse is alleged to have occurred when the girls visited their
aunt at another apartment she shared with Bismonte in Fontana,
Beltran said.</TE>
<TE>   Bismonte's attorney, Don Steier of Los Angeles, said he was hired
Monday and hadn't had a chance to talk to his client in detail about
the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   Steier said he believes the girls' family went to Bismonte with
the allegations last week and told him that authorities were
investigating. Bismonte in turn reported the allegations and
investigation to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, Steier said.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokesman Tod Tamberg confirmed that church leaders
learned of the allegations last week and placed Bismonte on leave
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran said police learned of the allegations Monday from a
school official, whom he declined to identify. Bismonte declined to
talk to investigators, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Father Hisham Dabaen, a priest at St. Joseph's, said of the
allegations, "I really don't believe it, because he's an old man."</TE>
<TE>   Bismonte was arrested as U.S. Roman Catholic cardinals were
meeting with the pope in Rome to discuss the widening sex abuse
scandal in the church.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney said the current climate fosters such claims.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not surprised that the allegations are being made at this
point, with all the publicity generated about the clergy and sexual
misconduct," Steier said. "Each case will be examined on its own
merits ... Some of the claims will be valid and some will not be,
like the one made against the cardinal [Roger M. Mahony] a week ago."</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokesman Tamberg said, "Of course, we are very
concerned when allegations like this are made. I think our policy is
very clear, and it shows our concern whenever allegations are made
against a priest for this type of conduct.</TE>
<TE>   "The priest is removed. We don't have all the details yet, but we
are very interested to hear the results."</TE>
<TE>   Inland Valley correspondents Danielle Samaniego and Gene Maddaus
contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Shields Land for Endangered Rodent</HD>
<DH>Environment: Agency designates 33,295 acres in San
Bernardino and Riverside counties as critical habitat for the
kangaroo rat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUGLAS HABERMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Tuesday officially designated
33,295 acres in San Bernardino and Riverside counties as critical
habitat for the endangered San Bernardino kangaroo rat.</LD>
<LD>   The move means development projects proposed within the habitat
area will have to clear higher hurdles to obtain some permits from
federal agencies, according to environmentalists and county
officials. The designation takes effect May 23.</LD>
<LD>   The acreage is in four groupings: by Lytle and Cajon creeks,
primarily east of Interstate 15 and west of Interstate 215 north of
Highland Avenue; in the Etiwanda area, just west of Interstate 15 and
north of Highland Avenue; along the Santa Ana River and wash in the
Highland area; and along the San Jacinto River in Riverside County
near the cities of San Jacinto and Hemet.</LD>
<TE>   The designation "will make it tougher" for the proposed Lytle
Creek North residential development and for some San Bernardino
County flood control projects, said Randy Scott, the county's
division chief for advance planning.</TE>
<TE>   The San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors unanimously
approved Lytle Creek North on Dec. 4. The project is a 647-acre
community with 2,466 homes just south of the Glen Helen Blockbuster
Pavilion. About 7,000 residents would live there. It would include 29
acres of parkland and 66 acres of open space, as well as commercial
and possibly industrial uses.</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Biological Diversity, which sought the designation,
said it will help protect the kangaroo rat. But a center attorney,
Kassie Siegel, lamented the exclusion of 22,000 additional acres
originally proposed for protection.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe that the reduction is biologically justified,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   All nine scientists who reviewed the habitat plan before it became
final called for more land to be included, Siegel said. But the Fish
and Wildlife Service determined that designating all of the acreage
was not necessary for the protection of the kangaroo rat, according
to documents published Tuesday in the Federal Register.</TE>
<TE>   The San Bernardino kangaroo rat is about 9 inches long from head
to tail and pale yellow and brown. It is a subspecies of Merriam's
kangaroo rat but is so different from other subspecies some
scientists consider it practically a species unto itself, according
to the Fish and Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   It once was found throughout the San Bernardino and San Jacinto
valleys, but its habitat "has been severely reduced and fragmented by
development and related activities," the service said.</TE>
<TE>   The Center for Biological Diversity is suing the county in state
court over its approval of the Lytle Creek North project. Tuesday's
Fish and Wildlife ruling will not affect that suit, but should make
it more difficult for the developer to get federal permits to
rechannel a portion of Lytle Creek, Siegel said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe they can obtain the permits they need," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Dabney, project engineer for Lytle Creek North, did not return
a call for comment.</TE>

<HD>Rising Pedestrian Death Toll Studied</HD>
<DH>Safety: Participants at session discuss ways to reduce
Valley fatalities, which have nearly doubled since 1999.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE STASSEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A mix of city and community leaders met Tuesday to discuss ways to
reduce the escalating number of pedestrian deaths on San Fernando
Valley streets.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, 40 people died crossing Valley streets, compared with
25 in 2000 and 21 in 1999, according to the Los Angeles Police
Department. "It's an alarming increase, but there's an awful lot we
can do about it," Los Angeles City Councilman Jack Weiss told the
gathering of 150, which included pedestrian-advocacy groups, as well
as police, school and transportation officials.</LD>
<LD>   Those attending the brainstorming session during the annual Valley
Traffic Summit at Airtel Plaza Hotel discussed a variety of ways to
combat the problem, including street improvements, education and
enforcement.</LD>
<TE>   The methods included the repainting of some crosswalks in a ladder
pattern to increase their visibility, installing pulsating strobe
lights at others to alert motorists of pedestrians, and placing
crosswalks in the middle of long blocks to discourage jaywalking,
said John Fisher, assistant general manager of the Los Angeles
Department of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   In areas with a large elderly population, some crosswalk signals
are being reprogrammed to give walkers more time to get across the
street before the signal changes. Efforts also are underway to
educate walkers in hopes of changing bad habits that contribute to
fatal accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Officials showed a video of pedestrians who narrowly avoided being
hit by vehicles as they stepped out of the crosswalk. The video also
showed schoolchildren who were nearly struck by cars after their
parents dropped them off in the middle of the street.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids think it's OK [to cross a street illegally] because
their parents let them do it," Officer Troy Williams told the
gathering.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Transportation has distributed brochures on
pedestrian safety and held seminars to teach the public how to safely
cross the street.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD has scheduled stings to cite motorists who endanger
pedestrians. Since January, 2,000 motorists have been ticketed as
part of the program, Sgt. Roger Archambault said.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly a year, LAPD Deputy Chief Ronald Bergmann, the Valley
Bureau's new commander, said he has been trying to get funding for
more laser guns, the high-tech version of the radar gun. The Los
Angeles Police Foundation has agreed to pay $130,000 for 40 laser
guns if the city did the same. The City Council has yet to approve
the funds.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very, very important tool for traffic enforcement,"
Bergmann said.</TE>

<HD>Panel OKs Bill to Let Prisons Use Force in DNA Testing</HD>
<DH>Measure: Public Safety Committee approves legislation
allowing officials to forcibly extract blood or saliva samples from
inmates for a state database.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A compromise bill authorizing prison officers to forcibly extract DNA
blood or saliva samples from murderers, rapists and other criminals
who refuse to give it up voluntarily cleared a steep hurdle in the
Senate on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The required DNA samples are recorded in a state databank and used
to identify perpetrators of unsolved crimes, some of them decades
old.</LD>
<LD>   However, some inmates refuse to provide samples because their DNA
may expose them as participants in crime cases gone cold.</LD>
<TE>   Sponsored by law enforcement and backed by Gov. Gray Davis, the
bill by Senate Republican floor leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga
broke a two-week stalemate and won easy 4-0 approval of the Public
Safety Committee.</TE>
<TE>   As an "urgent" measure, the bill would become law immediately upon
Davis' signature. A spokesman for the governor said it's likely he
would sign the bill if approved by the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   At its first hearing April 9, the legislation (SB 1242) stalled
when it ran into the opposition of Senate President Pro Tem John L.
Burton (D-San Francisco), a committee member. He objected to several
features, including what he called a vague definition of the use of
"reasonable force" by state prison and local jail guards.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of killing the politically popular bill in an election
year, the Democrat-dominated committee agreed to Burton's suggestion
that he and Brulte try to produce a compromise. They did so.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we've been able to deal with all the issues," Brulte
told the committee.</TE>
<TE>   Without discussion or testimony or comment from Burton, the
committee quickly approved it and sent it to the Appropriations
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The heavily amended bill specifically would allow the use of
reasonable force (now defined in the legislation), require the
videotaping of cases in which an inmate is removed from a cell by
force, and direct prison supervisors to authorize use of force in
writing before the DNA sample of blood is drawn or the mouth swabbed.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials can seek a court order for use of
reasonable force, but they say Superior Court judges are hesitant to
grant these orders.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, a court order no longer would be needed.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1998, violent felons and certain other criminals have been
required to provide a DNA sample and thumb and palm prints.</TE>
<TE>   Failure to do so can result in denial of parole or being tried for
a misdemeanor, which typically is punished by a $500 fine and six
months behind bars. Conviction of a misdemeanor is of little
consequence to convicts who will spend the rest of their lives in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Citing figures from the state Department of Justice, Brulte has
testified that about 16,000 eligible prisoners either have refused to
give specimens or have not been asked. A sampling of a handful of
prisons, he said, indicates there are 3,000 inmates who have refused
to give a specimen, including at least 300 hard-core felons.</TE>
<TE>   Some inmates have been freed on parole without providing DNA,
which is a violation of the law, Brulte said.</TE>
<TE>   In the original bill, Burton objected that the definition of
reasonable force was so vague that it could result in unnecessarily
harsh treatment of prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Under the compromise, reasonable force would be that which an
"objective, trained and competent correctional employee, faced with
similar facts and circumstances, would consider necessary and
reasonable to gain compliance" with DNA requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Some proponents of the bill have insisted that the Department of
Corrections has had the authority all along to use reasonable force
in securing DNA samples. Earlier this month, four months after the
bill was introduced, the department announced it intended to adopt
policy regulations by Jan. 1 on the use of reasonable force to obtain
DNA samples.</TE>

<HD>Earthquake Monitoring to Be Expanded to All Parts of State</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's network of seismic monitoring stations will spread from
Southern California to cover the entire state and total 1,200
stations under a new state appropriation announced Tuesday by the
Davis administration.</LD>
<LD>   The $2.9-million program includes $1.84 million for Caltech to
operate its Southern California network of 600 stations, completed in
the last year, and will add 600 stations in the north. When complete,
it will enable state scientific and emergency authorities to pinpoint
the precise location and damage pattern of any sizable quake within
minutes of its occurrence no matter where it occurs in California.
Some quakes in rural regions have been beyond quick identification.</LD>
<LD>   The program, announced in a Sacramento news conference by the
director of the state Office of Emergency Services, Dallas Jones,
supplants the traditional federal funding of such stations.</LD>
<TE>   The federal government had announced last year that it would cut
much of its funding, although the Federal Emergency Management Agency
will continue to contribute $1 million a year, and the U.S.
Geological Survey is expected to make a smaller contribution.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis said that a new umbrella group, the California
Integrated Seismic Network, has been created to coordinate quake
monitoring in the state. It provides information at www.cisn.org.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a more robust monitoring system," bringing together the
efforts of the Geological Survey, Caltech, UC Berkeley and the
California Geological Survey, Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   A vital feature of the Southern California network has been
so-called shake maps, which depict the shaking in sizable quakes not
only near the epicenter but in all areas where the quake is felt.</TE>
<TE>   Such shake maps have been available mainly in Southern California.
With the new state funding, they will now be available throughout the
state, and in a major temblor could be assembled by any of the
contributing monitoring agencies if one or more were disabled
regionally, according to Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Hauksson expressed concern that with the reduction of
federal funding, the Southern California system might be diminished
in scope. He launched a successful effort to convince the Davis
administration that the state should take over responsibility for
continuing and expanding the system.</TE>
<TE>   In both of California's most damaging quakes of recent years--the
1989 Loma Prieta temblor in the Bay Area and the 1994 Northridge
quake--authorities were unsure for up to two days just where all the
most severely damaged areas were.</TE>
<TE>   With the new shake map capabilities, it should be possible to know
within the hour where emergency units are needed, Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Historic records show that California has, on average, about one
potentially damaging quake of 6.5 magnitude or higher every four
years.</TE>

<HD>Summer Power Supply Looks Good</HD>
<DH>Energy: New plants, conservation, abundant mountain runoff
combine to make the threat of blackouts minimal, grid operators say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Power blackouts should not be a threat this summer, say California's
electricity grid operators.</LD>
<LD>   New power plants, continued conservation and abundant mountain
runoff at hydroelectric plants should allow the state to get through
summer without emergency alerts and blackouts, said Jim Detmers, vice
president of operations at the California Independent System
Operator.</LD>
<LD>   Based east of Sacramento in Folsom, Cal-ISO oversees the flow of
electricity on a transmission grid serving 30 million people.</LD>
<TE>   But getting the electricity wasn't always easy in 2000 and 2001,
when Cal-ISO struggled on dozens of days to keep enough power
flowing. On seven days in spring and winter of last year, Cal-ISO
intentionally triggered blackouts to avoid crashing large sections of
the transmission grid.</TE>
<TE>   Experts predicted that last summer's hot temperatures, when air
conditioning boosts electricity consumption, would make blackouts a
part of life in California. But long-term power contracts hurriedly
signed by the state and unexpectedly strong conservation helped
prevent blackouts. On some days, the state's total conservation
reached 2,000 to 4,000 megawatts, as much electricity as it takes
several major power plants to produce.</TE>
<TE>   There may be hot days this summer when the cumulative effect of
millions of Californians dimming lights and easing up on air
conditioning makes a critical difference to grid operators,
especially in the critical hours of 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., Detmers said.
But overall, he said, the state's power supply is dramatically
improved since 2001.</TE>
<TE>   New power plants capable of producing enough electricity to supply
nearly 1 million homes should be finished between now and summer,
said Detmers, and more abundant water supplies at big federal
hydroelectric plants in the Pacific Northwest and Northern California
will be capable of churning out more electricity than they did during
last year's dry conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Detmers said he expects the demand for electricity in the Cal-ISO
territory to peak between 42,000 and 45,500 megawatts. A megawatt is
enough power to supply roughly 750 homes.</TE>
<TE>   Long-term, the state's electricity picture is more clouded. More
than 62 power plant projects capable of supplying 3.5 million people
have been canceled or deferred in the past year, Detmers said. To
stay in step with demand, Cal-ISO figures the state should be adding
enough new capacity each year to serve 750,000 to 1 million homes.</TE>

<LD>A woman who tried to kill her husband with a poisoned milkshake was
sentenced to life in prison with a possibility of parole.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Dale Hahn sentenced Elizabeth Fuentes-Ortiz, 32, after she
was convicted in February for feeding her husband a pesticide-laced
chocolate milkshake in 1992, then fleeing to Mexico with their
2-year-old son.</LD>
<LD>   She admitted giving her former husband the drink, which left him
in a coma for 10 days. Fuentes-Ortiz said she wanted to incapacitate
him so she could escape and break a chain of physical abuse.</LD>

medical care, but officials have not found evidence of abuse there,
according to a recent report.</LD>
<LD>   Grand jury members called on the county Department of Human
Services to work with other social service agencies to improve
conditions at the county-run A. Miriam Jamison Children's Center and
seek funds for a new building.</LD>
<LD>   Shelter officials disagreed with the findings, saying the grand

<HD>Simon Clarifies View on Returns</HD>
<DH>Politics: He says he would release tax records if he wins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. agreed Tuesday to
release his income tax returns, but only if he wins the November
election.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first time Simon had made a distinction between his
refusal to disclose tax records as a candidate and his willingness to
do so as governor.</LD>
<LD>   "If I filed a tax return when I was governor, I'm sure I would
release that," Simon said.</LD>
<TE>   Since April 15, Gov. Gray Davis has demanded that Simon release
his tax returns to prove he paid his fair share of taxes. Simon, a
wealthy Pacific Palisades investment banker, has refused, saying the
governor's demand reminded him of Karl Marx and Big Brother.</TE>
<TE>   "After you're elected, you disclose your tax returns as part of
your duties as governor, and that's fine," Simon told reporters
between speeches to restaurant owners and manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates and elected officials are not required by law to
disclose their tax returns, but Davis and many others routinely
release theirs voluntarily. Simon argues that a financial disclosure
report he was required to file in December provided ample information
on his assets and sources of income.</TE>
<TE>   The tax matter has distracted Simon's campaign for more than a
week. On Tuesday, Davis used the issue to deflect Simon's criticism
of the governor's fiscal management. The state budget shortfall is
projected to be as much as $20 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Simon has no standing on this issue," the governor said,
"because he won't even reveal his income taxes, so we have no idea if
he has contributed to the cost of running the government."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who will release a revised budget proposal May 14, declined
to offer specifics on how he will handle the shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   "It will not be easy, but we'll do it in a way that is fair," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis reiterated that he does not intend to propose a tax
increase.</TE>
<TE>   Simon said the widening budget gap reflects Davis'"inaction and
inability to deal with a situation that's gotten worse by the month,
and we're all going to pay for it."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who has proposed spending cuts and other steps to save the
state $13 billion, wouldn't say how he would close the rest of the
projected gap. But he said he could still cut the capital gains tax.</TE>
<TE>   On another matter, the Simon campaign shifted course on
fund-raising disclosure. On Monday, Simon called on Davis to release
his schedule of fund-raising events--but the GOP challenger said he
would release his own only "after I'm elected governor."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, though, the Simon campaign pledged to release the
candidate's fund-raising schedule after all.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to call on the governor to do something we're not
willing to do," said Simon spokesman Jeff Flint.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, however, will keep his fund-raising schedule
private, because donations ultimately are disclosed in reports
available to the public, said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar.</TE>

<HD>Board-Care Home to Pay Family $700,000 in Elder Abuse
Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Verdict: The Oxnard facility is responsible for death of
man, 72, as result of dehydration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A jury has told an Oxnard board-and-care home to pay $700,000 to the
family of a 72-year-old man, stemming from a lawsuit that accused the
facility of wrongful death and elder abuse after he died of
complications resulting from dehydration.</LD>
<LD>   Last week's verdict against Summerville at Harbor came 21/2 years
after the facility, then under different ownership, paid $2.2 million
to settle a similar lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   In the most recent case, a jury voted 10 to 2 in favor of the
family of Jesse Espinoza, who died in August 2000 after being housed
in a room that lacked air-conditioning and where the windows barely
opened.</LD>
<TE>   Testimony in the six-day trial before Ventura County Superior
Court Judge Barbara Lane revealed that Espinoza had been dehydrated
for one to two weeks and died of renal failure, according to an
attorney for the family.</TE>
<TE>   The jury awarded Espinoza's four children $200,000 for wrongful
death and awarded $500,000 to Espinoza's estate for his pain and
suffering, said family attorney Gregory L. Johnson. The jury also
awarded $15,777 to cover funeral and medical expenses.</TE>
<TE>   It is believed to be the first time a Ventura County jury has
awarded damages for elder abuse under a relatively new state law that
provides greater protections for senior citizens, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   A day after the verdict, attorneys for the family and the
facility's owner--Summerville at Cobbco Inc.--reached a confidential
settlement for punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   "The most rewarding thing is that someone, in any amount, has
found that the facility has some responsibility and some
accountability," said Johnson, who filed the case in December 2000
along with Oxnard attorney Jody C. Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Summerville spokeswoman Laura Kislowski said, "We are saddened by
the verdict. The safety and well-being of our residents is our
highest priority, and in the case of Mr. Espinoza we feel appropriate
care and action was taken."</TE>
<TE>   The facility has been under fire before.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the former owner, CIG Oxnard Inc., settled a lawsuit
brought by survivors of a 74-year-old woman who died of pneumonia
after being left for hours on her bedroom floor in a pool of vomit.</TE>
<TE>   The facility was then known as Channel Islands Gardens.
Summerville assumed operation in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and Moore have another elder abuse lawsuit pending against
the Oxnard facility. That suit, filed in November, alleges elder
abuse and sexual battery against two elderly clients.</TE>
<TE>   That lawsuit has not been set for trial, but one of the defendants
pleaded guilty last year to elder abuse and was sentenced to 120 days
in jail, court records said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and Moore said last week's verdict brought a sense of
comfort to Espinoza's children, who put their father in the Oxnard
facility in 1995 after he was left partially paralyzed by a stroke.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, the significance of the verdict is that [the jury] was
willing to compensate somebody for his suffering, even though he
wasn't here to explain what his suffering was about," Moore said.</TE>

<HD>County OKs Funds to Fix Sluggish Computer System</HD>
<DH>Technology: Unhappy at a surprise request, supervisors
grant $630,000 to cope with lagging response time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Supervisors on Tuesday approved leasing an additional computer and
extra data storage for more than $630,000 a year because the county's
data processing department failed to anticipate that providing
Internet services and upgrading two departmental systems would slow
the county's central computers.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors approved the request but were unhappy the problem
hadn't been foreseen.</LD>
<LD>   "My goodness," said Supervisor Tom Wilson, "a 40% increase in
computer use should have been known about long before it happened."</LD>
<TE>   The problem was first noticed six months ago when county
technicians saw a spike in the county's use of computing power.
Employees started to complain about long response times for
information on desktop computers.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was especially embarrassing for county information
managers in light of last year's $260-million data processing
contract with Lockheed Martin IMSA, which was to have been adequate
for the county's computing needs through 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Leo E. Crawford, the county's chief information officer, said
available resources are now at their limit and that average daytime
demand is now greater than 90% of capacity.</TE>
<TE>   The board approved Crawford's plan to lease an additional IBM
processor and software from Affiliated Computer Services, which
bought Lockheed Martin IMSA a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford told the board that he and his staff simply became
complacent. "I think we got lazy because we thought that we were
perfect for so long," Crawford said.</TE>
<TE>   The problem and its cost rankled supervisors, who, at the board's
meeting, noted that Crawford was asking permission to extend the
one-year lease for three more years without asking approval each
time--a possible total expenditure of $2.5 million. Supervisor Todd
Spitzer told Crawford to ask for approval each year.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford later said that his staff had been preoccupied with
enhancing the county's Web services.</TE>
<TE>   "No one thought to say, 'OK, we should do a complete analysis.' We
were in the midst of e-commerce and everyone forgot the mainframe
because we've been focusing on the Web," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He anticipated leasing more power for as long as two years. Two
major data processing clients, the Municipal Court and Social
Services Agency, are planning to leave the county's main system
within two years, which is expected to free computer power, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly two years, the county's information technicians have
been trying to streamline public access and create a paperless
process for business transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Online services now allow the public to pay traffic fines, view
pictures of animals up for adoption, schedule an appointment with a
building inspector, apply for a county job and perform other such
tasks.</TE>

<LD>Reversing course, federal prosecutors said Tuesday that they will not
block Judge Ronald C. Kline's attorneys from interviewing a Canadian
computer hacker who allegedly found child pornography on the jurist's
home computer.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors abandoned their objections this week after learning
that Kline's attorneys have already discovered the hacker's identity.</LD>
<LD>   Kline's attorneys have argued the hacker might have been working
as a law enforcement agent when he broke into Kline's computer. If
so, a judge would probably throw out the pornographic evidence police
found in Kline's home, ruling that it was obtained as a result of an
illegal search.</LD>

<HD>Network Turns Its Eye on O.C.'s Celebrity Murder Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a celebrity murder case that has proved irresistible to TV's
legal experts. And why not? It took police awhile--a year, in
fact--to make their case. They have a theory as to who did it but no
witness. Proving it in court is far from a sure thing.</LD>
<LD>   By now, much of America knows the outlines of the Robert Blake
case, in which the former TV star is accused of killing his wife,
Bonny Lee Bakley, while she sat in their car.</LD>
<LD>   But Orange County has its own celebrity murder--one with the same
dark themes, a delayed arrest, no witnesses--but much richer in
intrigue. Last week, Michael Goodwin was ordered to stand trial for
the 1988 murders of former business partner Mickey Thompson and
Thompson's wife, Trudy.</LD>
<TE>   Thompson was the first American racer to break the 400-mph land
speed barrier. He and Goodwin had a tumultuous business partnership
that ended in acrimony and a court ruling against Goodwin that forced
him to declare bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Long suspected by Thompson family members, Goodwin wasn't arrested
until last year, 131/2 years after the killings. He has adamantly
protested his innocence.</TE>
<TE>   But while the national media zeroes in on Blake, little has been
said about Goodwin. That might change next month when CBS airs an
installment of "48 Hours" that promises to take a close look at the
pending drama of the Goodwin trial.</TE>
<TE>   "We were attracted because we see it as a fascinating cold case,"
CBS producer Katie Boyle says. "And we were able to get exclusive,
intimate access to Collene Campbell and Michael Goodwin, the two
sides in a fascinating murder."</TE>
<TE>   Campbell, a longtime south Orange County political figure and
Thompson's sister, made it clear early on that she believed Goodwin
arranged the murders. She is believed to have led the drive to have
authorities investigate his role.</TE>
<TE>   "She has been a force of nature and has been instrumental in
keeping attention focused on the unsolved murder of her brother and
sister-in-law," Boyle says.</TE>
<TE>   "48 Hours" has conducted extensive interviews with Campbell and
Goodwin, Boyle says. The yearlong research for the program, scheduled
to air May 20, included interviews with a number of other friends and
business associates of Thompson and Goodwin, as well as Goodwin's
lawyer and Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not trying to solve this case," Boyle says. "We're just
trying to tell the story of a sister who believes she knows who
killed her brother and his wife since the day they were gunned down.
On the other side is a man who says he's been unfairly hunted and
persecuted for 14 years."</TE>
<TE>   Boyle, a senior CBS producer who supervised the Goodwin segment,
says the Goodwin case is a first-rate drama. "I think it became more
fascinating the deeper we dug into the story," she says. "We
discovered all kinds of twists and turns that make it very compelling
drama."</TE>
<TE>   Calling Thompson a "real American hero," Boyle says, "it's
incredible that 13 years went by before someone was arrested."</TE>
<TE>   She's happy to have the show publicized, but it doesn't need my
hyping. For all the reasons Boyle cites, it's a story inherently more
compelling than the Blake case. "I think it's among the most
interesting mysteries we've ever investigated," she says.</TE>
<TE>   I ask Boyle if, after a year in putting the story together, the
"48 Hours" team reached any conclusions about whether Goodwin ordered
the hit on the Thompsons.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather not say what we found," she says. "I'm not trying to
be coy. But we haven't written the last act yet."</TE>

<HD>Uncle May Have Fled With Girl, 17</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A North Hills man who is obsessed with his 17-year-old niece may have
abducted her and taken her out of the country, police and relatives
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Yanira Elizabeth Lozano, a junior at Van Nuys High School, was
reported missing Friday from the Van Nuys apartment she shares with
her mother, stepfather and five siblings. Relatives said they believe
her 43-year-old uncle, Carlos Flores, took her.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know what's wrong with him," said Lozano's 16-year-old
brother, Mario. "He thinks he's in love with her."</LD>
<TE>   Flores was convicted last year of molesting Lozano, and he had
threatened to take her to El Salvador, said relatives and Los Angeles
police detectives.</TE>
<TE>   Lozano went to the store about 2 p.m. Friday but didn't return
home, her brother said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier on Friday, Lozano had called her mother at work and
complained that her uncle had been driving around the apartment in
violation of a court-approved restraining order, said Officer Esther
Myabe. Police said Flores abducted Lozano a year ago. Her brother
said they were found about a month later. Flores pleaded no contest
to four counts of having sex with a minor, the district attorney's
office said, and was sentenced to a year in jail. The court also
ordered him to stay away from his niece, Det. Jack Gray said.</TE>
<TE>   Lozano's parents told police that Flores threatened to take the
girl to El Salvador for reporting the molestation, Gray said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers with the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the FBI,
U.S. Customs and the Border Patrol have been notified that the pair
may have fled the country.</TE>
<TE>   Lozano has brown eyes and black hair, is 4 feet 6 and about 130
pounds. She was last seen wearing a white shirt, red pants and a gold
bracelet that spelled ''Sweet 15.''</TE>
<TE>   Flores, who is married with two grown sons, was last seen driving
a dark gray 1995 Mitsubishi pickup truck. Police ask that anyone with
information contact the LAPD Van Nuys Division at (818) 756-8371.</TE>

<LD>Orange County supervisors voted Tuesday to form an underground
utility district to help a realignment project along Laguna Canyon
Road.</LD>
<LD>   Under rules established by the state Public Utilities Commission,
utility lines are to be buried at the time of road construction.</LD>
<LD>   The board's action covers half a mile of Laguna Canyon Road from
El Toro Road to the San Joaquin Hills Corridor. Cost for taking
utilities underground is estimated at $600,000, a county spokesman
said.</LD>
<TE>   The board considered other utility projects, such as Pacific Coast
Highway through Sunset Beach, but gave priority to Laguna Canyon
Road. Construction is to begin in 2004.</TE>

<HD>Board Ousts Behavioral Health Chief</HD>
<DH>Government: In a closed session, supervisors' 4-0 vote ends
months of criticism over David Gudeman's leadership of Ventura County
agency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors fired Behavioral Health Department
Director David Gudeman on Tuesday, culminating months of growing
criticism over his leadership of the troubled mental health division
of the county Health Care Agency.</LD>
<LD>   Board of Supervisors Chairman John Flynn announced the 4-0
decision after a two-hour closed session. Supervisor Frank Schillo, a
Gudeman ally, was out of state and did not vote.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors declined to discuss details of the deliberations,
calling it a confidential personnel issue.</LD>
<TE>   But reached later, one supervisor said she hopes Gudeman's
dismissal would begin the process of healing a department that has
been plagued by turf wars and administrative squabbles for more than
four years. "I'm hoping people in the department will let the dust
clear, continue to do their jobs, do it well and put this stuff for
the past few years behind us," Supervisor Judy Mikels said after the
meeting. "What we need right now is to come together and keep patient
care in the forefront."</TE>
<TE>   Gudeman, 43, was not in the boardroom when the decision was
announced. Reached later, he said he listened to the vote on a county
audio system.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA-trained psychiatrist said he is unsure what he will do
next.</TE>
<TE>   He said he enjoyed working with the 450 employees in the
Behavioral Health Department during his three years at the helm of
the $50-million agency, which provides mental health services to
needy and indigent patients.</TE>
<TE>   Gudeman disputed the contention that mental health services have
suffered on his watch.</TE>
<TE>   "The department's in much better shape than it was when I took it
over three years ago," he said. "I'll leave it at that."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say Gudeman failed to end bureaucratic infighting that has
plagued Behavioral Health for years. He recently ignited a Superior
Court judge's wrath by refusing to treat a mentally ill teenager
sentenced to a Camarillo work program.</TE>
<TE>   And under his administration, critics say, the mental health
division has moved away from collaboration with other county
departments.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Kathy Long said it's time to return to cooperative
efforts to help people with mental illness function in society.</TE>
<TE>   "It's healthy to do a national search for his replacement and to
have a lot of public input," Long said. "We need to bring in someone
with both administrative skills and a commitment to [collaboration]."</TE>
<TE>   Schillo condemned the action of his colleagues, calling it a "rush
to judgment."</TE>
<TE>   "They did it in a way that is just disgraceful," Schillo said from
Washington, where he is lobbying for support for the county's
military bases.</TE>
<TE>   "They would not allow him to speak at [last week's] board meeting.
The appropriate thing would be for the state and federal government
to come down and evaluate him. And they wouldn't do that."</TE>
<TE>   Pierre Durand, director of the Health Care Agency, appointed
psychologist Linda Shulman to serve as acting director of Behavioral
Health. Shulman has been chief operating officer for two years and
will oversee daily operations until a permanent director is
appointed.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael Ferguson, a psychiatrist who has previously worked in
the Behavioral Health Department, will serve as acting medical
director. Gudeman held both titles.</TE>
<TE>   County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston said the recruitment
process will take three to six months. Shulman will be paid between

<HD>Orange School Contract Reached</HD>
<DH>Education: Teachers and district officials must ratify the
settlement. Raises are 'substantial,' board member says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Negotiators for Orange Unified School District and its teachers union
reached a tentative contract settlement late Tuesday, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The teachers' executive board and the school board must approve
the agreement.</LD>
<LD>   The district's 1,400 teachers, who have been at odds for years
with the district over salaries, must also ratify the agreement.</LD>
<TE>   No terms of the contract were released, but board member Melissa
Smith said the raises are "substantial.''</TE>
<TE>   "I am delighted,'' Smith said. "I think the teachers will be very
happy with it."</TE>
<TE>   Smith was elected in November and is a member of the board's new
majority.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers union campaigned on behalf of the new majority.</TE>
<TE>   During the summer, the union had supported a recall of board
members who had opposed raises.</TE>
<TE>   The union said contentious and dragged-out negotiations with the
previous board led to hundreds of teachers leaving the 30,000-student
district.</TE>
<TE>   The two groups have clashed repeatedly over district finances.</TE>
<TE>   After the recall election, the new board commissioned a study on
district operations.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting report said Orange Unified had consistently
overestimated its expenses and underestimated district revenues and
kept unnecessarily high levels of emergency reserves.</TE>

<HD>Builder Donates 57 Acres for Park</HD>
<DH>Conservation: Shea Homes will get a $2.4-million tax credit
for the Thousand Oaks land. It had planned to construct 21 houses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The plans called for 21 luxury homes on 57 acres at the edge of
McCrea Ranch in northern Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, builder Shea Homes handed the land over Tuesday to the
Conejo Recreation and Park District in one of the latest conservation
agreements under the state's Natural Heritage and Preservation
tax-credit program.</LD>
<LD>   By donating the land, the builder will get a $2.4-million tax
credit, 55% of the land's appraised fair market value. Wetlands,
wildlife and Chumash remains on the property will receive added
protection. And the public will get unobstructed views of nature when
a 340-acre park, ranched by the late cowboy actor Joel McCrea and his
family, opens next year.</LD>
<TE>   "Our board of directors is delighted," said Tom Sorensen, the park
district's planning administrator. "We didn't want a bunch of houses
across the street."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the state Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis signed
off on the tax-credit program as a way for state and local agencies
to acquire open space at a discount. The program allows as much as
$100 million in tax credits through 2005 for property owners who
donate land or water rights for conservation.</TE>
<TE>   The state's Wildlife Conservation Board decides whether
applicants' properties are worth preserving with tax credits; $39
million in credits have been granted to date. The first credit,
approved last spring, was $1.3 million to Mid-State Bank for property
in Cambria. Another 12 credits have been granted since, said Al
Wright, executive director of the conservation board. Those included
a $16-million credit in Malibu and the Shea Homes land in Thousand
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Several other applicants are scrambling for consideration,
although with the state's budget woes, some lawmakers have proposed
cutting the program short.</TE>
<TE>   Property owners have any number of reasons for participating
rather than building or selling, Wright said. They may need a
short-term tax break more than a long-term land profit. Or the tax
credit might yield greater profit than development, particularly if
community resistance to building plans or the discovery of rare
plants or animals would mean years of costly delays.</TE>
<TE>   Shea Homes sought the tax credit last year, although it already
had the entitlements to build. Company officials declined to discuss
details of that decision.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the $2.4-million credit, said Regional Manager Steve
Seeman, the company will lose money on the site. But the credit
"minimized a loss we would have taken by simply donating the land,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sorensen doesn't care why Shea went the route it did; he is
pleased with the results.</TE>
<TE>   When fully operational, the park will pay homage to ranch life,
featuring the McCreas' estate house, a foreman's house, barns and
chicken coops, a lake stocked with fish and perhaps a museum with
exhibits on ranching and western film actors. It might have been
difficult, he said, to reconcile such a nostalgic theme with a
skyline of suburban mansions.</TE>

<HD>Schools Try to Take Anxiety Out of Testing</HD>
<DH>Education: Breakfast, water bottles and cash awards are
some things officials are using to boost state scores.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the most serious of academic weeks, but at one elementary school
students were bubbling with excitement about their new personalized
water bottles. At another, youngsters competed for the chance to
attend a pizza party with a disc jockey. And on some high school
campuses, teenagers answered questions in hopes of scoring cash for
the prom.</LD>
<LD>   As standardized testing season begins this week in Ventura County
public schools, teachers and administrators are becoming more
creative about how to engage students in the annual ritual that many
of them dread.</LD>
<LD>   "We're learning more effective practices for the test
administration, and schools are learning more effective motivational
techniques," said Valerie Chrisman, who is working out of the Ventura
County superintendent of schools office to help five schools lift
test scores. "Anything that helps the kids relate to the test, I
think that's a good idea."</LD>
<TE>   Chrisman declined to say which schools she is working with.</TE>
<TE>   Countywide, more than 100,000 second- through 11th-graders will
spend the next several days hunched over Stanford 9 and
"standards-based" multiple-choice exams, a key component of Gov. Gray
Davis' school accountability program. Because improvement can mean
cash rewards for campuses, the stakes are highest at those schools
that failed to boost scores last year.</TE>
<TE>   At Santa Paula High School, for example, students have spent each
day during the last two months in a new 30-minute test preparation
period, being drilled on basic math and language concepts. School
officials have sponsored rallies, given out pencils stamped with
encouraging messages written in English and Spanish, sent home
letters to parents and even taken out ads in the local newspaper with
sample test questions.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make sure it was a school-wide effort," Principal
Tony Gaitan said. "We are totally focused on one common goal, which
is improved test scores."</TE>
<TE>   Similar efforts are underway at schools across Ventura County,
even as many educators continue to criticize the emphasis placed on
standardized tests.</TE>
<TE>   In Oxnard and Camarillo, school officials provided free
pancake-and-sausage breakfasts for high schoolers on six campuses
Tuesday, the first day of testing. They also promised that the class
at each school with the biggest jump in scores would get a donation
to its prom fund.</TE>
<TE>   At Ventura's Lincoln Elementary School, some second- and
third-graders received a "test-taking first aid kit" that included a
pack of Smarties candy to "boost test-taking brain power," a sticker
to "help stick with the task at hand" and a pencil to "record the
knowledge you have learned."</TE>
<TE>   And at Conejo Elementary School in Thousand Oaks, students who
showed good test-taking skills--including thoughtfully answering
questions and using extra time to check work--earned stickers on a
checklist that they could cash in for an end-of-the-week pizza party.</TE>
<TE>   "What everyone is trying to do is reduce the stress," Chrisman
said. "It should be nothing more than showing what you've learned all
year, and that's the message we want to give the kids."</TE>
<TE>   Gimmicks and incentives aside, school officials also say they have
worked hard to align what they are teaching in the classroom with the
standards-based material in the state tests.</TE>
<TE>   They have purchased new textbooks, incorporated good test-taking
skills into daily lessons and, at the high school level, tried to
stress basic language and math skills across other disciplines.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Dietel, a spokesman for the Center for Research on Evaluation
Standards and Student Testing at UCLA, said researchers have not been
able to determine why Stanford 9 scores have been difficult to
increase among ninth-, 10th- and 11th-graders. Many administrators
believed it was because teenagers are less motivated, but recent
studies have proved that theory false, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It really leaves an important question as to what can be done to
improve student performances at the high school level," Dietel said.
"At this point we really don't know, and at best, we're guessing."</TE>
<TE>   Since the state's testing and accountability system began four
years ago, educators have criticized it for being too dependent on
the results of one multiple-choice exam, which only measures how
students do compared with a nationwide pool of test-takers.</TE>
<TE>   That was in part because the Stanford 9 was the only basis for the
Academic Performance Index, a public ranking of schools that
determines a school's eligibility for rewards or potential for
sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   But starting this spring, standards-based tests--those measuring
students' knowledge of specific concepts and lessons in math,
language arts, science and history--will be incorporated into next
year's index, said Les Axelrod, education research and evaluation
consultant in the California Department of Education.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the state board of education today will consider a
recommendation to award the next testing program contract to a new
company, New Jersey-based Educational Testing Services.</TE>

<HD>Priesthood Has 'No Place' for Abusers, Pope Declares</HD>
<DH>Religion: John Paul II calls molestation a civil crime and a sin,

<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II, in a ringing denunciation of sexual abuse,
declared Tuesday that there is no place in the Roman Catholic priesthood
for those who molest the young.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to an extraordinary meeting of cardinals summoned from the
United States in the wake of the clerical sex scandal rocking the
American church, John Paul called the abuse of minors both a civil crime
and "an appalling sin."</LD>
<LD>   The pope's emphatic statement, several cardinals said later, was an
unmistakable signal that he expects bishops to cooperate fully with law
enforcement authorities in ferreting out offending priests.</LD>
<TE>   But he offered no explicit guidance on whether the church should
enforce a "one-strike" rule to defrock any priest found to have molested
a minor. Some cardinals, meeting at the Vatican to set guidelines to
handle sex offenses, said the pope's nuanced statement was open to
interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting from the defensive tone of his recent remarks, which had
agonized over the scandal's demoralizing blow to the church and its
clergy, John Paul sounded a note of compassion for the victims of sexual
abuse. Since January, dozens of American priests have been accused of sex
crimes, and bishops have been faulted for covering up some of the
incidents.</TE>
<TE>   "To the victims and their families, wherever they may be, I express my
profound sense of solidarity and concern," John Paul said in remarks to
the cardinals that were later released by the Vatican. The actions of
abusive priests, he said, have caused "suffering and scandal to the
young" and undermined trust in the church.</TE>
<TE>   "People need to know that there is no place in the priesthood and
religious life for those who would harm the young," the pope told the 12
U.S. cardinals, two U.S. bishops and leading Vatican cardinals. "They
must know that bishops and priests are totally committed to the fullness
of Catholic truth on matters of sexual morality."</TE>
<TE>   But John Paul, who believes in the transformative power of religious
experiences, also raised the possibility of a changed life for a
repentant fallen priest.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot forget the power of Christian conversion, that radical
decision to turn away from sin and back to God," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether a priest undergoing such a "conversion" would be allowed to
remain a priest remained open to question.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't clear to me either," Cardinal Francis George of Chicago
told reporters. "So I'm not sure where that [papal] discourse leads us on
that question of 'zero tolerance.' " Even the U.S. delegation, George
said, was not in agreement on that issue.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a difference between a moral monster who preys upon little
children, who does so in serial fashion, and someone who perhaps under
the influence of alcohol engages in an action with a 17- or 16-year-old
young woman who returns his affections," George told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles said it was evident to him
from the pope's remarks that the church has a dual role--to protect and
help the victim, and to help the perpetrator.</TE>
<TE>   "What he [John Paul] really was saying is you must take the person who
is the abuser or the molester and work with them. That doesn't mean you
reassign them to the priesthood," Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops, said the reassignment of abusive priests remained "a thorny
issue."</TE>
<TE>Credibility Concerns</TE>
<TE>   One thing was clear: Cardinals and bishops who weeks ago avoided
public discussion of the growing scandal are now eager to pose as
articulate reformers. Public relations representatives for the U.S.
bishops conference were flown here from Washington to arrange daily media
briefings, and several cardinals spoke to reporters on their own.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the question of the credibility of bishops is a real
concern," Gregory said. "We've passed the time for mea culpas. We're in
the season for action."</TE>
<TE>   David Clohessy of St. Louis, director of the Survivors Network of
Those Abused by Priests, said, "The real test of whether or not there
will be serious reform will come long after the media spotlight and legal
pressure abates."</TE>
<TE>   At first ignored by the Vatican, the scandals have threatened to taint
John Paul's long papacy, casting him in his twilight years as an
enfeebled pontiff distant from the problems afflicting his church and
overly protective of his clergy.</TE>
<TE>   But his forceful speech Tuesday dispelled that image.</TE>
<TE>   In one elegant passage, the pope gave thanks for good works by the
"vast majority" of American priests, who are free of scandal, and offered
a judgment of the American church that might also fit his own reign: "A
great work of art may be blemished, but its beauty remains."</TE>
<TE>   "We must be confident that this time of trial will bring a
purification of the entire Catholic community," John Paul said. "So much
pain, so much sorrow must lead to a holier priesthood, a holier
episcopate and a holier church."</TE>
<TE>   "That line hit me," said Cardinal Adam Maida of Detroit. "That's the
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Several cardinals offered to restore credibility by creating advisory
councils in each diocese to help bishops handle sexual abuse cases. They
also were studying the idea of creating a national layperson's panel to
advise the U.S. bishops conference on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The worst crisis in the American church's modern history ignited in
January in Boston with the disclosure that a known pedophile priest had
been moved by the Boston archdiocese from parish to parish. Other cases
followed, and the scandal soon spread to dioceses across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Catholic bishops have come under intense pressure to act. Outraged
Catholics have called for the resignations of Cardinals Bernard Law of
Boston and Edward M. Egan of New York, both blamed for reassigning
abusive priests to new parishes without telling parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two days, some cardinals have told the pope's closest
confidants that the Vatican should ask for Law's resignation as
archbishop of Boston, one cardinal told The Times. A bishop confirmed the
cardinal's account. Both asked that they not be identified. Both said a
majority of American bishops want Law to step down quickly.</TE>
<TE>   But on Tuesday, Maida joined George and Cardinal Theodore E. McCarrick
of Washington in saying that Law should remain. "The trouble began on his
watch, and he wants to fix it," McCarrick said. "Give him a chance."</TE>
<TE>   The pope made no reference to the pressures on Law. But he said
Tuesday that "many are offended at the way in which the church's leaders
are perceived to have acted in this matter."</TE>
<TE>Law Offers Apology</TE>
<TE>   Meeting with his fellow U.S. cardinals Monday night, Law personally
apologized to them, but no one spoke of resignation, George told
reporters. Law, he said, "started out saying that in a sense, if he had
not made some terrible mistakes, we probably would not be here."</TE>
<TE>   The formal, high-powered encounter--between the American prelates and
nine senior Vatican officials--took place around a U-shaped conference
table in the frescoed Sala Bologna of the Apostolic Palace.</TE>
<TE>   All eight cardinals who lead U.S. archdioceses were present: Law,
Maida, Egan, George, McCarrick, Mahony, William Keeler of Baltimore and
Anthony Bevilacqua of Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   They were joined by Cardinal Avery Dulles, a New York theologian, and
three American cardinals who work in the Vatican: William Wakefield Baum,
Edmund Szoka and James Francis Stafford.</TE>
<TE>   For 5 1/2 hours Tuesday, the American prelates rose one by one to
diagnose the problem and to offer solutions.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans' immediate goal is to win Vatican authorization for the
U.S. bishops conference to impose unprecedented binding procedures on all
195 U.S. diocesan bishops for addressing clerical sex abuse. The
conference is to meet in Dallas in June.</TE>
<TE>   Some American cardinals were also demanding a strong statement from
the pope.</TE>
<TE>   It came just before their midday break, after the prelates had filed
from the meeting hall through a labyrinth of corridors to the papal
library. John Paul, who did not attend the discussions, greeted each one.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very cordial, very grateful," Maida said, "but I could just
see in his face and his being: He was very sorry that we were there to
discuss this particular situation."</TE>
<TE>   Then he sat to read his remarks in English, while his guests followed
like schoolboys from a prepared text.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul said he was "deeply grieved" by the scandal and asked God to
give the bishops the strength to deal with it. He asked Catholics to
"stay close to their priests and bishops" and predicted that "your
discussions here will bear much fruit."</TE>
<TE>   His remarks, some cardinals said, recast what the Vatican had viewed
as an "American problem" into a challenge for the worldwide church, which
has suffered less visible clerical sex scandals in Canada, Australia,
Ireland, Britain, France, Germany, Mexico and Poland.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans aren't the only ones who sin," George told reporters. "The
holy father certainly knows the problem exists elsewhere. . . . Perhaps
what we do here can be helpful to the universal church."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the first day's discussion, however, was inconclusive and
skirted issues of clerical celibacy and homosexuality that some leading
Catholics insist are central to the debate.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony had called previously for debate on whether a married
priesthood would reduce instances of clerical sex abuse. But he did not
press the issue Tuesday, and other cardinals brought up celibacy only to
ask how the centuries-old clerical tradition could be strengthened.</TE>
<TE>   Another issue put on the table, but unresolved, is whether homosexuals
should be excluded from the priesthood--an idea suggested recently by the
pope's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls. Maida said Tuesday that
"behavioral scientists are telling us" that clerical sex abuse is "a
homosexual problem."</TE>
<TE>   In unusually candid remarks to reporters, Gregory admitted that a
"homosexual dynamic" exists in some American seminaries and discourages
young men from studying for the priesthood. "It is an ongoing struggle,"
he said, "to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by
homosexual men."</TE>
<TE>   The American cardinals worked into the night to shape the day's
discussion into proposals that might find consensus today.</TE>

<HD>Sudden Impact Pitches Commuters Into Chaos</HD>

<LD>Metrolink conductor Patrick Phillips was standing at his work
station early Tuesday, filling out paperwork, keeping track of arrival
times. He had counted about 240 tickets when they passed a signal for the
train to slow to 25 mph and prepare to switch to another track on their
way south.</LD>
<LD>   The train instead made an emergency stop, and then the engineer ran
past him, yelling a warning to everyone in the car.</LD>
<LD>   "He said, 'It's a big one, it's a big one!' " said Phillips, 49, of
Riverside. " 'We're going to get hit!' "</LD>
<TE>   In one jarring instant, Phillips and the passengers aboard Metrolink
Train 809 found themselves flying through the air, banging into walls and
tables and each other in a screaming, bloody whirl. Nearly all of the
double-deck train's 300 commuters suffered some sort of injury and two of
them died in a collision with a Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight
train.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened so fast for me that I don't remember the impact myself. I
just remember flying through the room and landing on the other side,"
Phillips said Tuesday night. He was recuperating from a concussion,
bruises and cuts at his parents' Inland Empire home.</TE>
<TE>   "I yelled at everyone to get down: 'Buckle up everyone. We're going to
get hit.' And they pretty much did, at least the ones who could hear me.
They were hitting the deck, stowing luggage under their seats. Some had
their heads in between their legs in a curled up position. . . . Maybe it
worked. I hoped it helped a little."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips and the others in the lead car who were warned by Engineer
Mike Dudgeon's frantic run from the front of the train had a few seconds
to brace themselves. For passengers in the second and third cars, the
collision brought a violent end to a routine morning of conversation,
reading and napping.</TE>
<TE>   Will Meier, 19, was catching a few extra minutes of sleep in the lead
car as he traveled from his Riverside home to morning classes as a
freshman at Cal State Fullerton. He was awakened by the engineer's
shouts: "Get down! Get down, right now!" Meier, not fully awake, did as
told. "I wasn't sure what was happening."</TE>
<TE>   Loydene Keith, 59, was also in the first car, riding near the front as
part of her regular commute to Cal State Fullerton, where she is dean of
students. Keith likes to sit with other regulars.</TE>
<TE>   Her first inkling of trouble was a hissing. "We looked at each other
and said, 'It sounds like the brakes.' "</TE>
<TE>   As the passengers ducked, Keith tucked into the defensive position
that flight attendants advise in the event of a rough landing: body
forward, head between the knees. Then she scrunched to the edge of her
seat and crouched as low as she could, waiting.</TE>
<TE>   The freight train banged into the commuter train, bumping it backward.
Then it ran into it again, harder this time, sending passengers bounding.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Bisesi, 38, of Placentia was watching the collision unfold
while buying gas at a nearby station. She heard the freight train's
whistle pierce the morning air--not the usual series of short bursts but
a long sustained blast. She ran to the sidewalk to get a better view and
saw two trains on one track.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't do anything. I just froze," Bisesi said.</TE>
<TE>   She started waving her hands. "To warn them, as if they could see me.
I screamed, 'Stop! Stop!' The ground shook. It felt like the worst
earthquake I ever felt. It hit so hard it knocked me back."</TE>
<TE>   The next few seconds were marked by mostly silence. Then passengers
began frantically trying to find ways out of the cars, pounding on
windows and doors to get them open.</TE>
<TE>   "People were crawling out the windows and they were coming out the
doors," Bisesi said. "First they were milling around. People were walking
around holding their heads, holding their stomachs. They were screaming,
crying." She heard some passengers wondering if it had been a terrorist
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Madden, 37, had been sitting in his usual spot in the middle
car, partly out of habit and partly out of a sense that somehow it might
be safer. He had just finished making small talk with a commuting buddy,
Kevin Barnett, who was sitting across from him, and cracked open the
morning paper to read about the latest Anaheim Angels loss. As usual, he
sat back to front, leaning sideways.</TE>
<TE>   After the impact, he caught himself at the edge of a table and somehow
kept his balance. Barnett had been jammed into the table edge and was
moaning about his ribs.</TE>
<TE>   Above Madden on the upper level, Rick Coverdell, 42, of Riverside was
also driven into a table. "Next thing I know, I was on the floor. I had
the wind knocked out of me."</TE>
<TE>   Savitha Mandi pulled herself up from the floor and felt pain shoot
through her back and left hip. On a normal day, she wouldn't have been on
Train 809 at all. But she'd overslept and missed her train from Corona
that connected in Orange to downtown Los Angeles and her job at a mutual
fund firm.</TE>
<TE>   So she joined her husband, who takes the later train to his job at an
Irvine bank, and was on a cell phone conference call when she was jolted
out of her seat.</TE>
<TE>   As she arose, she saw blood splattered over fellow passengers and the
car. People were strewn about the floor, some moaning.</TE>
<TE>   Mandi made her way out the door and away from the train to stretch out
on the pavement.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when I saw something had hit us," Mandi said. "I saw the
freight train. It was traumatic. We were all in shock."</TE>
<TE>   Loydene Keith, who hurt her ribs, back and head, at first thought the
train had struck a gravel truck. There was dust in the air and she looked
to her friend Cathy, who had blood on her face. There was blood on the
conductor's face too. Mike the engineer stopped momentarily to hold her
hand and ask if she was all right.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to Cathy, 'We've gotta get out of here,' " Keith said, fearing
fire might break out. "[Cathy] said, 'I can't move.' But we dragged
ourselves off the train. Then I just went out and laid down on the
ground."</TE>
<TE>   Meier, with a hurt hip, also had trouble getting to his feet. He gave
his sweatshirt to another passenger to staunch the flow of blood from
gashes on her face. Two men were sprawled near the door, unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   "There was smoke everywhere," Meier said. "People were screaming.
There was a lot of blood everywhere. . . . People were like unconscious
all around me. All the window glass shattered. . . . I tried to walk but
I couldn't, so a guy helped me out. I think it was another passenger.</TE>
<TE>   "I laid down in the dirt next to the train and I called my dad."</TE>
<TE>   His father told him to make sure he got medical attention, and
promised that he was on his way. Then Meier called his mother, Secret
Meier. He was praying to himself when she answered.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom, get here as soon as you can," he said, crying into the phone.
"There's all kinds of bloody people around me. My hip hurts really bad."</TE>
<TE>   Ariele Ray, 48, of Riverside had been deep in a John Grisham novel on
the last car's lower deck when the impact threw her into the headrest of
the seat in front of her. "I ended up on the ground, holding my head."</TE>
<TE>   Her next memory was of people gathered around her, asking if she was
OK. It took her a few moments to realize the skin in her forehead was
split open--three wounds that would later take 40 stitches at Anaheim
General Hospital to close up.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was an earthquake. Everything just went slam!" she said.
"Then everything seemed like it was moving in slow motion, forward. I
could hear people yelling and screaming. And the ambulances were right
there. It amazed me."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Scharr had been driving to Yorba Linda Friends Church, where he
is a pastor, when he saw the collision and pulled to a stop. He and other
witnesses grabbed a ladder from a truck and headed for the trains to help
people get out, Scharr fearing that fire could break out.</TE>
<TE>   Scharr and others moved from car to car trying to sort the confused
from the injured. He saw some passengers administering CPR to another
passenger.</TE>
<TE>   Other passersby leaped to help. Debbie Campbell, 43, of Anaheim had
been stopped at a traffic signal, and she and three men jumped from cars
and ran to the train, prying open a door with a 2-by-4 board.</TE>
<TE>   The wreck coincided both with a shift change for the Orange County
Fire Authority and with a regional disaster-preparedness drill.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedic Jim Shook and Engineer Darryl Barbee were the first of a
wave of rescuers to get through the door of the first car. Shook went
left, Barbee went right.</TE>
<TE>   The paramedics cleared the train of the "walking wounded," as they are
known. "We have to lessen the chaos," Shook explained. He stepped aboard
and shouted: "Anybody that can get up, get up!"</TE>
<TE>   Most did. Once those with minor injuries left the train, eight victims
who could not walk out on their own remained. Many were moaning, and most
were lying on the ground. Few had evident injuries, but appeared to be
victims of blunt trauma--internal injuries caused by slamming into tables
between the train's benches.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the injured were silent and still. One was lying face down,
his head under a bench and his breathing slow and shallow. Shook
maneuvered the man until he could insert a nasal tube to help him
breathe.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, 55 ambulances lined up to whisk the wounded to hospitals.
Shook told his comrades outside to take his patient first.</TE>
<TE>   "He was breathing a little better," Shook said. "He was actually
moving around a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Shook thought the man would survive. He was wrong--the man died about
an hour later.</TE>
<TE>   "I never knew his name," Shook said. "He could never tell me that."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the crumpled train cars, shock gave way to pandemonium.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the victims, such as Madden, were lucky. His neck
hurt--nothing serious, more of a strain, he said. He was cleared to leave
the scene on his own after a couple of hours and met his wife and some
neighbors, who took him home. His friend, Barnett, wasn't as lucky;
Madden thinks he broke his ribs.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of some victims were directed to a hastily established
family assistance center at the Alta Vista Sports Park, less than a mile
from the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Secret Meier went there hoping to find her son. She couldn't. Then he
called again via cell phone to say he was being taken to Placentia Linda
Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The parents went there, but again couldn't find him. After a wait,
hospital officials learned that Meier had been taken to St. Jude Medical
Center in Fullerton. The parents were off again, finally catching up with
Meier in a physical therapy room.</TE>
<TE>   Secret Meier was crying. "She threw her arms around me and wouldn't
let go," her son said. "I didn't want to let them go, either."</TE>

<HD>New Accounting Rules Leave AOL Seeing Red</HD>
<DH>Media: Changes prompt an expected $50-billion loss, two years after
a once-heralded merger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometime this afternoon AOL Time Warner Inc. probably will earn the
dubious honor of spilling more red ink than any company in U.S. corporate
history.</LD>
<LD>   With a quarterly loss expected to exceed $50 billion, in one fell
swoop the world's biggest media company will lose more than the annual
gross domestic product of Ecuador, Croatia, Uruguay, Kenya or Bulgaria.</LD>
<LD>   The loss--which is largely on paper and reflects new accounting
rules--essentially acknowledges that the merger between Internet giant
America Online Inc. and media conglomerate Time Warner Inc. has fallen
dramatically short of expectations.</LD>
<TE>   Two years ago when the deal was announced, the two companies had a
combined stock market value of $290 billion. Today, AOL Time Warner's
stock is worth about $85 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an appalling number, bigger than the [gross domestic product] of
some countries," said entertainment analyst Harold Vogel of Vogel Capital
Management in New York. "Most analysts will dismiss it and say it's now
behind them and doesn't matter because it's noncash. But it's an
admission of a humongous mistake."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Wall Street already has factored in the loss. AOL
Time Warner's shares have fallen 41% this year, partly because the
company telegraphed the eye-popping losses a few weeks ago and because of
the slowdown in advertising that is hurting its properties. An AOL Time
Warner spokesman declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting losses are a morning-after hangover of the wild run-up
in the stock market in the late 1990s. Many companies, including America
Online, used their inflated stock to buy other companies. Now, new
accounting rules set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board are
forcing companies to more accurately state the fair market value of those
acquired assets. Often, the result is huge write-offs.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner has said it expects its asset write-down to be $54
billion.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules have been especially tough on industries such as
entertainment, technology and telecommunications. Their stocks were hyped
in the '90s, when promise often meant more than profit.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, last year fiber-optics company JDS Uniphase Corp. posted
a $50.6-billion annual loss because of write-downs in its assets.
Telecommunications equipment maker Nortel Networks Ltd. adjusted its
books to the tune of $19 billion. Vivendi Universal, which owns Universal
Studios, in 2001 posted the largest loss ever for a French company at
$11.8 billion, reflecting its recent acquisition spree.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult for the typical investor to sort these numbers out.
These companies are very complicated, so huge, and the accounting and
reporting of the numbers is so complex," said Brian Mulligan, who had to
compile similar figures when he was chief financial officer for Seagram
Co. before it was acquired by Vivendi.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, entertainment companies often have pushed the
creative boundaries in how to portray their financial results, in much
the same way they creatively sell movies and TV shows.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1990 merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications to form
Time Warner, investors were steered away from traditional forms of
financial performance measures such as net income and earnings per share.
Instead, an array of often convoluted financial yardsticks including
"EBITDA," "cash flow," "free cash flow" and "pro forma" numbers were
touted by entertainment companies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become like a sleight-of-hand routine at a carnival," analyst
Vogel said. " 'Don't watch this hand--watch my other hand.' "</TE>
<TE>   Companies such as Time Warner and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. rarely
posted a sizable annual profit but nonetheless often were lauded by Wall
Street if other measures exceeded expectations. In the February news
release announcing its 2001 financial results, Viacom Inc., owner of CBS,
Paramount Pictures and MTV, waited until the third page to reveal it lost
$224 million.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when corporate earnings are coming under more scrutiny in
the wake of the bankruptcy filings of Enron Corp. and Global Crossing
Ltd., some critics say companies are too often downplaying profit as a
measurement so they can look better to investors.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment companies, often with Wall Street's blessing, have
embraced the financial measure EBITDA. It is a "profit" number that
excludes many kinds of expenses, including debt interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization.</TE>
<TE>   The theory was that traditional financial measurements don't
accurately portray the health of companies that have invested in big
projects such as cable systems, broadcast networks, technology and
telecommunications networks.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Gabelli, one of the nation's biggest media investors, said the
numbers are merely the tools needed to evaluate a company's health,
adding that an investor can't simply rely on any single one.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like valuing a big diamond ring. You have to look at color,
clarity and carats," Gabelli said.</TE>
<TE>   One problem is that different companies use different criteria, much
as if speaking different dialects of the same language.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co., for example, is one of the few entertainment
companies that still regularly highlight corporate earnings per share of
stock. In recent years, though, it also has highlighted free cash flow
because of its continuing theme park construction programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to report our numbers in a way that is most meaningful and
most clear, and I can only assume other companies present what they think
is meaningful," Disney Chief Financial Officer Thomas Staggs said. "But
it ends up being a hodgepodge."</TE>

<HD>Navy Pulling the Plug on Airport Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burying any chance of an airport at the closed El Toro Marine base,
the Navy said Tuesday that it will sell the sprawling Orange County
property for parks and other limited development.</LD>
<LD>   Just what is built will ultimately be the decision of local
officials--specifically the city of Irvine, the Navy said. Irvine has
petitioned to annex the 4,700-acre base; 424 of those acres are already
within city limits.</LD>
<LD>   "This marks the beginning of a tremendous opportunity for the people
of Orange County and best meets the mandate of the base closure law to
return this property to productive local use," Secretary of the Navy
Gordon England said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors reacted to the news by canceling contracts
with 15 consultants working on the proposed international airport, except
for two advocacy firms that specialize in dealing with the Navy and
federal bureaucracy. Supervisors Todd Spitzer and Tom Wilson-both
longtime El Toro airport opponents-were the only two of the five-member
board who objected to continuing those two contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement ends eight years and $54 million worth of planning by
the county for a commercial airport at El Toro, which opened in 1943 and
closed in July 1999. Local voters approved airport zoning for the base in
1994 but rescinded that last month through Measure W. The new zoning
calls for a park, open space and limited development.</TE>
<TE>   The decision also dashes the hopes of regional planners, who saw a new
airport at El Toro as both an economic stimulus and a way to take the
pressure off other Southern California airports.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Cynthia P. Coad, chairwoman of the Orange County Board
of Supervisors, H.T. Johnson, the Navy's assistant secretary for
installations, said the goal is to move El Toro "into private hands so
that it can be placed on the tax rolls for the benefit of the citizens of
Orange County and the city of Irvine."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who made the final decision on El Toro, will be in Orange
County on Thursday to meet with county and Irvine officials on a plan for
selling the property. In a letter to Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, who hopes
to build a large urban park at the base, Johnson said the Navy wants to
agree on a plan that includes city zoning and a development plan by May
31.</TE>
<TE>   The property will be sold through the General Services Administration,
which sent appraisers to view the base last month. The Navy will end its
El Toro lease with the county on June 30 but will honor several
subleases, including those for a golf course, stables, farming and
recreational vehicle storage.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's statement stressed that the Federal Aviation Administration
would have no further role in the fate of the base--a blow to elected
leaders from Los Angeles and Ontario who flew to Washington last week to
ask the FAA to stop the Navy sale.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy announcement was anticlimactic in Orange County, where most
local officials saw it as a confirmation of last month's public vote. But
there were no guarantees that a sizable park would be built--the
centerpiece of Irvine's rezoning campaign to rezone the property--or how
much of the land might end up in the hands of Irvine for public use.</TE>
<TE>   Still, South County officials who have fought for years to prevent the
airport were jubilant.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the last stake in the heart of the airport," said Irvine
Councilman Chris Mears, who met last week in Washington with Johnson and
Irvine City Manager Allison Hart. "Irvine will be the master planner of
the base in concert with the Navy. Who the land is sold to and how, those
are the details to be worked out."</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy has listened to the will of the people of Orange County and
come to the right decision for El Toro," said Allan Songstad, chairman of
the nine-city El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, which opposed the
county's airport plan.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors reacted to the news by canceling contracts
with 15 airport consultants working on the airport, except for two
advocacy firms that specialize in dealing with the Navy and federal
bureaucracy. Supervisors Todd Spitzer and Tom Wilson objected to
continuing those two contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, a leading opponent of the county's airport plans, said
taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for any more El Toro expenses. More
than $40 million over the years for El Toro planning came from John Wayne
Airport, whose funds could be used only toward the new airport.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's statement didn't mention the possibility of moving the
Marine Corps' West Coast boot camp to El Toro--an idea that continued to
circulate Tuesday. In a statement, Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James
Jones said the Navy's decision "allows for a timeline that provides the
Marine Corps sufficient time to study future possible land uses for El
Toro."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors have welcomed the possibility of the
Marines' return, although it would take federal legislation to reopen the
closed base. San Diego politicians are split on the idea of shifting the
boot camp to El Toro. Reps. Randall "Duke" Cunningham (R-Escondido) and
Darrell Issa (R-Vista) say it could allow San Diego to expand Lindbergh
Field, which is adjacent to the boot camp.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy said that the city isn't encouraging the
Marines to leave the depot, but "we remain ready to evaluate alternative
land uses if the Marine Corps decides to move [the boot camp] to El
Toro."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County supervisors also will ask the Navy to allow 852
single-family houses on the base to be used for low-income housing and
transitional living for the homeless. Irvine's plan calls for the homes
to be used by faculty, staff and other employees of Cal State Fullerton,
which wants to build a new campus at El Toro, and UC Irvine. Some 165 of
the homes already are planned for housing for the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge now is to create a master plan for the redevelopment of
the base that involves the coordinated transfer of property to individual
buyers, Mears said. A park still is planned, he said. The city intends
for 88% of the land to remain in public uses, including the university
and a nearly 1,000-acre wildlife sanctuary already established by the
Navy. Another 70 acres will go to the Department of Justice for FBI
training.</TE>
<TE>   At least one airport proponent held out hope Tuesday that the Navy's
intentions would change if a proposed initiative to revive an airport at
El Toro qualifies for the Nov. 5 ballot. Retired airline pilot and Villa
Park Councilman Bob McGowan said backers hope to restore airport zoning
to the property before it is sold.</TE>

<HD>2 Die, Hundreds Hurt as Trains Crash Head-On</HD>
<DH>Accident: A Metrolink stopped in Placentia is struck during rush
hour by a freight hauler that failed to stop at a signal.</DH>

<LD>A mile-long freight train traveling east through Orange County
failed to stop at a warning light and collided head-on Tuesday morning
with a double-deck Metrolink commuter train, killing two people and
injuring more than 260.</LD>
<LD>   Either the engineer missed the light or it malfunctioned, the
chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday night
at the scene of the crash. The accident caused the first deaths in the
10-year history of Metrolink, which runs more than 100 trains a day in a
network spanning six Southern California counties.</LD>
<LD>   "If the signal was functioning normally, it would have been a red and
that [freight] train should have stopped," said NTSB Chairwoman Marion C.
Blakey.</LD>
<TE>   The crash at 8:10 a.m. shook buildings and sent passengers flying
through the air in a tumble of newspapers, eyeglasses and seat cushions.
After the impact, screaming passengers pounded on the train windows to
get out, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   "You had no control," said Brent Belisle, a Metrolink commuter who was
on his way from Corona to Anaheim. "It was like surfing in Hawaii when a
30-foot wave hits you."</TE>
<TE>   The collision occurred in Placentia, about 35 miles southeast of
downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Placentia resident Bobby Paredes heard the crash from his home two
blocks away."The thing just shook my whole house," said Paredes, 38. "I
knew it was something major. Nothing has ever shook the house but an
earthquake."</TE>
<TE>   NTSB officials said the southbound Metrolink train, which runs between
Riverside and San Juan Capistrano, stopped suddenly because the engineer
saw the Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight train approaching on the
same track.</TE>
<TE>   An NTSB official, who asked to remain anonymous, said preliminary data
showed the freight train had been going about 50 mph. The engineer saw
the impending collision and applied the emergency brakes when the trains
were 2,100 feet apart, the official said, slowing the freight train to
about 23 mph when it hit.</TE>
<TE>   Blakey said the freight train engineer and conductor jumped off the
train before it hit the Metrolink train and dragged it 370 feet down the
track.</TE>
<TE>   "I was reading my paper and then 'Boom!' " recalled passenger Patrick
Madden of Corona. "It was like a big shock wave. Bodies were flying out
of their seats. Cushions were flying past."</TE>
<TE>   The Metrolink train carried about 300 people. In all, 186 were taken
to eight hospitals. Orange County fire officials reported that 20 people
had suffered critical injuries and 65 were seriously hurt. About 100
people were treated at the scene for minor injuries, mostly bruises, and
others may have been injured but left without treatment, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   None of the four engineers and conductors on the two trains suffered
life-threatening injuries, a United Transportation Union official said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they hadn't gotten the signal to stop," said Capt. Cliff Schnack
of the Orange County Fire Authority, "this could have been a lot worse."</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said that after the freight train struck the Metrolink
train, snapping it backward, it rammed it a second time as it continued
down the track.</TE>
<TE>   "You have the initial impact," said Charlie Watts, 54, a bus salesman
who was traveling from Riverside to Orange. "My first thought was, 'Hey,
I made it.' And then you get the screams and cries and the second impact.
And that's when it got really scary. It was horrendous. The train caught
up with us again. It hit us with the same intensity."</TE>
<TE>   The nose-to-nose impact bent the front Metrolink car in two and shoved
it and the second car partially off the tracks. The train had been
powered by a rear locomotive, so the lead car carried passengers, as well
as an engineer in a front-facing cab.</TE>
<TE>   At least one of the men who died was in the first car, Orange County
sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said. He was identified as Robert Kube,
59, a federal employee who was commuting from his home in Moreno Valley
to his office in Santa Ana. The other fatality was a 48-year-old man
whose identity was not immediately released.</TE>
<TE>   For a time after the accident, the area around the train--a broad,
dusty patch near Richfield Road and East Orangethorpe Avenue--resembled a
cross between a refugee camp and an emergency room. Passengers lay on
stretchers, tarps or the bare earth near the crumpled train. Many were
bleeding and bore expressions of shock or pain. Paramedics applied
bandages and neck braces.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an amazing scene, just cell phones and Band-Aids," said Rick
Darden, a Placentia Police Department chaplain. "Just lines and lines of
people lying on backboards and tarps, bleeding and bandaged and calling
their families on cell phones."</TE>
<TE>   The passenger train was running on tracks operated by the freight
company BNSF.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a shared track," said Sharon Gavin, a Metrolink spokeswoman.
"It's a track that is owned by Burlington Northern, and they're the ones
who dispatch for this track."</TE>
<TE>   Although she did not assign responsibility for the accident, she said,
"Our train normally runs on this track at this time in this direction."</TE>
<TE>   A BNSF spokeswoman, Lena Kent, declined to comment on the accident.
She said the 67-car freight train, pulled by three locomotives, carried a
varied cargo in large shipping containers and was operated by an engineer
and a conductor.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second serious train crash in a week for the NTSB. Last
Thursday, an Amtrak train derailed in Florida, killing four passengers
and injuring more than 160.</TE>
<TE>   Two NTSB investigators arrived at the Placentia crash site about noon
Tuesday. They recovered the trains' event recorders, which keep track of
speeds, throttle positions and brake settings, among other things.</TE>
<TE>   NTSB investigators boarded the train late Tuesday, taking pictures and
working under bright lights. They inspected the signal system and
recovered recordings of the conversations between dispatchers and crew,
officials said. The federal agency assigned 14 investigators, who will
spend the next several months on the case.</TE>
<TE>   The NTSB began to interview the train crews and will eventually
simulate the crash. NTSB investigator Ted Turpin said blood samples of
both engineers were taken to test for drugs and alcohol, which is
standard procedure in such transportation accidents. The line was
expected to remain closed today. Metrolink officials said they would
provide bus service for the route.</TE>
<TE>   In a coincidence, the accident was on the morning that many Orange
County emergency agencies--police, hospitals, fire departments--were
participating in a transportation disaster drill.</TE>
<TE>   The mock crisis involved the fictional crash of a truck carrying
hazardous materials in Brea, a neighboring city. Some officials said they
believed they were able to react more quickly because of the drill.</TE>
<TE>   "The blessing in all of this is it happens at the same time and in the
same area and we were all ready to respond," said Sandy Scheppmann,
spokeswoman for Anaheim General Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Schnack described what rescuers saw when they entered the lead coach
in the train. The fire captain, who supervised the rescue, said the top
section of the two-level car was splattered with blood and vomit.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters had difficulty scaling one stairway because it was so
slick with blood, Schnack said. The other staircase had buckled from the
impact of the crash, and one man was stuck underneath it. Firefighters
eased him out through the window.</TE>
<TE>   In the lower section of the car, eight to 10 more passengers were
wounded and unable to leave without help.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's accident occurred less than three years after a similar
collision between a passenger and freight train in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen people were injured, boxcars tumbled down an embankment and a
locomotive derailed on Nov. 18, 1999, after a Metrolink train slammed
into a 38-car Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight train in Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   "To this date, the investigation has not resulted in any
recommendations," said Jim Southworth, the lead investigator, on Tuesday.
NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said the probe remains open.</TE>

<HD>Valued Bush Confidant to Leave White House</HD>
<DH>Politics: President's counselor cites family reasons. Move creates
a void in role of enforcer.</DH>

</DL>
<LD>Karen Hughes, the longtime advisor to President Bush who became the
most influential woman ever to work on a White House staff, said Tuesday
that she plans to resign this summer and return to Texas with her
"homesick" family.</LD>
<LD>   Her departure, the first significant change in the White House staff
since Bush's inauguration 15 months ago, will deprive the president of
his closest political confidant and sounding board and most trusted
wordsmith.</LD>
<LD>   Hughes, 45, holds the title of counselor to the president and manages
the White House press and public relations offices. But her roles as an
all-purpose presidential advisor and relentless enforcer of Bush's wishes
has made her one of the administration's most powerful figures.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think it can be replaced," a senior White House official said
of the Bush-Hughes relationship. "I think new structures will have to be
put in place."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes said she decided to leave because "I thought it was important
for my family to live in Texas." Associates said her husband, Jerry, a
lawyer, and her son, Robert, 15, a high school freshman, wanted to return
to Austin.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes and Bush said she would continue to advise the president after
she moves, though not as a full-time member of his staff.</TE>
<TE>   "She may be changing addresses, but she's not leaving my inner
circle," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   But other aides said her departure would inevitably alter the workings
of the Bush White House, which has been a notably disciplined operation,
with fewer leaks and internal rivalries than most of its predecessors--in
part because of Hughes' ceaseless insistence on discretion.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't take someone that important out of the day-to-day operation
and not have it change," said a former Bush aide.</TE>
<TE>Move May Cause Drop in Staff Efficiency</TE>
<TE>   Hughes' departure might make the Bush staff less efficient and
sure-footed, at least temporarily, other associates said.</TE>
<TE>   "She is in some ways his alter ego," a White House official said. "He
relies on her a lot and trusts her a lot, and she has an uncanny knack of
knowing what he'll like."</TE>
<TE>   "They might lose a step for a while . . . because they'll have to run
more questions past the president," a former aide said.</TE>
<TE>   But current and former aides said they do not expect the White House
staff to become looser and less disciplined after she leaves.</TE>
<TE>   "That part comes from the president," said one. "She doesn't need to
be there for it to be enforced. It's the culture."</TE>
<TE>   As if to prove the point, the aides and former aides refused to be
quoted by name, except when offering praise for Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes' departure will leave Karl Rove, Bush's chief political
advisor, as the sole remaining member of his innermost circle of
aides--those who served him during his years as governor of Texas and his
presidential campaign--at the top of the White House staff.</TE>
<TE>   But a former campaign aide noted that communications director Dan
Bartlett--Hughes' apparent successor in responsibilities if not in
title--worked for Bush in Austin even before Hughes joined the staff in
1994. "Don't underestimate Dan," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Hughes took up residence 15 months ago in a corner office on the
second floor of the West Wing, she dismissed suggestions that her gender
might influence policy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite occasional indications that her Republicanism might be a shade
less conservative than Bush's, Hughes saw her role not as changing the
president's views but as helping him articulate them in a way that would
appeal to voters in the political center.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is now clear that the White House will soon lose its most
powerful and ardent champion of women and working mothers.</TE>
<TE>   It was Hughes who wrote into Bush's address to the nation nine days
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks a line urging parents to "live your
lives and hug your children."</TE>
<TE>Trip to Austin Leads to Decision</TE>
<TE>   As one of several senior White House staffers who are mothers of
children still at home, Hughes made it a point to leave work by 5:30 p.m.
at least once a week to spend time with her son, often at his baseball
games.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes said her family's longing to be back in Texas crystallized
while she was in Austin on the first weekend in April, watching a close
friend's son play soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized that I was missing seeing my friend's children grow up and
that my son, likewise, was missing the opportunity to go to his friends'
homes and be in touch with his friends' parents," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her son, Robert, attended Washington's exclusive St. Albans School,
whose alumni include many children of political figures, but he never
felt comfortable there, associates said.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes said she made her decision now because she faced a May 1
deadline to inform St. Albans whether Robert would be returning.</TE>
<TE>   "My son is going into his final three years of high school . . . and
we wanted him to have his roots in Texas," she said.</TE>
<TE>   During much of the 2000 presidential campaign, Robert joined his
mother on her travels with Bush and was home-schooled aboard the campaign
plane.</TE>
<TE>   Prominent figures in Washington often cite family concerns as their
reason for leaving office, even when facts point elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   But Hughes has been open for months about her family's discontent at
living in Washington, and no one doubted her explanation Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always prided myself that this is a family-friendly White House,
and I think this is a family-friendly decision," she said. "My commute is
going to be a little longer, but you'll still be seeing me around
frequently." She said she would also stay in touch with the president by
telephone.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes has often said that she brought Bush the perspectives of
"normal people," meaning people beyond Washington's inbred professional
political community.</TE>
<TE>   In her Northwest Washington neighborhood, near the Potomac River,
Hughes did much of her own grocery shopping and often walked the family
dog, stopping to chat with friends and neighbors--and strangers who
recognized her.</TE>
<TE>   "The three big things in her life are family, faith and the
president," said Austin-based political strategist Mark McKinnon, who
worked for the Bush campaign. "But her ultimate responsibility was her
family."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes was born in Paris, the daughter of an Army major general who
was the last U.S. governor of the Panama Canal Zone. Hughes, a
self-described "Army brat," had moved seven times by the time she
enrolled at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   After college, Hughes worked as a reporter for KXAS-TV in Fort Worth.
She left journalism in 1984 to work on the reelection campaign of
then-President Reagan and then-Vice President George Bush, the current
president's father. After a stint as executive director of the Texas
Republican Party, she went to work for George W. Bush in his first
campaign for governor in 1994, "back when . . . the motorcade was one car
and he was sometimes driving it," she recalled Bush joking.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush was weighing a 2000 White House bid, he told her: "I'm not
doing this without you." Hughes later downplayed that comment, saying
Bush was only pressuring her.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who has a penchant for assigning nicknames, called her the High
Prophet, a play on her maiden name, Parfitt.</TE>
<TE>   But journalists who covered Bush's 2000 presidential campaign had a
different nickname for her: Nurse Ratched, after the hard-line head nurse
in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes was quick to confront journalists who, in her view, had not
given Bush a fair shake, and she spared no words in defending her
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "Her entire and complete loyalty is to the president," said chief
presidential speech writer Michael Gerson.</TE>
<TE>   As he ran for president, Bush entrusted Hughes with writing his
autobiography, "A Charge to Keep." Shortly after moving into the White
House, Hughes remarked in an interview: "I don't know that I have a voice
different from his anymore."</TE>
<TE>   But she also felt comfortable telling Bush when she thought he was
wrong. At the public announcement of her appointment to the White House
staff, Hughes told Bush: "I promise I will always give you my unvarnished
opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Bush grinned and shot back: "No doubt about that."</TE>
<TE>Announcement Catches Some by Surprise</TE>
<TE>   Hughes was part of a triumvirate of longtime Bush confidants in Texas
who came with him to Washington. Besides Rove, the third is Joe Allbaugh,
now head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</TE>
<TE>   In past administrations, women also have held senior White House jobs,
including two who served at different times as Bill Clinton's deputy
chief of staff: Evelyn Lieberman and Maria Echaveste. And in the current
White House, Bush's national security advisor is Condoleezza Rice.</TE>
<TE>   But no other female staffer has enjoyed the degree of influence that
Hughes wields.</TE>
<TE>   Some White House aides were surprised by Hughes' announcement.</TE>
<TE>   But many echoed the words of Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, who told
reporters, "It came as a surprise to me. But then when I started thinking
about how some of the things I'm privy to, the things I know about Karen
and the closeness of her family and the importance of her family in
Texas, it wasn't a surprise for long."</TE>
<TE>   Bush hailed Hughes' decision.</TE>
<TE>   "She has put her family ahead of her service to my government. And I
am extremely grateful for that approach and that priority," he told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that he will miss her," Gerson said of the president. "Karen
often is, and will continue to be, the last person the president talks to
when he makes important decisions. She'll continue to be involved. But
there is going to be a hole there."</TE>

<HD>Landowners Dealt a Blow by Justices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court upheld the government's power to impose a
temporary ban on development Tuesday, ruling in a Lake Tahoe case that
property owners are not due compensation whenever they are barred from
building on their land.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-3 ruling is an important victory for city planners, state
officials and environmentalists nationwide. It reaffirms the broad
authority of local and state officials to control development and
regulate property.</LD>
<LD>   It rejects the claim of property-rights advocates who said the
government must pay "just compensation" to owners who are barred from
using their land, even temporarily.</LD>
<TE>   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority, described a
moratorium on building as "an essential tool of successful development."</TE>
<TE>   He cited an array of examples, from a 30-month halt to development
within the Petroglyph National Monument in New Mexico to the many cities
that banned new homes for a time while new sewage treatment plants were
built. Sometimes a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, flood or
wildfire, prompts officials to impose a building moratorium while they
rethink where homes or offices can be safely constructed.</TE>
<TE>   If every delay were treated as a constitutional violation that
required compensation for the property owners, cities and states would be
bankrupted by lawsuits, Stevens said.</TE>
<TE>   But he did not close the door to individual property owners--such as
those at Lake Tahoe--winning such a claim in court.</TE>
<TE>   "In our view, the answer to the abstract question of whether a
temporary moratorium effects a taking [of property] is neither 'yes,
always' nor 'no, never'; the answer depends upon the particular
circumstances of the case," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   However, the ruling deals a stinging defeat to nearly 700 families who
bought lots near Lake Tahoe in the late 1970s. They hoped to build
vacation or retirement homes there but soon ran afoul of new
environmental rules.</TE>
<TE>   Because of runoff from the hillsides, the clear blue waters of the
lake were turning algae-green. In 1981, the Tahoe Regional Planning
Agency halted new construction while it devised a land-use plan to deal
with the erosion.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly three years later, the moratorium was lifted, and some
landowners whose lots were not at high risk for erosion were permitted to
build homes. Others waited years to win permits, and still others were
never granted permits to build.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of the landowners joined a lawsuit that challenged the
development bans. But as their case moved through the courts, it focused
only on a 34-month moratorium that ended in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   A federal trial judge ruled the families had been denied all use of
their land during that period and were entitled to compensation. But the
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision and said a
temporary moratorium, by its very nature, does not deprive a landowner of
all use of his land forever.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court took up the case last year (Tahoe-Sierra
Preservation Council vs. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 00-1167) and
voted Tuesday to affirm the 9th Circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been left with a worthless piece of property," said Kenneth
Eberle of Cambria, Calif., one of the original plaintiffs. He and his
wife, Betty, bought two adjoining lots in 1977 but have not been
permitted to build there. "I don't think this is fair or reasonable. I
guess I'd say today I no longer believe in the court's willingness to
protect our rights," Eberle said.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute turned on how to interpret the 5th Amendment to the
Constitution, which says "private property . . . shall not . . . be taken
for public use, without just compensation."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens said there remains a "fundamental distinction" between the
government's seizing of property for its use and a government regulation
that prevents or limits the owner's use of the property.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if the state wants to take land to build a freeway, it
must pay the owner just compensation. But the high court has struggled
for decades to define just when a regulatory limit on land use amounts to
a "taking" of private property.</TE>
<TE>   Under Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the court's conservative
wing has strengthened property rights. In a key decision 10 years ago,
the court said property owners are entitled to compensation when
officials bar them from making any use of their land.</TE>
<TE>   That 5-4 ruling came in the case of David Lucas, a South Carolina man
who was prohibited from building on his two beachfront lots. State
officials had prohibited building in some low-lying lands after Hurricane
Hugo hit the area.</TE>
<TE>   But in Lucas vs. South Carolina, the high court announced a strict
rule: full compensation must be paid whenever the government permanently
bars any and all use of private property.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the justices took up the Lake Tahoe case to decide whether
the same automatic compensation rule applied when officials imposed a
temporary ban on building.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens called the automatic compensation rule "extreme" and
unworkable. "We resist the temptation to adopt per se rules" in land-use
cases, he said. He wasjoined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M.
Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.</TE>
<TE>   In dissent, Rehnquist said the landowners in this case were subjected
to extreme treatment and deserve compensation for it. "The Taking Clause
requires the government to pay compensation whenever it deprives owners
of all economically viable use of their land," Rehnquist said. Justices
Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas joined his dissent.</TE>
<TE>   During his 16 years as chief justice, Rehnquist usually had a narrow
majority to rule in favor of property rights, but Justices O'Connor and
Kennedy switched sides this time and joined the liberal majority.</TE>
<TE>   Georgetown University law professor Richard Lazarus, an expert on
land-use law, called the ruling a welcome surprise. "This is the first
time I can recall the court discussing the propriety of land-use planning
at length. And basically they say it's a tough job, but the government's
got to do it if we are going to protect the environment."</TE>
<TE>   Because it is a constitutional ruling, the decision affects government
at all levels, from cities and counties to states and federal agencies.
In what may have been a key move, U.S. Solicitor General Theodore B.
Olson joined the case and argued in support of the Tahoe planning agency.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the property-rights movement said they were dismayed but
not devastated by the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento called the ruling "an
unfortunate blip in the forward progress of property rights."</TE>
<TE>   "We strongly agree with the chief justice, who recognized that while
Lake Tahoe is a national treasure, the costs for its environmental
protection should be borne by the public at large, not by a handful of
property owners," said foundation attorney R. S. Radford.</TE>
<TE>   In some instances, local agencies and the U.S. Forest Service have
offered to buy the lots of owners who have been barred from building on
them.</TE>
<TE>   The prices offered are quite low, said Santa Monica attorney Michael
M. Berger, who represented the remaining 449 Lake Tahoe families before
the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   It is impractical for these families to bring individual lawsuits in a
case such as this, Berger said. He had urged the court to adopt the rule
that a "total prohibition" of using land requires some compensation, even
if it is temporary.</TE>
<TE>   "We've come a long distance over the last 16 years in 'takings' law,"
Berger said. "Landowners have some real legal protection today. But this
is a disappointment. It is unfortunate backpedaling from where the court
seemed to be headed."</TE>

<HD>El Toro Sale Puts Regional Plans in a Fix</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Navy put an end Tuesday to plans for an airport at the former
El Toro Marine base in Orange County, forcing regional airport planners
to face a cold reality: The numbers don't add up.</LD>
<LD>   Those who favor a regional solution to the growing demand for air
travel in Southern California had hoped El Toro would ease the burden on
aging Los Angeles International Airport. An El Toro airport could have
accommodated up to 30 million passengers by 2025. With that option gone,
Southern California aviation planners must redistribute the load among
the region's other major airports.</LD>
<LD>   One likely impact, officials said, will be pressure to ease traffic
restrictions at Orange County's John Wayne International Airport.</LD>
<TE>   Redistributing the air traffic load presents a significant problem:
Most of the region's facilities have limitations--ranging from air
quality to federal restrictions to local opposition--that hinder their
growth. If aviation planners can't overcome the hurdles, experts agree
the region could lose valuable international air service to other states.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy announced Tuesday that it will retain the option of selling
all or part of the former Marine base but leave the ultimate decision on
how the property is developed to local officials.</TE>
<TE>   That puts even more focus on last year's 25-year forecast for regional
airport growth, compiled by the Southern California Assn. of Governments,
which attempted to spread 167 million annual passengers among 11 regional
airports. Despite a drop in traffic after Sept. 11, forecasters agree
growth will resume next year. But all the airports face major challenges
to expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Not the least of these is Los Angeles International Airport, which
served 50% more passengers last year than it was designed to handle.
Mayor James K. Hahn has proposed capping the airport at 78 million
passengers per year--a plan that many say isn't likely to hold up because
the airlines control service at the world's third-busiest airport.</TE>
<TE>   "For airlines like United and American there's a good percentage of
their passengers that go into Los Angeles and connect to somewhere else,"
said Michael Boyd, who heads the Boyd group, an aviation consulting firm.
"If you spread it out it means the airlines will start to go elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   This is precisely what Hahn hopes to do. The mayor has proposed
redistributing passenger growth that would have gone to El Toro among the
region's other airports, such as Ontario International Airport in San
Bernardino County and Palmdale Airport in northern Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, along with officials from communities near LAX, lobbied federal
officials last week in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the El Toro
airport plan alive.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor is disappointed; he believes El Toro should be built," said
Troy Edwards, deputy mayor. "But Ontario is ready and eager to serve some
of those passengers."</TE>
<TE>   Ontario served about 6.5 million passengers last year, but it could
not easily accept millions of additional passengers a year. For one
thing, Air Quality Management District restrictions limit the facility to
12 million passengers a year. And even with two new terminals, Ontario
could grow to only 10 million to 12 million without adding facilities and
a new runway, officials agree.</TE>
<TE>   Ontario residents and politicians have lobbied for years to add
flights at the airport, but they cringe at the notion of absorbing 20
million to 38 million passengers a year if El Toro isn't built. Those
figures were devised by the Assn. of Governments as part of two scenarios
in its 25-year forecast that left El Toro out of the mix.</TE>
<TE>   "Can we go up to 38 million? Wow, I don't know," said Ontario Mayor
Gary Ovitt. "We're real concerned about our quality of life in the
future. We don't want to end up like El Segundo and some of those other
cities that are negatively impacted by LAX."</TE>
<TE>Airlines Don't Like Palmdale as Plan B</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale Airport, which hasn't had commercial aviation service since
1997, would take 2 million to 4 million passengers a year by 2025,
according to the SCAG alternative that eliminates El Toro. But airline
representatives have repeatedly said they're not interested in flying to
the far-flung facility. Aviation planners said such reluctance could be
overcome if federal officials intervened.</TE>
<TE>   "The airlines don't want to go to Palmdale because they have capital
investments in existing facilities,' said Los Angeles County Supervisor
Don Knabe, who also heads the Southern California Regional Aviation
Authority. "But with strong direction from the Federal Aviation
Administration or the Transportation Security Administration, they may
want to move there."</TE>
<TE>   Other local airports said they were unsure they could take up the
slack by accepting more international flights.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that there is a demand for growth, especially in
longer-haul flights, that activity would be concentrated by the airlines
at LAX and Ontario and John Wayne," said Victor Gill, a Burbank airport
spokesman. "Burbank fits into a niche play. The constant growth occurs in
West Coast short-haul segment."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego officials said the city's Lindbergh Field is not an
alternative to El Toro, particularly since the 526-acre facility is near
capacity at 15.8 million passengers a year.</TE>
<TE>   The SCAG forecast that eliminates El Toro from the regional aviation
pot also carries daunting messages for local officials. If the Orange
County airport isn't there to absorb some regional aviation growth,
Southern California can bet on losing air service to communities like San
Francisco, Phoenix and Las Vegas, experts agree.</TE>
<TE>   The region would most likely lose international flights--thus
threatening LAX's status as the gateway to the Pacific Rim--to other
major airports in the West. Passengers on these flights would then take
commuter aircraft to Los Angeles, or connecting flights to other cities
around the country.</TE>
<TE>   For example, if LAX were capped at 78 million passengers and Ontario
took 20 million by 2025, the region would serve 19 million fewer
passengers than forecast, forcing airports outside Southern California to
take up the slack, said Hasan Ikhrata, SCAG's manager of transportation
planning.</TE>
<TE>   Without El Toro, it's also likely that airports such as Long Beach and
John Wayne would have to accept more passengers. Each has local
restrictions on growth--the only airports in the country that avoided a
1990 federal ban on such limits. Space at Long Beach Airport is scarce
because of a 1995 federal lawsuit settlement that limited the number of
commercial takeoffs at the airport to 41 per day. That was in response to
local efforts to reduce noise.</TE>
<TE>   John Wayne's restrictions are contained in a 1985 agreement, approved
by a federal judge, that expires Dec. 31, 2005. This agreement limits the
airport to 8.4 million passengers annually. Orange County supervisors
have proposed increasing the limit to 9.8 million by 2015.</TE>
<TE>   But regional aviation proponents say the airport may have to be
prepared to take even more.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some conversation about John Wayne growing regardless of
caps," said Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice). "Arguably, although more human
beings are going to be living in the Inland Empire, the demand for air
travel is growing the fastest in Orange County, and all those people
can't be exported to LAX."</TE>
<TE>   The Navy's decision on Tuesday underscored a rift between officials in
Los Angeles and Orange counties. Los Angeles lawmakers say Orange County
must take its fair share of regional aviation growth, with or without El
Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Although Orange County generated 20% of all regional aviation demand
in 1997--the latest year for which figures are available--it served only
9.4% at John Wayne. In contrast, the same year Los Angeles generated 58%
of the regional demand, but served 81%.</TE>
<TE>Planners Hope Bill Will Solve the Problem</TE>
<TE>   Aviation planners hope a bill by Assemblyman George Nakano
(D-Torrance) will help them mend the inequity. The bill, which is
scheduled to be heard by the Assembly Appropriations Committee next
month, would give preference for regional transportation funds to
counties that meet their regional aviation needs. Under the bill, SCAG
would determine whether counties are meeting the requirements set in its
transportation forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   "We maintain that it's high time Southern California had true,
equitable and fair distribution of the burdens related to aviation," said
Becki Ames, Nakano's chief of staff. "This issue of putting equity into
the process lets us put some teeth into us moving forward together toward
a truly regional plan."</TE>

<HD>A Quiet Broker of the Wild</HD>
<DH>The low-profile Wildlands Conservancy lures wealthy donors to
preserve open space. It helped the U.S. buy a vast expanse of desert.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN EMIGDIO RANCH, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>The canyons, oaks and grasslands here sent Dave Myers back to his
1950s childhood.</LD>
<LD>   "This reminds me so much of Orange County when I was young and the
hills went on forever," he said as his eyes roamed the landscape for deer
and eagles.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County of Myers' youth was long ago displaced by red-tile
roofs. But his allegiance to the wild made him an ardent conservationist,
head of a little-known nonprofit that has helped save expansive chunks of
Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   Operating out of a renovated bunkhouse in an old apple orchard in the
foothills of the San Bernardino Mountains, his Wildlands Conservancy
outmaneuvered the Mormon Church to buy San Emigdio Ranch, an untamed
97,000-acre intersection of ecosystems in southern Kern County, just over
the mountains from the seeping sprawl of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in a series of transactions beginning in 1998, the organization
came up with $35 million in private donations to help the U.S. Department
of the Interior acquire a vast checkerboard of desert lands that together
are bigger than Orange County. The Land Trust Alliance in Washington,
D.C., says it is probably the biggest sale, in terms of acreage, of
private land for public conservation in the U.S. The parcels stretch from
Barstow to the Arizona border, a raw, khaki landscape of mountains,
valleys and washes.</TE>
<TE>   In its brief history, Wildlands Conservancy has demonstrated a talent
for coaxing big private donations from a few wealthy benefactors and then
using the money to attract public funds for major conservation purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like something out of 'The Godfather'--a deal you can't resist,"
quipped a congressional staffer familiar with the organization's work.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Eubanks, a realty specialist for the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management, remains incredulous at Wildlands Conservancy's fund-raising
muscle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just phenomenal the ability they have to raise cash," he said.
"What they have done--I'm just amazed."</TE>
<TE>   The scale of their projects reflects a growing consensus in the
conservation community that big is biologically better, that ecosystems
need room to thrive.</TE>
<TE>   Myers still has, at 50, the lope of a teenage boy. He recites Emerson
and Wordsworth, never wears a watch and stopped eating meat and hunting
years ago because, he said, "It no longer pleased my imagination to kill
things."</TE>
<TE>   He and his small group--the administrative staff can be counted on one
hand--don't always succeed. Last year, they withdrew from attempts to
protect the Owens Valley by buying development rights from the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power after Inyo County ranchers and
supervisors balked. Locals were suspicious of an outside environmental
group as well as the concept of a conservation easement.</TE>
<TE>   But Wildlands Conservancy very much got what it wanted in the Mojave
Desert--in good part because the organization provided much of the
funding, no strings attached.</TE>
<TE>   While conservancy groups commonly negotiate land deals and provide
money up front, they often are largely reimbursed by the government or
another entity taking over the property.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlands Conservancy poured a fortune into the Mojave purchase with
no expectations of a payback. It could do so because its donors valued
the boundless, unadorned essence of one of the most American of
landscapes--the Southern California desert.</TE>
<TE>   Though the group gets some foundation grants, much of its money comes
from anonymous individuals interested in a particular project. As a
nonprofit, the conservancy is not obligated to disclose the identity of
major donors. And it doesn't. Myers said in some cases he works through
attorneys, signs confidentiality agreements and doesn't know who the
benefactors are. In other cases he does know, but the donors shun
publicity.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to pick and choose how they donate their money," Myers
explained. "They don't want the world knocking on their front door. They
don't want the recognition associated with wealth."</TE>
<TE>   The Wildlands Conservancy staff, which includes a financial officer,
outdoor education naturalists and a few preserve rangers, doesn't much
like the spotlight either.</TE>
<TE>   "They just like to be in the background," Eubanks said. "I don't get
the impression they're trying to make a name for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   As vice president of Catellus Development Corp.--the owner of the
desert land--John Bezzant for years has negotiated with Myers, whom he
describes as "straightforward, humble, genuine. He doesn't play games.
He's not manipulative."</TE>
<TE>   Myers grew up in La Habra, exploring the Chino Hills and spending part
of his summers in the Sierra Nevada. When he was 17, he hiked the John
Muir Trail. When he was 19, he ran a ranch in the Great Basin.</TE>
<TE>   He studied botany, religion, psychology and literature in college, but
never got a degree. "I just wanted to learn," he said. "I wanted to learn
how to deal with my despair about seeing all the places I loved
destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   Then he started trying to save them. He formed a nonprofit to raise
money for the creation of Chino Hills State Park, selling his house and
woodworking business to get cash for the cause. He is uncomfortable
discussing the amount, saying it was modest and that he was just one of
several who made sacrifices for the park project.</TE>
<TE>Skilled at Bargaining</TE>
<TE>   Believing material things can be a burden, he used to give away his
possessions every two years. In 1995, he founded Wildlands Conservancy
with four others, one of whom, David Gelbaum, remains on the board. Other
current board members include Sierra Club director Carl Pope and Ed
Hastey, retired director of the BLM in California.</TE>
<TE>   It would be a mistake to dismiss Myers as a dreamy tree-hugger. Under
his guidance, Wildlands Conservancy is intensely focused and skilled at
bargaining with the big boys.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't let their emotions dictate their sense of what a good and
bad deal is," said Steven McCormick, who headed the Nature Conservancy in
California for 16 years and is now that organization's national
president. The Nature Conservancy, probably the country's best known land
preservation group, helped Wildlands Conservancy in 1996 with the San
Emigdio Ranch purchase, one of its first big deals.</TE>
<TE>   A developer who planned a new town on part of the ranch had defaulted,
and the oil company holding the note was well into sales talks with
another potential buyer when Wildlands Conservancy appeared on the scene.</TE>
<TE>Group Outbid Mormon Church</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Farm Management Co. of Salt Lake City, an agriculture firm
owned by the Mormon Church, thought it had the deal sewn up.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a handshake and had begun title work," said Farm Management
President John Creer. "We had concluded it was something that would serve
our purposes, and then it vaporized."</TE>
<TE>   After getting the ear of oil company executives with the help of the
Nature Conservancy, Wildlands Conservancy outbid Farm Management and
bought the property.</TE>
<TE>   Myers' group, which wanted the ranch for its ecological diversity,
rich wildlife and common boundary with Los Padres National Forest, now
operates it as a preserve called Wind Wolves.</TE>
<TE>   There is still cattle grazing--to keep nonnative grasses from choking
out wildflowers and native plants. But there also are a few score tule
elk, introduced several years ago, scads of blacktailed deer, bobcats,
golden eagles and busloads of Central Valley schoolchildren attending
outdoor education programs.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, the conservancy plans to open the preserve to the
public on weekends for hiking, camping and wildlife watching.</TE>
<TE>   The Mojave land deal has been far more complicated, stretching on for
years in several phases, the third of which is due to close within
months. The desert tracts are part of the land-grant legacy of the rail
empires, alternating square-mile parcels given by the federal government
to the railroads in the mid-1800s as enticements to lay tracks and
promote settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM long had its eye on the hundreds of thousands of acres of
railroad land scattered across its Mojave holdings like Swiss cheese
holes. But, said Hastey, who joined the Wildlands Conservancy board after
retiring, the agency couldn't drum up enough money to buy the land. Nor
did it have the kind of property that would have drawn Catellus into a
major land swap.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Catellus--a modern offshoot of the real estate arms of
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe railroads--started marketing its desert
property, sending shivers down the spines of environmentalists when it
erected big "For Sale" signs on holdings within the newly created Mojave
National Preserve, southeast of Baker.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlands Conservancy, which had watched Catellus sell parcels for
development near its Oak Glen headquarters, perked up. An anonymous donor
offered millions. Wildlands Conservancy signed options with Catellus and
sat down at the bargaining table. Other environmental groups lined up to
lobby for federal funding.</TE>
<TE>   When the third phase of the deal closes, the federal government will
have acquired 505,000 acres of the Mojave that it gave away more than a
century ago. Most is going to the BLM, the rest to the National Park
Service. Catellus is getting $53 million for the land, $35 million of
which came from donors to Wildlands Conservancy. The rest came from the
federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, Wildlands Conservancy gave the Department of the
Interior 26,000 acres of private holdings it bought in Joshua Tree
National Park and BLM wilderness areas. It helped the BLM with two land
exchanges and recently obtained $6 million in donor pledges to fund a
fourth phase of Catellus acquisitions, involving 77,000 acres in Imperial
County.</TE>
<TE>   All told, that's nearly 1,000 square miles.</TE>
<TE>   "A big project takes on a life of its own," Myers said. "If you have a
big vision, it really speaks to people's hopes and dreams."</TE>

<HD>Israel Takes Back Assent to U.N.'s Jenin Probe</HD>
<DH>Delay: Officials say they want more time to consult on delegates.
Security Council calls for quick compliance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>The Israeli government abruptly withdrew permission Tuesday for a
United Nations fact-finding mission to probe its military operations at
the Jenin refugee camp, the site of widespread fighting and destruction
during its just-ended West Bank offensive.</LD>
<LD>   Israel's move, which delayed but did not kill the probe outright,
represented an attempt to maintain a narrow scope to the investigation,
Israeli officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon consulted late Tuesday with aides on
whether to cooperate with the probe, sponsored by U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, who picked three senior humanitarian experts to serve on the
panel scheduled to arrive Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "The composition of the delegation is bad for Israel," a government
official said late Tuesday after Sharon concluded his deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   The official said the government decided the members were overly
political and might be biased in favor of the Palestinians. Israel wants
delegates with military expertise, the official said, and had expected to
be consulted on the choices.</TE>
<TE>   At U.N. headquarters in New York, however, the Security Council held
an emergency meeting Tuesday night and issued a statement afterward
saying it expected "fast implementation" of a resolution welcoming the
mission and Israel's "full cooperation" with the secretary-general and
the team.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Foreign Ministry legal advisor Alan Baker told reporters that
Israel had asked for a delay in the team's arrival so that "new terms of
reference" could be negotiated with the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Complaining that the delegation had been "imposed on us," Baker said
Israel became alarmed that Annan seemed intent on expanding the mandate
of the group and the breadth of its eventual conclusions beyond the Jenin
case and into the wider question of the humanitarian conditions of the
Palestinian people.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Sharon's Cabinet secretary, Gideon Saar, had hinted that
Israel would not cooperate with the probe and would block the team's
access to the refugee camp if it believed that the mission was
overstepping narrowly defined bounds.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians claim that Israeli troops perpetrated a massacre at
Jenin, with several hundred people killed, many when their homes were
flattened by armored Israeli bulldozers. Israeli officials vehemently
deny the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   Journalists have not uncovered evidence to support the Palestinian
claims, but Israel muddied the waters by refusing for days to allow
access to the site for Red Cross, human rights and rescue workers.</TE>
<TE>   Israel maintains that no more than 100 Palestinians died during the
10-day incursion and that most were fighters. About 40 bodies have been
recovered, almost all of them of men. Twenty-three Israeli soldiers were
killed as camp militants booby-trapped buildings with explosives and
offered tough resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Because so many unanswered questions swirl around the Jenin operation,
the U.N. mission has been widely looked to as a forum for separating
unsupported allegation from fact. From the start, however, Israel was
nervous that the team would be stacked against it.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's relations with the U.N., which it often views as
pro-Palestinian, have always been spotty.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. delegation includes Martti Ahtisaari, a former president of
Finland; Cornelio Sommaruga, former president of the International
Committee of the Red Cross; and Sadako Ogata, the former U.N. high
commissioner for refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Answering one of Israel's complaints, Ahtisaari added to the team a
U.S. military advisor, retired Army Maj. Gen. William Nash, who led
American troops in the Persian Gulf War and Bosnia-Herzegovina.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy over what happened at Jenin is only one of the murky
legacies of Israel's West Bank invasion. Another is what many Israelis
and Palestinians see as a serious security vacuum.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, with Palestinian security services left a shambles by the
offensive, Palestinian vigilantes imposed a grisly brand of street
justice for the second time in as many days Tuesday when alleged
collaborators with Israel were slain in public.</TE>
<TE>   The killings reflected both the vengeful fury in the wake of Israel's
massive incursion and a growing lawlessness that feeds on the absence of
police forces either destroyed by Israeli attacks or dedicated to
attacking Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Masked Palestinian gunmen hauled three alleged collaborators from a
prison in the West Bank city of Hebron and shot them, then strung up one
of the bodies, bloodied and battered, from a utility pole while a mob
looked on, witnesses said. Two of the bodies were shown in television
footage with their hands bound behind their backs. Members of the crowd
stomped or spat on the bodies as they were dragged through the streets.</TE>
<TE>   One of the masked men, fleeing the scene in a car loaded with his
comrades, paused to proclaim to journalists that there was "a lot of
filth around that we have to clean up."</TE>
<TE>   They were acting at least in part to avenge the deaths of two
militants killed by Israel in a helicopter missile strike the night
before.</TE>
<TE>   The Hebron killings followed a similar shooting Monday of three
Palestinian men, also accused of aiding Israel, who were pulled from a
taxi and attacked by a mob in the West Bank city of Ramallah. One died of
his wounds.</TE>
<TE>   There is a long history in the Palestinian territories of killing
suspected collaborators with Israel. During the first Palestinian
uprising, from 1987 to 1993, hundreds of alleged informants were reported
killed. The practice picked up again after the start of the current
conflict in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians fear that, with so much of the Palestinian security
apparatus destroyed by the Israeli offensive, more cases will follow of
vigilante justice and the settling of old scores, adding to a general
lawlessness.</TE>

<HD>Two Sides Try to Resolve Siege at Nativity Church</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Meetings yield no agreement, but Israel is reportedly
studying a proposal to send wanted Palestinians to Gaza. Three men flee
complex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>With tensions reaching a critical point at the Church of the
Nativity, Israelis and Palestinians met for the first time Tuesday to
resolve the 3-week-old standoff here at one of Christianity's most
revered sites.</LD>
<LD>   Two meetings Tuesday produced no agreement on ending the siege at the
site traditionally held to be Jesus' birthplace, but both sides said
talks would continue today.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian negotiators proposed transferring to the Gaza Strip an
estimated 20 to 30 armed men who are wanted by Israel and holed up in the
church. The Israeli government, which has insisted that the men face
justice in Israel or be deported, was considering the proposal,
Palestinians said.</LD>
<TE>   The meeting came after several Palestinians went on a rampage in the
complex in a desperate search for food. Israeli soldiers around the
sacred compound spotted at least two groups of armed men on the roof.</TE>
<TE>   "It was positive and constructive, but the results were not great,"
said Salah Tamari, a local Palestinian councilman who is helping
coordinate the negotiations. "They are suggesting exile to another
country, which we adamantly reject." The two sides did agree to allow
four ailing people out for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military officials could not be reached for comment late
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>Food Deliveries Have Been Restricted</TE>
<TE>   More than 140 Palestinians sought refuge in the church when Israeli
troops moved into Bethlehem on April 2. About 80 priests, nuns and monks
were trapped inside with the Palestinians, some of whom Israel has
accused of being members of militant groups such as Hamas and the Al Aqsa
Martyrs Brigade.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Israelis have restricted food deliveries to the church
compound, which is shared by several Christian faiths. Electrical and
water service has been haphazard.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, disagreements have mounted in recent days among different
factions of the Palestinians, according to Israeli military officials and
those who have recently escaped from the church. Some of them are seeking
to leave the site, while others insist that they remain inside.</TE>
<TE>   Growing medical problems and the lack of food drove five men to flee
the compound late Sunday. Two of those men, speaking to The Times after
their release from Israeli custody late Tuesday, described an atmosphere
of fear and dissension in the church.</TE>
<TE>   Fayez Dibs, a 23-year-old Palestinian naval police officer, said the
church had been significantly damaged. He said Israeli snipers have
shattered windows and pockmarked the inside walls with bullet holes.
Grenades thrown inside set off two fires.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that members of different branches of Palestinian
security forces had begun squabbling as the small rations of food and
constant harassment by the Israeli army take their toll.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is tense now," Dibs said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most visible signs of the deteriorating situation came the
day Dibs escaped, when several Palestinians stormed into the Armenian
Orthodox monastery that abuts the church, breaking down doors in a search
for food.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday morning, Israeli soldiers heard a bell ringing from the
monastery. There, they saw three men holding a sign on a balcony: "Please
help," it said in English, according to an army commander.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli soldiers approached the men via a route that the troops had
been using to smuggle food to the monastery, which has remained largely
isolated from the Palestinians inside the main church, the commander
said.</TE>
<TE>   Three men--two priests and a church worker--then sneaked out, the
commander said. The men said they were in a state of shock after the
Palestinian incursion into the monastery.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians stole a gold neck chain worn by one of the priests
and broke down a door, said the army commander, who declined to give his
name. The Israeli army offered to make the priests available for
questioning but later said they were too exhausted from their ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   "They were not so well" when they came out, the commander said. "They
were shocked."</TE>
<TE>   The state of the religious workers in the church compound has remained
one of the most confused and delicate questions of the siege. Israeli
officials have said they are being held hostage. The Armenian priests,
the Israeli commander said, confirmed that version Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But those inside the compound have denied that they are being held as
prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here of our own free will, to protect the holy places," said
Father Parthenus, a Greek Orthodox priest, in a phone interview from
inside the church late Monday.</TE>
<TE>Israeli Snipers Watch Over Complex</TE>
<TE>   The clashes at the church compound have been matched by battles
outside it. On Tuesday, the Israeli army took reporters on a guided tour
of Bethlehem, using a bulletproof bus with Day-Glo upholstery.</TE>
<TE>   Escorted by two modified U.S.-made Patton tanks and an armored
personnel carrier, the bus traveled to a construction site only a few
hundred yards east of the church, which sits on a hill overlooking
Bethlehem's dun-colored apartment buildings and nearby valleys.</TE>
<TE>   Inside a half-built, four-story building, a team of snipers watched
through binoculars and a scope, searching for armed men. Downstairs, two
young soldiers remotely maneuvered a small blimp equipped with a video
camera, which was hovering over the church.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Israeli government has insisted that its troops will not
shoot at the church itself, army officials said the policy was to shoot
at any armed men who appeared, or at those who run outside and refuse to
stop for commands.</TE>
<TE>   "We are shooting at armed people in the church," said Lt. Col. David
Baruch, a reservist with the 310th Brigade who has been in charge of
operations in Bethlehem for the past month. "If there is no gun, there is
no shooting."</TE>
<TE>   Around noon, the soldiers on the lower floor reported seeing two
groups of five men each run across the roof of a building next to the
church. Gunfire rang out in the distance, its source unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, an Israeli sniper swung into action, scanning nearby
buildings. The men quickly disappeared, and the sniper fired no shots.</TE>
<TE>   The sniper, 30-year-old reservist Stephan Dore, said he had killed two
men since beginning his tour a month ago. He sat behind light camouflage
netting in the unfinished concrete building, surrounded by spent
7.62-millimeter shells, old cans of rations and a propane stove.</TE>
<TE>   He said that each shot was "well considered."</TE>
<TE>   "We came here with high morale, with the aim to finish the job as fast
as possible without harming any civilians," said Dore, who owns a door
factory. "We're simply fighting for our homes here."</TE>

<HD>German Raid Targets Islamic Group</HD>
<DH>Europe: Police arrest 11 suspected militants. Prosecutors say group
falsified passports and recruited fighters for a 'worldwide jihad.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>Police arrested 11 suspected Islamic militants in raids across
Germany on Tuesday, executing a crackdown on what authorities described
as an extremist brotherhood active in Europe that recruits, trains and
bankrolls fighters for a worldwide holy war.</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutor Kay Nehm's announcement of a sweep against the
Sunni Muslim and Palestinian movement known as Al Tawhid, or the Divine
Unity, made no immediate claims of a connection to Osama bin Laden's
terrorist empire or the suicide hijackers thought to have plotted the
Sept. 11 U.S. attacks from Hamburg, in northern Germany.</LD>
<LD>   But Nehm emphasized that the investigation has just begun into the
computer records, forged documents and other evidence seized in searches
of 19 sites in Berlin, the industrialized Ruhr River area and several
cities in the southern state of Bavaria. His description of the group's
operations evoked comparisons to those purportedly used by the Hamburg
terror suspects and their accomplices, who were reportedly part of an
international network of Bin Laden foot soldiers providing military
training, refuge and falsified documents to those wanting to attack
Western targets.</LD>
<TE>   The move against Al Tawhid, which is said to be headed by a
36-year-old Palestinian living in Essen, Germany, coincides with
Germany's first prosecution of terror suspects in recent years. Five
Algerians accused of plotting an attack in Strasbourg, France, are now on
trial in Frankfurt.</TE>
<TE>   The Frankfurt defendants deny any connection with Al Qaeda. But one of
the accused's testimony Tuesday provided a window into the pockets of
extremism that thrive in democratic European countries committed to broad
individual freedoms.</TE>
<TE>   German authorities have arrested only one man in connection with the
Sept. 11 attacks, a young Moroccan thought to be a peripheral figure in
the Hamburg cell. In a sign that Germans plan to stick by their respect
for civil liberties, investigators conceded that some of the 11 Al Tawhid
suspects could be released unless police uncover more incriminating
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   But the coordinated raids on Al Tawhid--along with Interior Minister
Otto Schily's insistence on an aggressive investigation of an April 11
attack on a Tunisian synagogue that killed 11 German tourists--indicate
that authorities here are taking more concerted action against suspected
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's arrests followed months of surveillance of the alleged
Palestinian ringleader and his contacts, ARD television reported, citing
unnamed sources involved in the investigation. The news report also said
that several of those arrested had undergone military training in
Afghanistan during the rule of the Taliban, a fundamentalist movement
allied with Bin Laden--as had members of the Hamburg group accused in the
Sept. 11 hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Tawhid members were involved in falsifying passports and other
documents, gathering and distributing donations, and recruiting fighters
for "a worldwide jihad of all brothers in faith," Nehm said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities moved to break up the group when they concluded that its
members were planning attacks in Germany, the prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's session of the Algerians' trial in Frankfurt, 26-year-old
Aeurobui Beandali said in a statement read by his lawyers that he had
helped plan a bomb attack on a synagogue in Strasbourg early last year.
But Beandali denied any connection between his group and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The attack, never carried out, was intended to damage French-Israeli
relations rather than hurt innocent bystanders, he insisted in a contrite
account of his deeds. The bombing was to be staged after Sabbath services
on a Saturday in January or February 2001, and a videotape of the damaged
building was to be sent to French TV stations. Beandali said the group's
aim was to avenge what the members see as French support for Algerian
government repression of Islamic fundamentalists.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say that the five defendants were associated with Al Qaeda
and that the group's attack was to have taken place in the crowded
Christmas market outside Strasbourg's cathedral in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Beandali, who admitted that he spent a year in Afghanistan and
Pakistan before becoming involved in the Strasbourg plot, expressed
sympathy for the Sept. 11 victims and called the date "a dark day in the
history of the Islamic world."</TE>
<TE>   "The death of innocents such as those in America is just as bad as
those of innocents in Palestine or Algeria," he said in his statement.</TE>
<TE>   Beandali and three others are charged with belonging to a terrorist
organization and conspiracy to commit murder, which carry sentences of up
to 10 years. A fifth suspect is accused only of the lesser offense of
belonging to a terrorist group. The trial is expected to last as long as
a year.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's testimony by Beandali followed the German government's
confirmation Monday that the April 11 explosion of a gas-laden truck at a
synagogue on the Tunisian resort island of Djerba was deliberate. In
addition to the 11 Germans, five others were killed in the blast. It was
deemed "a tragic accident" by Tunisian authorities until Schily objected
to what Berlin considered a premature ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Schily, an attorney who defended Red Army Faction terrorism suspects
in the 1970s and '80s, traveled to Tunis and Djerba last weekend for a
firsthand investigation.</TE>

<HD>Spain Holds Alleged Terrorist Financier</HD>
<DH>Europe: The Syrian-born man's arrest advances an inquiry into a
suspected Al Qaeda cell believed to have had a role in the Sept. 11
attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADRID
</DL>
<LD>Spanish police arrested a suspected terrorist financier Tuesday who
is accused of funneling money from Madrid to Al Qaeda operatives around
the world, including close associates of the Hamburg, Germany, cell that
allegedly carried out the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest of Mohammed Galeb Kalaje Zouaydi, a Syrian-born Spaniard,
advanced the complex investigation of a suspected Al Qaeda cell in Spain
that allegedly played a support role in the attacks on the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Zouaydi allegedly used front companies involved in construction and
real estate to send funds to "the closest inner circle" in Hamburg of
Mohamed Atta, the suspected leader of the Sept. 11 hijackers, the Spanish
Interior Ministry said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   "He was responsible for the business structure that financed from
Spain the network of [Osama] bin Laden in various countries," the
statement said.</TE>
<TE>   Police have detected about $2.2 million that Zouaydi allegedly
channeled to suspected Islamic extremists in Germany, the United States,
Belgium, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, China, Jordan, Syria and the Palestinian
territories, according to a senior Spanish law enforcement official.
Investigators suspect that some of the money financed the activities of
Atta and his Hamburg associates, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish police are also investigating suspected ties between Atta and
an alleged recipient of the money, a Hamburg-based Syrian whose bank
accounts were frozen at the request of U.S. officials after Sept. 11.
Police are pursuing leads that Mamoun Darkazanli traveled to Spain last
summer at the same time as Atta, according to the senior Spanish law
enforcement official.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are convinced that Atta's visit to Spain in July was a
key step in the preparation of the attacks. They believe that Atta met
with other suspected Al Qaeda terrorists to coordinate the hijacking
attacks and other plots.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also believe that the suspected visit of Darkazanli, who
remains free in Germany and denies any ties to terrorism, could be an
important piece of the investigation, the senior law enforcement official
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He may have been in Spain at that time," the official said. "We are
looking into that. We are also putting together the puzzle of how the
financing worked around the world."</TE>
<TE>   Zouaydi was arrested in November along with his associate Imad Eddin
Barakat Yarkas, the alleged boss of a Madrid cell that had been under
surveillance since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   But Zouaydi was not among the eight suspects jailed then by Spain's
best-known investigative magistrate, Judge Baltasar Garzon, as suspected
accomplices in the Sept. 11 plot. Most of the eight are well-educated
middle-class Syrian immigrants with Spanish citizenship who are married
to Spaniards.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish and U.S. investigators consider Barakat a top Al Qaeda figure
in Europe and a possible planner of the hijackings. Barakat allegedly
discussed the attacks in code during wiretapped phone conversations in
August, and his phone number was found in Atta's former Hamburg
apartment, according to an indictment filed by Garzon, who also led
Tuesday's police operation.</TE>
<TE>   Even though police initially released Zouaydi, he remained a target of
their inquiry into the movement of funds to nongovernmental
organizations, Koranic schools and other suspected fronts, the senior
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the money went to extremists linked to the Al Qaeda network,
but some funds also went to the militant Palestinian group Hamas,
according to the official.</TE>
<TE>   Police released a video of the arrest of Zouaydi, who wore a dapper
business suit, a neat gray beard and glasses.</TE>
<TE>   "He's accused of financing the Al Qaeda network in Spain, but from
what I've read in the case file, there's nothing to support what they
say," said Zouaydi's lawyer, Maria de los Angeles Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest is also likely to increase scrutiny of Darkazanli, whom
Garzon described in December as a close associate of Barakat. Despite
intense interest predating Sept. 11, German authorities have said they do
not have enough evidence to arrest Darkazanli. The Spanish Interior
Ministry accused him Tuesday of belonging to Atta's "inner circle" and
being a top figure in Barakat's cell.</TE>

<HD>Gaza Strip Residents Bracing for Israel's Next Move</HD>
<DH>Conflict: It's unclear whether they will be targeted, but
Palestinians are digging bunkers and stockpiling food. Radicals seek more
suicide attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GAZA CITY
</DL>
<LD>With the first phase of Israel's campaign against Palestinian
militants over, residents of the Gaza Strip are stockpiling food and
digging fortifications in the belief that they are next. It is a prospect
that militants, but certainly not ordinary citizens, relish.</LD>
<LD>   "Militants are waving red flags like Spanish matadors, saying, 'Come
on over the line,' " said Raji Sourani, director of the Palestinian
Center for Human Rights. "They're disappointed Israel hasn't taken the
bait yet. Of course, people here are nuts. Why? Because they have
nothing. So they have nothing to lose."</LD>
<LD>   Answering the call of the radical group Islamic Jihad, hundreds of
young men, jobless and aimless, gathered on a recent night in a
litter-strewn parking lot while men with loudspeakers denounced Israel
and the United States and extolled the virtues of dying in the struggle
for a Palestinian state.</LD>
<TE>   The crowd had come out of the refugee camps and seedy Gaza
neighborhoods to watch a home video of two young Palestinians, Mohammed
Irheem and Salem Hasouna, training for an attack on a Jewish settlement
from which they knew they would not return. (They didn't.)</TE>
<TE>   Boys no more than 7 or 8 years old scurried to the front of the throng
for a better view of the TV monitors set up in the lot. Older boys
watched in passive silence, occasionally giving each other an approving
nod.</TE>
<TE>   Theirs were the faces of tomorrow's suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   How many would be willing to blow themselves up? "I'd say 80, maybe
90%," said Abdel Braraa, 26, a member of Islamic Jihad who carried a
rifle and wore a black stocking mask to hide his identity from possible
collaborators with Israel. "The martyrs on the video are heroes to them."</TE>
<TE>   In the streets nearby, the preparations for war were reminiscent of
what was seen in Fakhani, Beirut's Palestinian quarter, during Israel's
invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Ten-foot-high piles of earth formed
barricades at intersections. Parapets of dirt-filled rice bags stood at
street corners. Shelves of small grocery shops were emptied of bottled
water and flour as families stocked up on essentials. Bunkers were being
dug in some refugee camps, and the number of guns in evidence seemed
extraordinarily high.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the readiness for war, the Palestinian Authority is
transferring as many documents as possible to computer disks, aware that
in Beirut and, this month, the West Bank, Israeli soldiers destroyed
everything from scholastic records to civil service payroll data. Key
computers have been moved to unannounced locations and secondary
communications lines set up, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Authority ministries are holding first-aid classes, and 70
women have been trained as midwives in case expectant mothers can't get
to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "If [Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon can continue his war while
[Secretary of State Colin L.] Powell is in Jerusalem, what's to stop him
from coming to Gaza?" asked Jihad Wazir, the Palestinian Authority's
deputy minister of planning. "Militarily, we know it would be no contest,
but Palestinians have always offered resistance, never compliance. Just
by surviving we win."</TE>
<TE>   Hamas, an organization that has long recruited suicide bombers and
carried out scores of attacks in Israel, has threatened to unleash
hundreds of "martyrs" on the Jewish state in retaliation for the West
Bank campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Abdulaziz Rantisi, one of Hamas' senior leaders, received a visitor in
his home the other evening before attending the rally to fire up the
young crowd with praise for volunteer bombers. There was a bullet hole in
his front door and a video camera overhead to monitor who came and went.</TE>
<TE>   "We have found the bombings are a simple means, one of our most
effective, of making Israel pay for its aggression," he said. Of the fact
that most victims are civilians, he said: "We only target soldiers. But
all Israelis are soldiers, even if they wear civilian uniforms. They are
occupiers."</TE>
<TE>   On whether Hamas wants to destroy Israel, he answered indirectly: "We
want one Palestine here where Muslims, Christians and Jews live side by
side."</TE>
<TE>   Despite war preparations, it is far from certain that Gaza is Israel's
next target, because the Palestinians here are already separated from
Israel by a fence and isolated from the world after Israeli tanks and
bulldozers destroyed the runway of the Gaza Strip airport. As proof that
the policy of isolation is working, Israeli officials point out that none
of the recent suicide bombers inside Israel launched their attacks from
Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   "The talk of wanting war with Israel is an emotional feeling not based
on rational thinking," said Salah Abdel Shafi, an independent business
consultant. "Unfortunately, what's happened in the present atmosphere is
that the many reasonable voices here aren't being heard.</TE>
<TE>   "Like many others, I've spoken out openly against the suicide bombings
as vile, immoral and very damaging to the Palestinian image in the world.
But one of our shortcomings is that we've never addressed our message to
the Israeli public. We've never convinced them [that] the majority of us
accept the existence of Israel. Nor have our leaders delivered the
message that all this isn't about destroying Israel. It's about getting
our rights."</TE>
<TE>   Although the blockade of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip has enhanced
Israel's security, it does so to the detriment of hopes for peaceful
coexistence and of Palestinians' desire to escape poverty and
statelessness, which is at the core of the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza Strip--25 miles long and as little as 4 miles wide--42% of
the land is set aside for about 5,000 Jews, many of them Israeli
Americans, guarded by 15,000 soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the land is used by 1.3 million Palestinians, half jammed
into eight refugee settlements that constitute some of the world's most
densely populated communities. More than 80% of Gaza's Palestinians live
in poverty, 65% are unemployed, and 60% of the children need psychiatric
counseling, according to United Nations and Palestinian surveys.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as the late 1980s, 130,000 Gaza Palestinians crossed into
Israel as day workers, bringing home $2 million daily. As troubles
increased, Israel cut back on the numbers. Now none cross. The border has
become a fortified wasteland, and Israeli soldiers are stringing more
barbed wire around their positions.</TE>
<TE>   "My best friend made a lot of money, built a nice house, doing
business in Israel," journalist Abed Salam said. "With the border closed,
he lost everything. He's back in a refugee camp, with no money to even
buy a pack of cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to see him the other day, and he said, 'Abed, do you know
where I can find out about being a suicide bomber?' When people start
thinking like that, so they can get money to take care of their wife and
children with the payment bombers' families get, you know we've reached
desperation levels."</TE>

<LD>Six Serbs indicted for war crimes, including three who were close
to former President Slobodan Milosevic, will surrender to a United
Nations court in The Hague, the Yugoslav government announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   If the six go to the war crimes tribunal voluntarily, as they have
promised, they will be the first major Serbian suspects to face the court
since the messy arrest and extradition of the former Yugoslav president
last year.</LD>
<LD>   "These people are definitely the most important indictees who are
believed to be on Yugoslav territory, and their surrender should be seen
as proof of Yugoslavia's full cooperation with the Hague tribunal,"
Interior Minister Zoran Zivkovic said.</LD>
<TE>   The first of the indictees is expected to travel to The Hague this
week and the others in the next two to three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The government has a list of 23 Serbs indicted for war crimes that
took place in the 1990s during conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia
and the Yugoslav province of Kosovo. Officials have pledged to arrest
those in Yugoslavia who do not agree to go voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   At least one of the most wanted indictees, former Bosnian Serb leader
Radovan Karadzic, is believed to be in Bosnia. The whereabouts of another
Bosnian Serb wartime leader, former Gen. Ratko Mladic, is not known.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement of the six indictees' agreement to surrender seemed
to mark a turning point for the Yugoslav government in cooperating with
the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and
presenting the issue to the Serbian public.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, politicians have jockeyed over how to avoid blame for
complying with The Hague's orders, and there have been constant fears of
a backlash among Yugoslav citizens. However, the adoption of a law this
month to permit the arrests and extradition appears to have helped defuse
the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a major marker for the government. The fact that a law was
adopted shows that there is a consensus among politicians to cooperate.
It is no longer something that has to be done under cover of darkness,"
said Ljiljana Smajlovic, a political analyst in Belgrade, the capital of
both Yugoslavia and its main republic, Serbia. "It shows we are able to
behave like a normal country."</TE>
<TE>   However, it was not clear that the announcement would be enough to
secure the release of more than $40 million in aid that the United States
froze when the Yugoslav government failed to meet a March 31 deadline for
complying with the court.</TE>
<TE>   It is all but certain that the money will remain frozen until the
majority of the 23 indictees are transferred to The Hague and there is
some commitment to open significant government archives to the tribunal,
a diplomat said. The United States is supportive of the reform-oriented
government in Belgrade but wants to see "concrete action," said the
diplomat, who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that
the U.S. welcomed the announcement but that Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell had not decided whether to free up the aid.</TE>
<TE>   The six indictees include at least two who probably have information
that would be important to Hague prosecutors in the ongoing trial of
Milosevic. They are former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic
and former army chief Dragoljub Ojdanic.</TE>
<TE>   Both were indicted along with Milosevic and are accused of crimes
against humanity in Kosovo, the majority ethnic Albanian province of
Serbia. Thousands of ethnic Albanians were killed and about 800,000 fled
their homes during the 1998-99 Yugoslav campaign against separatist
rebels. The province is now under United Nations control.</TE>
<TE>   Sainovic was widely viewed as a key Milosevic aide, while Ojdanic was
at the top of the army chain of command that executed Yugoslav and
Serbian policies in the province. Another indictee in the same case,
former Interior Minister Vlajko Stojiljkovic, killed himself this month.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sainovic rarely made public appearances, he was Milosevic's
point man on Kosovo, often going to the province to direct the activities
of troops and paramilitary forces. A videotape leaked to the media in
1999 suggests that he was in direct contact with Serbian officers at the
time they slaughtered more than 45 ethnic Albanians in the village of
Racak that year.</TE>
<TE>   In a radio interview this week, Ojdanic made it clear that he did not
believe that he was guilty of any crime and said he was going to The
Hague "to defend the honor of the army, the state and the people, and in
that way defend my innocence."</TE>
<TE>   Also prepared to go voluntarily is Milan Martic, a leader of ethnic
Serbs in Croatia who rebelled when the country seceded from Yugoslavia in
1991. As Croatian forces regained rebel-held territories, Martic
allegedly ordered retaliatory missile fire against the Croatian capital,
Zagreb, killing seven civilians and injuring 20.</TE>
<TE>   Martic, a police inspector who rose to become the wartime leader of an
area that is now part of Croatia, was in close contact with Milosevic and
was in charge of ethnic Serb troops in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The three others who have agreed to surrender are Mile Mrksic,
Vladimir Kovacevic and Momcilo Gruban. Mrksic is one of three former army
officers accused of the killing of at least 198 men and two women after
the fall of the Croatian town of Vukovar in 1991, widely viewed as the
first major atrocity of that war. Subsequently, he commanded elite
Yugoslav army troops on special missions in Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   Kovacevic is accused of murder and attacks on civilians in the 1991
shelling of the Croatian port of Dubrovnik.</TE>
<TE>   Gruban, a Bosnian Serb, is accused of 1992 atrocities at the notorious
Omarska prison camp near the Bosnian town of Prijedor. The camp was one
of several where Muslims captured by Serbs were starved, beaten, sexually
abused and tortured.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said arrest warrants will be sent to the district court in
Belgrade today for those who did not tell the government by midnight
Tuesday that they would surrender. Those who give themselves up will have
the costs of transport to The Hague for themselves and their lawyers paid
for. More important, the government will act as a guarantor that the
indictees will appear for their trials if, after they enter a plea, the
tribunal allows them to return to Yugoslavia to prepare their defenses.</TE>
<TE>   For many Serbs, the hope is that the issue can now be left behind, but
the wounds were deep and there is still unfinished business from the
point of view of Western countries and the tribunal. Prosecutor Carla Del
Ponte has been pushing hard to bring Karadzic and Mladic to justice.</TE>
<TE>   "None of these guys who is saying he will go voluntarily is really a
popular person who is seen as a symbol of Serbia," said Stojan Cerovic, a
columnist for Vreme, a weekly newsmagazine. "It's not going to create a
political problem that they are going, but it's not going to help for any
reconciliation and healing of wounds. For something like that, you need
something much bigger than a trial. . . . Maybe you need the next
generation."</TE>

<HD>Uruguay Cuts Diplomatic Ties to Cuba</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay
</DL>
<LD>Uruguay's president announced Tuesday that his country was severing
diplomatic ties with Cuba, days after Uruguay sponsored a U.N. human
rights vote targeting Fidel Castro's government.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise announcement by President Jorge Batlle came as the
Uruguayan leader charged Cuba with a series of insults against this South
American nation.</LD>
<LD>   Cuban President Fidel Castro, who was speaking live on a government
television program in Havana when the announcement was made,
characterized Batlle as "a lackey."</LD>
<TE>   Uruguay sponsored a resolution targeting Cuba that was passed Friday
by the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva. The vote was 23 to 21,
with nine abstentions.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution invited the Communist country to provide its people
with greater civil and political rights. It also exhorted Cuba to allow a
U.N. representative to visit--an idea Havana rejected. Almost all Latin
American nations on the 53-member commission approved the measure.</TE>
<TE>   Castro seemed unconcerned as he read the story about Uruguay aloud on
air. He said that while Uruguay was breaking ties with Cuba, plans were
underway to vaccinate 300,000 Uruguayan children with meningitis vaccines
donated by Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Castro had referred to Batlle as that "hung-over, abject
Judas who presides over Uruguay."</TE>

<HD>Cuba Tape Casts a Shadow Over Fox's Domestic Agenda</HD>
<DH>Mexico: Battle with Congress will be tougher after release of
recorded conversation with Castro.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>President Vicente Fox will face even greater problems pushing his
stalled domestic agenda through an opposition-dominated Congress after an
embarrassing clash between his government and Cuba, analysts said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Cuba's release Monday of a taped telephone conversation between Fox
and President Fidel Castro shows that the Mexican leader applied pressure
on his Cuban counterpart to depart early from a summit last month in
Mexico to avoid a potentially awkward encounter between the Communist
leader and President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   The tape, roundly criticized as an underhanded ploy by Castro,
nevertheless reveals that Fox was less than candid in his earlier
statements to the Mexican public that Castro had left early of his own
free will.</LD>
<TE>   The tape also suggests that Fox was accommodating the American
president at Castro's expense, which rankled critics of the Mexican
leader's pro-U.S. policies. Fox has achieved little in terms of the
concessions he has sought from the Bush administration on issues such as
immigration and cross-border infrastructure, the critics say.</TE>
<TE>   The tape will put Fox's ambitious legislative agenda in even deeper
jeopardy than it was, facing as he does a divided and increasingly
hostile Congress dominated by the traditionally pro-Cuba Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI. Fox's reform efforts last year largely fell
flat, and the tape incident will make bending Congress to his will even
tougher this year, observers said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another irritant in the relationship between Fox and the PRI,
which makes the PRI less disposed to pass reforms they don't want to pass
anyway," said Pamela K. Starr, professor of political science at the
Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Fox is locked in a power struggle with the PRI, the long-ruling party
that he dislodged from the presidency in 2000. Fox and Congress have been
fighting for powers that previously were held by the PRI, Starr said.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure has been mounting on Fox--both domestically and
internationally--to do something on the reforms he promised as a
candidate. But his efforts have been frustrated in Congress, where his
National Action Party is in the minority.</TE>
<TE>   At issue could be billions of dollars of foreign investment that hinge
on reforms to Mexico's inefficient infrastructure and corruption-prone
judicial system. Only last month, Fox got an earful from U.S. auto
industry executives who warned that he might see investment leave Mexico
unless changes were made.</TE>
<TE>   "As for external damage to Mexico, there isn't any, even if there is a
break in relations with Cuba," said Jose Antonio Crespo, political
analyst at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching here. "But
internally, yes--for the paralysis this will generate for Fox's
initiatives, the difficulties he will have in advancing them."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's changing policy toward Cuba has been a tinderbox. As Fox has
distanced himself from Castro, the PRI and the left-leaning Democratic
Revolution Party, or PRD, have criticized him bitterly, maintaining that
the nation's relationship with Cuba is essential to maintaining Mexico's
independence from U.S. foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   Castro was outraged by Mexico's decision Friday to vote in favor of a
United Nations measure calling on Cuba to allow human rights inspections.
The vote showed Mexico's sea change of attitude under Fox: In past years,
Mexico had abstained from votes critical of Cuba's human rights record.</TE>
<TE>   Now the PRI has even more ammunition with which to fight the Mexican
president's proposals. Though Fox argues that such reforms would boost
the economy, opponents say they would surrender state-owned resources and
services to U.S. corporate control.</TE>
<TE>   "Fox has to dispel the notion that he lied," said Denise Dresser, a
senior fellow at USC's Pacific Council on International Policy. "The
opposition is having a field day with this. It underscores what they have
been saying all along, which is that Mexico has submitted itself to U.S.
wishes."</TE>
<TE>   Opposing legislators, including Sen. Silvia Hernandez of the PRI, took
off the gloves Tuesday. She called on Fox from the floor of Congress'
upper chamber to "return to the path of truth and respect for the
principles that have brought us stability as a nation."</TE>
<TE>   The PRD party president, Rosario Robles, also slammed the nation's
leader, declaring: "President Fox lied to Mexicans. If he lied to his
country on a theme as important as foreign policy, what is happening in
other areas?"</TE>
<TE>   Fox spokeswoman Alicia Buenrostro responded that "keeping silence on
something which has been previously agreed to as private is not lying. It
is honoring a commitment of privacy. Fox spoke to a friend, and Castro
spoke to a tape recorder."</TE>
<TE>   The tape is the latest and ugliest turn of events in the Cuba-Mexico
melodrama, which has been ongoing since Castro abruptly left the U.N.
development summit in Monterrey in a huff last month.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Foreign Minister Jorge Castaneda told a radio reporter Tuesday
that his nation had no plans to cut diplomatic relations or recall its
ambassador.</TE>
<TE>   In a nearly four-hour discourse Tuesday night, Castro railed against
the Fox administration for its policies.</TE>

<LD>Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has ordered an inquiry into the
killings of more than 40 people before and during the military coup that
briefly ousted him and said that those responsible must be punished.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Atty. Gen. Isaias Rodriguez dated Monday, Chavez said
he was willing to cooperate fully with the investigation, which has been
loudly demanded by opponents who blame him and his supporters for some of
the deaths.</LD>
<LD>   The official inquiry would cover the killings of at least a dozen
people by gunmen during an anti-Chavez protest march in the capital,
Caracas, on April 11.</LD>

<HD>Argentina's Finance Minister Steps Down</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES
</DL>
<LD>Argentina's economy minister resigned Tuesday, touching off a new
crisis over how to steer the once-prosperous country out of a deep
financial downturn that has sparked near-daily street protests and
political upheaval.</LD>
<LD>   Jorge Remes Lenicov quit amid increasing opposition to his latest plan
to rescue Argentina from a four-year recession.</LD>
<LD>   Argentine news reports said Alieto Guadagni, a foreign trade
specialist who held posts under former President Carlos Menem, was
offered the job.</LD>
<TE>   The government did not confirm the reports, which came as President
Eduardo Duhalde held emergency meetings with Cabinet officials.</TE>
<TE>   Remes Lenicov was a key figure in the caretaker government of Duhalde,
who took office in January after protests over the state of the economy
forced President Fernando de la Rua out of office.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said Remes Lenicov's exit could mark the beginning of
the end for Duhalde, who is unpopular in polls and under pressure by some
politicians to call elections before his term ends in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Remes Lenicov resigned after Congress delayed a vote on his attempt to
stop a banking collapse by swapping deposits for government bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Remes Lenicov's resignation, which came as hundreds of people
demonstrated outside Congress for a second straight day, sparked renewed
uncertainty about the government's ability to overcome the economic
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters were venting their anger about a banking freeze.</TE>
<TE>   With the peso sharply devaluated and joblessness topping 18%,
Argentina is suffering its worst economic downturn in decades, and angry
citizens hold protests almost every day.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, frightened senators had to be escorted under guard
from Congress.</TE>

<HD>Abuse an 'Appalling Sin' in God's Eyes, Pope Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The text of Pope John Paul II's speech Tuesday to U.S. cardinals
gathered at the Vatican:</LD>
<LD>   Dear Brothers,</LD>
<LD>   Let me assure you first of all that I greatly appreciate the effort
you are making to keep the Holy See, and me personally, informed
regarding the complex and difficult situation which has arisen in your
country in recent months. I am confident that your discussions here will
bear much fruit for the good of the Catholic people of the United States.
You have come to the house of the successor of Peter, whose task it is to
confirm his brother bishops in faith and love, and to unite them around
Christ in the service of God's people. The door of this house is always
open to you. All the more so when your communities are in distress.</LD>
<TE>   Like you, I too have been deeply grieved by the fact that priests and
religious [orders], whose vocation it is to help people live holy lives
in the sight of God, have themselves caused such suffering and scandal to
the young. Because of the great harm done by some priests and religious,
the church herself is viewed with distrust, and many are offended at the
way in which the church's leaders are perceived to have acted in this
matter. The abuse which has caused this crisis is by every standard wrong
and rightly considered a crime by society; it is also an appalling sin in
the eyes of God. To the victims and their families, wherever they may be,
I express my profound sense of solidarity and concern.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that a generalized lack of knowledge of the nature of the
problem and also at times the advice of clinical experts led bishops to
make decisions which subsequent events showed to be wrong. You are now
working to establish more reliable criteria to ensure that such mistakes
are not repeated. At the same time, even while recognizing how
indispensable these criteria are, we cannot forget the power of Christian
conversion, that radical decision to turn away from sin and back to God,
which reaches to the depths of a person's soul and can work extraordinary
change.</TE>
<TE>   Neither should we forget the immense spiritual, human and social good
that the vast majority of priests and religious in the United States have
done and are still doing. The Catholic Church in your country has always
promoted human and Christian values with great vigor and generosity, in a
way that has helped to consolidate all that is noble in the American
people.</TE>
<TE>   A great work of art may be blemished, but its beauty remains; and this
is a truth which any intellectually honest critic will recognize. To the
Catholic communities in the United States, to their pastors and members,
to the men and women religious, to teachers in Catholic universities and
schools, to American missionaries in all parts of the world, go the
wholehearted thanks of the entire Catholic Church and the personal thanks
of the bishop of Rome.</TE>
<TE>   The abuse of the young is a grave symptom of a crisis affecting not
only the church but society as a whole. It is a deep-seated crisis of
sexual morality, even of human relationships, and its prime victims are
the family and the young. In addressing the problem of abuse with clarity
and determination, the church will help society to understand and deal
with the crisis in its midst.</TE>
<TE>   It must be absolutely clear to the Catholic faithful, and to the wider
community, that bishops and superiors are concerned, above all else, with
the spiritual good of souls. People need to know that there is no place
in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young.
They must know that bishops and priests are totally committed to the
fullness of Catholic truth on matters of sexual morality, a truth as
essential to the renewal of the priesthood and the episcopate as it is to
the renewal of marriage and family life.</TE>
<TE>   We must be confident that this time of trial will bring a purification
of the entire Catholic community, a purification that is urgently needed
if the church is to preach more effectively the Gospel of Jesus Christ in
all its liberating force. Now you must ensure that where sin increased,
grace will all the more abound [Romans 5:20]. So much pain, so much
sorrow must lead to a holier priesthood, a holier episcopate and a holier
church.</TE>
<TE>   God alone is the source of holiness, and it is to him above all that
we must turn for forgiveness, for healing and for the grace to meet this
challenge with uncompromising courage and harmony of purpose. Like the
good shepherd of last Sunday's Gospel, pastors must go among their
priests and people as men who inspire deep trust and lead them to restful
waters [Psalms 23:2].</TE>
<TE>   I beg the Lord to give the bishops of the United States the strength
to build their response to the present crisis upon the solid foundations
of faith and upon genuine pastoral charity for the victims, as well as
for the priests and the entire Catholic community in your country. And I
ask Catholics to stay close to their priests and bishops, and to support
them with their prayers at this difficult time.</TE>
<TE>   The peace of the risen Christ be with you!</TE>

<HD>A Media Circus in Rome</HD>
<DH>Coverage: Vatican and U.S. bishops' officials disagree on how to
deal with a deluge of reporters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROME
</DL>
<LD>As American reporters looked on, a tense turf battle broke out
Tuesday between a Vatican official and a spokeswoman for the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops in the courtyard of the North American
College here.</LD>
<LD>   The Vatican security official was adamant and angry, saying the small
group of reporters and photographers had to leave the area immediately.
The American bishops' spokeswoman held her ground, saying the reporters
needed to stay to meet a cardinal. One spoke Italian, the other English,
but each knew exactly what the other was saying.</LD>
<LD>   The brief dust-up reflected the differing views between the Americans
and the Italians over how to best deal with the throng of American media
that has descended on this city.</LD>
<TE>   The American Roman Catholic officials are attempting to manage the
reporters as best they can, while the Vatican wishes that everybody would
just go home. There are so many players and reporters here--200 foreign
media representatives, by one account--that spin control has been
replaced by a loss of control.</TE>
<TE>   Just beyond the barricades at St. Peter's Square, a stage has been
erected for television reporters' stand-ups, TV trucks are parked every
which way, and a couple of large satellite dishes are aimed toward the
17th century statues of the saints.</TE>
<TE>   The scene resembles a kind of old-world Camp O.J. One Vatican
official, looking out an office window, sniffed that at least the media
setup is located on City of Rome property rather than Vatican City
property.</TE>
<TE>   "The cardinals have found all the major American networks awaiting
them as if they were Hollywood stars," said the Italian newspaper Il
Giorno.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's and today's meetings between American prelates and Vatican
officials over a growing sex abuse scandal are closed to the media, of
course, but the bishops conference has set up one main briefing a day for
reporters. The briefings are being held in the shadow of the Vatican
grounds, at the North American College, the seminary where many of the
American clerics are staying.</TE>
<TE>   Some media-savvy cardinals and bishops, including Los Angeles Cardinal
Roger M. Mahony and Detroit Cardinal Adam Maida, are holding their own
briefings for their hometown reporters. Others, including embattled
Boston Cardinal Bernard Law and New York Cardinal Edward M. Egan, are
staying out of public view.</TE>
<TE>   With the meetings closed to the media, reporters mill around,
interviewing English-speaking tourists, and sometimes one another.</TE>
<TE>   A People magazine reporter, eager for a story on Mahony, attempted to
interview fellow reporters about the cardinal before his afternoon
briefing. Among her questions: whether they had lunch with him and where.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters who regularly cover the Vatican found themselves as pundits
with microphones jammed in their faces. Even the Italian media, which
have mostly stayed away from covering the sex abuse crisis, are being
asked for interviews. Marco Politi, a Vatican expert and reporter for La
Repubblica newspaper, has barely written about the scandal but was
nonetheless interviewed Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinals have set somewhat contradictory ground rules for the
media, saying on the one hand that they need to be open about the sex
abuse scandal and on the other that they would not release written texts
of their remarks. Further, they decided Tuesday to discuss with the media
the general proposals coming out of their meetings--but not to reveal the
cardinals who made them.</TE>
<TE>   So when Mahony was asked about a suggested national panel to review
sex abuse cases, he said only that it was a proposal "I had not thought
of."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has said the problem of clerics abusing children is worldwide
rather than a strictly American issue. The cardinal said he believes the
crisis is more open in the United States because, in part, the media are
freer to report such incidents.</TE>
<TE>   John L. Allen, the Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic
Reporter, agreed, saying in an article that newspapers and broadcast
media in much of Europe tend to be "beholden, directly or indirectly, to
political interests."</TE>

<HD>Mogul Keeps Tribal Site Sacred</HD>
<DH>History: Anschutz's company rules out drilling for oil in a Montana
canyon graced with ancient Indian art.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Denver-based energy company has given up plans to drill for oil
in a Montana canyon decorated with ancient rock art that is sacred to
several American Indian tribes and will donate its leases to the National
Trust for Historic Preservation.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by Anschutz Exploration Corp. announced Tuesday ends a
yearlong wrangle over Weatherman Draw, an obscure 2-mile-long niche in
southern Montana that became an early battleground over President Bush's
energy policy in the Western states.</LD>
<LD>   The controversy pitted the interests of a major donor to the Bush
campaign, Philip F. Anschutz, against preservation of some of the most
prized examples of centuries-old American Indian rock art in the High
Plains.</LD>
<TE>   The reclusive billionaire, who is a major stakeholder in Staples
Center and the Lakers and Kings professional sports teams in Los Angeles,
donated more than $300,000 to Republican causes in the last five years.
He was awarded rights to drill in Weatherman Draw, 12 days after the Bush
inauguration, after years of delay by the Interior Department's Bureau of
Land Management during the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy to get it behind us," said William Miller, vice president
of Anschutz Exploration. "It was a cultural resource we learned a lot
more about and one that merits some level of protection."</TE>
<TE>   Weatherman Draw hides numerous multicolored depictions of humans,
shields and animals, some of which archeologists believe are more than
1,000 years old. The mysterious figures are considered the best-preserved
examples of the art form in the High Plains. At least 10 tribes have said
they hold the area sacred, and some compare it to the Sistine Chapel.</TE>
<TE>   After Indian tribes and environmental groups protested the drilling
plan, an unsuccessful effort was made last year to trade drilling rights
in Weatherman Draw for rights of equivalent value on the Blackfeet
Reservation in northern Montana.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement reached this week leaves the trust holding the only
legal claims to oil exploration in Weatherman Draw. The trust has pledged
to let those leases expire, and the land bureau said Tuesday it has no
plans to permit any further leases of the 4,268-acre site, about 70 miles
southwest of Billings.</TE>
<TE>   "To my knowledge, this is the first time an oil company has donated
leases to a nonprofit organization," said Richard Moe, president of the
National Trust for Historic Preservation, which agreed to drop its legal
challenge to Anschutz's drilling plan. "The Interior Department is happy,
the tribes are happy, Anschutz is happy," Moe said.</TE>
<TE>   A bureau spokesman in Montana said the agency will keep the site off
the lease auction block and redraw its land-use plan to prohibit drilling
in the area, also known as Valley of the Chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   "We have discretion over what we offer for lease, so through our
discretion, we will not lease," said bureau spokesman Greg Albright.</TE>
<TE>   Ten Indian tribes, the Sierra Club and the National Trust had sued the
Department of the Interior for its February 2001 decision to grant
Anschutz permission to drill. That legal action will be halted, those
groups said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that says they're not going to drill, and that's on paper,
is a good thing," said Howard Boggess, an oral historian for the Crow
tribe in Montana. "I and the coalition of tribes really appreciate what
Anschutz has done. They left without any compensation."</TE>
<TE>   Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton said in a statement that the
decision "exemplifies the successes we are achieving through the process
of consultation, cooperation and communication."</TE>
<TE>   Still, one congressional opponent of the drilling effort, Rep. Nick J.
Rahall II (D-W.Va.), warned that other battles over Western land remain.
"In this case, I deeply appreciate the efforts of all involved, including
the oil company, to come to a proper resolution of this dispute," Rahall
said in a statement. "But make no mistake about it, there are other
Valley of Chiefs out there crying out for a comprehensive approach to
this issue rather than causing us to fight on a case-by-case basis."</TE>
<TE>   Although Anschutz Exploration hoped it could find as much as 10
million barrels of oil, the area's energy potential is unproved, making
the market value of the leases difficult to gauge. The land bureau had
been in the process of assessing the value in anticipation of a possible
congressional buyout of the lease but had made no estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Native Americans initially were reluctant to draw attention to the
area, slowing the process of protecting it. By the time the bureau began
assessing its eligibility for protection as an "area of critical
environmental concern" in 1992, two oil exploration leases already had
been auctioned to a small company. Anschutz, one of the most active
players in oil and gas exploration in the Rocky Mountain region, bought
the leases in 1994 and applied for permission to drill a well soon after.
The bureau granted the area its protected status in 1999, leaving the
Anschutz leases "grandfathered." Overcoming their reticence to bring
attention to the site--and hence more visitors--the tribes formed a
coalition to fight the permits.</TE>

<HD>Hawaiians Sue NASA Over Telescope</HD>
<DH>Astronomy: Group is trying to block expansion of the observation
area atop a mountain held sacred.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Hawaiian government body has sued NASA, charging that the
construction of new telescopes atop the islands' tallest peak could
threaten areas deemed sacred by many residents.</LD>
<LD>   The Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a semiautonomous state agency set up
to improve the condition of Hawaii's native population, filed the suit
late Monday in U.S. District Court in Hawaii to try to force NASA to slow
down plans to expand the Keck telescope. The suit asks that NASA be
required to conduct a full environmental impact review before it proceeds
with building four to six small "outrigger" telescopes to boost the
capabilities of the Keck, which consists of two 10-meter telescopes that
are each the world's largest gatherers of starlight.</LD>
<LD>   "The cultural sensitivities have not been appropriately addressed,"
said Haunani Apoliona, chairwoman of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. "The
issues have been ignored. We had no choice but to file legal action."</LD>
<TE>   Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano on Hawaii's Big Island, is the setting
for 13 telescopes. The top of the mountain is coveted by astronomers
because it rises above the cloud layer into thin, clear air that provides
excellent viewing of the heavens. It is also more convenient to reach
than other good viewing spots in the Chilean desert and Antarctica.</TE>
<TE>   Many Hawaiian residents have become increasingly upset about
development and construction on the mountain, which is home to hundreds
of sacred shrines and ancient burial grounds as well as a rare
high-altitude insect called the Weiku bug. In Hawaii's naturalistic
religion, the 13,769-foot mountain is considered the piko, or navel of
Hawaii, from which all else arose. Hawaiians call it their sacred temple.</TE>
<TE>   "The role that this mountain plays in Hawaiian culture and religion is
unquestioned throughout Polynesia," said Kealoha Pisciotta, a native
Hawaiian and former telescope employee who is leading efforts to protect
the mountain.</TE>
<TE>   The battle over Mauna Kea has crescendoed in parallel with a growing
native Hawaiian political movement. The calls by elders, religious
leaders and other local Hawaiians against more construction on the
mountain have been joined by Sierra Club leaders who fear environmental
degradation of the mountain.</TE>
<TE>NASA Asked to Give Back to Community</TE>
<TE>   The development of astronomy in Hawaii had long been seen as a way to
improve the economy and educational resources of the state. Over the last
few years, though, the effort has become more controversial. In 1998,
state officials published a scathing audit that lambasted management of
the summit.</TE>
<TE>   Some Hawaiians are calling for a ban on new telescopes or even removal
of the existing ones. Others want better stewardship of the mountain,
which has had some of its cinder cones flattened in preparation for
telescope placement.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Stevens, a Hawaiian elder who worships on the mountain and leads a
group called Ahahui Ku Mauna--"group for the mountain"--is urging that a
full impact assessment of development on the summit be conducted and also
that the astronomers reimburse the state for use of the mountain. Some
have suggested that the telescopes fund educational opportunities for
Hawaiians.</TE>
<TE>   Viewing time at Keck is worth roughly $1 per second, or $30,000 per
night. Each telescope pays the state a rental fee of $1 per year.</TE>
<TE>   But a proposal by NASA to offer $1.85 million to native causes was met
with derision. "We found the offer not only ridiculous but totally
insulting," Pisciotta said. "There is no way to compensate [for] the
destruction, desecration or possible injury to an endangered species and
the sacred waters of Mauna Kea."</TE>
<TE>   Keck is run jointly by NASA, the University of California and Caltech.
Telescope officials and a NASA spokesman said Tuesday they would not
comment on any pending litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed outrigger telescopes are 6 feet across and would be built
around the edge of the two 33-foot-wide Keck telescopes. Once in place
and linked to the main telescope through a technique called
interferometry, they would greatly increase the telescopes' ability to
see distant objects clearly.</TE>
<TE>   The improvements mean the telescopes might be able to make maps of
nearby planets and galaxies. This is a key part of NASA's Origins
project, an attempt to seek life elsewhere in the galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   The project has now been delayed by a year and a half. Conducting a
full environmental impact statement could delay matters for an additional
year, NASA officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   NASA officials, who have said they are concerned about protecting the
mountain, did conduct a less formal environmental assessment and said the
project would have "no significant impact."</TE>
<TE>   The fight over the Keck outriggers is seen as a test case for other
projects designed for the mountain. One telescope three times the size of
Keck is now on the drawing board at UC Santa Cruz and may be destined for
Mauna Kea.</TE>

<HD>Fla. Bonus Rewards a Thin Blue Line; Some Call It 'Bogus'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAVIE, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>This state asks plenty of the men and women who wear the taupe
uniform and orange shoulder patches of the Florida Highway Patrol. Can it
ask them to watch their weight as well?</LD>
<LD>   It can, if the troopers want to be eligible this year for a $500
bonus. And some on the 1,600-member force are not very happy.</LD>
<LD>   "Being 15 to 25 pounds over the weight requirement has never been a
hindrance," said Sgt. Jim Rhyne, chairman of the Florida branch of the
International Union of Police Assns. Under current guidelines, Rhyne
said, "someone, let us say 17 pounds overweight, who wrote the most
tickets, worked the most complicated crashes and solved them wouldn't be
eligible for the bonus."</LD>
<TE>   At 6-foot-4, the 47-year-old Rhyne tips the scales at 267 pounds, 36
more than the maximum prescribed by the Highway Patrol's height-weight
chart. But he says the extra weight doesn't hamper his effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "I am in the mold of a big old boy, very intimidating," said the
Orlando-based trooper, conjuring up film and folklore images of the beefy
Southern lawman, hitching up his gun belt as he prepares to inform a
stopped motorist that he is in for a heap of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "The officers are now smaller and trimmer," Rhyne said.</TE>
<TE>   The Highway Patrol defends its weight goals and its readiness to be
flexible in applying them. "We give everybody the benefit of a doubt,"
said Capt. David Tripp, spokesman at patrol headquarters in Tallahassee
(who, at 6 feet and under 170, easily meets the criteria).</TE>
<TE>   If a trooper loses a single pound in a year, for example, it will be
taken as a sign of improvement and make him or her eligible for the
bonus.</TE>
<TE>   "We allow troopers to use their FHP car and gas to get to fitness
centers. Local gyms and the YMCA will give troopers a price break," Tripp
said. "We are not a fat force. Troopers are in good shape."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in recent years, no across-the-board pay increases have been
mandated for Florida's troopers this year, with Republican Gov. Jeb Bush
and the GOP-led Legislature instead setting aside $219,561 to be
distributed in bonuses to the best FHP employees, including civilian
staff members. A rookie trooper earns $30,825 to $37,007 a year,
depending on where he or she is stationed. Veterans max out at $45,184.</TE>
<TE>   To divvy up the bonus pot among the 260 most deserving employees,
Highway Patrol supervisors are supposed to use their regular performance
evaluations. If any area is marked as "needing improvement," troopers are
ineligible. They are graded on a number of factors, among them
investigative skill, report-writing ability, how they maintain their
cruisers and shotguns, and "appearance and fitness." That last category
includes weight.</TE>
<TE>   The weight guidelines aren't new for the patrol--and many law
enforcement agencies nationwide have similar rules--and they became
controversial in Florida only when the patrol tied them to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Stationed at Davie on the fringes of the Everglades, Lt. John J.
Bagnardi says a trooper's appearance is a crucial part of the job. "So
much of what we do is perception," he said. "You line up a bunch of
squared-away troopers, instead of a bunch of Keystone Kops, people are
going to say, 'This a battle we're not going to fight.' "</TE>
<TE>   Rhyne admits he's not exactly built for chasing down lawbreakers on
foot but adds: "I am useful in pushing cars and kicking down doors."</TE>
<TE>   Bagnardi responds, "You see many doors out there on the highway?"</TE>
<TE>   The lieutenant knows firsthand about the struggle to keep his weight
within patrol limits, not an easy accomplishment for officers who
customarily grab their meals on the fly at McDonald's, Wendy's or other
fast-food joints. Before Christmas, the 5-foot-8 Bagnardi ballooned to
205 pounds. He's now down to 190 and says his uniforms fit better and he
has more energy.</TE>
<TE>   Defending the policy, Bagnardi emphasizes the leeway patrol brass has
in evaluating subordinates. The weight chart is the same as that used by
the U.S. military, and troopers are already permitted to exceed those
numbers by 15 pounds. Moreover, doctor's notes attesting to an officer's
fitness and body fat level can also be used to further raise the
permitted ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   For a living example, Bagnardi got on the radio and summoned Trooper
Vernon Slater, 36, who almost filled the doorway when he arrived at the
Davie station. At 6-foot-2, Slater should weigh a maximum of 215, instead
of 245. But the former Marine platoon sergeant is "all muscle," said
Bagnardi, and that can be taken into account on his evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   "I had reduced my weight to the standards, and I was sick every day,"
Slater said. The strapping trooper is now back at his customary, imposing
bulk and healthily bench-pressing 310 pounds and squatting 650 pounds
during his five-times-a-week workouts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not fat, I'm big," Slater summarized. So big, in fact, that some
motorists he has stopped on South Florida roads have complained to his
superiors that the mere sight of him walking up to their cars frightened
them.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason I kept my body this size was, the first thing I want them
to say is, 'I'm not going to start anything,' " Slater said.</TE>
<TE>   The real reason for discontent in patrol ranks may not be the weight
issue, but the absence of a salary increase this year and the relatively
small number of employees who will receive bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   Troopers' pay was hiked by 2.5% last year and 8% the year before. Now,
under Bush's "Service First Initiative," Florida's stated goal is to
reward public employees as if they were in the private sector, with
outstanding performers getting additional money.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of a well-deserved raise, they [Florida's politicians] have
come up with a bonus plan," Rhyne said. "A 'bogus plan' is what we call
it."</TE>

<HD>As Rail Traffic Rises, Crash Risk Increases</HD>
<DH>Prevention: Orange County's system remains low-tech, relying mostly
on human judgment. Satellite network more fail-safe, official says.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rail lines in Orange County have grown increasingly crowded in
recent years with both freight and passenger trains--narrowing the margin
of error in a system still heavily reliant on human judgment.</LD>
<LD>   Metrolink service to the county began eight years ago, with a dozen
trains a day now passing the site of Tuesday's crash with a Burlington
Northern Santa Fe freight train. The passenger trains must compete for
space with up to 60 trains a day operated by Burlington Northern, which
has increased operations in the area 96% since 1988.</LD>
<LD>   This crowding of the rail space will provide the backdrop as National
Transportation Safety Board investigators study a variety of possible
factors in Tuesday's crash: the performance of the locomotive engineers,
the functioning of the signal systems and the operation of the
dispatching system that determines which train is supposed to be on which
track.</LD>
<TE>   Tuesday's accident was at a Burlington Northern "control point" east
of the Anaheim Canyon station. The control point allows trains heading in
opposite directions to avoid each other by switching one of them onto a
parallel passing track, said Al Nerkowski, local chairman of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers Local 662.</TE>
<TE>   The trains are supposed to stop before the control point and wait for
a Burlington Northern dispatcher operating the rail switches to order one
of them onto the other track.</TE>
<TE>   "There's millions of things that could have caused this to happen,"
Nerkowski said, "but it looks like one of the trains didn't stop."</TE>
<TE>   About 40% of Metrolink's 416-mile network--stretching across Los
Angeles, Orange, Riverside, Ventura and San Bernardino counties--is run
on rails controlled by freight railroads, including the Burlington
Northern and Union Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   On stretches operated by the cargo railroads, the freight lines also
handle the dispatching. When the trains switch to Metrolink track, the
dispatching is done by Metrolink employees at a center in Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 collision, also between Metrolink and Burlington Northern
trains, occurred on another stretch of Orange County track not far from
Tuesday's crash. Unlike Tuesday's accident, that crash occurred on track
controlled and dispatched by Metrolink, according to Metrolink spokesman
Francisco Oaxaca.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of freight and passenger trains sharing track has been a
significant concern of Metrolink operators, but mainly because the
passenger trains are frequently delayed, waiting for the bigger freight
trains to pass.</TE>
<TE>   That worry has focused on the Riverside-to-downtown Los Angeles route,
where Metrolink officials claim Union Pacific has not been dispatching
its trains properly. Another meeting in that dispute is scheduled Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Tuesday's accident and a fatal rail crash last week in
Florida, trains are an extremely safe way to travel.</TE>
<TE>   Rail accidents continue to diminish and the number of deaths and
injuries from those accidents is relatively low. Since 1995, an average
of seven people have died each year on passenger trains nationwide,
compared with more than 40,000 a year who die in motor vehicle crashes.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, rail is very safe," said Tom Rubin, an Oakland-based
transportation consultant. "It's certainly safer than driving on a
freeway."</TE>
<TE>   However, Wendell Cox of the Amtrak Reform Council said that freight
and passenger trains sharing tracks causes him concern, despite the
statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to take a serious look at separating them as much as
possible," Cox said. "Imagine driving down the freeway full-speed and
having to constantly pull over because someone is slowing or stopping, or
suddenly driving in the opposite direction. That's what it's like for
trains in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Federal transportation officials have also been studying high-tech
collision avoidance systems.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Rutter, head of the Federal Railroad Administration, said in a
March 27 letter to the National Transportation Safety Board that the cost
of a system now under study "would financially overwhelm the passenger
railroads, especially at this time when [Amtrak's] future is unclear."</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Department officials estimate the cost of a system
covering all passenger lines and key freight lines throughout the country
at about $3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Devising a technology to prevent railroad crashes remains a top
priority for the safety board, which first recommended it in 1987.
Tuesday's fatal collision is likely to result in renewed urgency for such
a high-tech solution.</TE>
<TE>   Government and industry officials said technology widely used in
aviation and trucking can be adapted to railroads. The concept is known
as "positive train separation," also called "positive train control."</TE>
<TE>   The system would use the global positioning satellite network to keep
tabs on the location, direction and speed of locomotives. The engines
would have to be equipped with transponders that continually signal their
position.</TE>
<TE>   If satellite data show that one train is headed for a collision with
another, one or both of the locomotives could be slowed or stopped--by an
on-board computer, engineer or a remote dispatcher.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's signal system relies on strict adherence to operational
procedures and protocol," said Warren Flatau, a spokesman for the Federal
Railroad Administration. "This next generation would be much more
fail-safe."</TE>
<TE>   The railroad agency has the legal authority to require
collision-avoidance systems. Instead, the agency has chosen to
concentrate on setting standards for the technology and on persuading
railroads to embrace it voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   Rutter, the railroad agency chief, has told the NTSB that his agency
plans to require collision-avoidance systems in the busy Northeast
Corridor, where high-speed passenger trains are being introduced.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials remain skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to complete the tests. You have to find out what the costs
are. And you have to see what the cost-benefit relationships are," said
Tom White, a spokesman for the Assn. of American Railroads.</TE>
<TE>   Although the industry is concerned about initial costs, satellites
could help railroads more efficiently manage locomotives--conserving fuel
and cutting delays.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, with accident rates relatively low, industry officials have
remained resistant.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't hear people talking about installing collision-avoidance
systems in cars," said one industry official, who asked not to be
identified. "The money is simply not there."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In November 1999, a Metrolink passenger train and a Burlington
Northern Santa Fe freight train collided in an accident eerily similar to
Tuesday's deadly wreck in Placentia.</LD>
<LD>   Nineteen people were injured in the previous accident, as boxcars
tumbled down an embankment and a locomotive derailed after being hit by a
Metrolink train. The crash occurred in Fullerton, just a few miles from
the site of Tuesday's wreck.</LD>
<LD>   National Transportation Safety Board officials studied several causes
for the 1999 crash, including mechanical and signal failures and sunlight
glare in the Metrolink driver's eyes. Those causes were ruled out,
however, and the investigation remains open.</LD>
<TE>   Metrolink engineer Harvey Wong told police he received a warning
signal to slow down three miles before the crash. While Wong reported
that he slowed his train, he said he did not receive a timely warning to
stop the passenger train altogether.</TE>

<HD>Car Accident Drove Victim to Rail, a Commute His Family Said He
Loved</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Robert Kube, 59, of Moreno Valley centered his life around
his church, wife and daughters. A second victim was not identified.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He boarded the Metrolink train in Riverside each day to avoid a
punishing freeway commute.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Kube, 59, fell in love with the train after a bad car accident
three years ago. It was peaceful, a 90-minute cruise from his Moreno
Valley home to the government office where he worked in Santa Ana. It was
time he used to read the Bible and to prepare for a course he taught at
his church--on embracing faith.</LD>
<LD>   But Tuesday morning, one of the typically tranquil commutes that Kube
enjoyed ended suddenly and violently. The married father of two was one
of two who died when a freight train plowed into Metrolink Train 809 in
Placentia. Kube died at the scene.</LD>
<TE>   The second victim of the train crash is described by authorities as a
48-year-old man who lived in Riverside County. Police were in the area
late Tuesday trying to locate the man's parents and won't release his
name until they inform his next of kin.</TE>
<TE>   Kube's life was centered around the Moreno Valley Christian Fellowship
and his family: his wife Ann and daughters, Krystle, 17, and Kelly, 21.</TE>
<TE>   That and baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Kube had an obsession with the sport. When he was in his 20s, although
he was partially blind in one eye, Kube tried out for a minor-league team
in his hometown of Detroit. He didn't make the squad. Instead, he went to
work at the Department of Housing and Urban Development as a real-estate
specialist helping in the sale of foreclosed homes.</TE>
<TE>   He met his future wife, Ann, when the two were set up for a date. He
told her he fell in love because she could talk intelligently about
sports. When they moved to Perris a few years later, Kube played ball in
amateur leagues.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, married more than 20 years, had kids relatively late in
life. When Ann finally got pregnant, Bob was hoping for a boy--someone to
play ball with.</TE>
<TE>   But they had girls, and Kube coached Krystle's softball team.</TE>
<TE>   "He taught me everything I knew about playing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When Kelly decided that dance, not baseball, was her passion, Kube
attended her recitals.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad was the coolest guy," she said. "He was funny. He gave
everything he had for me." On Friday, her 22nd birthday, her dad was
going to take her shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Kube said Tuesday was the first morning in months that she didn't
get up to see her husband catch his 7:30 a.m. train.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, she plans to go to church in her husband's place. It will
be the first meeting of a fellowship group Robert Kube organized for
newcomers. Ann Kube said her husband would have wanted her to carry on
with his work.</TE>
<TE>   Its name: New Beginnings.</TE>

<HD>Drill Preparation Put Hospitals in Ready State</HD>
<DH>Response: Fifteen north Orange County facilities were poised for a
disaster exercise when the real thing hit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County hospitals say their response to Tuesday's train
collision went smoothly, in part because of preparation for a disaster
drill that had been scheduled an hour after the real emergency hit.</LD>
<LD>   "If you had to pick a time to have an accident, this would be the time
because the system was all set up to be implemented," said Dr. Robert
Becker, chief of the emergency department at Kaiser Permanente Medical
Center in Anaheim, about a mile from the crash site. "If anything, I
think I had more doctors than I could handle."</LD>
<LD>   All told, about 161 victims of the collision were sent to hospitals,
and 20 of them initially were deemed to have life-threatening injuries.
The 9:15 a.m. drill had been designed to treat about 100.</LD>
<TE>   All 15 of the hospitals in the northern part of the county were
scheduled to take part. The exercise was based on a scenario in which a
truck carrying toxic material crashed into a Brea storefront less than
five miles from the actual crash site.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals including Kaiser Anaheim had physicians in their surgery,
anesthesia and internal medicine departments on hand. Usually, it would
take time to assemble such a specialized team. Ambulances and firetrucks
heading for the drill were turned around when the train wreck was
reported. Amateur radio operators that had been sent to the hospitals for
the exercise were put to work in disaster communications.</TE>
<TE>   "All the agencies were there [at the drill site], police, fire, about
30 ambulances," said Lisa Larres, a disaster preparedness specialist for
the American Red Cross, adding that 350 people were scheduled to
participate. "We were waiting to get started. One of the fire chiefs came
over and said, 'There's a real incident going on at this time. The drill
is canceled.' I just thought 'Oh no.' "</TE>
<TE>   Though injuries were numerous, officials at several hospitals said
they were equipped to handle accidents of this magnitude and had a far
easier time than if bioterrorism had been involved or a serious
earthquake had hit.</TE>
<TE>   At St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, clinical educator Vicki
Cadwell was in the middle of final drill preparations with nurses when
news of the crash arrived. The hospital had 20 emergency room nurses on
hand at one point, compared to the usual morning crew of nine.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, some hospitals reported confusion among staff members as to
what was real and what was not. Despite having a message piped through
the public address system that the train collision was not a drill,
"There were still people questioning: Are they just saying that?" Cadwell
said.</TE>
<TE>   At Anaheim Memorial Medical Center, the overhead paging system had
back-to-back announcements about the need for supplies for both the mock
and real disasters.</TE>
<TE>   "Within a very short period of time, we suspended the drill," said Dr.
Tim Korber, the hospital's director of emergency services.</TE>
<TE>   When word of the real disaster spread, off-duty nurses and doctors
began arriving and calling to see if their help was needed.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim General Hospital officials said the drill had caused them to
update phone lists and map out assignments well in advance.</TE>
<TE>   Had the real disaster happened any other time, "we wouldn't have been
as prepared," said hospital spokeswoman Sandy Scheppmann.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals said they could have handled even more patients. St. Jude
moved two of its community medical vans to its ER parking lot to treat
the least seriously injured so that its emergency room could stay clear
for more critical cases.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Memorial, which received more than 60 patients, set up a tent
in its parking lot to treat the "walking wounded." As soon as beds became
available inside, patients were moved. Only three people were admitted
throughout the day.</TE>
<TE>   The American Red Cross' Southern California division said it shipped
extra units of blood to the hospitals, depleting its supply of O-negative
and A-negative types to less than a day's reserve. The group tries to
keep a supply of three or four days on hand.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since Sept. 11, the group put out a call for blood
donors. To arrange to give blood in Orange and Los Angeles counties,
people can call 800 GIVE-LIFE.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Bruce E. Haynes, medical director of Emergency Medical Services
for Orange County, said the system worked well but officials will review
the response to see if they could have done anything better.</TE>

<HD>Dairy Products Help Curb Risk Factors for Diabetes, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Overweight people who consume lots of dairy products may be less
likely to develop risk factors for diabetes, a study shows.</LD>
<LD>   The findings, published in today's issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Assn., pertain to insulin resistance syndrome, a
condition that can lead to diabetes and that afflicts 1 in 4 Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The body of an insulin-resistant person must produce an elevated level
of insulin to control his or her blood sugar.</LD>
<TE>   The study showed that for overweight people, eating dairy more than
five times a day, as opposed to once, can reduce the risk of insulin
resistance syndrome by 72%.</TE>
<TE>   Insulin-resistant patients are at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes
because of the heavy demand the syndrome puts on the pancreas. More
pressing, some researchers believe, is the potential for heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   A major risk factor for the syndrome is obesity, which changes the
body's ability to use insulin. Concern is growing over the syndrome and
diabetes because more Americans are obese than ever, said Mark Pereira,
the study's lead author and an epidemiologist at Children's Hospital in
Boston and Harvard Medical School. Younger and younger populations have
developed insulin resistance syndrome in recent decades. At the same
time, Pereira said, milk consumption has fallen and soda consumption has
climbed. Studies show that dairy consumption and healthy body weights are
linked, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers in the insulin resistance study analyzed data from
another University of Minnesota study of coronary artery risk in young
adults. That study followed more than 3,100 adults in four centers around
the country for more than 10 years. The patients studied are now between
the ages of 25 and 40.</TE>
<TE>   For a patient to be considered insulin resistant, the researchers
looked for two of four risk factors: abnormal glucose regulation,
obesity, high blood pressure or dyslipidemia--which is high triglycerides
(blood fats) and low "good" cholesterol levels (HDL).</TE>
<TE>   People with the syndrome, also known as syndrome X or metabolic
syndrome, often have high levels of triglycerides, as well as low HDL
cholesterol and high blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found a correlation between decreased dairy
consumption and these factors related to insulin resistance syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Pereira and his group could not be certain precisely why dairy would
prevent the syndrome. He said the nutrients in dairy products, such as
calcium, might affect blood-sugar metabolism.</TE>
<TE>   "Dairy has a really good mix of macronutrients" such as carbohydrates,
proteins and fats, Pereira said. "They could fill people up more . . .
than high-calorie, low-nutritional-value food," which might help prevent
obesity.</TE>
<TE>   The findings were met with some skepticism. Dr. Gerald Reavan, the
Stanford University researcher who first described insulin resistance
syndrome in the 1980s, questioned how the researchers diagnosed the
syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   Only half the people with the syndrome develop hypertension, Reavan
said. A person can be obese and hypertensive, he said, and still not have
the elevated insulin levels that define the syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   He believes dyslipidemia is a better measure of the syndrome than
hypertension, and said the effect of dairy on dyslipidemia in this study
was not statistically significant.</TE>
<TE>   Pereira said although not significant, eating five or more servings of
dairy still had a notable effect on dyslipidemia, reducing the chance of
its occurrence by a third.</TE>

<HD>Report Says 'Abstinence-Only' Programs Met With Resistance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Programs that encourage teenagers to abstain from sex have
multiplied in the last five years, but they have had trouble engaging
parents and local schools, according to a national evaluation released
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The "abstinence-only" initiative, to which Congress directed nearly
$500 million as part of a massive 1996 welfare law, is controversial
because it bars any discussion of condoms or birth control, other than to
explain their limitations.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday's report, written by independent researchers who are
evaluating the initiative, reaffirms that despite claims by advocates,
there is no reliable evidence that these programs are effective in
reducing teen sex, pregnancy or the transmission of disease.</LD>
<TE>   Congress is debating whether to renew the funding for another five
years, as President Bush has requested, or allow the money to be spent on
a broader range of activities.</TE>
<TE>   Given the restrictions, states across the country debated whether to
take the money. Eventually every state took it, though one, California,
dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   "The funding has stimulated considerable discussion at the state and
local level on the problem of teen sexuality," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, about half of high school students and nearly two-thirds of
graduating seniors reported having had sex. That is a small drop from
earlier years, but the report says there is no evidence to link the
decline to abstinence-only programs.</TE>

<HD>Plans Sputter to Strip Ethanol Rules From Senate Energy Bill</HD>
<DH>Politics: Foes of the provision, including California lawmakers who
foresee gas price hikes, lose out to Corn Belt colleagues.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Senators from both coasts lost their effort Tuesday to strip from
energy legislation an ethanol provision that they warned would lead to
gasoline price spikes.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate bill, heading toward a final vote later this week, would
significantly increase the amount of ethanol--made from corn and other
crops--added to gasoline to help reduce pollution. But the lawmakers from
California and New York said their constituents would face unfair
gasoline price hikes because of the costs of shipping ethanol from the
Midwest.</LD>
<LD>   After a debate that pitted Democratic colleagues from different
regions against one another, the vote came down to simple arithmetic:
opponents of the ethanol provision were outnumbered by Corn Belt senators
whose home states would reap a windfall from it.</LD>
<TE>   Senators voted overwhelmingly--68 to 31--to keep the ethanol provision
in the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The vote was the latest to leave a group of senators disappointed with
the energy legislation. Last week, senators rejected drilling in the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a key component of the energy plan
President Bush proposed almost a year ago. Last month, the senators voted
down tougher miles-per-gallon standards for vehicles, the top priority of
environmentalists and most Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Having rejected these two high-profile proposals, the Senate is moving
to wrap up work on the legislation, which remains packed with measures to
promote conservation and production. The final vote could come Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The 500-page-plus bill includes $14 billion in tax breaks to, among
other things, encourage consumers to buy fuel-efficient hybrid cars. The
measure provides a federal loan guarantee to spur construction of a
$20-billion, 2,100-mile pipeline to carry Alaskan natural gas to the
lower 48 states.</TE>
<TE>   It would set new energy efficiency standards for traffic lights,
establish new efforts to reduce school bus idling and create a program
aimed at getting drivers out of their cars and onto bicycles.</TE>
<TE>   Collectively, the proposals left in the bill would reduce energy use
by 2% by 2020, some experts say. "We're only doing part of what needs to
be done," said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council
for an Energy Efficient Economy, a Washington-based think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Senators are anxious to pass the bill and move to the next phase:
House-Senate negotiations that could produce a compromise measure. The
House last year passed a plan that closely followed Bush's plan.</TE>
<TE>Ambitious Bill Becomes Modest</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers from both parties are striving to pass the first
comprehensive energy bill in a decade, despite diminishing enthusiasm for
what the final product might contain.</TE>
<TE>   "If this had been developed and presented as a modest bill, people
would be comfortable with it," said David Nemtzow, president of the
Alliance to Save Energy, a bipartisan coalition of business, consumer and
environmental leaders. "It was presented by the president and leaders of
each house as a major bill. . . . So expectations were high, and that's
where it fails."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has vowed to vote against the overall
bill if the ethanol mandate remains. On Tuesday, she assailed the
provision as "unconscionable, selfish and parochial" public policy.</TE>
<TE>   She called it a hidden tax that could cost California drivers 10 cents
a gallon at the pump. She also called attention to a House hearing
Tuesday that alleged possible ethanol industry collusion to set prices.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony at the hearing led Rep. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento),
chairman of the House Subcommittee on Energy Policy, Natural Resources
and Regulatory Affairs, to request a Federal Trade Commission
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) joined Feinstein in the fight against
the ethanol provision. "Remember the California electricity crisis?"
Schumer said, suggesting that the ethanol requirement could lead to the
same kind of stinging price increases and supply shortages that hit the
West Coast last year.</TE>
<TE>   But Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), chief sponsor of the
provision, contended that ethanol could be used as a smog-fighting
substitute for MTBE, which helps gas burn cleaner but has been blamed for
fouling water supplies. He also disputed predictions of big price spikes
from its use.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell you what's going to be disruptive," Daschle shot back.
"What's going to be disruptive is if we phase out MTBE . . . and we don't
have anything in its place."</TE>
<TE>   The provision calls for tripling the amount of renewable fuels, most
likely ethanol, in gasoline to 5 billion gallons by 2012 while phasing
out over four years the use of MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether).</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill still includes a number of initiatives that were part
of Bush's energy plan, including $2 billion for technology to make
coal-fired power plants less polluting and a cap on the nuclear
industry's liability for accidents.</TE>
<TE>   The measure also would require utilities to generate more electricity
from such alternative sources as solar and wind power. But
environmentalists say the provision includes so many exemptions,
including public power companies, that it would lead only to modest
change.</TE>
<TE>   Among the lesser-known provisions, the bill would direct regulators to
establish new efficiency standards for vending machines, commercial
refrigerators, ceiling fans, battery chargers and power supplies for
consumer products. The bill seeks to reduce the amount of electricity
used by TVs, VCRs, computers and microwaves when they're not in use.</TE>
<TE>   It establishes the "Next Generation Lighting Initiative," a
government-industry effort to develop more efficient lighting systems. It
provides for the creation of a new federal office to watch out for
consumer interests in energy markets.</TE>
<TE>   And it would set aside about $5 million to establish 10 pilot projects
in cities yet to be selected to promote bike riding as an alternative to
driving.</TE>
<TE>   "Every possible approach must be considered in order to solve our
energy problems," said Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), who proposed the
program. "Something as simple as traveling by bike instead of car can
play an important role in reducing our dependence on foreign oil."</TE>

<HD>Senate Debates Permanent Demise of 'Death Tax'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>When Congress passed a $1.35-trillion tax cut last year, it created
a major incentive for the wealthiest taxpayers to die before New Year's
Day 2011.</LD>
<LD>   Under the law, the federal estate tax is scheduled to be reduced
gradually over the next eight years and repealed entirely in 2010. But
when the calendar turns to Jan. 1, 2011, the law calls for the full,
sudden resurrection of what critics call the "death tax."</LD>
<LD>   The Senate on Tuesday, facing pressure to address that issue, agreed
to take up by late June legislation to abolish the estate tax
indefinitely.</LD>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who last week vowed to
block any action on House-passed legislation to make the entire 10-year
tax cut permanent, asserted Tuesday that he has enough votes to thwart
the Republican-led effort to extend the provision to repeal the estate
tax.</TE>
<TE>   An accord Daschle reached with Republicans committed the Senate to a
brief debate on the estate tax by June 28, with 60 votes required for
passage of a GOP or Democratic proposal. That is a tall order in a
100-member Senate that is almost evenly split between the two parties.</TE>
<TE>   The debate on the estate tax, however, could pose political
difficulties for several Senate Democrats in an election year with
control of the chamber at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a red-meat tax vote for Republicans," said Stephen Moore,
president of the Club for Growth, an anti-tax political action committee.
"Just getting a vote I take as a victory for the tax cut agenda. It puts
the Democrats on record once again."</TE>
<TE>   Only a tiny fraction of estates--about 45,000, as of 1999--are
actually taxed by the federal government. But many more taxpayers consult
tax attorneys and financial advisors in an effort to avoid taxes.</TE>
<TE>   As of this year, estates valued at $1 million or less are exempt from
the federal tax. Estates worth more face tax rates as high as 50%.</TE>
<TE>   The tax law enacted last year, championed by President Bush, gradually
raises the exemption and lowers the tax rate. But for political and
procedural reasons, the law, which also cuts income tax rates and
provides other tax breaks, expires Dec. 31, 2010.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the 2001 top estate tax rate of 55% would go back into
effect for anyone who dies the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and congressional Republicans recently resumed the tax cut cause,
gearing up their push to make the entire law permanent. Democratic
leaders are seeking to block them, arguing that the tax cuts already in
effect were partly responsible for throwing the federal budget into
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining party discipline on the estate tax issue will be a
challenge for Daschle.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska, one of 12 Senate Democrats who voted for
the overall tax cut measure, said he would favor wiping out the estate
tax altogether. Nelson said that the issue is urgent because the law as
it stands prevents rational estate planning.</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers, Nelson said, "don't want to have to figure out whether to
die in the next 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   GOP leaders count at least 58 votes in favor of extending the repeal.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 13, the Senate voted, 56 to 42, in favor of a nonbinding
resolution sponsored by Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) to eliminate the tax
altogether. The supporters of the Kyl resolution included several
vulnerable Democrats up for reelection: Sens. Max Baucus of Montana, Max
Cleland of Georgia, Tim Johnson of South Dakota and Mary Landrieu of
Louisiana. In addition, two senators who did not vote on the matter in
February--Robert F. Bennett (R-Utah) and Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.)--have
supported estate tax repeal in the past.</TE>
<TE>   And some opponents of the Kyl resolution have either supported repeal
previously--such as Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), John B. Breaux (D-La.)
and John McCain (R-Ariz.)--or face tough election battles this year. One
who could face heavy lobbying to change her vote is Sen. Jean Carnahan
(D-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   Across the Capitol, support for a permanent repeal of the estate tax
is strong. Last year, the House approved legislation to repeal the estate
tax entirely on a broad bipartisan vote of 274 to 154. Fifty-eight
Democrats and one independent joined 215 Republicans in support of the
measure.</TE>

<HD>FDA Panel, Amid Patients' Pleas, Urges Clearing Lotronex for Sale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BETHESDA, Md.
</DL>
<LD>Government advisors heeded patients' pleas Tuesday that a drug for
irritable bowel syndrome should be cleared for sale again--but with
stringent restrictions to try to mitigate side effects that have
hospitalized more than 160 people and killed seven.</LD>
<LD>   If the Food and Drug Administration follows the panel's advice,
Lotronex will be tough to get--prescribed only by doctors who have
undergone special training to use it and given only to the sickest
patients, who must register in a national database that monitors how they
fare.</LD>
<LD>   "A life without Lotronex is a miserable existence," said a tearful
Diana Hoyt of Atlanta, who described swallowing four anti-diarrheal pills
and donning a diaper just to spend a few minutes asking the FDA for the
only pill that ever made her feel well.</LD>
<TE>   Two attorneys for people injured by the once-popular drug, which was
pulled off the market in November 2000, argued that it is too risky to
sell again.</TE>
<TE>   The syndrome afflicts up to 11% of Americans, mostly women. It isn't
life-threatening, but it can cause chronic abdominal pain, sudden and
urgent need to use a toilet and either frequent diarrhea, constipation or
both.</TE>

<HD>Studying 'Dirty' Bomb Scenario</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: An Al Qaeda leader's warning that his group has the
know-how to build a radioactive device exploits fears, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In the heart of a major American city, terrorists set off an
explosive encased in radioactive waste that scatters metal debris for
hundreds of yards and coats several blocks with radioactive dust.</LD>
<LD>   A handful of people suffer radioactive burns, and a small number of
others will develop cancer as a result. The attack stirs a panic that
prompts a major evacuation and forces local officials to consider razing
scores of buildings that they fear no one will ever willingly use again.</LD>
<LD>   This scenario has been troubling federal officials, and especially so
this week, when the imprisoned Al Qaeda leader Abu Zubeida warned that
his group knows how to build a device that would spread radioactivity
over a wide area.</LD>
<TE>   While these "dirty" bombs are likely to kill relatively few directly,
they exploit fears of radioactivity in a way that makes them a
devastating terrorist weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "The sheer psychological impact is enormous," said Nikolai Sokov, an
analyst at the Monterey Institute's Center for Non-Proliferation Studies.
"More people may be killed from the stampede that follows than from the
bomb."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials and outside experts acknowledge that some of their
knowledge of the subject is based on guesswork.</TE>
<TE>   So far no group has set off a dirty bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Most experts reason that the chances of such an attack in the United
States remain low because terrorists could be reluctant to use such a
complex and risky device when conventional explosives are easy to use and
readily available.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the materials and know-how needed to build such devices
are widely available, and even apart from Zubeida's statements there have
been indications that militant groups have been seeking to build such
devices.</TE>
<TE>   Radioactive waste materials are widely available in the United States
and elsewhere, from civilian and military sources. Radioactive products
are used in medicine and industry, including those from nuclear power
generation.</TE>
<TE>   Governments have sought to control the handling of such materials, but
officials have acknowledged since Sept. 11 that rules haven't been tight
enough.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are adding detection devices at key border crossings, yet
they acknowledge that smugglers could cross the border in unguarded
areas.</TE>
<TE>   Overseas, highly radioactive nuclear materials are scattered widely,
including in the former Soviet Union. In December in the former Soviet
republic of Georgia, three hunters gathering firewood died of exposure to
three abandoned canisters of radioactive material.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials are not sure how seriously to take the threats of
Zubeida, who may have been trying to frighten Americans. But Al Qaeda's
interest in dirty bombs has been well established, including through the
1998 trial of suspects in the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Chechen rebels left an unexploded dirty bomb in a Moscow park
to frighten Russians, noted John Parachini, an analyst at the Rand Corp.
think tank in Washington. The event received wide publicity, he said,
though the radioactive level of the materials was so low that Russian
authorities "laughed it off."</TE>
<TE>   No conventional military is believed to keep dirty bombs because of
their ineffectiveness against troops.</TE>
<TE>   Yet few doubt that they are within the technical capabilities of major
terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. official said such devices are "fairly simple to make;
anyone who can come up with the material can build it. . . . The range of
entities that can do this is probably pretty broad."</TE>
<TE>   It is more complicated to use the devices effectively, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The user would need to figure out how powerful an explosive it would
take to spread enough radioactivity to contaminate an area, based on how
radioactive their materials were. Wind conditions and other factors also
would affect the blast.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of environmental variables that are hard to gauge,"
said Rand's Parachini.</TE>
<TE>   People near a dirty-bomb explosion could protect themselves from
low-level radioactivity by taking some simple precautions, such as
staying inside and taking showers, for example. Gas masks offer
protection as well.</TE>
<TE>   The difficult question for the authorities in such an attack would be
how much radioactivity exposure to accept.</TE>
<TE>   At a Senate hearing in March, Steven E. Koonin, provost of Caltech,
testified that under U.S. government guidelines the dispersion of a
fraction of a gram of a certain isotope over a square-mile area would
make the area uninhabitable.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, exposing the population to that quantity of the material would
only add four more cases of cancer per 100,000 people--in addition to the
20,000 cases that are statistically likely to result from all other
causes, Koonin testified.</TE>
<TE>   Koonin said he also could imagine an attack that exposed people in 100
square blocks of a business district to three times the acceptable level
of radioactivity. At that level, the attack would probably produce no
fatalities.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the area could be sealed off for months of
decontamination, and hundreds of thousands of people could be expected to
show up at hospitals for screening. Dozens of buildings might be razed
because of the difficulty of decontaminating them.</TE>
<TE>   "There would be billions of dollars of economic damage," Koonin said.</TE>

<HD>Colorado Calls Drought Emergency as Wildfires Multiply Rapidly</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>Gov. Bill Owens on Tuesday asked the federal government to declare
a drought emergency in Colorado, saying some areas are facing the driest
conditions in a century.</LD>
<LD>   He also released $450,000 in emergency funds to place 80 firefighters
on duty six weeks early and keep three tanker planes and 25 prisoners who
are trained to fight wildfires on standby.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a statewide emergency that requires a statewide response,"
Owens said.</LD>
<TE>   There have been 283 fires that have charred 7,600 acres in a wildfire
season that began two months early this year. In 2000, the worst fire
season in 50 years, there were 54 fires that burned 2,700 acres this
early in the season.</TE>
<TE>   Since October, precipitation has been below normal across much of the
West except for northern California and the Pacific Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman designated Montana a
drought disaster area, giving farmers eight months to apply for
low-interest emergency loans from the Farm Service Agency.</TE>

<HD>Nearly 100 Arrested in Airport Security Roundup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.
</DL>
<LD>Authorities arrested close to 100 workers Tuesday at airports
serving the nation's capital on charges they lied to obtain security
badges that gave them broad access to sensitive areas.</LD>
<LD>   Those arrested included construction workers, janitors, food workers
and at least two baggage screeners.</LD>
<LD>   Federal officials said that by day's end, or perhaps today, they
expected to have arrested at least 138 employees in a sweep called Fly
Trap at Washington Dulles International Airport and Ronald Reagan
Washington National Airport.</LD>
<TE>   At least one employee arrested already had been deported from the
United States but illegally returned and obtained an airport job,
authorities said. They said those arrested included at least one baggage
screener each at Reagan and Dulles airports.</TE>
<TE>   Ten other arrests--also on charges of immigration violations and
falsified employment applications--were made at Baltimore-Washington
International Airport. Seven people there had failed to disclose felony
convictions, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Reagan airport is closest to the Pentagon, which was struck Sept. 11
by American Airlines Flight 77 after the jet took off from Dulles with
five hijackers aboard. That crash killed 189 people on the plane and
inside the military headquarters in Washington's Virginia suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said the arrests, which followed sealed
indictments issued last week by a federal grand jury, "should be a
wake-up call for every airport in America." People arrested could face as
much as five years in prison and fines up to $250,000, and immigrants who
were caught without proper documentation could be deported.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me be clear," Ashcroft said. "There will be zero tolerance of
security breaches at our nation's airports."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Paul McNulty described Tuesday's raids as an
"anti-terrorism initiative" but said authorities have "no evidence at
this point of any connection of these individuals to any terrorist
organizations."</TE>
<TE>   McNulty also said authorities learned during the preceding weeks that
some of those arrested Tuesday had improper access to sensitive airport
areas. Authorities did not restrict their movements for fear of
undermining the investigation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the arrests targeted mostly construction workers, janitors
and food workers, who normally don't go near airplanes, Justice officials
defended the arrests as necessary. They said workers with illegally
obtained security badges could be blackmailed into cooperating with
terrorists.</TE>

<HD>New Guidelines Limit Extra Paps</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>New Pap test guidelines issued by a panel of experts could mean
fewer return visits and less anxiety for the millions of women whose
cervical cancer results come back inconclusive.</LD>
<LD>   Currently, many of the estimated 2.5 million American women a year
with abnormal but inconclusive results are given at least two follow-up
Pap tests within a year; a colposcopy test, in which the cervix is
examined and sometimes biopsied; or a test for the human papillomavirus,
or HPV, the chief cause of cervical cancer.</LD>
<LD>   The new guidelines say HPV testing alone should be the preferred
method for many women because it is more convenient for the patient. In
many cases, the HPV test can be done from the Pap test sample.</LD>
<TE>   If the HPV test is negative for the riskiest forms of the virus--as it
is in half of these women--the patient can be virtually assured she does
not have cancer and does not need follow-up testing, the experts said.</TE>
<TE>   By some estimates, that could save hundreds of millions of dollars a
year in health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines were created at a conference last year sponsored by the
American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology. Participants
included representatives from the American Cancer Society and the
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.</TE>
<TE>   "It should set a standard for how women with abnormal screening tests
should be handled," said a guideline co-author, Dr. L. Stewart Massad of
Chicago's Cook County Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines appear in today's Journal of the American Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   They reflect doctors' better understanding in recent years of HPV and
how a few high-risk strains of the virus are the primary cause of
cervical cancer.</TE>

<HD>House Panel Votes in Favor of Nevada Waste Site</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A House panel voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to override Nevada's
objections to building a nuclear waste disposal site at Yucca Mountain in
the state's desert.</LD>
<LD>   The 24-2 vote was the first congressional action on President Bush's
decision in February to approve the Yucca Mountain site 90 miles
northwest of Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   The action by the Energy and Commerce energy subcommittee signaled
that the House is ready to move swiftly to support the president's
decision despite Nevada's strong opposition.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal calls for the Yucca Mountain facility, which has yet to
get regulatory approval, to accept 77,000 tons of waste over 24 years,
beginning in 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Subcommittee chairman Joe Barton (R-Texas) said it would be a mistake
to "not let the process go forward." A final decision on the disposal
site will be made by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The full committee is expected to approve the resolution this week.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said he expects a floor vote
next week. The Senate has yet to take up the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Nevada lawmakers have focused their fight against the site on the
Senate, where the Democratic leadership opposes Yucca Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution gained broad bipartisan support in the subcommittee
with only Democrats--Reps. Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Bill
Luther of Minnesota--opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Ralph M. Hall (D-Texas) recalled the decision by Congress in 1987
to single out Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   "We took no pleasure in selecting a state [then] and it's not easy to
vote against friends of ours [from Nevada]. It's not easy to roll over
them," Hall said. But he said he is convinced the waste will be safer at
a single site than scattered around the country and that "the risks are
very low."</TE>
<TE>   Only Markey, a longtime critic of the Yucca Mountain site, spoke
extensively against the Bush decision, saying it was "based on politics
and not science." He said he had no confidence in members of Congress
deciding about the safety of the site.</TE>

<LD>Gold Line--A story in Thursday's California section said two public
officials had recommended that most crossings along the Pasadena-Los
Angeles light rail line be built "as designed." The officials' reports to
the state Public Utilities Commission said the structure of most
crossings on the so-called Gold Line can remain the same. But the
officials also recommended changes in operation of the line--including
slowing train speeds and limiting the sounding of train horns--to improve
safety and reduce noise at several crossings.</LD>

officials had recommended that most crossings along the Pasadena-Los
Angeles light rail line be built "as designed." The officials' reports to
the state Public Utilities Commission said the structure of most
crossings on the so-called Gold Line can remain the same. But the
officials also recommended changes in operation of the line--including
slowing train speeds and limiting the sounding of train horns--to improve
safety and reduce noise at several crossings.</LD>
