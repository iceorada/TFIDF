<LD>For now, we'll call it "Austin Powers, Part 3": New Line Cinema is in
trouble over planned use of "Austin Powers in Goldmember" as the
title for its summer release. Seems they didn't get clearance from
keepers of the "Goldfinger"/ James Bond properties.</LD>

<HD>For 'Greenlight,' Nothing Succeeds Like Failure</HD>

<LD>One of the great cottage industries of Hollywood is the endless
number of workshops, classes and seminars that promise untold riches
and fame to a multitude of wide-eyed wannabe writers and filmmakers.
You've seen all the preposterous come-ons: "How to Be a Hot
Screenwriter in 60 Days!" "How to Sell Your Script to Top Hollywood
Agents!" "How to Pitch a Movie No Studio Exec Can Resist!"</LD>
<LD>   Of course nobody teaches a class in "How to Mess Up Your First
Movie and Do It With Every Rookie Mistake Being Immortalized by a
Take-No-Prisoners Documentary Crew Eager to Make You Look as Inept as
Possible on Nationwide Television." Who would pay good money for
that?</LD>
<LD>   As it turns out, people everywhere, both inside and outside
Hollywood, have been getting their kicks following that class every
Sunday at 9:30 p.m. on HBO. It's a 12-part "reality TV" series called
"Project Greenlight" that documents the travails of neophyte
writer-director Pete Jones, an apple-cheeked former insurance
salesman from Chicago whose script about a friendship between two
schoolboys won a filmmaking competition created by Matt Damon and Ben
Affleck's production company. Jones' reward is the ultimate American
Dream, circa 2002: getting $1 million to turn his script, "Stolen
Summer," into a movie that will be distributed nationwide by Miramax
in March.</LD>
<TE>   Full of ego battles, weaselly back-stabbing and boneheaded
movie-making--imagine a cross between "Survivor" and "Day for Night,"
if it had been directed by Joe Eszterhas--the series is irresistibly
watchable because, like a great tell-all book, it slips behind the
iron curtain of the Hollywood publicity machinery. Those in the
industry have openly questioned the series' "reality," it being hard
to believe that anyone would surround a first-time director with such
an inexperienced crew.</TE>
<TE>   But HBO original programming chief Chris Albrecht says the series
has "exceeded our expectations in every way. I've got friends who
have nothing to do with show business who are totally caught up in
it, calling me and saying, 'Geez, I hate that Miramax guy' or 'I
can't believe what a mess Pete Jones got into last week.' The
audience has really got involved with the characters."</TE>
<TE>   With ratings up since HBO moved the series to its post-"Sex and
the City" time slot, the network has informally agreed to air a
"Greenlight" sequel that will film this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary, filmed by a team headed by Liz Bronstein, doesn't
skimp when it comes to wickedly entertaining examples of near-total
disaster. As New York Times critic Caryn James put it when the series
debuted in November: "You've never had so much fun watching someone
else fail."</TE>
<TE>   And oh boy, how they do fail! The first day of shooting finds
Jones underneath Chicago El tracks, trying to film a lengthy dialogue
scene with two 10-year-old boys, only to have the scene repeatedly
drowned out by passing trains. It turns out no one thought to bring
the soundman along when they scouted the location. Jones is the
hapless hero, indecisive one moment, digging in his heels the next.
When forced to compromise in the face of budget limitations, he
snaps, "Over my dead body!" so many times that one of his producers
finally advises him to "come up with a new phrase."</TE>
<TE>   As a bracing illustration of realpolitik filmmaking, the series is
required viewing, offering all sorts of practical lessons you won't
learn in those how-to-break-into-Hollywood seminars. Lesson No. 1:
Actors have all the power in Hollywood. When the producers realize
they need more money for the film, they are stymied at every turn by
cost-conscious Miramax execs. But Affleck picks up the phone and
instantly gets Harvey Weinstein to agree to a meeting. (Weinstein is
the only person smart enough--or powerful enough--to duck the
cameras. Asked why he was so camera-shy, he told me: "I thought it
was the cool thing to do to be the man of mystery, like in 'Charlie's
Angels.'")</TE>
<TE>   Even Aidan Quinn, who's hardly an A-list star, has plenty of
clout. The only reason the filmmakers get a 25-day shoot--five more
days than initially budgeted--is because Quinn made it a prerequisite
of his agreeing to do the film, believing the rookie director would
need all the extra days he could get. For himself, Quinn got a
dialogue coach, approval on the casting of the female lead and
back-end money. (Don't hold your breath on that one, pal!)</TE>
<TE>   The differences between Quinn and Matt &amp; Ben are striking: Damon
and Affleck are breezy and irreverent, smoking cigarettes and
drinking Samuel Adams beer, a nice plug for the series sponsor. Quinn
is wary and demanding--he's clearly a guy who's always had to fight
for whatever he got. Young writer-directors, take note: Always make
sure you can explain anything--and I mean anything--in the script to
your Method-obsessed actors. Exploring the firefighter he plays in
the '70s-era film, Quinn at one point asks Jones, "In your mind, was
this character in Vietnam?"</TE>
<TE>   Lesson No. 2: If you're shooting outdoors and it looks like rain,
make sure you have a backup set. Somehow the bumbling producers get
stuck without one and spend a day shooting a Little League game in
monsoon-like conditions. As the baseball field dissolves into mud,
everyone huddles under ponchos except Quinn, who decides his
blue-collar character wouldn't use an umbrella.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The series' success reaffirms our continuing fascination with
Hollywood ineptness and failure, a formula that has also helped books
like Steven Bach's "Final Cut" and Kim Masters and Nancy Griffin's
"Hit and Run" become bestsellers. But people who work in the
industry, perhaps worried that viewers will think them all dolts,
question whether the filmmakers' blunders are truly natural disasters
or manipulated for the benefit of the TV cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Did Miramax and the "Greenlight" team put the fix in when they
decided to pick a script that saddled a rookie director with a triple
whammy: a period film, shot on location with kids who can work only
five hours a day and surrounded by a largely inexperienced crew.</TE>
<TE>   As one line producer I know put it: "If you have a first-time
director, you surround him with experienced people, not weak,
untested producers and a cinematographer who's never shot a studio
film." Another fan of the show, Liz Dubelman, an Emmy Award-winning
director and producer-turned- media consultant, says, "For me, the El
scene was a pivotal moment. You didn't need a soundman to figure out
you can't shoot a conversation under an El track. It's when I started
not to believe that the documentary cameras weren't affecting
everything."</TE>
<TE>   Although Quinn was at the Sundance Film Festival, helping promote
"Stolen Summer," the actor was so incensed when he saw how he was
portrayed in the series that he recently wrote a three-page letter to
Miramax TV and the "Greenlight" team contending that most of his
scenes were taken out of context, making him appear arrogant and
controlling.</TE>
<TE>   In fairness, nearly everyone comes off pretty badly. That includes
the Miramax TV execs who, at a time when Weinstein is scrambling to
position his company as returning to its art-house roots, choose an
accessible script over a more ambitious art-house screenplay, saying
Jones' script is "a more open story people all over the country will
appreciate." Even Chris Moore, who is the film's chief producer and
Matt &amp; Ben's "Greenlight" partner, looks like a heel. He blows up at
everybody so often in the series that he acknowledges that "everyone
watching thinks I'm the ass. Newsweek called me the 'crafty heavy.'"</TE>
<TE>   Moore says nothing was staged for the cameras. But he admits there
were instances--specifically a key meeting between Jones and one of
his producers--when the participants were allowed to confer without
the presence of cameras. The series' demands for juicy drama put
Moore in a difficult bind. As the one battle-tested producer on the
film, Moore could've stepped in and fixed a lot of the on-set
problems.</TE>
<TE>   But a smooth-running movie would've made a dull documentary. So
Moore is constantly seen letting everyone make mistakes--and then
loudly berating them afterward. During one critical juncture, when
all hell is breaking loose, he wanders off to a nearby playground to
shoot hoops.</TE>
<TE>   "The one person Matt and Ben asked ahead of time not to solve all
the problems was me," says Moore, who worked with the pair on "Good
Will Hunting." "We had a crucial conversation before we pitched the
show where we essentially decided that I wouldn't step in and help or
call in favors and bring in a more experienced crew. Believe me, it
was killing me not to put my foot down and say, 'Hey, you guys are
being unbelievable morons!'" (Moore has become such an outsized
character that the series is now sponsoring a video contest for the
best impression of the volcanic producer.)</TE>
<TE>   Moore says the prospect of having documentary cameras on hand made
it difficult to attract actors and crew for the shoot. "There were
definitely people who didn't audition or meet with the director
because they wouldn't sign releases [for the documentary]." He says
it was also "a nightmare" persuading Miramax execs to appear on
camera. "But we told them that if Matt and Ben were going to be on
camera, then they had to do it too." Of course all this attention
hasn't hurt Miramax; the company made a profit just from selling the
series to HBO.</TE>
<TE>   As a TV viewer, I have no quarrel with the series' nod 'n' wink
approach to reality, which seems far less staged than the "reality"
on display on shows like "Survivor." But I bet it'll be a lot harder
to get experienced people on camera for a "Greenlight" sequel, even
if Miramax is willing to promise another $1-million budget and
guarantee a theatrical release. It turns out that making movies is a
lot like making sausages; it can get pretty ugly inside the kitchen.</TE>

<HD>Tribute Concert DVDs Go Beyond Being Footnotes</HD>
<DH>A recording of the  Sept. 21 telethon displays remarkable
power, as does a 'Concert for  New York City' disc.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"America: A Tribute to Heroes" on DVD is a reminder of how much the
nation was in shock in the days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
on New York and the Pentagon. That element alone establishes
"Tribute" as one of the great concert documents ever.</LD>
<LD>   The power of the DVD shows that many of us have been wrong in
assuming that neither the music on CD nor the accompanying visuals on
DVD could recapture the drama of the moment when, just 10 days after
the attacks, some of our most celebrated musicians gathered in Los
Angeles, New York and London for a telethon to rally our spirits and
raise money for families of the rescue workers and others who died in
the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   That assumption may be the reason the telethon album has met with
such tepid commercial response.</LD>
<TE>   Despite featuring some of the biggest names in the pop world,
including U2, Bruce Springsteen, Celine Dion and Dave Matthews, the
two-disc "Tribute" set has only sold about 600,000 copies and has
slid to No. 59 on the sales chart.</TE>
<TE>   The second charity disc--"The Concert for New York City," which is
from the Oct. 20 spectacular at Madison Square Garden that featured
such celebrated rock veterans as Paul McCartney, Elton John and the
Who--has sold only about 400,000 copies and is languishing at No.
130.</TE>
<TE>   Even the DVD and video versions of the telethon, which have been
available since late November, have sold only about 100,000
copies--on a par with the latest Britney Spears and U2 videos. The
DVD and video editions of the New York City concert arrive in stores
today.</TE>
<TE>   Believing that the "Tribute" DVD would be just a footnote to the
original broadcast, I even waited until receiving an advance copy of
the "New York City" DVD over the weekend to watch it.</TE>
<TE>   My surprise was immediate.</TE>
<TE>   First, the sound and picture quality is so extraordinary in the
"Tribute" and "New York City" packages that it's like seeing the
programs on a new, absorbing level. Most remarkable, however, is how
many details I had missed in the telethon by focusing on the artists'
messages of healing and resilience.</TE>
<TE>   I was concentrating so hard on the words to Springsteen's
unreleased song, "My City of Ruins," that I didn't even notice that
three members of the E Street Band were among the background singers.
Neil Young was so captivating on John Lennon's "Imagine" that I was
oblivious to the live orchestra. I even missed that U2 had a fifth
member for the night, guitarist Dave Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, I had missed Bono's lyric change in "Peace on Earth,"
which U2 used as a prelude that night to "Walk On."</TE>
<TE>   On the band's latest album, "All That You Can't Leave Behind," the
tone of "Peace on Earth" is bitter--a statement of despair over the
continuing use of violence to solve disputes between countries and
religious factions. On the album, a disillusioned Bono sings, "Sick
of sorrow/Sick of pain/Sick of hearing again and again/That there's
gonna be peace on earth."</TE>
<TE>   To provide more hope on the telethon, he turned the line upside
down by making it a slap at disillusionment, "Sick of hearing again
and again/That there's never gonna be peace on earth."</TE>
<TE>   Equally surprising is how some artists who aren't as acclaimed as
U2 and Young rose to the occasion. Faith Hill sounded unusually
soulful on "There Will Come a Day," while Celine Dion showed
surprising restraint on "God Bless America." Limp Bizkit's Fred
Durst, often portrayed as the poster boy of goofball rock, was
strikingly tender teaming with the Goo Goo Dolls' John Rzeznik on
Pink Floyd's "Wish You Were Here."</TE>
<TE>   Also contributing to the continuing punch of "Tribute" is the
imaginative staging, which achieved a gripping intimacy and starkness
by eliminating such customary elements as a studio audience and even
the introduction of the performers.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the nonmusical factors are often the most touching
elements in "The Concert for New York City" DVD, notably the repeated
scenes of widows, children and co-workers talking about or holding up
photos of colleagues or loved ones among the police, firefighters and
rescue workers killed in the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   It's still moving to see Yankee manager Joe Torre standing next to
a youngster who speaks about missing his father and Jim Carrey
holding up a photo of a missing rescue worker and saying, "That's
what a hero looks like."</TE>
<TE>   Years from now, we're still likely to marvel at the sight of Billy
Crystal trying gallantly to make us feel that it was OK to laugh
again.</TE>
<TE>   Life has moved on since Sept. 11, but these concerts show a moment
unprecedented in American history, and my new assumption is that
they're going to maintain their power for decades.</TE>

<LD>   British Academy Nods Announced</LD>
<LD>   The very British "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" (called
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" in England) failed to make
the list of nominations for best film in the Orange British Academy
Film Awards nominations, announced Monday at BAFTA headquarters in
London. The junior-wizard epic did, however, make the nominations
list for best British film. Joining "Harry Potter" on the nominee
list for the Alexander Korda Award for Outstanding British Film of
the Year are "Bridget Jones's Diary," "Gosford Park," "Iris" and "Me
Without You."</LD>
<TE>   "The Lord of the Rings" and "Moulin Rouge," both of which made the
best film list, led with 12 nominations each. The rest of the film
nominees were "Gosford Park" (nine nominations), "Amelie" (nine), "A
Beautiful Mind" and "Shrek."</TE>
<TE>   "Ring" nominations included English stage veteran Ian McKellen for
his turn as Gandalf the Grey. "Moulin Rouge" star Nicole Kidman got
an actress nomination, not for "Moulin" but the eerie ghost story
"The Others." Russell Crowe received an actor nomination for "A
Beautiful Mind"; Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson both were nominated
for "In the Bedroom"; Renee Zellweger was selected for "Bridget
Jones." British acting nominees include Judi Dench, Jim Broadbent,
Maggie Smith, Kate Winslet, Colin Firth and Hugh Bonneville.</TE>

<TE>   Hagen Sidelined From Broadway Run by Illness</TE>
<TE>   The planned Broadway production of "Six Dance Lessons in Six
Weeks," starring Uta Hagen as a lonely widow in a Florida retirement
community and David Hyde Pierce as her dance teacher, will be delayed
until next season due to Hagen's current health problems. Although
press representatives for the show would offer no specifics on her
illness, it was reported that she suffered a stroke following the
highly successful engagement of the Richard Alfieri play last year at
Westwood's Geffen Playhouse, which ended in August. The Broadway
production, to be directed by Arthur Allan Seidelman, had been
announced for an April 28th opening at the Booth Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   'Ellen Show' Future Doesn't Look Good</TE>
<TE>   In a move that foreshadows the show's demise, CBS has cut back its
episodic order of "The Ellen Show," the first-year sitcom starring
comedian Ellen DeGeneres. The series, in which DeGeneres plays an
urbanite who moves back to her folksy hometown, has averaged a
disappointing 5.9 million viewers, whether airing Friday nights or
Mondays, where CBS attempted to jump-start the series a few times on
its big night of comedy. CBS won't officially say the show has been
canceled, but the network shut down production and pulled the sitcom
from its February sweeps--standard procedure toward cancellation.</TE>
<TE>   But Surely He Already Knew This Was Coming</TE>
<TE>   Psychic medium John Edward, host of the telepathic syndicated talk
show "Crossing Over With John Edward," has signed an agreement with
Studios USA Programming to develop a one-hour dramatic series.
According to the studio, the drama is about a man who "wrestles with
coming to terms with his psychic gift." Edward, author of the books
"One Last Time," "What If God Were the Sun" and "Crossing Over: The
Stories Behind the Stories," has said he had out-of-body experiences
and hosted visits from dead relatives during his childhood on Long
Island.</TE>

<TE>   Graves Still-Life on Reverse Side of Painting</TE>
<TE>   A long-lost still-life by Morris Graves, the last of the
"Northwest Mystics," has been found on the back of a painting he made
in 1936, Seattle Art Museum officials say.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Seattle Times, the discovery was made while
Nicholas Dorman, the museum's painting conservator, was cleaning the
surface of Graves' "Ancient Anthem" in preparation for shipment to
Germany, for a show set to open next month. Noticing a slight split
in the cardboard backing, he looked closer and discovered an untitled
still-life with the same type of palette and technique as Graves'
early work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful feeling to find a painting instead of a few
brushstrokes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Fox Valley, Ore., Graves gained national attention 60

<HD>Imago Theatre Sets Out to Play a Mind Game With Audience</HD>
<DH>Dance* Blending mime, movement and masks, this company
fools the eye and tweaks the brain.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If your mind is telling you one thing, but your eyes are telling you
another, you may be looking at one of the funny, fantastical
creatures created by Carol Triffle and Jerry Mouawad, founders and
co-directors of Imago Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Take the Larvabatic, one of their creations in the "Frogz" program
Friday at Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks like some slug doing some incredible acrobatic feats
that are impossible," Mouawad said recently from company offices in
Portland, Ore.</LD>
<TE>   That's because the performer's foot is masked to look like a hand
and his hand to look like a foot.</TE>
<TE>   "Mind and sight are doing different things to us. You're shocking
yourself into belief and disbelief."</TE>
<TE>   Shocking, or rather, delighting people is something Triffle and
Mouawad have been doing for years. The two met while studying
performing and visual arts in Portland in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Triffle went on to study with--and eventually become an assistant
to--Parisian mime master and teacher Jacques Lecoq. (Julie "The Lion
King" Taymor is another Lecoq disciple.)</TE>
<TE>   "The first year, you learn theater mostly by not talking," Triffle
said. "You learn how important everything is before you talk. If an
actor doesn't learn that, you may never see anything else when he
comes onstage. You could close your eyes and you wouldn't miss
anything."</TE>
<TE>   Taking nonverbal communication as a given, they founded the
movement- and mask-based Imago Theatre in 1979, first touring small
communities in the Northwest but within six years becoming successful
enough to tour internationally as well. The two married in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pretty well known for work that is idiosyncratic and takes
the set design or the lighting design and makes it not a supportive
element but a more integral and necessary element," Mouawad said.</TE>
<TE>   They staged Jean-Paul Sartre's "No Exit," for instance, on a
17-square-foot wooden deck suspended on a single point 3 feet off the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   "It would start to tip slowly if you went over the balance point,"
Mouawad said. "Every change, every character coming in ... I don't
want to say that it was physically represented, but it physicalized
the drama as the characters experienced it."</TE>
<TE>   Their show about giant frogs and other creatures, originally
called "Frogs, Lizards, Orbs and Slinkys," metamorphosed into the
current "Frogz."</TE>
<TE>   Some people have described it as a trip to a strange zoo.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of it is like that," Mouawad said. "If you go to a zoo and
see a creature you've never seen before, your response would not
likely be 'Why?' but 'Wow. What is that? What is it doing? How is it
doing it?' That sense of awe of the universe we try to create
onstage, with pure humor, pure fun."</TE>
<TE>   Said Triffle: "We put very real creatures in very unreal
situations and keep the pathos going. It becomes unbelievably
absurd."</TE>
<TE>   "Frogz" has five performers and two technicians. (Triffle and
Mouawad still perform, but not in this show.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's always the same; it's always different," Mouawad said.
"There's a very firm, strong structure in the piece. From that, the
performers are always asked to come alive, form spontaneities from
events."</TE>
<TE>   Their company has a core ensemble of nine and operates on an
annual budget of about $600,000, with 70% coming from ticket sales
and touring revenue, the rest from government, corporations,
foundations and private individuals.</TE>
<TE>   The Fullerton performance is part of a three-month national tour
that will end at New York's off-Broadway New Victory Theatre. It will
be their second engagement there.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried to close the show 10 years ago and work on other
things," Mouawad said. "But it was impossible. Our audiences tend to
thrive on it, and our presenters won't let it close."</TE>
<TE>   The two keep it fresh by adding new pieces, and also by looking at
new ways to bring animation onto the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago, we created a new piece by looking at a simple
paper bag. We spent several thousand dollars creating a [large] paper
bag that comes to life."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Imago Theatre will present "Frogz" on Friday at 8 p.m. at Plummer
Auditorium, 201 E. Chapman Ave., Fullerton. Part of Cal State
Fullerton's PAIR (Professional Artists in Residence) Celebrity

<HD>A Fascinating Display  of Buddhist Dancing</HD>

<BD>TIMES DANCE CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a thousand years, a caste of Buddhist priests in the Katmandu
valley of Nepal has practiced a form of meditation involving dancing,
trance and the invocation of Tantric deities. An inheritor of this
tradition, Prajwal Ratna Vajracharya demonstrated five of its dances
in a fascinating Sunday program sponsored by the Himalayan Arts and
Cultural Council at the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   Known as Charya Nritya (dance as a spiritual practice), this idiom
remained largely secret until the late 1950s; public performances
since then have led to the adoption of costumes and other theatrical
aids drawn from Nepalese religious paintings and sculpture. In the
process, dances in which the priest attempts to be transformed or
possessed by the forms and energies of Buddhist divinities have
assumed a new role as education or entertainment for non-initiates.</LD>
<LD>   Preceded by a parade of Nepalese clothing, the Sunday solos
displayed links to Indian classicism in many characteristic stances
and the use of mudras (hand-language). Taped Sanskrit singing,
cymbals and sometimes drumming accompanied the dancer.</LD>
<TE>   Except in a jumping, stamping personification of the lion-headed
goddess Singhamukhi,  he remained unmasked, his features usually
frozen, apart from darting eyes. Smooth clockwise turns occurred in
all the solos, though the wrathful god Vajrapani whirled in
alternating directions and introduced grotesque facial expressions.</TE>
<TE>   Gestural refinement and majestic poses dominated more serene
dances, such as the one invoking the compassionate Lokeshvara and the
introductory Mayanjala Time solo. But in nearly all the repertory,
his limbs quivered with the transforming power of divine energy. In
the words of the ancient instructions read by narrator Josh Brody,
"One should meditatively derive bliss from bliss."</TE>
<TE>   Prajwal Ratna Vajracharya offers a workshop in Buddhist dance at
10 a.m., Sunday. Pacific Asia Museum, 46 N. Los Robles Ave.,
Pasadena. $36. (626) 449-2742.</TE>

<HD>Rhapsody in Two</HD>
<DH>The works of Gershwin blend surprisingly well with two such
disparate composers as Purcell and Schoenberg.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Something's up.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday afternoon, an early music group joined George Gershwin with
Henry Purcell. Sunday night, a cabaret act joined Gershwin with
Arnold Schoenberg.</LD>
<LD>   Is Gershwin's music really so universal that it shakes hands with
17th century English music as well with that of a contemporary German
Modernist? Do Gershwin's blue notes bend on gut strings and hold
their own in the face of 12-tone rigor? For the most part, yes.</LD>
<TE>   Although both took place in clubs, the two concerts had nothing to
do with each other. The first, sponsored by Chamber Music in Historic
Sites, was an appearance by Fuoco e Cenere (Fire and Ashes) and young
Israeli mezzo-soprano Rinat Shaham at the Ebell of Los Angeles, once
headquarters of the nation's largest women's club. The second concert
was at the Knitting Factory, a cutting-edge rock and jazz club that
was hired out by the Los Angeles Philharmonic for a
Schoenberg-Gershwin cabaret, with Michael Feinstein.</TE>
<TE>   "Fantasy in Blue," the program by Fuoco e Cenere, was the result
of a late-night reverie by the ensemble's leader, wrote Jay Bernfeld
in his program note. Recording Purcell at 3 a.m. in Paris, Bernfeld,
who is one of the jazzier early music players, suddenly began to feel
some of Purcell's themes had certain Gershwin-esque turns.</TE>
<TE>   It then occurred to him that the two composers led parallel lives.
Both died in their late 30s, before they could fully realize their
potential. Both were men of the theater, who wrote hit songs with
great ease and always had successful shows running on Broadway or
Drury Lane. Both had ambitions to be taken more seriously. They were
inspired melodists and harmonic colorists.</TE>
<TE>   But the sense of "Fantasy in Blue," which is also a recording soon
to be released in the U.S., is that just about anything works
together if you care about it enough to perform it really well.</TE>
<TE>   It was actually only a mild novelty to hear four viols accompany
Shaham in "Embraceable You," and Bernfeld's elegant embellishments of
the melodic line were an easy bridge between Baroque and blues. "A
Foggy Day" might have been written for Purcellian viols. A recorder
bends notes naturally and Patricia Lavail caught just the right
mournful tone for the middle section of the Prelude No. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Shaham added yet another style to the mix. An opera singer a shade
too grand for either Gershwin or Purcell, she expressed emotions for
the proscenium stage, not an intimate chamber.</TE>
<TE>   But she is also a very persuasive singer, with a gorgeous amber
tone and a voice both powerful and flexible. The thrilling passion
she brought to "My Man's Gone" from Gershwin's opera "Porgy and Bess"
and Dido's Lament from Purcell's opera "Dido and Aeneas" really did
demonstrate kindred spirits across the centuries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gershwin and Schoenberg actually were kindred spirits and, for the
few years they both lived here, Hollywood's most notable odd couple.
They played tennis together.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gershwin never actually studied with Schoenberg, he
looked up to him as a student does a master. And Schoenberg--who knew
a good tune when he heard one (and wrote a few himself)--took a near
paternal pride in the popular composer's innate musicality.</TE>
<TE>   The Knitting Factory event began with an extended skit by
musicologist Christopher Hailey, which dramatized the relationship
between Schoenberg (Kurtwood Smith) and Gershwin (Barry Pearl), along
with wisecracking pianist and composer Oscar Levant (Michael
Tucci)--Gershwin's best friend and a Schoenberg pupil who brought the
two famous composers together.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Stein, the contemporary musician who was closest to
Schoenberg, made a cameo appearance. John de Lancie directed.
Everyone was convincing in what could be developed into a marvelous
play.</TE>
<TE>   Gershwin visits Schoenberg in his studio. The year is 1937, and
Gershwin, recently deceased, is a ghost. Levant is hanging around.</TE>
<TE>   Schoenberg and Gershwin fondly debate music high and low; Levant
keeps ghost and master down to earth. Much of the dialogue came from
Levant's memoirs, but also from Schoenberg's writings. Its witty
repartee reveals a great deal about Schoenberg and Gershwin, as men
and musicians, and about their times.</TE>
<TE>   Stein, Schoenberg's assistant, suddenly appears. He sits at the
piano and blows everyone's minds when he reveals that Gershwin's
Prelude No. 1 and the Prelude to Schoenberg's Suite, Opus 25, both
begin with the same melodic motif. It sounds good both ways, 12-tone
or blues. (And it also had sounded good, Purcell fashion, when the
Gershwin prelude was played on viols earlier in the day.)</TE>
<TE>   For the second half, Feinstein sang Schoenberg's "Brettl-Lieder,"
the cabaret songs the composer wrote as a young man in Berlin. They
fall somewhere between Johann Strauss and Kurt Weill, engaging tunes
with subtle complexities and licentious texts.</TE>
<TE>   Musically, these songs go beyond Feinstein's technique. But he had
the advantage of an excellent accompanist, Armen Guzelimian, alert to
both the humor and the seriousness of the music.</TE>
<TE>   He also had the advantage of knowing how to put over a song in an
extravagant fashion. To watch him exploit the sequence of
blush-making double entendres in "The Easily Satisfied Lover" (the
songs were sung in English translation) is to learn firsthand about
the earthy, downright erotic side of Schoenberg that is so often
overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   To close, Feinstein sang Gershwin ("By Strauss" and "Of Thee I
Sing") his way--which is 180 degrees from Shaham's, a world apart
from Schoenberg or Purcell. Yet, somehow, it seemed neither more
right nor wrong. The performances simply worked on their own terms,
which was clearly the lesson of the day and our age.</TE>

<HD>'Nova' Reveals Secrets of Fireworks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It began with Chinese alchemists mixing compounds more than 1,000
years ago, but the enduring, evolving art of fireworks seems
picture-perfect for today's world of big-screen TV. An eye-catching
"Nova" explores the history, science and artistry of "Fireworks!"
(tonight at 8, PBS).</LD>
<LD>   Modern fireworks makers and exhibitors still rely on ancient
alchemy and old family secrets, but they also use such high-tech
tools as digital launch controls to create pyrotechnic symphonies for
crowds with ever-rising expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Pelkey, the man behind last year's Independence Day gala in
Boston, explains how much more there is than meets the eye. Those mad
splashes of color don't choreograph themselves to each piano stroke
of "Great Balls of Fire."</LD>
<TE>   While coordinating 3.5 tons of pyrotechnics, Pelkey has to sweat
wind conditions, crowd control and other headaches. No wonder he
carries a container of Advil.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Wally Glenn, Web designer by day, "Pyroboy" by night:
Donning a Kevlar suit and a harness full of explosives, he becomes a
dancing pyrotechnic display. The key, he says, is in knowing enough
about chemicals to create brilliant blues and greens while avoiding
spontaneous combustion.</TE>
<TE>   These pros take their incendiary craft seriously. Says one
fireworks planner: "We're responsible for sucking the emotion out of
every man, woman and child."</TE>
<TE>   In true "Nova" style, the show has just enough science to satisfy
a layperson's curiosity. We learn the once elusive secret to color
(using potassium chlorate for a fiercer burn) and the varied shapes
that help make fireworks screech, whistle and bang on cue.</TE>
<TE>   Half a year before the Fourth of July may seem like an odd airdate
but, with its spirit of celebratory patriotism, this episode couldn't
be more timely.</TE>

<DL>HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The two actors are awash in a stark light while everyone outside
camera range is in shadows. Even amid the relative darkness, you can
make out the young faces of eager students in Studio A in Hofstra
University's Dempster Hall.</LD>
<LD>   But among students clad in jeans, sneakers and sweats, one figure
casts a decidedly different aesthetic.</LD>
<LD>   He wears an orange turtleneck sweater and green sweatshirt under a
tan wool suit--in deference to the chill in the cavernous studio. His
brown tweed cap is jauntily cocked to the side. Black, wire-rimmed,
round glasses frame his dark, expressive eyes. His relatively smooth
brown face, belying his 69 years, is accented by a trim gray beard.
He chomps on an ever-present, though unlighted, cigar as he observes
the scene unfold on a monitor.</LD>
<TE>   "Cut," booms Melvin Van Peebles, the groundbreaking filmmaker who
wrote, directed, scored and produced "Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss
Song" in 1971. Melvin Van Peebles the dramatist ("Ain't Supposed to
Die a Natural Death"), the writer in two languages, the stockbroker,
the performance artist (he talk-sings, backed by a jazz-based trio,
Roadkill, in a genre he once described to an interviewer as a fusion
of rock, R&amp;B, pop and Broadway standards that he simply called
"Melvin"). It might just be simpler to call him an original.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so close to being perfect, let's get it perfect," Van
Peebles tells the students. "His white shoes were overpowering
everything in the scene," Van Peebles says of an actor. He tells
student director Meghan Boulger, "You don't want visual distractions
to take away from what you've got."</TE>
<TE>   It is a lesson Boulger, 22, a film major who hopes for a career in
post-production editing, readily absorbs. "I hadn't even thought
about it. I didn't notice. He was able to point out the details."</TE>
<TE>   Van Peebles has taken on a new role as a visiting professor,
joining Hofstra professors Nancy Kaplan from the audio/video/film
department and Rawleigh Moreland of the drama department to
team-teach a special course, "Acting for Film and Television," being
held this month between the winter and spring semesters. Van Peebles
is with the 18 students two days out of the four days a week the
class is held. Each class lasts four hours.</TE>
<TE>   The class is a pilot program focusing on the processes and
techniques used in preparing and acting for the camera, the syllabus
says.</TE>
<TE>   Van Peebles says it's merely preparing students for "real life" in
the industry.</TE>
<TE>   It stems from a suggestion from a Hofstra alumna, actress Susan
Sullivan, who co-stars on the hit television show "Dharma and Greg,"
said George Back, dean of Hofstra's School of Communication.</TE>
<TE>   "Acting is acting, whether on stage or in front of a camera,"
Sullivan said recently in a telephone interview. But, she said, there
are different skills to be employed between, say, doing Shakespeare
and "reading Tylenol copy for a commercial."</TE>
<TE>   There is different terminology to learn, affirmed drama professor
Moreland, and a different environment to become accustomed to.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan's suggestion, backed by a financial contribution toward
the course as a way of "giving back" to Hofstra, was heartily
endorsed by Back, who sought to meld the "component parts" of working
in front of and behind the camera.</TE>
<TE>   Back said Hofstra was interested in bringing in "a person who had
the experience of doing it." And Van Peebles, who has lectured and
performed at the university in recent years, came to mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known Melvin for 20 years," Back said. "He's an organic,
walking media outlet."</TE>
<TE>   For Van Peebles, Creativity Ahead</TE>
<TE>   Van Peebles' name certainly stirred recognition among the
students, though many were more familiar with the work of Van
Peebles' actor-director son Mario. But Steve Priest, 20, a sophomore
majoring in TV and film, said he relished the opportunity to be face
to face with someone of such experience.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan, who has worked as a stage manager for television shows,
said she was excited to be involved because of the interdisciplinary
nature of the course. Besides, she added, "We're having a lot of fun
with it." And she's taking "copious notes" for the future.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan hailed Van Peebles' instincts as a teacher, in his first
experience as an instructor. Often, "he whispers in my ear," Kaplan
said of Van Peebles. "'You see how the light is doing this. Let's
leave that because that's a lesson.'"</TE>
<TE>   For Van Peebles, life seems full of creativity ahead. His most
recent film, shown at festivals in 2000, is a French-Dutch production
called "A Belly Full." He said he's exploring putting together a film
distribution company. He's contemplating writing his own
"unauthorized autobiography," he said in that sly, mischievous manner
that informs much of his work.</TE>
<TE>   He said he enjoys whatever he's involved in. And at this moment,
it's teaching at Hofstra. The students "are eager and that's made it
easier," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then he heads toward Studio A for more life lessons to impart.</TE>

<HD>Bush Must See Past the Acts of Terror to the Root Causes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAM E. FULLER</AU>
<BD>Graham E. Fuller is a former vice chairman of the
National Intelligence Council at the CIA.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Israeli-Palestinian situation has moved into what can only be
described as a stage of collective madness. And Washington is walking
right down that same path, apparently unaware of or unconcerned about
the abyss yawning ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Two basic schools of thought exist. One says: Unacceptable
terrorism is running rampant in Israel and nothing can be done until
the terror is brought under control or eliminated. The other view
says: The core of the problem is 35 years of harsh and humiliating
occupation. Ending the occupation is the sole means of beginning to
attain peace.</LD>
<LD>   The first view has triumphed; the second has been largely
silenced. And things are deteriorating fast.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is committed to the first
view. He believes he can crush Palestinian terrorism and is using
extreme military power to do so. The Bush administration over the
past month seemingly has accepted this rationale--a tragedy for
Washington, Israel and the Palestinians because the terror isn't
abating but increasing. Washington is treating only the symptoms of
the massive Palestinian frustration: bitterness, impotence and rage.</TE>
<TE>   Does Israel face a problem of terrorism? You bet. It is appalling
that Israeli citizens are being blown up in discos, pizza parlors and
public streets. Israelis justifiably are bitter and angry.</TE>
<TE>   But conditions in the West Bank and Gaza also have never been
worse. Palestinians are reacting violently as the rat cage tightens.</TE>
<TE>   Tragically, the most unspeakable terrorism against Israelis will
be applauded by virtually every Palestinian until their own
desperation is alleviated and their sovereign state has been
established.</TE>
<TE>   In treating the symptoms and not the cause, President Bush is
participating and contributing to the isolation, humiliation and
destruction of Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon believes that Arafat's elimination is desirable, and most
of the Israeli Cabinet is ready to assassinate him. Washington
effectively acquiesces to the Sharon strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Few have sympathy for Arafat, who has made more than his fair
share of stupid mistakes in his long political career to preserve the
Palestinian cause. The problem, however, is not Arafat but the
Palestinian reality he reflects. The Palestinian Authority is corrupt
and ineffective. If Israel is about to eliminate Arafat, fine, as
long as Sharon and Bush are convinced that what succeeds him will be
better, more malleable.</TE>
<TE>   To disabuse yourself of this view, read Khalil Shikaki's analysis
of the next generation of Palestinian leadership in January's Foreign
Affairs. That generation is more aggressive, more determined to move
to armed struggle and more willing to cooperate with Hamas as an
indispensable political and military ally. Hamas has never been
stronger, thanks to current conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Did Arafat or his lieutenants seek to import arms to bolster the
armed struggle? Almost certainly; all national liberation movements
do.</TE>
<TE>   Is terrorism on the rise? Of course, because the Palestinians have
no other vehicle of resistance. That does not justify it, but
terrible political violence is emerging from the Israeli side as
well, even if not technically terrorism. Bush's own war on terrorism
is hostage to the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Lest these views appear one-sided, listen to Ami Ayalon, for four
years the director of Shin Bet, the Israeli version of the FBI:
"Israeli society, top to bottom, is sinking into confusion.... People
mask this reality with swaggering slogans: 'We will vanquish
terrorism!' There are today more Palestinian terrorists than a year
ago and there will be even more tomorrow....</TE>
<TE>   "In Israel, no one is in touch with reality.... Why is the problem
not resolved? Reoccupying the Palestinian Authority lands, and
killing Arafat, what would that change? Those who want victory want
an unending war....</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who [equates] Arafat with [Osama] bin Laden understands
neither Arafat nor Bin Laden.... We say the Palestinians behave like
'madmen,' but it is not madness but a bottomless despair....</TE>
<TE>   "I favor unconditional withdrawal from the territories--preferably
in the context of an agreement, but not necessarily."</TE>
<TE>   Should Bush listen to these powerful insights from Shin Bet? Or is
he hostage to an agenda that looks only at the terror and not its
cause?</TE>

<HD>A Walk in the Valley of Greed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What would Jesus do? It's a no-brainer; he would leave the Christian
Coalition, take a consulting job with Enron and then use his divine
power to make George W. Bush president.</LD>
<LD>   Read that way, there's nothing sinister in the recent revelation
that it was Bush's top political advisor, Karl Rove, who in 1997
hooked up former Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed with Enron.
After eight years of making Pat Robertson look good, Reed was
exhausted and ready for a career change. The private sector is even
more lucrative than televangelism, and Enron was just one of many fat
consulting contracts that was Reed's for the asking.</LD>
<LD>   For the Bush people, it was also a good deal. George W. was still
a few years away from announcing for the presidency. In the meantime,
it wouldn't hurt to park the former spokesman for the Christian right
with the Bushies' close friends at Enron.</LD>
<TE>   Think of the synergy in that relationship. Two years later, when
the campaign was officially announced, Reed would be added to the
Bush payroll without having to sever his ties to Enron, since there
were lots of other folks in the Bush camp doing the same thing. Reed
knew that Bush would win because "He (God) knew that George Bush had
the ability to lead in this compelling way."</TE>
<TE>   But in the interim, a fellow has bills to pay and that Enron
consulting job--which paid $10,000 to $20,000 a month and lasted
until Enron's bankruptcy--was a nice little favor.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that's not the way White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer sees it. He 'fesses up that "Karl Rove gave Ralph Reed a
good recommendation" for the Enron job but insists that was only
because he was the most qualified. "Ralph Reed is excellent at what
he does," Fleischer opined.</TE>
<TE>   Makes perfect sense. What Reed did before entering the private
sector was spread the message of the Gospel, and of course that's
exactly what Enron was looking for. Particularly the commandment that
says, "Thou shall not honestly report corporate profits." Or the
other one, "Thou shall not regulate electricity."</TE>
<TE>   Reed hit the corporate ground running: "I met with three
executives at Enron in September of 1997. They wanted assistance in
building grass-roots support for electricity deregulation in
Pennsylvania, which was supported by then-Gov. Tom Ridge and which,
by the way, has become a model for the nation."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, Reed was expected to mobilize the state's Christian
right to support deregulation. Unfortunately, Reed is right about
Enron's approach to deregulation becoming a model for the nation--all
the way to California and bust.</TE>
<TE>   But why be so modest? It was a hard sell. Otherwise Enron wouldn't
have had to spend all those millions lobbying, not to mention
bringing out the big guns, such as then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, to
make its case.</TE>
<TE>   A month after Reed came on board, as Enron's erstwhile chief
executive, Kenneth Lay, tells it, "I called George W. to kind of tell
him what was going on, and I said that it would be very helpful to
Enron, which is obviously a huge company in the state of Texas, if he
could just call the governor [of Pennsylvania] and tell him [Enron]
is a serious company, this is a professional company, a good
company."</TE>
<TE>   Darn right it is, or was, "serious," "professional" and "good" up
until the whole dang company mysteriously imploded.</TE>
<TE>   Reed now says he didn't witness any evidence of wrongdoing during
his four years with the company and he is happy to report that Enron
paid the bills owed him right up to the day of bankruptcy. Some guys
have all the luck.</TE>
<TE>   He's not alone in that category among the Bush folk. There seems
to be no end of Bush administration officials and former campaign
consultants who made a bundle off Enron but had not a glimmer of
warning that anything was ever wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Even the president himself, who was exchanging chummy birthday
cards with his "good friend" and patron "Kenny Boy" Lay, wasn't clued
in enough to save his mother-in-law from losing more than $8,000 on
Enron stock. As in a messy divorce, sometimes those closest to the
family are the last to know.</TE>
<TE>   So, what would Jesus do? Heck, according to the teachings of the
Rev. Pat Robertson, he'd be out there just like Ralph Reed and George
Bush serving God and greed--or rather Mammon--in the same moment.</TE>
<TE>   But what would he really do, faced with all those employees who
lost their pensions? Jesus would cry.</TE>

<HD>Riordan Runs With the Big Dogs and Gets Nipped</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP J. TROUNSTINE</AU>
<BD>Philip J. Trounstine is the former political editor of
the San Jose Mercury News and former communications director for Gov.
Gray Davis. He is currently a communications consultant and director
of the Survey and Policy Research Institute at San Jose State
University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Poor Richard. Riordan, that is. After months of smashing, bashing and
trashing Gov. Gray Davis for everything from California's recession
to the rising price of electricity, the former Los Angeles mayor has
suddenly discovered you don't get a free pass to attack a sitting
governor who is serious about keeping his job.</LD>
<LD>   Davis has responded with a television ad questioning Riordan's
self-professed stance in favor of abortion rights.</LD>
<LD>   In a state where pro-choice sentiment is in the political
bloodstream, Davis has used Riordan's own record to open a gash in
his opponent's credibility.</LD>
<TE>   Just as former Gov. Pete Wilson did with his soft-on-crime attack
on Kathleen Brown in April 1994, Davis has concluded that if the
leading candidate in the other party's primary is going to ignore his
opponents for the nomination and act as if the general election were
underway, then it's time to take a stand against the would-be
usurper.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, the Davis ad notes, "was the national chairman who raised
$500,000 to put right-wing Judge Robert Bork on the Supreme Court"
and gave money to Americans United for Life, the Right to Life League
and to anti-abortion candidates (including Alabama Sen. Richard
Shelby) "as recently as 2001."</TE>
<TE>   "Is this a record we can trust?" the ad asks.</TE>
<TE>   Ouch.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's response was not to challenge the facts of the ad but to
put on the air a generic spot he had shot in anticipation of a Davis
attack. In it, he says: "I believe in taking responsibility and being
accountable. Unfortunately, Gov. Davis thinks differently. Instead of
outlining his plans for our future, he has chosen to attack me
personally."</TE>
<TE>   Now, whether Riordan believes in taking responsibility and being
accountable is not a provable assertion. But it's clear he's not
particularly comfortable taking responsibility or being accountable
for his contributions to the pro-life movement.</TE>
<TE>   However, the assertion that Davis hasn't outlined his plans for
the future but has instead attacked Riordan personally is false.</TE>
<TE>   As governor, Davis has laid out a detailed plan for the future in
four successive state budgets and he's shared his vision for the
future in four State of the State addresses. Riordan may not like
Davis' plans, but he can't say Davis hasn't spelled out a program.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Davis has not attacked Riordan personally. He's attacked
him politically. Riordan's stand on abortion rights--and his
record--is an absolutely legitimate political concern for voters,
especially women.</TE>
<TE>   Given that Riordan once said he "strongly" agrees with the
Catholic Church that "abortion is murder," voters might ask: When did
Riordan conclude that abortion is not murder? Or does he support
abortion today even though he still believes it is murder?</TE>
<TE>   Is the new Davis ad negative? Well, despite the argument from the
governor's advisors that it's factual, not negative, most
dispassionate observers would say sure, it's negative. But it's not
personal or out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   Up to now, Riordan had it both ways: He could proclaim that he's
pro-choice on abortion, hoping to attract moderates and independents
for November, without being attacked from the pro-choice Republican
left. That's because his GOP opponents--Secretary of State Bill Jones
and businessman Bill Simon--are pro-lifers.</TE>
<TE>   He's had a free lunch. The Davis ad is the due bill. Time to pay
up.</TE>
<TE>   What we don't know about Riordan, who has never run in a bruising
statewide, partisan race, is whether he can take the pressure of a
campaign that presages taking over the second-biggest executive job
in American politics.</TE>
<TE>   It won't cut it to whine about personal attacks when your opponent
pulls up your record and compares it with your campaign statements.
That's when you've got to prove to voters that your record matches
your rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   With a record of generous help for the pro-life movement in a
state that's vehemently pro-choice, that will be quite a challenge
for Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Poor Richard.</TE>

<HD>Legal Lesson for Afghanistan: War's Not a Slip-and-Fall
Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley is a professor of law at George
Washington University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of "daisy cutters," B-52 bombings and lightning special
operation raids, the United States has deployed its most destructive
weapon: The lawyers have landed in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Some Afghan citizens have decided to take that most American of
measures by suing Al Qaeda. At the same time, Global Exchange, a San
Francisco-based public advocacy group, has demanded compensation from
the United States for unintended victims of the bombing in
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   It seems that Afghanistan has finally arrived as a modern nation,
serving papers on friend and foe alike.</LD>
<TE>   The Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan can
hardly be faulted for pursuing a lawsuit against Al Qaeda for
damages. But most experienced attorneys would view such a suit as
having little promise of a return on investment.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda is not some deep-pocket defendant like Enron, with fixed
assets to liquidate beyond a few caves with splendid views of Tora
Bora.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the alliance prevailed, it would take years to secure
limited money that would have to be shared with rival claimants.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that lawsuit would at least focus on the truly culpable. In
contrast, Global Exchange is seeking reparations for Afghan citizens
injured as a result of a U.S. campaign to free their country from
tyranny--money in addition to the billions in aid already pledged for
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   While Global Exchange thus far has pursued relief through Congress
and the State Department rather than the courts, its claims are
premised on a flawed concept of responsibility and reparations.</TE>
<TE>   For centuries, it has been accepted that damage caused in wartime
cannot be claimed as injuries deserving compensation.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, whole civilian populations were
carpet-bombed, not accidentally but intentionally. Citizens of
Coventry, England, sued their own country for damages stemming from
bombing by the German Luftwaffe. The suit came after the people
learned that, due to the breaking of the German Enigma code, Prime
Minister Winston Churchill knew in advance of the bombing but did not
warn or evacuate citizens to avoid alerting the Germans that the code
had been broken. The citizens' claims were rejected as the bitter
fortunes of war.</TE>
<TE>   By definition, war requires a certain level of destruction, and
combatants are not required to treat every invasion like a massive
slip-and-fall case.</TE>
<TE>   There have been limited circumstances in which the U.S. government
has agreed to pay damages even though it wasn't required to. These
primarily have been cases in which individuals were injured in
peacetime by military negligence.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, when a Japanese fishing boat was exposed to radiation during
the testing of an atomic bomb or an Iranian airliner was mistakenly
shot down by a U.S. warship, the U.S. paid compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The closest precedent for any Afghan claimants is Grenada, in
which the U.S. government agreed to pay $1.6 million to people harmed
in the military invasion.</TE>
<TE>   The compensation was a mistake. It is one thing to allow families
to receive general humanitarian aid. It is quite another to
"compensate" for our actions.</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen American soldiers were killed and 115 injured in our
rescue of American citizens in Grenada.</TE>
<TE>   This was not some misdeed for which we should have paid
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Such finer points are unlikely to concern Global Exchange, which
appears to hold a rather twisted view of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The group's Web site denounces our legal system and says the U.S.
government is responsible for the "torture and physical abuse of
immigrants" while sealing our borders against illegal aliens.</TE>
<TE>   This does not mean that the U.S. should not help people left
destitute by war.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, such aid is already flowing, but families will be
helped as part of a general humanitarian effort regardless of whether
they were harmed by an errant bomb or, more commonly, by Taliban
abuses.</TE>
<TE>   There is an important principle that must guide our aid. To
paraphrase Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, one of our founders: billions
for charity but not a cent for reparations.</TE>

<LD>The Dance of a New Director</LD>
<LD>   John Malkovich presided over the Los Angeles premiere of "The
Dancer Upstairs," his debut as a film director, with characteristic
impish charm. Standing before the crowd at a special screening at
Grauman's Chinese Theatre on Thursday, he singled out Gary Sinise,
his longtime friend and co-founder of the Chicago-based Steppenwolf
Theatre Company. "Why, when I ask you to wear a sarong to my
openings--you don't wear one?" Malkovich asked Sinise. "I want you to
reflect on that."</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, at a candlelit dinner at the Highlands club in
Hollywood, Malkovich worked the room as others ate, moving through a
crowd that included Andy Garcia, David Schwimmer and Mark Ruffalo.
About 200 people attended the $1,000-per-ticket fund-raiser for the
Chicago-based Steppenwolf.</LD>
<TE>   "The Dancer Upstairs," which was purchased by Fox Searchlight at
the Sundance Film Festival this month for $2.5 million, is Nicholas
Shakespeare's adaptation of his own book on revolutionary activity in
Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish star Javier Bardem stars as a police investigator who
falls in love with his daughter's mysterious dance instructor while
tracking down revolutionaries. Bardem told us that Malkovich gave him
an enormous amount of freedom, and helped him channel his emotions
more carefully than he had done in other roles. Working with
Malkovich "was a huge responsibility," Bardem said. "And I was
scared. It was like going to acting school for free."</TE>
<TE>   Malkovich described Bardem as a hard worker bursting with ideas,
and called him "a screen-eating monster."</TE>
<TE>   "If you get the camera on him ... it's impossible not to watch
him," he said. Malkovich said he was given nine weeks and $4 million
to shoot the picture--"and I did it." The result, he said, is a film
that is "dense, clear, demanding."</TE>
<TE>   If audiences agree, he'll have reached his goal of creating a
picture that has a lasting effect and won't be seen as "a product of
this second, or a film that you couldn't remember five minutes [after
it ended.]"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Courting Koolhaas</TE>
<TE>   The scene was reminiscent of a Hollywood premiere: long lines of
spectators, a cluster of celebrities (Brad Pitt, Martha Stewart,
Michael York, Diane Keaton), and at the center of it all a
charismatic star adroitly filling the role of Man in the News.</TE>
<TE>   But the attraction Sunday afternoon at UCLA wasn't a matinee idol,
but controversial Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, the leading
rock-god/philosopher of contemporary design.</TE>
<TE>   Possibly the most talked-about builder on the planet today, he was
on campus to deliver a freewheeling lecture on his latest projects,
including the new Prada boutique in Manhattan's SoHo district and a
major redesign of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   About 400 people squeezed into Dickson Auditorium for the free
event, with another 130 or so watching a live video feed in an
adjacent building. Some said they had stood in the rain for more than
an hour to get seats, and when Koolhaas appeared in the hall, several
squeals of excitement went up from the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Among the L.A. art-world luminaries in attendance were Ann
Philbin, director of UCLA's Hammer Museum, and Stephanie Barron,
senior curator of modern and contemporary art and vice president of
education and public programs at LACMA.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a white shirt and black slacks--Prada, by any
chance?--Koolhaas used slides, playful graphics, paradoxical thinking
and deadpan humor to walk his audience through the major conceptual
issues he's currently wrestling with. "Every single institution known
to man is infiltrated by shopping," Koolhaas declared at one point,
before going on to defend his own involvement with Prada, for which
he has been chastised by architecture critics.</TE>
<TE>   Leaning his 6-foot-5 frame into a lectern, Koolhaas was
alternately jokey and intense, assertive and disarming. Air
conditioning and the escalator have turned architectural values
systems upside down, he said, leading to the use of increasingly
"debased" materials and "the degradation of the idea of the city."
Commenting on a graphic depicting pay rates for Chinese architects
versus the much higher salaries of their less-productive U.S. and
European counterparts, Koolhaas joked to the audience, "I hope you
will permit me to find your laughter extremely unpleasant."</TE>
<TE>   Summing up his attitude toward the global marketplace, where
credit cards have become the new passports, Koolhaas said, "Our
relationship with the market is both analytical--and also
relentlessly critical."</TE>
<TE>   It'll be interesting to see if L.A., where the LACMA project and
another Prada boutique are set to open in coming years, will buy that
combination.</TE>

<TE>   A Drive to Court</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies arrested Emmy-winning actress Kim Delaney in
Malibu on Saturday on suspicion of driving under the influence of
alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   The actress, who played a detective on "NYPD Blue," was driving
erratically on Pacific Coast Highway on Saturday evening, prompting
another driver to call 911, said Sgt. Mo Angel of the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   The driver began following Delaney's black Mercedes while calling
in directions to deputies.</TE>
<TE>   When Delaney reached her home, she accidentally set off the
burglar alarm, causing additional deputies to respond, Angel said.</TE>
<TE>   Delaney was arrested but refused to take an alcohol test. She was
booked at the Malibu sheriff's station and released four hours later.
A court date was set for March 27.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Delaney won an Emmy for best supporting actress for her
role as a recovering alcoholic on "NYPD Blue." She currently stars as
a defense attorney in "Philly."</TE>

<LD>THE LOVE OF STONES</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Tobias Hill</LD>
<TE>   Picador USA</TE>
<TE>   396 pages, $25</TE>
<TE>   "I think that after a certain age jewels cease to be possessions,"
explains Katherine Sterne, the main character in "The Love of
Stones," an intriguing, high-tension novel by British author Tobias
Hill that centers on rare, antique jewels and the obsession they may
inspire. Once the fixation for a particular set of stones takes hold,
Katherine tells us, it is the jewels themselves that "become the
possessors."</TE>
<TE>   In this tale that is equal parts mystery-thriller, literary novel
and history lesson, Katherine is one of many possessed by the Three
Brethren. The ancient cloak clasp, which dates back to the 15th
century, has not been seen since Queen Victoria wore it just prior to
her coronation in 1838. For reasons never logically explained--when
possessed by the love of stones, we're told, logic doesn't enter into
the equation--Katherine is on a current-day, globe-traipsing mission
to unearth the missing brooch.</TE>
<TE>   On her travels, we meet a cast of similarly jewel-addicted
characters with whom Katherine deals and, just as often, cheats.</TE>
<TE>   "The search ... has changed me," she says of having left behind
all family and friends, living on the run from continent to
continent. "For the people who make their lives from them, stones are
more than ornaments or currency. They are a kind of drug, a
crystallised heroin. A fetish. They attract violence."</TE>
<TE>   Though Katherine has no proof the Three Brethren still endures,
she intuits its existence by the pull the jewel exudes over her,
compelling her to keep searching regardless of personal cost or the
likelihood of her prevailing. From Turkey to London and then on to
Japan, Katherine cannot rest. "I see history through the eyes of the
Three Brethren," she tells us. "It is the way a pawnbroker might look
at things: as if everything has a value and a price."</TE>
<TE>   Comprised of a triad of massive balas rubies, pear-shaped pearls
and the "Heart of the Brothers," a wine-yellow diamond of 1371/2
carats, the Three Brethren has attracted over the centuries many
seekers like Katherine who would forgo almost anything to lay claim
to this prize. The value of the cloak clasp for its pursuers goes far
beyond price, a legacy Hill deftly traces in the history of the
jewel. By tracking the lives of the many people who have owned it,
killed for it, stolen it and searched for it, Hill explores the
brooch's six centuries of existence and, in doing so, shines as an
exceptional storyteller. Using a kind of old-fashioned diction
reminiscent of the tales of Scheherazade, he conjures a spell over
his readers, luring us into the exotic worlds he describes. The
book's strongest sections, in fact, have nothing to do with
Katherine's search but are found in the overlapping strands of
parallel subplots Hill weaves throughout.</TE>
<TE>   As Katherine's story goes back in time to uncover the last time
the brooch was seen and where it might have gone, another strand of
the narrative takes the brooch's creation in the early 1400s as its
starting point and moves forward in time until it intersects with
what Katherine has learned.</TE>
<TE>   The most captivating of the historical subplots takes place in the
1800s and tells of Iraqi brothers Daniel and Salman Levy who
immigrate to England and work as goldsmiths on the crown for Queen
Victoria. Their tale, of having been gifted with an earthenware jar
filled with jewels while still living in Iraq--the Three Brethren
among them--and then of their attempts to wrest their jewelry-making
fortunes in London from those precious stones, is lively and
impressively narrated.</TE>
<TE>   We learn how jewels were cut in earlier times, how a genuine
diamond feels different in the hand than a fake due to the stone's
thermoconductivity, and how the measurement of a carat (based on the
weight of seeds from the locust bean tree Ceratonia siliqua) was
derived.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the main plot focused on Katherine's search never
rises to the occasion the way these subplots do. As a character,
Katherine is emotionally deadened, a cold-fish of a narrator. Though
this numbness is clearly meant as a partial explanation for her jewel
obsession, it doesn't do much to spark the reader's interest. Her
tale, which is reported in the literary equivalent of a first-person
monotone, is marred by this anesthetization; readers may have a hard
time feeling for her what she doesn't feel for herself.</TE>
<TE>   Though one can't help but wish for a better narrative, there is
much to be admired in Hill's lush use of language, the potent
storytelling and, most especially, the delightful historical details
and exotic locations he excavates. Perhaps the weakness of
Katherine's story is like the flaw that mars every diamond: a
demonstration of its one-of-a-kind, albeit imperfect, nature.</TE>

<HD>Discovering Life Can (and Does) Go on After Divorce</HD>
<DH>Marriage breakups don't always spell disaster, a new book
reveals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN LEVINE</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.</DL>
<LD>In the beginning, E. Mavis Hetherington was looking for as much
pathology as the next person. It was the early 1970s, with the
American family in free fall, and she fully expected that her
just-launched study of the impact of divorce would find dysfunction
and plenty of it: parents unable to cope, maladjusted children with
long-term difficulties. By almost any measure, "we expected them to
blow it."</LD>
<LD>   Yet here's the surprising thing about her families, with all their
couplings and uncouplings and even recouplings in the years that
followed: The vast majority of parents rebounded from the pain and
upheaval. Resiliency overshadowed pathology. By the time the children
were young adults, considering marriage and families of their own,
Hetherington discovered at least 75% coping fairly well--some very
well--with life.</LD>
<TE>   Divorce, it seems, is not predestined. Now Hetherington, 75, wants
to get the word out. More than that, with the publication of "For
Better or for Worse: Divorce Reconsidered" (Norton, $26.95), she
wants to change the public debate about divorce. Her book offers
reassurance to the millions of Americans who don't make it till death
does part them. More than 40% of marriages end in divorce, down from
the record highs of the '80s but hardly a statistic for celebration.
The most divisive aspect has centered on the harm inflicted on
children--irreparable damage, some researchers contend.</TE>
<TE>   Hetherington, a University of Virginia professor emeritus,
believes she offers "a more hopeful look, a more realistic look" at
the consequences. She says the book, authored with New York writer
John Kelly, is neither antimarriage (though angry e-mails already are
accusing her of such) nor pro-divorce. Rather, it explains the
challenges people face and the diverse choices they make. It doesn't
ignore the downside. While most children adapt and adjust to their
parents' split, she says, 20% to 25% are left deeply scarred.</TE>
<TE>   "I harbor no doubts about the ability of divorce to devastate,"
she writes. "It can and does ruin lives.... But that said, I also
think much current writing on divorce--both popular and academic--has
exaggerated its negative effects and ignored its sometimes
considerable positive effects."</TE>
<TE>   After three decades exploring the most important nexus of human
relations, through the stability or dissolution of nearly 1,400
marriages, she wishes others weren't so skeptical. "Why are people so
afraid to say that in the long run, people end up living reasonably
constructive lives?"</TE>
<TE>   Partly a how-to survival primer, partly a behavioral science
treatise, "For Better or for Worse" provides a window on the ways
humans react when their worlds implode.</TE>
<TE>   Some families were followed for almost 30 years. That longevity,
as well as the work's scope and methodology, makes Hetherington's
research the most comprehensive ever on divorce. Her lab holds
thousands of her subjects' interviews and questionnaires and tens of
thousands of hours of videotape.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the families were divorced when they signed up.
Hetherington intentionally recruited a control group among the
happily married. But control is a fleeting thing when love is
concerned. Some of her married couples started to divorce, even as
her divorced men and women started to remarry.</TE>
<TE>   Relaxing in the converted schoolhouse outside Charlottesville
where she lives with her husband, she laughs at the memory of her
early frustrations: "When you study families over time, you're
studying a moving target."</TE>
<TE>   Sociologist Andrew Cherlin of Johns Hopkins University praises
Hetherington's approach as groundbreaking: "Everybody should be in
her debt. She almost originated the rigorous scientific study of the
effect of divorce on children. "The debate has swung back and forth
between people saying divorce is bad for most any kid, and people
saying divorce is not a problem," Cherlin said. "Her message is that
divorce raises the risk of undesirable things happening to your kids,
but most kids are going to do OK."</TE>
<TE>   The first year after a divorce is brutally painful for adults and
children alike, Hetherington says. Doctor visits double for men and
triple for women, although generally women cope better in the long
run, and many make changes that ultimately enhance their lives.</TE>
<TE>   The second year after a divorce usually brings improvement and
adjustment, but parents should remain vigilant. Some will have their
hands more full than others: Boys rebel more against mothers than
against fathers. Girls experience greater stress during adolescence.
Daughters in divorce or melded stepfamilies more frequently become
sexually precocious.</TE>
<TE>   Not until the sixth year after a divorce are most family members
emotionally and mentally back on their feet, according to
Hetherington. Twenty years later, she lists caveats and silver
linings: A significant number of grown children consider divorce an
acceptable solution to an unhappy marriage, nearly twice as many as
in intact families. The percentage of adult children of divorce with
serious psychological problems remains double that of intact
families. "That is significant risk, but it still means 75 to 80% are
doing all right or very well," she stresses.</TE>
<TE>   California psychologist Judith Wallerstein, whose bleak readings
of divorce's aftershocks continually hit the bestseller lists, takes
issue with Hetherington's optimism. The offspring of broken marriages
whom she studied were left anxious and pessimistic, especially
crippled when it came to love. "They say, 'It's better not to feel, I
learned that a long time ago.'"</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the two approaches should be examined side by side,
suggests David Popenoe, co-director of the National Marriage Project
at Rutgers University and author of "Life Without Father." "One can
go either way in the analysis of this data, and that's one thing that
Hetherington's book points out," he says. "If you're a child of
divorce, you certainly don't need to be told your life is a mess and
there's nothing you can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   As she embarks on a cross-country book tour, Hetherington already
is drawing much attention. Detractors call her a marriage basher.
"It's people like you," a recent e-mail vented, "who are eroding the
sacred institution of marriage."</TE>
<TE>   The criticism pains and amuses her. The grandmother hardly looks
incendiary. She's been married 46 years to the same man, a retired
University of Virginia law professor. Neither her parents nor her
three sons have divorced.</TE>
<TE>   She holds strong views about marriage: that couples bail out of
troubled relationships far too quickly, that a family with two
supportive parents is by far the best way to raise children. But take
one away and disaster need not strike, she says: A caring, competent
custodial parent is the "most potent protection" a child of divorce
can have.</TE>

<HD>Where Hackers Teach the Art of Self-Defense</HD>
<DH>At a little school in Paris, regular Joes learn how to
protect their cyberspace.</DH>

<LD>They call it the Hackademy. The so-called hackers school, on a
dead-end street in a residential Paris neighborhood, is run by wiz
kids who crack computer security codes as a sort of cyber-sport. Now
they're taking what they've learned to the computer
illiterati--regular people with a limited understanding of
technology.</LD>
<LD>   "We are trying to make the underground go overground," said a
23-year-old instructor who calls himself Fozzy, his English thick
with French  during a telephone interview. "Some hackers, not many,
want to ... keep things [secret]. Us, we don't want to do like this.
We want to give everyone the real picture."</LD>
<LD>   While the school is small and in only one city so far, the
Hackademy sees itself on the forefront of a coming consumer
market--educating private individuals who want to defend their
cyberspace.</LD>
<TE>   Hackademy courses are taught in French, but they will soon be
offered in English, due to interest from British and American
computer users. The school's teachers are also considering offering
English-language classes online.</TE>
<TE>   As opposed to "black hats" (or "crackers" who break systems with
malicious intent) and "white hats" (who discover system
vulnerabilities and alert owners to fix the problem), the Hackademy's
teachers call themselves "gray hats"--hackers who "do not do evil
things" like write viruses or steal credit card numbers, but who
break into computer systems "for our own entertainment" and to
educate, said Fozzy.</TE>
<TE>   Like the other handful of people who work at the Hackademy, Fozzy
uses a pseudonym to conceal his identity, not from government
authorities (with whom they say they've had no problem) but from
other hackers. Fearing they will be targeted by "black hats" if they
use their real names, the school's instructors use character names
they've adopted from video games, books and movies.</TE>
<TE>   According to the school's manager, who goes by the name Billy Dub,
more than 400 people have attended the Paris Hackademy since it
opened last fall. The school has only one classroom and six
computers, but a second room is under construction and classes will
be offered year-round.</TE>
<TE>   Students, many of whom learned of the school through media
coverage and the Web, have included high schoolers, grandparents,
businessmen, even a police officer. Most are 25 to 35 years old,
though they range from 15 to 76. They are also mostly male, which
prompted the school, upon opening, to offer free classes to the first
10 women who signed up.</TE>
<TE>   About 90% of the students are "newbies," taking a beginners'
course in basic vocabulary, introductory hacking techniques and how
to secure their Web sites and e-mail. Classes about network
vulnerabilities, exploiting network protocols and intruding systems
are available to more advanced students, as are methods of protection
from such attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody should know what are the real security problems that
exist on the Internet and how to protect from [them]. At this time,
the [home computer] user really does not understand the problem,"
Fozzy said. "That is why we created the Hackademy."</TE>
<TE>   What should they be worried about? Any number of things, Fozzy
said, but most specifically the Web. As more and more services are
performed online, and increasing amounts of highly sensitive personal
data are shuttled through cyberspace, the Internet makes computers of
all kinds more susceptible to attack.</TE>
<TE>   The common misperceptions Fozzy hopes to correct: that antivirus
software on its own prevents computers from acquiring bugs (it is
useless unless security patches are applied) and that credit card
information is safe if sent over a "secure server" (it is not the
transfer of data but how it is stored by the company on the other end
that is unsafe, he said).</TE>
<TE>   About 50% of the school's students say they have been the victim
of some sort of security breach, according to Dub. Still, in a
constantly shifting computer security landscape, one has to wonder:
Is it even worthwhile for a layperson to bother educating himself on
the latest techniques and strategies?</TE>
<TE>   "No," according to Bruce Schneier, chief technical officer of
Cupertino-based Counterpane Internet Security. "If you're worried
about getting sick, you don't need to go to medical school. I go to a
doctor so I don't have to become a doctor. If you're a layperson
concerned about computer security, hire an expert."</TE>
<TE>   There is no question computer security courses are imperative for
large corporations. According to an annual security survey of Fortune
500 companies and large government agencies conducted by the Computer
Security Institute in San Francisco, 91% of survey respondents in
2001 said they had suffered some kind of security breach.</TE>
<TE>   To prevent computer break-ins, a number of American companies
offer systems security classes, companies like Internet Security
Systems in Atlanta and Foundstone in Irvine. Geared toward computer
security professionals, their classes are usually taught by
ex-military personnel and cost about  $1,000 per student per day.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, classes at the Hackademy target personal computer
users and charge $60 for nine hours of teaching by the hackers
themselves. Then again, at least for now, you have to be in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, it is the teachers who make the Hackademy unique--the
collective of teen and 20-something self-taught computer hobbyists
who, in the spirit of populist security, have gathered together to
pool their knowledge and send it out to the world. With the
exceptions of Defcon (a yearly hacker convention in Las Vegas) and
monthly meetings around the country held by a group called 2600, a
formal group of hackers teaching hacking skills does not exist in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   But it could, according to Mark Radcliffe, a Palo Alto-based
Internet law attorney. The issue, Radcliffe said, is what is
permissible by U.S. law. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, passed
in 1998, makes it illegal to crack somebody's system without
permission or to distribute the tools that would accomplish those
ends. Whether it is legal for hackers to teach what they know is
largely a matter of intent.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're saying, 'I'm going to crack Bank of America's security
system,' that's not permitted. If they say, 'You have a computer at
home with a DSL line and I'm going to crack into it and show you how
your security is no good, and I have your permission to do that,'
that's OK," Radcliffe said.</TE>
<TE>   The basic concept behind courses offered by Foundstone and other
corporate-oriented security classes and those offered by the
Hackademy is basically the same. They both teach hacking skills as a
means of defense.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a bad guy to catch a bad guy," said Jose Granado,
national leader of Ernst &amp; Young's Attack and Penetration Group. "The
best way to stop an attack is to think like an attacker."</TE>
<TE>   Ernst &amp; Young, better known as an accounting firm, has been
offering an antihacking class to corporate clients for six years. In
a lab environment, instructors set up a dummy company with security
situations common to many corporations. The students  pretend they
are hackers and play Capture the Flag,  in which they infiltrate the
system and, when successful, also  scramble for the telephone to call
their employers.</TE>
<TE>   The name of the Ernst &amp; Young class: Extreme Hacking. Other
corporate hacking courses also capitalize on the buzz term, with
courses titled "Ethical Hacking" and "Hacking and Cracking Seminar
101."</TE>
<TE>   As for the Hackademy, the space in which it is located has all the
trappings of subversion--artful graffiti on the walls, a pirate flag
hanging in a window--but the school's manager said both are more in
the spirit of fun than sabotage. So is the Hackademy merely
capitalizing on the hacker mystique for commercial gain, or do the
school's instructors truly have an edge over those at other computer
security schools?</TE>
<TE>   "We try to be clever, to be at the edge of new things, to invent,
to create new ways to go into the system," said Fozzy, who teaches a
class on Web vulnerabilities, some of which he has found himself.</TE>
<TE>   Granado agrees that hackers are on the cutting edge. But, he said,
"Through our contacts in industry and through the conferences we
attend and the mailing lists we're a part of, our folks have access
to the same type of information that underground folks would have. We
may get it a day later than some underground guy ... but over a very
short period of time we'll have the same information as everyone
else."</TE>
<TE>   How? By monitoring news sources where hackers post their latest
discoveries.</TE>
<TE>   Not known for their modesty, many hackers delight in letting their
peers in on the security breaches they've happened upon, on Web sites
such as Rootshell.com and Packetstorm.com and in zines such as 2600:
The Hacker Quarterly.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the best-known American hacker magazine, 2600 (named for
the hertz frequency that allowed phone hackers, or "phreakers," to
place calls for free) details hacker tactics and highlights issues of
concern to the community in its print edition. It also holds meetings
for hackers to meet and exchange information.</TE>
<TE>   The Hackademy is based on a similar concept. An offshoot of
Hackerz Voice, a French-language newspaper for hackers founded by
Publisher Olivier Spinelli in  2000, the Hackademy was initially
founded to bring together its readers.</TE>
<TE>   Spinelli, who has described himself as "an idealist trying to
provide a public service," claims to have 80,000 subscribers in a
handful of French-speaking countries, including Belgium, Switzerland
and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The school has been much more popular than its founders
anticipated. There has been enough interest in Spain and Israel that
Hackademies will soon be established in both countries, Dub said.
There are no plans, however, to set up shop in America anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good cause, but I think in the United States it will not
be possible because of the lack of freedom after the new
antiterrorism law," Fozzy said.</TE>
<TE>   The school hasn't experienced any legal problems in France,
according to Dub. But Radcliffe said a law similar to the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act--the U.S. law designed to prevent copyright
infringement in cyberspace--may be adopted by the European Union over
the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the dissemination of this information will result in good
or ill remains to be seen. Just because the instructors are
interested in helping people protect themselves doesn't mean that
students will use what they've learned for such positive purposes.
When you give someone the keys to a car, you can't control how they
drive.</TE>
<TE>   "I teach them ethical values," a teenage instructor who goes by
the name Clad Strife (a character from the "Final Fantasy" videogame)
told the BBC in December. "It's not my responsibility if they use my
information to do something illegal at home."</TE>

<LD>We all know that Harry Potter can create great magic, but did you
know that artists also create their own kind of magic? Look closely
at this fantasy photograph of 6-year-old twins Jayme and Jesse
Clapoff. What looks real and what looks made-up? Instead of using
magic spells, artists Wayne and Penny McCall used their camera,
computer and imagination to create a new work of art.</LD>
<LD>   The McCalls took more than 100 photos to prepare for this
portrait. They found out that Jesse liked karate, Jayme liked to
dance, and that they both loved to paint. The artists changed the
colors and sizes of things in photos. They even made it look like the
twins were inside the picture doing a paint-by-numbers painting of
each other. It took more than a week of work on a computer to put all
the parts of this photograph together and create this exciting new
work of art.</LD>
<LD>   Every photograph by Wayne and Penny McCall is different. If they
made a fantasy portrait of you, what would you like to be doing?
Would you be skiing down a mountain? Horseback riding? Or would you
like to be pictured as the president of the United States? Use your
imagination just like artists Wayne and Penny McCall have used
theirs.</LD>
<TE>   Visit the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum and see how eight
photographers created portraits, each with a unique style. "Portrait
2001" is at CAF through Feb. 9. For more information, call (805)

<LD>Permissive parents or pervasive violence? The availability of drugs
or recklessness of the young? A toxic culture or a few bad seeds? I
expected that my column last week on the murder of two suburban teens
by a classmate would unleash the usual back-and-forth among readers
over who or what was to blame.</LD>
<LD>   What I did not expect was that adoption would be fingered as the
culprit in this tragedy. The convicted killer, Michael Demirdjian,
16, was adopted as an infant, a fact that made its way into virtually
every news story on the case. He'd had an unremarkable
upbringing--safe home, doting parents--but veered off track when he
turned 13, just after he learned he'd been adopted.</LD>
<LD>   He fought at school, feuded with his parents, had trouble keeping
friends. He felt angry and full of rage, he admitted to a probation
officer. Typical adolescent angst? That's what his broken-hearted
parents believed, but not what some readers of my column seemed to
see.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know if this will be any consolation, but the adoption
issue goes a long way in trying to understand his behavior," wrote
Harriet Bay, the mother of two adopted kids, now grown. Bay is also
an educator who works with troubled teens, many of whom are adoptees.
"All I can say is that love and good parenting can't erase the
initial fact that 'someone didn't want me.'"</TE>
<TE>   It's a notion as troubling as it is intriguing--the idea that the
separation of a child from its birth mother creates a rupture so
profound, the reverberations last for life. That bumps hard up
against the conventional view that adopted children can be absorbed
seamlessly into new families; that comfortable lives make up for
biological loss.</TE>
<TE>   The theory--put forth in the 1993 book "The Primal Wound:
Understanding the Adopted Child" (Gateway Press) by therapist Nancy
Newton Verrier--follows decades of studies that have found adopted
children more likely to have behavioral problems, learning
disabilities and emotional troubles than other children, no matter
how stable their adoptive families. Those differences have
traditionally been blamed on the genetic contributions of birth
parents, or trauma that may have preceded adoption.</TE>
<TE>   But some researchers now believe "the fact of adoption" can
predispose a child to emotional instability; that unresolved feelings
of loss can lead to low-self esteem and insecurity. According to
adoption research, more than three-quarters of adult adoptees report
feeling "abandoned" by their birth parents. Many say they are "overly
sensitive to issues of loss" and have trouble forming close
relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Symptoms of "attachment impairment" typically show up in
adolescence, therapists say. Although any teenager is apt to rebel,
feel out of place and struggle with issues of identity, adoptees face
a special challenge, says therapist Marlou Russell, author of
"Adoption Wisdom: A Guide to the Issues and Feelings of Adoption"
(Broken Branch Productions).</TE>
<TE>   "What adoptees walk around with, whether they're aware of it or
not, is the truth that, whatever the story, on some level, your
mother didn't want you. If that's not addressed, the pain has to come
out one way or another," she says. "I'm never surprised when adoptees
act out in a hostile way, hurting themselves or someone else."</TE>
<TE>   But Russell--who was adopted as a baby and now counsels adoptive
families--says those feelings can be ameliorated. "Adoptees have to
process their loss, just like you'd process any loss. And that means
their adoptive parents have to acknowledge it."</TE>
<TE>   Recognize that it is natural for adopted children to wonder about
their birth parents, she advises. "Let them know you're not
threatened by that. Encourage them to ask questions. Help them
understand the facts. Provide a safe space for the feelings to come
out, so they don't have to go underground."</TE>
<TE>   The "primal wound" theory is controversial not just for its lack
of scientific grounding but for its impact on adoptive families.
Millions of families have grown through adoption, and their ranks are
increasing as options expand. There are adoptions by single parents
and gay couples, international adoptions, transracial adoptions,
foster care adoptions and open adoptions, where birth parents remain
a part of their children's lives.</TE>
<TE>   As a society, we no longer regard adoption as a secret that
stigmatizes parent and child, but as one of many ways to create a
family no less stable or more fragile that any other. And adoptive
parents are working to counteract stereotypes that subtly assign
their families second-class citizenship--such as gratuitous mentions
of adoptive status in news stories.</TE>
<TE>   Still, old attitudes die hard, as my e-mail reveals. "I somehow
feel the type of woman that chooses to give up her child too often
has something wrong," wrote one grandmother. "This antisocial or
dysfunctional trait, whatever it is, must somehow be inherited."</TE>
<TE>   Another reader, an adoptive father, speculated that "the type of
girl who rejects abortion for adoption" may have a kind of emotional
disorder that encourages defiance and produces particularly difficult
kids. One man insisted that kids like Michael Demirdjian are doomed,
because their birth parents are "scum" and the circumstances of their
births inflict damage that even loving adoptive parents "could not
overcome."</TE>
<TE>   Some worry that publicity over the travails of a handful of
adopted children is souring some on the idea of adoption. "I know a
lot of people struggling with infertility," Bay said. "And they are
opting for anything but adoption--doing test tubes, egg donors,
surrogates.... They just consider adoption too dicey."</TE>
<TE>   As if raising children--however they join our families--isn't
dicey anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Many of us have special challenges--single parents, the working
poor, grandparents raising their children's kids--and statistics
stacked against us. And children with emotional and behavior problems
can be found on any family tree.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't what adopted children need what my daughters also require of
me? That I listen, tell the truth, provide them with security. That I
give them the freedom to vent their fears and the space to figure who
they want to be. That I teach them--as they teach me--that life
provides no guarantees, but family offers limitless possibilities.</TE>

<HD>Bridgett's Adventure on the Digital Highway</HD>
<DH>Part 2 The story so far: Bridgett has wished herself into
the computer so she can get information for her report. She has met a
character named Bookmark.</DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Grab onto the next zero and it will guide us to the Internet,"
Bookmark said.</LD>
<LD>   Bridgett jumped up and caught the next zero shooting by. She held
tight and found herself moving on the glowing Digital Highway.</LD>
<LD>   Bookmark said, "What do you need to find out about?"</LD>
<TE>   "I need to know about mammals that live in the sea," Bridgett
said, giggling. Her feet tingled.</TE>
<TE>   Bookmark unbuttoned his "zeros and ones" vest to uncover a monitor
and keyboard.</TE>
<TE>   "Your wish is my command. Click. Type in what you're looking for,
and we'll be on our way," Bookmark said.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgett touched the keyboard, typing out: "Ocean + mammals +
sea."</TE>
<TE>   "Hold tight!" Bookmark said as he grabbed her hand. They flew off
on the Internet. They whirled through the air, heading into the blue
darkness. She listened to a humming noise get louder.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that noise?" Bridgett exclaimed.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Hard Drive. It stores all the information you need,"
Bookmark explained. Sparks flew. Sparkle! Bookmark pulled an
electronic device from his pocket and connected it to Hard Drive. It
spun faster.</TE>
<TE>   "Hard Drive stores everything digitally. You are the only human
who has come so close to it. You can't stay in one place for too long
or Hard Drive or something else might find you." Bookmark shivered,
and his monitor chest blinked.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry, Bookmark," Bridgett said as she tapped more words on
the keyboard.</TE>
<TE>   "Two things can make the computer crash," Bookmark hinted.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgett hurried over to take a closer look at Hard Drive. It was
humming. It sensed that something foreign was near. Hard Drive
naturally wanted to save all information to its disk.</TE>
<TE>   "Hold on there! Click!" Bookmark yelled and pulled her back. "The
information will appear on my screen. Do not get too close."</TE>
<TE>   Bridgett's hair filled with static electricity as Hard Drive
pulled her toward it. Snap! Hard Drive churned louder. Bridgett
grabbed onto Bookmark. One step closer and Bridgett could become a
digital memory!</TE>

<HD>Dark Side of Rodeo Drive</HD>
<DH>For his latest novel set in L.A.,  Bruce Wagner looked to
Charles Dickens for inspiration.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>IRENE LACHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Novelist Bruce Wagner could be the Josephine Baker of the L.A.
literary life if the late chanteuse had walked around fully clothed
in black. Or perhaps the Jerry Lewis if the comedian were possessed
of X-ray vision that penetrated the city's darkest corners. All three
have found their best audience thousands of miles from home.</LD>
<LD>   For Baker and Lewis, their most fervent fans hailed from Paris;
for Wagner, the hub of appreciation is in New York. This despite--or
perhaps, because of--the fact that his work is so strongly identified
with Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "My wife used to say, 'Why are you always writing about Rodeo
Drive?'" Wagner said dryly about his new book, "I'll Let You Go"
(Villard), in a discussion with his longtime friend, actress and
author Carrie Fisher at a recent Writers Bloc forum.</LD>
<TE>   But Wagner's street is not your garden-variety Rodeo Drive, the
innocent main drag for "Pretty Woman" and pretty women for whom Prada
is a birthright. Wagner's metaphorical Rodeo Drive is the boulevard
of nightmares, where screenwriters go crazy, mega-producers treat
their assistants as sex slaves, and big stars seek solace from
drug-pushing doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Such suitors of the apocalypse populated Wagner's earlier novels,
"Force Majeure" (Random House, 1991) and "I'm Losing You" (Villard,
1996). Their sting came from his experiences as a screenwriter with a
body of work including the edgy TV miniseries "Wild Palms," directed
by David Lynch, and the Paul Bartel film, "Scenes From the Class
Struggle in Beverly Hills," among others.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner's insider view of the industry has fascinated some
high-profile critics in New York, among them John Updike, who
reviewed "I'm Losing You" (about a Hollywood producer who learns he's
dying) for the New Yorker. And while the New York Times reviewed the
book twice, it went unnoticed by some of L.A.'s media.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a peculiar sort of below-the-radar situation for me
sometimes, but that works for and against me," muses Wagner, 47. "If
one can still be invisible in a sense, then I think that's a powerful
tool, not so much because you can observe in a more fastidious way if
you're invisible, but also just in terms of one's own vanity. If one
is not given tremendous accolades or attention, I think that's simply
better for one's artistic spirit."</TE>
<TE>   To Wagner, more grating than being ignored, which is becoming
increasingly unlikely anyway, is being misunderstood. Some critics
have tagged him a tedious hipster, at one with the jaded landscape he
skewers in his books.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner counters that he's nothing of the sort. "I think there are
a lot of very cynical people who misread my work and want me to write
about degradation," he says. "And I do write about degradation, but
in the context of many other things. I'm not someone who is thrilled
with degradation as an end in itself, so this book is a much broader
canvas than my last books, much less claustrophobic, much more humane
in a sense, and much more traditional in its narrative."</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, Wagner is talking about "I'll Let You Go" in his
three-story loft in an austere Frank Gehry building, a residential
oddity on an otherwise industrial block in Santa Monica. The front
door opens onto an office lined with corkboard, peppered with
remnants of Wagner's voraciously eclectic interests that sometimes
find their way into his books.</TE>
<TE>   A quick glance dispels any typecasting of Wagner as someone
afflicted with entertainment industry myopia. Painted in gold above
one corkboard are the words: "The varieties of religious experience."
Draped over the piano bench of his baby grand is a Jewish prayer
shawl. Wagner leads the way upstairs to the kitchen, an airy balcony
overlooking his work space. If his books are not necessarily as they
seem to the casual observer, neither is he. He's dressed in his
uniform of cool-cat black up to his thick-rimmed glasses. Virtually
his entire head is covered in 5 o'clock shadow.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner's friend Fisher says his bad-boy looks have caused
misunderstandings. "He's a really kind, tender guy, and that's the
surprise of him because he certainly doesn't look like that," she
says. "He looks like--dare I say it?--a terrorist. We were in Israel
and staying in an old part of Jerusalem, and he kept getting carded.
He's a nice Jewish boy who loves his mother."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, "I'll Let You Go" is dedicated to his mother, Bunny. And
critics have noted that the 549-page tome is gentler and more
sympathetic than his earlier works. Michiko Kakutani wrote in the New
York Times that "I'll Let You Go" is "tender, even sentimental where
that earlier novel was corrosive; deliberately old-fashioned where
'I'm Losing You' was willfully, sometimes tiresomely hip."</TE>
<TE>   With his new book, Wagner looks to anti-hipster Charles Dickens
for inspiration, from its traditional story structure and formal,
lush language to its homeless waifs and baroque narrator. "Why
Dickens? Why now? It's because I'm not a kid anymore," Wagner says.
"And the orderliness that Dickens presented really appealed to me.
You're no longer a young writer, so you're no longer indulging in
violence or wickedness for violence or wickedness' sake."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll Let You Go" centers on the journey of 12-year-old
zillionaire Tull Trotter, who stumbles onto a family secret that
sends him on a search for a father he'd believed long dead. Helping
him in his quest are his pubescent cousins, "girl detective" Lucy and
her prodigy brother, Edward, who creates elaborate hoods to cloak his
disfigurement caused by Apert syndrome. Tull's fate is crossed with
that of Amaryllis Kornfeld, a homeless orphan who believes the world
will open up to her if she can only be canonized as a saint.</TE>
<TE>   To take readers to parts of Los Angeles most well-heeled denizens
rarely think about, Wagner played reporter. When he writes about
Amaryllis getting caught up in the horrors of the child-welfare
system, he's drawing on experience and contacts he gleaned from
acting as a court-appointed special advocate for a child in a group
home. When he describes the lost encampments of L.A.'s homeless, he's
invoking his memory of trips to the city's underbelly.</TE>
<TE>   For all the compassion expressed in the book, Wagner escaped from
some of his research oddly unmoved. "I was telling someone about
going downtown, and the person said, 'Doesn't it make you sad to see
the junkies and the amputees and homeless people?' I said, 'What
makes me sad is when something terrible happens to one of my
characters.' It sounds so bizarre and selfish and rarefied, but it's
true, because I don't know those people, and I know these characters
intimately."</TE>
<TE>   Wagner hasn't abandoned his turf--naked Hollywood--and the book is
spiced with some scathing references to real people, among them
screenwriters Ron Bass, William Goldman and Callie Khouri. The gibes
are ascribed to the bitter boyfriend of Tull's mother, a struggling
screenwriter named Ralph who insists on being called "Rafe" because
"it oscillates." "He says terrible things about Ron Bass but
ultimately becomes his big buddy, so I think his own sort of
shallowness is exposed," Wagner says. "I think you consider the
source. I don't mean me." Wagner says he populates his novels with
famous people because they're "part of the fabric of this town, so
it's just become a part of the fabric of my fiction." And he says
that most celebrities and industry movers who make cameos in his
books are flattered to do so. But not everyone is.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher says there have been times "he's written a character that's
potentially unfavorable, and someone may think they recognize
themself. Just for a minute it [makes them angry]. I think he walks
away without hearing some of these things." Wagner denies that his
books are roman a clefs. "If there's a character in real life that's
so fascinating that you'd want to portray him in fiction, you're
going to fail because there's nothing better than this real person.
And I don't want to set myself up to fail."</TE>
<TE>   Wagner writes like a native son because he is one--for all intents
and purposes.  When he was 8, his family moved to Beverly Hills,
where he was a popular kid at Beverly Vista Elementary School, which
pops up in the book. Early on, his own class struggle in Beverly
Hills was great sport. His father had relatively modest jobs in
entertainment as a radio consultant and producer for TV's "The Les
Crane Show," but Wagner played and partied in some of Beverly Hills'
wealthiest homes because he grew up with Hollywood royalty.</TE>
<TE>   He moved on to the desert of Beverly High and beckoning adulthood.
Neither appealed, so at 16, Wagner dropped out of school and began
working as a driver of ambulances and limousines. For all his
Hollywood connections, it was serendipity that nudged him into
screenwriting when he hooked up with an actress who dabbled in
writing. The pair wrote and sold comedies until Wagner went  on his
own. (He later wed the actress, Rebecca de Mornay, a marriage that
lasted less than a year.)</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until he was in his early 30s that he began writing
prose, starting with short stories modeled on F. Scott Fitzgerald's
Pat Hobby stories about a Hollywood hack writer. Wagner called his
own beleaguered screenwriter Bud Wiggins, whose travails made the
rounds of Hollywood when the author self-published 1,000 slender
copies that were sold at Book Soup in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   The buzz led to a book contract, which resulted in "Force
Majeure," a reference to a standard contractual clause that releases
studios from the deal if unforeseen disaster strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner delights in giving his books titles with multiple meanings.
"I'm Letting You Go" and "I'm Losing You," both allusions to phone
chatter, are part of a "titular trilogy" about love, loss and
redemption that will continue with his next book, "Still Holding." He
has also adapted a series of Charles Bukowski short stories for an
animated feature called "The Way the Dead Love" that's being made by
"Rugrats" creators Arlene Klasky and Gabor Csupo.</TE>
<TE>   And following his forays into directing with "Women in Film"
(2001) and "I'm Losing You," (1999), which were based on his novels,
Wagner plans to pursue his other career as a budding auteur. But
words, luscious and obscure and wittily strung together, will keep
drawing him back.</TE>
<TE>   Says Wagner: "I'm creating it as I go. But I'm enjoying writing
books a lot now. I feel I've hit a certain stride."</TE>

<LD>Rick Harris' work uniform is a neon orange vest and a hard hat. But
considering the maniacs he faces every day, he might be better served
in Kevlar body armor, a motorcycle helmet, football pads or all of
the above.</LD>
<LD>   That's because Harris and his fellow Caltrans maintenance workers
are on the firing line--the routine targets of bottles, battery acid,
jars of body fluids and other missiles. All are flung by passing
motorists.</LD>
<LD>   A few years ago, someone threw a full beer can at Harris. The
Budweiser landed short, striking him in the foot.</LD>
<TE>   But the worst injuries of all, Harris insists, are the verbal
ones. Aimed at his mother.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like that," said Harris, a 22-year veteran of the
California Department of Transportation. "I only have one momma."</TE>
<TE>   Agency officials keep no statistics on such attacks, but say they
are increasingly frequent. The culprits are frazzled motorists who
blame highway workers for the region's mounting traffic delays.</TE>
<TE>   For Caltrans workers, the frustrating irony in these attacks is
that some motorists see Caltrans efforts to improve and maintain the
freeways as nothing more than a source of roadway obstructions and
traffic headaches.</TE>
<TE>   Almost every Caltrans worker has a story about being the target of
an insult or projectile, often flung in anger.</TE>
<TE>   Not long ago, someone tossed a chocolate eclair at Caltrans
superintendent Pam Dennis as she supervised a maintenance crew on a
Los Angeles freeway. The errant pastry missed and instead struck her
truck windshield.</TE>
<TE>   "They flip us the bird all the time," Dennis said with a shrug.
"They see us as the bad guys."</TE>
<TE>   The problem has grown in direct proportion to the increase in
freeway congestion, prompting the agency in 1998 to arrange for
California Highway Patrol officers to park near Caltrans freeway
closures to dissuade angry motorists from lashing out.</TE>
<TE>   State lawmakers have tried to put the brakes on such attacks by
passing a bill in 1996 that doubled fines for misdemeanor crimes in
freeway construction zones.</TE>
<TE>   But CHP officers can't monitor every closure, so most of the time
Caltrans workers are on their own.</TE>
<TE>   "At least once a week people throw things at us," said Michael
Miles, deputy district director for maintenance in Los Angeles and
Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a problem limited to traffic-choked Southern
California. Bay Area drivers also have been known to lose their cool
on the roads.</TE>
<TE>   "During rush hour it gets real ugly," said Bob Haus, a spokesman
for the district office in San Francisco. "Sometimes we have to call
in the cops to protect our workers."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities don't know how many Caltrans workers have been hurt by
such attacks, but they say most injuries are minor scrapes and
bruises.</TE>
<TE>   The most serious injuries come when motorists ignore the orange
cones and signs and speed onto closed offramps and freeway lanes
where maintenance crews are working.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1924, 155 Caltrans employees have been killed and hundreds
have been hurt by drivers who have plowed into work crews on
freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans workers say many of those deaths and injuries are caused
by motorists who are angry that their regular route has been closed.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody takes the time to learn an alternate route," Dennis said.</TE>
<TE>   Harris suffered a broken shoulder a few years ago when a driver in
a Buick LeSabre drove onto a closed offramp on the Pasadena Freeway,
hit Harris and sent him spinning in the air like a pinwheel.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember seeing my feet flying up in the air," said Harris as
he took a break at a Caltrans maintenance office near Los Angeles
International Airport. "The guy got out of his car and complained
that his bumper was dented."</TE>
<TE>   It may seem to motorists that work crews are the source of
Southern California's notorious traffic congestion.</TE>
<TE>   After all, if traffic is bogged down and commuters see the workers
in their distinct orange outfits blocking lanes and offramps during
rush hour, who else would they blame?</TE>
<TE>   But agency officials say they do as much maintenance work at
night, on weekends and during off-peak hours as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Many other freeway closures are unavoidable--because of accidents
that spill diesel fuel on the pavement or smash guardrails. In those
cases, crews must block the roadway to make repairs, regardless of
the time of day or amount of traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists stuck in traffic often don't understand. They reach lane
closures long after collisions have been cleared and assume the
traffic delay is caused by a boneheaded Caltrans plan to make routine
repairs in the middle of rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that we want to be in their way," said Miles. "It's that
we have to be to keep the system functional."</TE>
<TE>   This can lead to ugly confrontations.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, equipment operator Alfredo Davis said a motorist
challenged him to a fight because he was in a Caltrans truck,
blocking traffic at night on a downtown freeway connector road that
others in a sweeper truck were cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Davis and his fellow workers are sturdy men who
could probably hold their own against the average driver. But it is
foolhardy, said Davis, to tussle with every stranger who picks a
fight.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is, you don't know who these people are," he said.
"You don't know if they have a gun or what."</TE>
<TE>   Even Caltrans' top administrator, Jeff Morales, has been a target.
A couple of years ago, when Morales toured agency facilities in Los
Angeles, he took a ride on a street sweeper on a downtown freeway
ramp. An angry motorist pulled off the freeway, got out of her car
and pounded on the sweeper door.</TE>
<TE>   "This lady was banging on the door, yelling at the director: 'Why
are you closing the ramp?'" Miles said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency urges its employees not to get tangled up with irate
motorists and instead to call the CHP for backup.</TE>
<TE>   But such confrontations have become so common that Caltrans
workers say they have learned to take the assaults and insults in
stride.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, it's like water off of a duck's back," Dennis
said. "Sometimes I just smile and wave back."</TE>

<HD>Legislative Last Call</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lobbying interests in Sacramento are hoping that bills they oppose
will die a quiet death Thursday, the last day for action on measures
introduced last year. There are two measures on which we especially
hope the Legislature will rouse itself in time--one to reduce auto
emissions and the other for fairer ways to pay for local government.</LD>
<LD>   The Legislature's pass-or-die rule applies to the house in which a
bill originated. So it is the state Assembly that needs to approve
the two measures: AB 1058, a modest step toward control of carbon
dioxide emissions from vehicles, and AB 680, to create an
experimental redistribution of sales tax revenue in the Sacramento
region. Both bills have triggered opposition out of proportion to
their likely impacts.</LD>
<LD>   AB 1058, by Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), directs the state Air
Resources Board to adopt regulations on the emission of carbon
dioxide from passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles and light trucks
by 2004 and then to determine when they realistically could be put
into effect. The state doesn't control carbon dioxide from exhaust
pipes now because it is not considered an immediate threat to public
health, though it is certainly a culprit in global warming. President
Bush promised during his campaign to reduce industrial emissions of
carbon dioxide but has now reneged.</LD>
<TE>   Auto makers scoff that the bill fails to set specific standards
and that California shouldn't meddle in a global problem. Setting
standards, however, is the air board's job. And California accounts
for an estimated 7% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions.
California should be the pioneer, as it was on smog reduction.</TE>
<TE>   AB 680, by Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento, would allow a slight
reallocation of future sales tax revenue in a six-county region
surrounding Sacramento, beginning several years from now. Instead of
all the local government share of sales taxes staying in the county
or city of origin, some of the new revenue would be distributed
regionwide by population and some as a reward for sensible planning
controls.</TE>
<TE>   The present system grossly distorts city planning because local
governments feel compelled to pursue "big box" stores and auto malls
for the sales taxes they generate. Their neighbors are often left to
suffer effects such as increased traffic. Steinberg's tiny pilot
program would spread a little of the windfall a little more fairly.
The system is so broken that this modest proposal could only help.</TE>

<HD>Cheney's Stone Wall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney may be spending too much time in
underground bunkers. His refusal to hand over information to Congress
about secret meetings of his energy task force last spring with
corporate executives, including Enron's, suggests that he has become
blinded to the fact that democracy relies on open government.</LD>
<LD>   On television this past weekend, Cheney inflated his position into
a mini-constitutional crisis, declaring he is determined to stem the
erosion of executive power that has taken place over the past three
decades. But even leading Republicans--including Rep. W.J. "Billy"
Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of a House committee that is investigating
Enron--are now calling on Cheney to cough up the documents, and his
stonewalling is fueling the perception that the administration has
something to hide.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, the vice president demonized Rep. Henry A. Waxman of
Los Angeles, charging that the Democrat is on a personal crusade to
tarnish the White House. But Waxman, along with John G. Dingell
(D-Mich.), asked for the information way back in April, long before
Enron became synonymous with scandal. What's more, neither Waxman nor
the others picking up the disclosure chant, including Sens. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Carl Levin (D-Mich.), have made specific
allegations of misdeeds.</LD>
<TE>   In his television attack, Cheney also asserted that General
Accounting Office head David M. Walker had backed away from suing for
the information. In fact, Walker says he decided to go easy in his
pursuit of the information in the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11 and
may still sue to make the documents public if Cheney isn't
forthcoming.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Cheney was really reaching when he claimed there is no
reason to hand over information because "there is no evidence to
indicate anybody did anything wrong in the administration." What
elected official wouldn't love to get away with that line of
argument? Most citizens would rather decide for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Long before Enron imploded, we called on Cheney to come clean
about the energy task force. Now, and with good reason, the pressure
on him has multiplied. Enron was the biggest corporate donor to the
Bush campaign. No fewer than 17 provisions in the final energy task
force report would have benefited the company. One, added at the last
minute, for instance, urged President Bush to push India to increase
oil and gas exploration--a possible boon to Enron's money-losing
natural gas plant in Dabhol, India.</TE>
<TE>   At Enron, executives were able to escape accountability through
bluster or obfuscation. The public should hold the executive branch
to a higher standard. In attacking Congress, Cheney is behaving as
though the best defense is a good offense. But on Sunday he looked as
feeble as the San Diego Chargers.</TE>

<HD>Sunshine on Sunrise Service</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There's something very David and Goliath about the battle between a
venerable civic group and a large television ministry over the
Hollywood Bowl's Easter sunrise service. Except that Goliath won. And
he did it on a coin toss, not on any test of strength or virtue.</LD>
<LD>   The nondenominational program has been a tradition for
generations, and for most if not all that time a Hollywood-based
civic group has produced it. Hollywood Bowl Easter Sunrise Services,
incorporated as a nonprofit organization in 1943, traces its roots to
the organizers of the 1921 Easter service, the first to be held in
the natural amphitheater then known as Daisy Dell.</LD>
<LD>   This very history is part of the present-day squabble. The
Hollywood group claims its forebears had a 99-year renewable lease
with Los Angeles County, which owns the property, to produce the
Easter service. But a search by the county counsel turned up no
written records of such an agreement.</LD>
<TE>   Enter Trinity Broadcasting Network, the reason the county was
searching its records. Not content with running the nation's largest
Christian television network, Costa Mesa-based televangelists Paul
and Jan Crouch cast a covetous eye on the nation's best-known Easter
sunrise service. According to the Hollywood group, Trinity gained
control of the group's board in 1992 and won approval to produce and
broadcast that year's Easter service.</TE>
<TE>   Already controversial in Orange County for what many consider its
over-the-top Christmas lights, Trinity put on a 1992 Hollywood Bowl
Easter program replete with flamboyant network personalities and
"prayer line" telephone numbers running across television screens.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, longtime sunrise service supporters regained
control of the board and returned to the program of preachers, hand
bell choirs and gospel singers that for decades had drawn thousands
to the bowl. So Trinity, which has featured Los Angeles County
Supervisor Mike Antonovich on its programs, took its quest to the
top. Last Friday the network won a coin toss to produce this year's
March 31 Hollywood Bowl service.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of a clear lease, county supervisors can't be
blamed for opening  the application process. As the county counsel
outlined in a 10-page memo, not to do so would have violated 1st
Amendment requirements to provide equal access to a public forum.
Only the Hollywood group and Trinity applied to conduct this year's
service. Fine, so far. But instead of exercising any form of civic
judgment about the use of a county-run property, the Board of
Supervisors flipped a coin.</TE>
<TE>   Has the Hollywood group done a poor job in the past? What about
Trinity's performance in 1992? Which group has the most community
support or the best record of inclusion?</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to avoid at least the appearance that the supervisors
have been cowed by the powerful broadcasters' demands or swayed by
ministry supporter Antonovich. Surely by next year they can come up
with a more rational way to pick an Easter preacher.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The order to no longer require U.S. servicewomen in Saudi Arabia to
wear a restrictive and oppressive body covering is long overdue
("Saudi Official Oppose U.S. Army Stance on Veil," Jan. 25).</LD>
<LD>   This has been an ongoing human rights violation for years. If the
Saudi government had required Asian Americans, African Americans or
any other select group to wear a particular piece of clothing in the
name of religion, the people of this country would have been
outraged.</LD>
<LD>   The dedicated woman who has been fighting this issue for over
seven years is Air Force Lt. Col. Martha McSally. She put her career
on the line to defend the rights of American women when the officers
above her would not help. She is a true hero in my eyes. Maybe the
Saudis will learn by this action that the U.S. will not allow the
human rights of our military personnel to be violated. Thanks to
McSally for one more step toward equality for my daughters.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Davis Reveals Plan to Limit Hospital Nurses to 5 Patients," Jan.
23: I've been an ER nurse for nearly 20 years. I've cared for
patients crammed into plastic chairs in hallways, stacked against the
walls on gurneys and literally out of the door in the emergency
entrance because there are not enough beds to accommodate them
inside. I've been forced to treat multiple patients on ventilators,
others with head injuries, heart attacks and those in intractable
pain simultaneously because the hospital claims it can't hire enough
nurses.</LD>
<LD>   The issue is not just about money, either. I remember asking one
nurse to stay over and work a double shift and his response was, "You
could offer me $200 an hour and I wouldn't stay." No rational person
relishes a job where you don't even have time to go to the bathroom
or that makes you fearful that someone is going to die because of too
little help.</LD>
<LD>   If those in charge continue to ignore adequate patient care and
instead insist on purchasing a CT scanner or building a fancier
lobby, with their photo in the newspaper as proof, both patients and
nurses are going to suffer. Staffing ratios, as with elementary
schools, will force the guys who control the purse strings to do the
right thing and hire more help.</LD>
<TE>   Will this solve the entire health care crisis? Certainly not. But
it will definitely go a long way toward improving things both for
patients as well as the nurses who care for them.</TE>
<TE>   Richard C. Mallyon</TE>
<TE>   Lancaster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Congratulations to Gov. Gray Davis and the California Nurses Assn.
for creating nurse staffing ratios that have no hope of being
successful. They will not succeed because there simply aren't enough
nurses or dollars to meet the current demand, let alone what is
anticipated for the future.</TE>
<TE>   This action serves to further the rift between hospital
administrations and the nursing profession when what is really needed
is a collaborative effort to create and implement patient-care
delivery systems that will meet the needs of patients, nurses and the
bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Carol O'Dea RN</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This staffing minimum is long overdue. Managers at local hospitals
claim they have many unfilled positions, which is true. What the
managers do not tell the public is that they do not even bother to
post the unfilled positions or advertise them to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem in attracting qualified nurses and other health
care professionals is the lack of a decent paycheck. A registered
nurse with a bachelor of science degree is paid less than the
hospital's painter or locksmith.</TE>
<TE>   After over 20 years in the health care field, I am attending
school to train for another profession. I love patient care; I just
cannot stand the oppression from management any longer. I doubt if
the new state guidelines will change anything.</TE>

<LD>Re "Enron Auditor Says Fired Partner Drove Shredding," Jan. 25: The
difference between "evildoers" and the sheep who follow became
apparent last week. David Duncan, former partner of the Andersen
accounting firm, appeared before Congress in an expensive suit,
protected by lawyers, and refused to answer any questions that were
put to him, and he walked out.</LD>
<LD>   On the sheep side, John Walker Lindh was brought to court in
chains, sporting the latest in prison jumpsuits, and was returned to
his maximum security cell ("U.S. Talib Goes to Court on Conspiracy
Counts," Jan. 25). My guess is that Duncan will cut a deal and serve
no time for ratting out the other Enron evildoers. And Lindh will be
on the fast track for life in a federal prison.</LD>

<TE>   Johnny the Kid came from good stock. As an adventurous young lad
he chose the excitement of riding with the notorious Osama bin Laden
gang. The sheriff and his posse combed the hills until they rounded
up the gang--minus the leader. The townspeople were outraged to find
Johnny hiding out with the band of outlaws. They found the Kid
guilty, by public opinion, and hung him in the town square for all to
see.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, across town, due to lack of funds, the bank of Enron
was shutting its doors. As the local ranchers were pounding on the
front door demanding their money, the banker and his assistants were
stuffing their satchels with cash. The dirty sidewinders ducked out
the back door and caught the first stage out of town.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff and his deputies were torn as they formed a posse to
give chase. They were good pals of the banker, for he had contributed
greatly in getting them their jobs. So, when they returned
empty-handed, saying they lost the trail, the townsfolk eyed them
suspiciously. Rumor has it that the banker settled in another town
and opened a new bank.</TE>

<TE>   Ain't that the pot calling the kettle black?</TE>
<TE>   While the actions of Enron and its auditor Andersen are
deplorable, I can't help but be amused at our government's posturing
and outrage. The U.S. government is the master of creative
accounting. Billions are accounted for off balance sheets and the
financial condition of the country is grossly misrepresented.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, average Americans don't appear to be overly
concerned with the big picture as long as they get theirs and life
continues along in the same pattern. I fear that one day the charade
of governmental accounting will catch up to us (possibly when Social
Security goes bankrupt) and, like Enron investors, the public will be
left wondering how this could have happened.</TE>

<TE>   It was a fast, great decision to freeze the assets of the backers
of terrorism. The administration would hardly make the same decision
against the executive class no matter how crooked and conniving
members of the Enron hierarchy were to their own workers.</TE>
<TE>   It would be too simple to freeze the assets on stock traded as of
a set date in volume over 1,000 shares and give that money back to
the pension fund. It would certainly take fewer lawyers, who are
about to drain away whatever is left.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Federal Agents Probe Shredding Inside Enron," Jan. 23: "I'm
absolutely confident the American people know that my administration
has acted the right way," President Bush said. Then, Dubya, you
wouldn't mind turning over all printed, recorded and digital
information taken before, during and after your administration's
energy meetings with Kenneth Lay or his agents, would you? As a
voting American about to be stiffed for your bankrupt pal's losses, I
have a right to know.</TE>

<LD>Whatever inspired you to give such prominence to shopworn liberal
drivel like "Class Dismissed" by Neal Gabler (Opinion, Jan. 27)?</LD>
<LD>   From its contention that the American public has been
"brainwashed" to its specious claim that the purpose of the tax code
is as a "tool for correcting an imbalance" (in reality, most
Americans consider that the purpose of taxes is to provide defense
and various social services), this piece simply restates the liberal
belief that the populace is ignorant of its own best interests and
somehow must be brought to enlightenment by an intellectual (liberal)
elite.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not surprised the author is a fellow at the Norman Lear
Center, though Norman Lear might well think twice before turning his
back on a system that turned him into a multimillionaire.</LD>

<TE>   Gabler overlooks the views of Ralph Nader, which are shared by
many Democrats who would not vote for Nader but nevertheless believe
our society is in a state of capitalism with a vengeance, where the
richest reap the most rewards. The current patriotic fever makes
those who utter such statements appear suspiciously antipatriotic.</TE>
<TE>   Trickle-down theory is a joke to the homeless on the streets of
L.A. The millions who do not have any health insurance also are aware
of the fact that the rich never worry about health care.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who is not rich who votes Republican deserves to pay for
the free ride the very rich are getting on the backs of the middle
class. We will see if the single-issue voters who vote Republican
think the same come November.</TE>

<TE>   Gabler is correct in 5% of his article on class conflict. There
are, indeed, many anecdotes like mine. My wonderful father was a
butcher who taught me that hard work, intelligence and education
could make me a millionaire. I fulfilled our "dream." Gabler is also
correct that it isn't intelligence alone that made me a success. I am
dumb enough to think that Karl Marx had died long ago, but Gabler's
diatribe proves me wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Saul H. Sanders</TE>
<TE>   Palos Verdes Estates</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After reading "Class Dismissed," I thank the Social Security
system for benefits to my mother on my behalf because I was a minor
when my father died, thank the public schools and universities and
the taxpayers for my education, thank the G.I. Bill for its financial
assistance to my education and, finally, of all governmental
institutions, I thank the IRS, which provided an excellent
opportunity to tax-defer some of my income for a secure retirement,
through the powerful 403(b) plan. I am proud of the help of the
government and these wonderful programs that leveled the playing
field so I could have a shot and ultimately succeed at going from a
have-not to a have.</TE>
<TE>   Gabler courageously and accurately outlined that investing in
Americans, public institutions and infrastructure is the best
investment we can make.</TE>

<LD>Re "New Dawn for Bowl Easter Service," Jan. 26: All of Los Angeles
should rejoice at the outcome of the coin flip for Easter sunrise
services at the Hollywood Bowl. Paul and Jan Crouch are perfect to
put on the show. They are the Barnum and Bailey of the Christian
world. Jan is virtually made to order for Easter, with that massive
mane of lavender hair (perfect color for Easter) and a painted face
that tops any painted egg.</LD>

<TE>   Shame on Los Angeles County for not being able to make a decision.
Allowing an Orange County television ministry to take control of the
Hollywood Bowl Easter sunrise service by "kissing off" the
responsibility with a coin toss is not only irresponsible but stupid.
Perhaps the voters of L.A. County should flip a coin to decide whom
to vote for in the next elections.</TE>

<LD>With his denial of clemency for Stephen Wayne Anderson, Gov. Gray
Davis exsanguinates an already anemic political and moral record
(Jan. 27). Oblivious to the pleas of the victim's family to spare
Anderson's life, Davis also ignores more than 60% of polled
Californians who opt for life without the possibility of parole over
death. He becomes an accessory and accomplice to premeditated and
state-sanctioned murder. He implicates us all.</LD>

<HD>Queenie Leonard, 96; Cabaret Singer Appeared in Films</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Queenie Leonard, British cabaret singer and actress who performed
proper English maids and other character roles in more than 30
Hollywood films and was the lilting voice of a bird in Disney's 1951
"Alice In Wonderland," has died. She was 96.</LD>
<LD>   Although legally blind for many years, the impeccably groomed
Leonard maintained her independence until the end of her life. She
died Jan. 17 of natural causes in her West Los Angeles apartment,
said her friend Patience Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   Born Pearl Walker in Manchester, England, the young chanteuse took
the name Queenie Leonard to perform onstage with her entertainer
father, John Leonard Walker, when she was 14.</LD>
<TE>   She quickly became popular in stage musicals, including Cole
Porter's "Nymph Errant" with Gertrude Lawrence, and entertained
London's cafe society at the Mayfair Hotel, Claridge's, the Cafe
Anglais and Ciro's. She also began working in British films,
beginning with the 1931 "Who Killed Doc Robin," and was on British
radio and neophyte television programs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1939, she moved to Hollywood with her set designer husband,
whom she later divorced. She was cast as a switchboard operator in
"Confirm or Deny" and as Sister Agatha in "Ladies in Retirement,"
both in 1941, and worked steadily in films through the mid-1960s. She
was often uncredited, as was the case in "What a Way to Go!" starring
Shirley MacLaine, and in "My Fair Lady," both in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard unsurprisingly was popular in musical motion pictures,
including "Mary Poppins" and "The Sound of Music." For Disney, she
also voiced Princess in "101 Dalmatians."</TE>
<TE>   Moving her nightclub experience to the U.S., Leonard performed at
the Deauville on Sunset Strip and the Blue Angel in New York, and
became a regular in Hollywood's old Turnabout Theater.</TE>
<TE>   She appeared occasionally on television, including episodes of the
1960s series "Bewitched" and "I Dream of Jeannie."</TE>
<TE>   Her handprints were placed in London's Theatre Museum at Covent
Garden, a part of the Theatre Collection of the Victoria and Albert
Museum.</TE>
<TE>   Twice divorced, Leonard had no children and no known survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland said a memorial is planned for 1 p.m. Feb. 17 in
Westwood Cemetery Chapel. Memorial contributions can be sent to the
Braille Institute, to the Actors Fund, to the Motion Picture Relief
Fund or to any charity of the donor's choice benefiting animals.</TE>

<LD>Travel and financial services company American Express Co. said
fourth-quarter profit fell 56% as fewer people traveled by air after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Net income dropped to $297 million, or 22 cents a share, from $677
million, or 50 cents. Revenue fell 3% to $5.87 billion. For the year,
net income was $1.31 billion, a 53% decline from 2000 and its first
drop since 1994.</LD>
<LD>   American Express is cutting about 15% of its work force and paring
expenses as it copes with an economic slowdown that has sapped its
credit card and asset management businesses. Thousands of workers,
including Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault, were displaced from its
New York headquarters when the World Trade Center collapsed.</LD>
<TE>   Chenault announced in December that severance and related costs
for the most recent round of job cuts would reduce fourth-quarter
profit by as much as $280 million, before taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The results fell short of the average analyst estimate of 23
cents, according to a poll by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   American Express shares fell 70 cents to close at $36.29 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Other company earnings, excluding one-time gains and charges
unless noted:</TE>
<TE>   * Safeco Corp., a property casualty insurer based in Seattle, said
fourth-quarter profit fell 16% because of losses related to Enron
Corp.'s collapse, an increase in claims from the terrorist attacks
and larger-than-expected homeowner claims. Net income fell to $8.6
million, or 6 cents a share, from $10.2 million, or 8 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue was little changed at $1.67 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Tyson Foods Inc., the largest U.S. producer of beef, chicken and
pork, said fiscal first-quarter profit jumped nearly fivefold,
boosted by added sales from its newly acquired IBP beef business. Net
income at the Springdale, Ark.-based company rose to $126.9million,
or 36 cents a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 29, from $27 million,
or 12 cents, a year earlier. Earnings beat Wall Street esteimates and
met the high end of the company's revised numbers provided earlier
this month. Revenue climbed to $5.86 billion from $1.77 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Drugstore.com Inc., a Bellevue, Wash.-based seller of
pharmaceuticals via the Internet, said its fourth-quarter loss more
than quadrupled after the company wrote down the value of some
assets. The loss widened to $182.9million, or $2.75 a share, from
$43.2 million, or 68 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 20% to $43.5
million. For the first quarter, the company forecast sales of about
$40 million and expects to add 190,000 customers. It predicted a loss
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $25 million
to $26 million for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Tupperware Corp., a maker and direct seller of plastic storage
containers, said fourth-quarter profit rose 30% as sales through mall
kiosks, television and the Internet increased. Net income rose to
$28.5 million, or 48 cents a share, from $21.9 million, or 38 cents,
a year earlier. Sales rose 10% to $326.7 million on higher Tupperware
sales in U.S. and Latin American markets. Sales fell in Europe and
Asia; the company said it had to discount to stimulate sales,
especially in Europe.</TE>

<HD>Ticketmaster Loss Narrows</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Cost cuts at Citysearch unit, more Match.com
customers help boost results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ticketmaster, which sells concert and sports tickets, said its
fourth-quarter loss narrowed to $46 million as it signed up more
customers for its Match.com singles Web site and cut costs at its
Citysearch Web sites.</LD>
<LD>   The loss was 32 cents a share, compared with a loss of $84.9
million, or 60 cents, a year earlier. Sales of the Los Angeles
company rose 11% to $159.6 million.</LD>
<LD>   Ticketmaster is 68%-owned by USA Networks Inc. USA Networks agreed
last month to sell its cable-television networks including USA and
the Sci Fi Channel to Vivendi Universal and focus on its commerce
businesses, such as Ticketmaster.</LD>
<TE>   The company said it will fire an additional 111 employees at the
Citysearch Web sites, which offer consumer and entertainment
information about cities across the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding costs related to acquiring other companies, advertising
provided by USA Networks and some other expenses, Ticketmaster said
earnings would have been 6 cents a share. On that basis, the company
was forecast to earn 4 cents a share, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Ticketmaster shares rose $1.25, or 5.8%, to $22.75 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   In other earnings news at California companies Monday:</TE>
<TE>   * Beckman Coulter Inc., a maker of medical diagnostic equipment,
said fourth-quarter earnings rose 12%. The results, in line with
analysts' expectations, reflect rapid growth of the Fullerton
company's robotic genetic analysis products and equipment to detect
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings were $48.3 million, or 75 cents a share, up from $43
million, or 69 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 10% to $578.3
million. The company said it expects earnings growth of 18% to 20%
this year, with sales rising 7% to 8%.</TE>
<TE>   The stock rose $1.46 to $46.28 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   * FileNet Corp. said fourth-quarter earnings fell, but the Costa
Mesa software maker still surprised Wall Street, which didn't expect
a profit until at least the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The company posted net income of $1.9 million, or 5 cents a share,
compared with $14.9 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier. Analysts
expected a loss of 3 cents a share. Revenue fell nearly 23% to $86.3
million.</TE>
<TE>   Results were announced after regular trading. The stock was up 61
cents to $19.23 on Nasdaq, then surpassed $20 after hours.</TE>
<TE>   * Diedrich Coffee Inc. said fiscal second-quarter profit jumped to
$1.3 million, or 26 cents a share, from $164,000, or 5 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue fell 18% to $16 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine specialty coffee company said it continued to reduce
debt and eliminate unprofitable retail stores and wholesale accounts,
as well as minimize overhead and capital expenditures. Sales for
stores open at least a year, a key industry indicator, fell 5.2%.</TE>

<HD>UC Group Signs Lease Valued at $16 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In one of the biggest office leases the Century Boulevard corridor
has seen in several years, the University of California's
medical-billing group will consolidate much of its local operations
into 81,000 square feet at the renovated Airport Spectrum complex.</LD>
<LD>   The group's 10-year lease with an affiliate of Van Nuys-based
Decron Corp. is valued at nearly $16 million.</LD>
<LD>   Decron purchased the 488,000-square-foot property at 5757 Century
Blvd. for about $20 million about 11/2 years ago and planned to
invest $10 million or more in needed upgrades.</LD>
<TE>   With Westside office rents then skyrocketing, the company expected
the improvements to attract large tenants seeking affordable
alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Although Airport Spectrum has some 100,000 square feet still
available, the university is the type of tenant Decron principals
hoped for, said David Thurman of Grubb &amp; Ellis Co., who with Chris
Sinfield and Bill Maher handles leasing at the property.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Gray and Dean Heck of Beitler Commercial Realty Services
negotiated on UC's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   The Century corridor, adjacent to Los Angeles International
Airport, was one of the Southland's weakest office sub-markets during
the early-1990s recession.</TE>
<TE>   It was showing signs of recovery when Decron bought the office
complex.</TE>
<TE>   The area continued to improve, but again is facing slack tenant
demand as the economy slows.</TE>
<TE>   According to Grubb &amp; Ellis figures, tenants within the
4-million-square-foot Century Boulevard office market occupy about
300,000 square feet less today than a year ago. The vacancy rate has
risen from about 22% to 29%.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc. plans to form alliances with independent
real estate companies to build its business in Southern California
and the U.S. Southeast.</LD>
<LD>   Cushman, the second-largest U.S. commercial real estate broker, is
allying with Commercial San Diego; Commercial Carolina, which has
offices in North and South Carolina; and Commercial Jacksonville, in
Florida, each a former Cushman office.</LD>
<LD>   The other members of the alliance are Commercial Tennessee, with
offices in Memphis, Little Rock, Ark., and Mississippi; Eason Graham
&amp; Sandler of Birmingham and Huntsville, Ala.; and Mission Property of
Nashville, Tenn., company officials said.</LD>
<TE>   New York-based Cushman's primary objective is to build up its
business in industrial warehousing and distribution space, said Bruce
Mosler, president of U.S. operations. A secondary objective is to add
strength in office sales and leasing.</TE>
<TE>   Cushman will use the alliances to expand its services to corporate
clients, such as "big-box retailers, manufacturing and
distribution-oriented companies, information technology businesses"
and others that need office and industrial space in a large number of
markets, said Derrick Mashore, Cushman's director of client services.</TE>
<TE>   Alliance members will pay an undisclosed fee and be able to market
themselves as members of the Cushman &amp; Wakefield alliance, Mosler
said. The program may be expanded to other markets, Mosler said,
though he added, "we're not looking to allow a lot of people to have
use of our brand name."</TE>
<TE>   Cushman, a unit of Mitsubishi Estate Co. of Tokyo, has 42 offices
nationwide, Mosler said.</TE>

<HD>Courtney Love Receives Court OK to Pursue Labor Claim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chuck Philips</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Court of Appeal on Monday allowed singer Courtney Love
to proceed with her legal challenge to a California labor code
amendment as part of her lawsuit against Vivendi-owned Universal
Music Group.</LD>
<LD>   In December 1999, Love decided to stop recording music for
Universal. Last year, Universal sued Love, seeking millions of
dollars in damages from her for five undelivered albums. Love
countersued Universal, accusing the company of "unconscionable"
dealings and contending that her recording contract was illegal and
excessively long compared with other California labor agreements.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the court denied a petition by Universal to remove from
Love's suit a challenge that focuses on a California labor code
amendment that essentially keeps recording artists tied to contracts
longer than other workers.</LD>
<TE>   Love's breach-of-contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court is
scheduled to go to trial in June.</TE>

<HD>December New-Home Sales Set '01 Record</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New-home sales rose 5.7% in December and set a record for the year,
the government said Monday, as the housing sector registered a
stunning performance despite the U.S. economic recession.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the one resilient part of the economy, the one that has
continued to impress throughout this recession," said Fred Breimyer,
chief economist for State Street Corp.</LD>
<LD>   New homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
946,000 last month, up from a revised 895,000 pace in November, the
Commerce Department said. December home sales were ahead of
expectations of analysts polled by Reuters, who had forecast a sales
pace of 925,000 units.</LD>
<TE>   The sales level for the year was 900,000 units, 2.6% above the
877,000 volume for 2000. The annual figure is the highest since the
government began keeping track in 1963 and exceeds the 1998 high of
886,000.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of existing homes also set a record for 2001 with 5.25
million units, the National Assn. of Realtors said last week.</TE>
<TE>   By region, sales of new homes last month soared 35.1% in the West,
but fell in all other parts of the country, dropping 9.6% in the
Midwest, 1.4% in the Northeast and 1.1% in the South.</TE>
<TE>   Economists discounted the surge in the West, saying warm weather
may have boosted construction.</TE>
<TE>   Housing activity has remained strong throughout the U.S. economic
downturn because of low interest rates and lean inventories. In one
of the most aggressive rate-cutting sprees in history, the Federal
Reserve cut short-term rates 11 times last year.</TE>
<TE>   The popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell as low as 6.45% in
November, but rose to more than 7% in December, according to home
finance giant Freddie Mac.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the strong performance of residential real estate in
2001 may mean it will not contribute to an eventual U.S. economic
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be somewhat sympathetic to the view that housing has nowhere
to go," Breimyer said.</TE>

<HD>Japan's Jobless Rate Again Sets Record</HD>
<DH>Economy: Analysts say unemployment could continue to grow
as more companies announce drastic cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Japan's unemployment rate reached a record 5.6% in December, as the
nation's continuing economic slowdown dragged down corporate profits
and chipped away at jobs.</LD>
<LD>   With the nation battling a decade-long slowdown, the jobless rate
has been hitting record highs almost every month since July when it
reached 5%--the highest since the government began keeping track in
1953.</LD>
<LD>   December's results, announced today, marked the fourth month in a
row that Japan's jobless rate hit a record high. In November, the
unemployment rate hit 5.5%, as jobs were lost in onetime mainstay
sectors such as manufacturing and construction.</LD>
<TE>   It hit 5.4% in October and 5.3% in September. The U.S.
unemployment rate hit a six-year high of 5.8% in December.</TE>
<TE>   For 2001, Japan's unemployment rate stood at 5%, also a record
high.</TE>
<TE>   For December, the number of unemployed people in Japan was 3.37
million, 390,000 higher than the same month last year.</TE>
<TE>   The male jobless rate for December came in at a record high 5.8%.
For women it was 5.1%, 0.2 of a percentage point higher than in
November.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the unemployment situation in Japan could worsen.
Facing a global slowdown and pressured to cut costs, companies have
been announcing drastic job cuts that have been rare in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   The restructuring plans from companies in the electronics, banking
and telecommunications sectors are expected to send tens of thousands
of people out in the streets looking for work.</TE>
<TE>   Hitoshi Suzuki, senior economist with Daiwa Institute of Research
in Tokyo, said he is forecasting the unemployment rate rising as high
as 6.4% through 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Although the nation's corporate production may improve this year
on the back of U.S. economic recovery and inventory adjustments at
home, much of Japan's job problems are rooted in the need for labor
to move from past thriving sectors such as manufacturing to emerging
service industries.</TE>
<TE>   "Unemployment is going to keep rising gradually," Suzuki said.
"The joblessness that comes from structural causes is not going to go
away."</TE>
<TE>   Masato Chino, director of the government's labor statistics
office, said the number of unemployed among heads of households is
increasing. He also said that for the year 2001 there was a loss of
370,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector from the previous year,
marking the ninth straight year of decline.</TE>
<TE>   "The conditions for employment remain very serious," Chino said.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has reminded the public that
growing unemployment is part of the pain that must come with his
economic reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi is trying to clean up the bad debts at the nation's banks
and encourage competition in protected areas to put the country back
on track toward stable growth without resorting to pork-barrel public
works spending.</TE>
<TE>   Both those measures could push unemployment higher.</TE>
<TE>   Jun Ohmi, a spokesman for Pasona, a Tokyo-based temporary
employment company, said people looking for temporary jobs were
nearly all women until just a few years ago, reflecting the corporate
culture here that placed men in lifetime jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the number of men looking for temporary jobs is slowly
increasing, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The pain that accompanies structural reforms is expected to
grow," Ohmi said. "Unemployment has grown into a serious problem."</TE>

<HD>Jenny Craig to Be Sold for $115 Million</HD>
<DH>Acquisition: The husband and wife team will step down from
the weight-loss company they founded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A slimmed-down Jenny Craig Inc. agreed Monday to sell itself to a
private investment group for $115 million, or $5.30 a share.</LD>
<LD>   The price offered by the buyout group, led by New York-based ACI
Capital Co., represents a 68% premium over Friday's closing price of
$3.15. Sid and Jenny Craig, the husband and wife team who founded the
company and control 67% of its shares, will receive $73 million as a
result of the transaction. They will continue to hold a small $4
million stake in the La Jolla-based company but will not be involved
in its management.</LD>
<LD>   Named to succeed Sid Craig as chairman and chief executive was
Kent Kreh, a former chief executive of Weight Watchers International
Inc. Sid Craig will remain on the company's board.</LD>
<TE>   ACI Managing Director Kevin Penn declined to comment on other
financial terms of the transaction. Sally Stewart of Edelman
Worldwide, the public relations firm that represents Jenny Craig
Inc., said no one from the company was available to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Penn, in an interview, called Jenny Craig Inc. "a terrific
company" in a "growth industry." He said that as baby boomers get
older and heavier, they will turn to such companies as Jenny Craig to
lose weight. "It is not just about looks," Penn said. "It is about
how long you are going to live and how healthy you are going to be."</TE>
<TE>   But Jenny Craig Inc. hasn't yet been able to leverage the trend
toward obesity to fatten its business. Since the mid-1990s, the
company has been on a steady diet, dropping hundreds of weight-loss
centers in the face of competition and bad publicity.</TE>
<TE>   A turning point came in 1997 when the company settled
long-standing false advertising complaints that arose from a federal
investigation of the weight-loss industry. Though the company did not
admit guilt, it was hurt by Federal Trade Commission allegations that
it overstated the success of its diet program.</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Craig also had been hurt by competition from a succession of
diet books, low-fat foods and prescription drugs that help people
lose weight. Its number of domestic weight-loss centers, which
account for nearly 80% of the firm's revenue, fell to 502 last year,
down 23% from 655 in 1997. The figure includes company-owned and
franchise locations. Total revenue declined 22.3% to $283.6 million
in 2001 from $365.1 million in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The company reported modest improvement for the quarter that ended
Sept. 30, which it attributed in part to a new weight-loss regimen
that gave dieters more flexibility in their food choices. The company
said dieters chose "more appealing" foods that also happened to be
more expensive. Jenny Craig derives most of its revenue from food
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Penn said that no significant changes were planned for the
business, which, he said, should continue to improve.</TE>
<TE>   The Craigs have been involved in the weight-loss industry since
1970, when Sid hired Jenny to manage a chain of fitness clubs. They
married in 1979, sold the fitness clubs and moved to Australia, where
they started Jenny Craig Inc. They opened their first U.S. center in
1985 and went public in 1991. They continue to operate in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Sid and Jenny Craig, both 69, each earned an annual
salary of $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Jenny Craig shares rose $1.97 to $5.12 in over-the-counter
trading.</TE>

<HD>Enron Workers File Suit Over 'Staggering Losses'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. employees past and present who said they suffered
"staggering losses" in their retirement funds filed a lawsuit Monday
seeking reimbursement from top company executives.</LD>
<LD>   The legal action came as the wife of ousted Chairman and Chief
Executive Kenneth L. Lay was claiming in a television appearance that
the couple are nearly broke.</LD>
<LD>   The group of more than 400 Enron employees, whose 401(k)
retirement plans are now virtually worthless, contends in the federal
lawsuit filed in Houston that employees were urged to invest in Enron
stock but were not told how fragile the company's financial condition
was. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2.</LD>
<TE>   The suit names as defendants Lay, former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling
and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, among others.
Those three executives sold more than $198 million in stock, the suit
alleges. The suit also names Northern Trust Co., trustee for the
retirement plan, and Andersen, Enron's former accountant.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron executives were profiting from an elaborate shell game,
using the hard-earned retirement savings of their loyal employees,"
Randy McClanahan, a lawyer representing the group, said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   This is the latest in dozens of lawsuits filed against current and
former Enron executives, accusing them of misleading investors. The
company and its officers have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   So did Linda Lay, who defended her husband, in a taped interview
aired Monday on NBC's "Today" show, as an "honest, decent, moral
human being who would do absolutely nothing wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Lay, appearing bitter and emotional, told NBC News correspondent
Lisa Myers that everything the family owns is for sale except the
opulent Houston home where the interview took place over the weekend.
Ken Lay, Myers noted, has been advised by his lawyers to avoid
speaking to the media.</TE>
<TE>   Lay acknowledged that her husband earned "a massive amount of
money." However, she added: "It's all gone. There's nothing left.
Everything we had mostly was in Enron stock."</TE>
<TE>   The couple's wealth has been further drained by cash calls on
other long-term investments, and the Lays are nearly bankrupt, she
said. Lay said that she understands the anger being focused on her
husband but that he did not know all that occurred at Enron before
the company crumbled into insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   Public relations professionals, who asked not to be identified,
saw the interview as a desperate move to humanize Ken Lay--but one
that may not play well.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what ... they were thinking," one said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Petitfils knows the risks of gambling firsthand. He remembers
well the night he lost $4,000--more than two months' take-home
pay--playing blackjack in Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   "I was doing really well in the beginning. That's how it always
starts, and every time I lost I would bet a lot more," recalled
Petitfils. "That's why I don't go to Vegas very often. I know where
my faults are."</LD>
<LD>   Or does he? Petitfils, a 48-year-old supervisor at a Sav-on
drugstore in Agoura Hills, may be avoiding the blackjack tables, but
he has plowed such a big chunk of his savings into the stock market
that he may be gambling with his goals of taking early retirement and
paying for his two kids' college educations.</LD>
<TE>   "If Rick wants to retire in six years, he needs to spread his
chips around the table," said Chris Reedy, the founder of Reedy Asset
Management in Newport Beach. "Rather than ride the roulette wheel,
Rick should reduce his stock exposure and increase his bond
allocation."</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, he brings a sizable stake to the table. By
forgoing all but a few small luxuries--such as the occasional
vacation to Hawaii or British Columbia, air fare courtesy of a family
connection--he and wife Maria have built a $267,000 nest egg. Not bad
on a combined annual salary of $56,000.</TE>
<TE>   His share of that income--$35,000--is the result of a decision 10
years ago to accept a 50% cut in pay in return for a job that let him
spend more time with his family. Until 1992, he was a district
manager for Kentucky Fried Chicken, overseeing the operations of as
many as 20 stores at a time. He worked 14-to-15-hour days and drove
about 35,000 miles a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see a lot of my son when he was growing up; I couldn't
go to a lot of his functions," he said. "Now I live a mile from my
job."</TE>
<TE>   It helps that Maria, 44, plans to continue working as a teacher's
aide for the Las Virgenes Unified School District until she's 62. And
the family's overhead is low. The Petitfils own their three cars and
their only debt other than a small mortgage is a 3.5%, $15,000 Small
Business Administration loan they used to rebuild their home after
the Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   But with 85% of his portfolio invested in stocks--and more than a
third of that in risky technology shares--Petitfils has placed
himself at the mercy of an unforgiving market. In the last few
months, for instance, the value of his portfolio has tumbled more
than 11%.</TE>
<TE>   "The equity markets are the most volatile investment tool there
is. The market is for people with long-term horizons, and Rick needs
to adjust for his phase of life," said Jim Macy, vice president of
investments for Reedy Asset Management.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, a 48-year-old is years away from the period when a
shift to more conservative investments--such as bonds and
certificates of deposit--is necessary. But in this case, the goals of
early retirement and paying for collegeare more immediate.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Petitfils, 18, is a freshman at California Lutheran
University in Thousand Oaks, where he has a scholarship that supplies
$10,000 a year if he maintains a 2.7 grade point average and works 10
hours a week for the school. That and student loans, $6,000 a year
from mom and dad and contributions from Rick Petitfils' parents take
care of the $27,000 annual cost. Daughter Michelle, 12, is a few
years away.</TE>
<TE>   To reduce the risk in Petitfils' portfolio, the planners said he
should cut his stock exposure to 60% to 65%. The remaining 35% to 40%
should be invested in a laddered portfolio of fixed-income
investments, such as Treasury bonds and high-grade corporate bonds. A
laddered portfolio is invested in securities with a range of
maturities. As securities mature, the money is reinvested in new
securities, usually at the longer end of the maturity range.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to reduce volatility in Petitfils' portfolio by
replacing equity-heavy and tech-heavy growth assets with a less
volatile combination of income-producing assets," Macy said.By the
time he's 55, Petitfils' 401(k) account from KFC should be worth
about $165,000. At that point, he can use the money to purchase an
annuity that would provide income of $13,800 a year over 20 years
assuming a relatively modest 6% yearly return, the planners said.
Returns from the couple's cash and stock holdings should add $1,770
or so to their annual income, and Petitfils' pension from KFC will
contribute $3,600 annually.</TE>
<TE>   The grand total in year one of early retirement, including Maria's
salary: about $40,000, which should be more than enough to take care
of the couple's expenses, allowing them to maintain their lifestyle
plus a few luxuries and a vacation or two, the planners said. If
Social Security remains intact, all the better--the planners chose
not to include it in their analysis.</TE>
<TE>   After the money from Petitfils' 401(k) is depleted, the couple can
rely on Maria's teacher retirement account, the pension from KFC and
the couple's individual retirement accounts--the two IRAs are
currently valued at a combined $144,000--to see them through
retirement, the planners said.</TE>
<TE>   The Petitfils own two zero-coupon bonds maturing this year at
$21,500 that they planned to sell to come up with their $6,000 annual
contribution to each child's education. But the planners suggested
making the bond money work even harder by using it to fund a 529
College Savings Plan for Ryan that can be rolled over later for
Michelle. California's version allows parents to put more than
$120,000 into a tax-deferred account invested in a changing mix of
stocks and bonds--more stocks at first and more bonds as the college
years approach--that will be taxed at the child's rate when the money
is withdrawn for college expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Macy and Reedy also recommended using $10,000 from the bond
proceeds to bolster the couple's emergency fund.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of your assets are in sheltered or retirement
accounts, so you need some avenues to tap money without doing
something that would have tax or penalty implications," Macy said.</TE>
<TE>   Petitfils is far enough along in his retirement preparations that
he might consider easing up a bit, the planners said.</TE>
<TE>   "You are in a position to meet your financial goals, so if you
want to live a little, live a little," Macy said.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Finish Flat Amid Doubts</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Investors await Fed's first meeting of the year
and confirmation the economy is beginning to recover from recession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks were little changed Monday as lingering doubts about the
timing of an economic recovery dampened investor enthusiasm and
another big bankruptcy weighed on the market.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the market was waiting for the two-day meeting of
the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which begins today.
Although the committee is not expected to reduce interest rates
again, traders want to see what predictions the Fed makes about an
economic turnaround.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 25.67 points, or 0.3%,
at 9,865.75, recovering from a drop of as much as 41 points.</LD>
<TE>   The broader market was mixed. The technology-dominated Nasdaq
composite index rose 6.21 points, or 0.3%, to 1,943.91, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slipped 0.2 point, nearly unchanged, to
1,133.06.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers 13 to 12 on Nasdaq, and were about even on the
New York Stock Exchange in moderate trading.</TE>
<TE>   Though Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated last week that the
economy appears to be strengthening, traders will be scrutinizing the
situation report the Fed is expected to release when its meeting
concludes on Wednesday. Even in the absence of a rate cut, investors
hope the central bank will be able to provide more concrete
information about when a recovery will come, and which sectors will
turn around first.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks reversed direction several times during Monday's session,
continuing the meandering trend that has been in place for much of
January. A string of murky corporate forecasts has given investors
little sense of when business will improve, and therefore little
reason to buy.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase dropped after Global Crossing
filed for bankruptcy protection. Last month, Global Crossing secured
a waiver with a group of banks led by J.P. Morgan and Citibank for
$2.25 billion in loans.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup slid 31 cents to $49.31 and J.P. Morgan fell 68 cents to
$34.31, its lowest level since October. Global Crossing has lost more
than 99% of its value in the last year and is the fourth-biggest
bankruptcy in U.S. history. Enron, which filed for Chapter 11 on Dec.
2, ranks as the largest. Kmart, the second-largest discount retailer,
sought protection from creditors last Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   American Express stumbled 70 cents to $36.29 after reporting its
fourth-quarter net income tumbled 56% and that it remains cautious
about improvement in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Technology stocks were mixed. IBM fell $1.13 to $108.15, while
Cisco Systems advanced 57 cents to $19.70.</TE>
<TE>   In economic news, the Commerce Department reported new home sales
rose 5.7% in December. The gain was helped by the Federal Reserve's
11 interest rate cuts in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * The automobile sector got a boost after Morgan Stanley raised
its investment rating on the sector. It also increased individual
ratings on auto makers General Motors and Ford, saying the stocks are
cheap, given resilient car demand and lower inventories. Ford rose 45
cents to $15.06, while GM climbed $1.86 to $50.34.</TE>
<TE>   * Texas Instruments rose 95 cents to $28.40 in anticipation of
earnings due out after the market closed. Those results beat Wall
Street's expectations, and the stock rose as high as $30.05 in
after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   * Xerox climbed $1.34 to $11.24 after the office equipment maker
reported a surprise profit, before unusual items, for the 2001 fourth
quarter. Xerox said it was confident of a profit for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Veritas Software jumped $1.43 to $46.65 after an ABN-Amro analyst
said the company will benefit from increased sales for data backup
and recovery products.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Deal Objections Filed</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: Industry groups say proposed settlement doesn't
have enough restrictions to restore competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. would keep its Windows monopoly and the power to
bully customers and competitors under the Bush administration's
proposal to settle the government's 31/2-year-old antitrust case,
opponents said.</LD>
<LD>   Industry groups that supported breaking up the world's biggest
software company said its settlement with the Justice Department
doesn't contain enough restrictions to restore competition to the
market for personal computer operating software.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement "allows Microsoft to keep the fruits of its
statutory violation, and it leaves intact all of the incentives--and
many of the means--for Microsoft to maintain and extend its monopoly
in the future," economists Joseph E. Stiglitz and Jason Furman said
in papers filed by the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Assn.</LD>
<TE>   The association represents companies such as Oracle Corp. and AT&amp;T
Corp. Also filing objections was ProComp, an alliance of software
companies including Sun Microsystems Inc. and AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Nine states have joined the Justice Department in signing the
proposed settlement, which would give computer makers more freedom to
promote software that competes with Microsoft. California,
Massachusetts and seven other states that rejected the settlement are
asking a judge to force Microsoft to give up control of the Web
browsing software.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very tough settlement that puts significant
restrictions on Microsoft," company spokesman Jim Desler said. It is
"a fair way of resolving this case."</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has 30 days to respond to the objections.</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth J. Arrow, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who consulted
for the Justice Department in its 1995 antitrust settlement with
Microsoft, said he opposes the current plan because "seven years
later it is clear that little was accomplished in the prior consent
decree."</TE>
<TE>   The latest settlement "is far from sufficient to create effective
competition" from rival software, Arrow said in documents filed by
ProComp.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly must decide whether the
settlement is in the public interest. She has scheduled hearings on
the dissenting states' proposals, which would require Microsoft to
give computer makers the choice of installing a version of Windows
without Internet Explorer.</TE>
<TE>   ProComp's lawyers, Kenneth Starr and Robert Bork, two Republicans
who served as U.S. appeals court judges, urged the judge to wait
until she has heard the states' remedy proposals before deciding
whether to approve the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "No court has ever approved an antitrust settlement, where, as
here, there are remaining plaintiffs in the very same consolidated
case," ProComp said in its filing. "It is essential that the court
evaluate all available evidence bearing on the 'public interest' of
the department's proposed settlement."</TE>
<TE>   The case is the first under a federal law that sets the procedure
for judicial review of antitrust settlements reached after a company
was found to have broken the law. All other cases involved
settlements presented to judges before the government had proven
illegal conduct.</TE>

<HD>Anderson Partnership Buys Oxnard Financial Plaza</HD>
<DH>Ventura County complex of 13 buildings, which is 85%
occupied, is being acquired for about $58 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A real estate investment partnership headed by Los
Angeles businessman John E. Anderson and his wife, Marion, is acquiring
Oxnard Financial Plaza, home to the tallest office building between
the Bay Area and Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   An affiliate of the Andersons' Duesenberg Investment Co. real
estate group has agreed to purchase the 13-building complex featuring
the 21-story Morgan Stanley Tower and 14-story City National Bank
Tower. John Anderson said he expects escrow to close in mid-February.</LD>
<LD>   The Duesenberg group is buying the 580,000-square-foot development
along the Ventura Freeway for about $58 million--about $100 per
square foot. The price is said to be barely half of what it would
cost to develop the property today.</LD>
<TE>   The late Martin "Bud" Smith, one of Ventura County's most prolific
builders, developed the 27-acre complex during the 1970s and 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The Andersons are buying it from an affiliate of the
institutionally backed real estate opportunity fund--Tiger/Westbrook
Real Estate Partners--that bought the bulk of Smith's local real
estate portfolio in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Transwestern Commercial Services has been overseeing the real
estate on behalf of the Tiger/Westbrook affiliate, known as Channel
Islands Properties. Secured Capital Corp. brokered the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, who heads Century City-based Topa Equities Ltd.,
said the new owners will rename the property Topa Financial Plaza. The
Tower Club atop the Morgan Stanley building will become the Topa
Tower Club. Topa-affiliated insurance groups that do business in
Ventura County are expected to move into the complex, where about 85%
of the office space is occupied.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said he's comfortable outbidding the competition for
prime real estate even though the near-term economic outlook. "In the
long-run, that's actually the cheapest--and wisest--route'' to
assembling a productive property portfolio, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Duesenberg group has purchased office buildings in the nearby
Conejo Corridor over the last several months. "I'm very high on
Ventura County,'' said Anderson, who also owns a ranch there.</TE>
<TE>   The Andersons purchased Honolulu's AmFac Center (now Topa

<HD>J.C. Penney Forms Holding Company</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J.C. Penney Co. formed a holding company, adopting a structure that
analysts and investors say may help the operator of department stores
and Eckerd drugstores provide a clearer picture of the performance of
its units.</LD>
<LD>   The new structure, effective Sunday, won't result in any immediate
changes to operations, the firm said. The department store division
will be called J.C. Penney Corp., and its former shares have been
converted into stock for the holding company that will continue to
trade under the symbol JCP, the firm said.</LD>
<LD>   The structure may make it easier for J.C. Penney to execute
changes such as spinning off Eckerd, analysts said. Eckerd now is
combined with the department store business.</LD>
<TE>   A holding company may enable J.C. Penney to establish separate
financial reports, they said. J.C. Penney, which has lost money in
six of the last 10 quarters, said the holding company format will
provide more flexibility as it tries to rebuild. Shares of Plano,
Texas-based J.C. Penney rose 60 cents to close at $24.30 on the New
York Stock Exchange. They have fallen 9.7% this year.</TE>
<TE>   J.C. Penney shelved plans to issue a tracking stock for Eckerd in
August 2000 after the drugstore chain's earnings declined. A tracking
stock follows the performance of a subsidiary while representing a
stake in the entire corporation. Sales at the drugstore chain have
increased the last three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   The new structure comes amid heightened investor sensitivity to
accounting issues since Enron Corp. filed the largest U.S. bankruptcy
reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   J.C. Penney spokeswoman Stephanie Brown said Monday's announcement
isn't related to the company's statement Friday that reports of
accounting issues were "unfounded and without merit." The
StreetInsider.com Web site reported the same day that the Eckerd
drugstore division may have overcharged the government for Medicare
billing.</TE>

<HD>Prudential Fund Buys Irvine Office Building</HD>
<DH>Purchase, estimated at $70 million, is among the largest in
Orange County in recent months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An institutional real estate fund has acquired one of the John Wayne
Airport area's newest office towers for an estimated $70 million in
one of the largest Orange County commercial real estate sales in
recent months.</LD>
<LD>   The fund, managed by Prudential Real Estate Investors of
Parsippany, N.J., purchased the 12-story tower known as Opus Center
Irvine I. The 268,000-square-foot building at 2020 Main St. in Irvine
opened in late 1999 and is home to such corporate and professional
tenants as Sun Microsystems, New York Life, PricewaterhouseCoopers,
Harvey &amp; Co. and Miller Brewing.</LD>
<LD>   The real estate investment advisory arm of Prudential Financial
bought the property from developer Opus West Corp. and its minority
partner, an affiliate of SPI Holdings. Opus West is the regional
affiliate of commercial property developer Opus Corp., headquartered
in Minnetonka, Minn.</LD>
<TE>   Opus frequently sells its developments to institutional investors
after the buildings are filled with tenants and generate stable
rental revenue. Opus West built and leased 2020 Main amid strong
demand for space in the airport vicinity, Orange County's biggest and
priciest office market.</TE>
<TE>   Its income stream attracted Prudential's commingled real estate
fund despite today's softer economy, a Prudential spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Prudential wouldn't disclose what the fund paid for the property,
but Orange County real estate sources estimated the price at about
$70 million based on other recent sales. Chris Hoffman, Tony Malk and
Steve McKenzie of investment specialist Eastdil Realty brokered the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   With the 2020 tower 95% leased, Opus last year started
construction on a "sister" 14-story, 321,000-square-foot high-rise at
2040 Main St. scheduled to open this year. Law firm Knobbe Martens
Olson &amp; Bear pre-leased six floors in a 10-year deal reportedly
valued at more than $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   Opus has plans for a third tower as well, but the airport market
probably won't see much office construction soon. The airport area's
tenant base has been contracting for the last few calendar quarters.
Brokerage Grubb &amp; Ellis reported that occupancy of the 28.8 million
square feet of office buildings in the area shrank by more than
700,000 square feet--or nearly 2.5%--in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The predictable result is slight downward pressure on rental
rates, which have fallen about 5% since early last year. Still, the
airport market's vacancy rate of 13.5% isn't considered
alarming--especially compared with more than 30% in southern Orange
County, where the technology crash has left a lot of empty office
space.</TE>

<HD>Shopping Centers  a Revolving Door</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Turnover among retail tenants has grown amid
chain store mergers, cost-cutting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp.'s plans to jettison hundreds of stores as part of its
recent bankruptcy filing and Toys R Us Inc.'s decision to close
several outlets reflect the ever increasing pace of change that has
turned many shopping centers into revolving doors for retailers.</LD>
<LD>   The turnover among tenants in shopping centers in Southern
California and across the nation has grown over the years in the
turmoil of intense competition and financial pressures, chain store
mergers and an expanding supply of new retail space, according to
retail and real estate industry observers.</LD>
<LD>   The trend is expected to speed up even more in the year ahead as
the recession forces more retailers to cut expansion plans and
shutter stores. On Monday, for example, Toys R Us announced it would
close more than 60 poorly performing outlets.</LD>
<TE>   "We've have had more failures and more turnover," said Brent F.
Howell, a veteran retail real estate specialist at brokerage firm CB
Richard Ellis. "These tenants tend not to stay the long term like
they used to."</TE>
<TE>   Large pieces of retail real estate are always being recycled, and
many a Southern California shopping center is haunted by the ghosts
of retailers past, including Broadway, HomeBase and  Montgomery Ward.
Landlords were left in the lurch when the bank industry consolidated
and shuttered thousands of branches, supermarkets opted for larger
stores and drug chains built new outlets with drive-thrus.</TE>
<TE>   Turnover "is an inherent risk in the retail business, and one that
gives developers pause," said Cliff Goldstein, a partner in J.H.
Snyder Co., a Los Angeles-based development firm.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate and retail observers are hard pressed to quantify the
change in the pace of retail turnover. But there is a consensus that
many chain stores are much quicker to pull the plug on locations that
fail to meet financial targets or no longer fit into a new store
format.</TE>
<TE>   "In this world of firms being more scrutinized [by Wall Street
investors], retailers are more proactive about closing stores than
they were 20 years ago," said Steve Sakwa, a real estate industry
analyst for Merrill Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   Turnover has become high enough to support a mini-industry focused
on helping retailers dispose of their unwanted stores. Excess Space
Disposition Inc. for example, has seen its listings of surplus store
space grow 25% in recent years to about 20 million square feet in
1,500 locations nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a big business these days as large chains merge,
restructure and enter and leave markets," said Rob York, a retail
consultant at Fransen Co. "You don't want to stick with a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Store closings are usually associated with struggling
retailers--such as Kmart, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection last week, and defunct Montgomery Ward. But in an era of
constant cost-cutting and intense competition, even the healthiest of
chains are not hesitant about closing poorly performing or outdated
stores. For example, ever-expanding discount retailer Wal-Mart Stores
has about 400 stores for sale or lease.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these are properties that we outgrew and had to relocate
to a bigger store," said Peter Kanelos, a community affairs
representative for Wal-Mart, which operates about 3,500 stores.</TE>
<TE>   The aggressive expansion of big-box retailers and so-called
category killers--such as Home Depot, Staples and Best
Buy--eventually results in surplus space after they flood a market
with new outlets, said Howard Makler, chairman of Excess Space
Disposition. Not only do smaller retailers usually get crushed as
rival chains battle for domination, but eventually one or more of the
big-box retailers drop out of the market as well. That leaves
landlords struggling to find ways to fill hangar-like stores.</TE>
<TE>   The dwindling number of major chains means that landlords "don't
have many replacement tenants waiting the wings," Makler said.</TE>
<TE>   Owners of shopping centers in densely populated sections of
Southern California have a better chance at recycling empty space
than owners of property in outlying areas, say real estate brokers.
With relatively few large building sites left in urbanized areas,
retailers eager to expand often act quickly to take advantage of
precious real estate left behind by failed rivals. Target Corp., for
example, purchased nine former Montgomery Ward stores in Southern
California last year after the retail giant folded.</TE>
<TE>   "These things have a second life and a third and a fourth life,"
said real estate consultant Larry Kosmont of retail property. "You
don't see them getting knocked down."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, most of the stores that might be vacated by Kmart,
which has about 90 locations in Southern California, are expected to
be acquired by another retailer, according to real estate and retail
specialists.</TE>
<TE>   In cases of poorly located store sites, property owners might have
to turn to other uses--such as housing, schools or medical
facilities--to fill the void. Kmart has said in court documents that
it plans to break the leases on about 10 properties in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even under the best circumstances, landlords stuck with an
empty Kmart would have to wait about a year before another chain
retailer could reopen in the same spot. That could result in a major
loss of rental income and put tenants in the same shopping center
under financial pressure, leading to more vacancies.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of such potential disasters, many retail developers are
careful about selecting properties, tenants and leasing deals that
can insulate themselves from retail defections. Some firms avoid
building structures tailored to meet the specific needs of a single
big-box retailer. Others build only in proven urban locations where
space can be filled relatively quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein of J.H. Snyder said his firm once turned down an
opportunity to build a shopping center adjacent to a Wal-Mart in
Lakewood after each potential tenant wanted the right to break its
lease if the giant discounter ever closed its doors. "It was not a
risk we were willing to take," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In designing his shopping centers, Los Angeles retail developer
Rick Caruso makes sure most of the store spaces are fairly generic in
size and shape and flexible enough to accommodate new store formats
and retailers.</TE>
<TE>   "Retailers change the way they retail over time, and you have to
be able to accommodate them or you lose them," Caruso said.</TE>

<HD>Westfield to Gain Stakes in 3 Malls</HD>
<DH>The firm will acquire MainPlace in Santa Ana plus interests
in Century City Shopping Center and Valencia Town Center in Santa
Clarita in Rodamco buyout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB HOWARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Westfield America Inc., one of the largest owners of regional
shopping malls in Southern California, will acquire interests in
three more Southland malls as part of its $2.2-billion buyout of
Rodamco North America by Westfield and two other mall operators.</LD>
<LD>   Brentwood-based Westfield, which owns 16 shopping centers in
Southern California, will acquire a half-interest in Century City
Shopping Center, 25% of Valencia Town Center in Santa Clarita and
full ownership of MainPlace Mall in Santa Ana, for a total of 2.6
million square feet.</LD>
<LD>   The three Southern California properties are among five Rodamco
malls in California and 14 throughout the United States in which
Westfield will acquire an interest, said Peter S. Lowy, chief
executive of Westfield America Inc., which is the U.S. arm of
Australia's Westfield America Trust.</LD>
<TE>   Lowy said Westfield will acquire interests in 15.8 million square
feet of Rodamco malls in the deal, in which Westfield, Simon Property
Group Inc. and Rouse Co. are acquiring the U.S. holdings of
Netherlands-based Rodamco.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to paying Rodamco $2.2 billion, the buyers will assume
$3.1 billion of Rodamco debt.</TE>
<TE>   With the addition of the Rodamco assets, Lowy said, Westfield will
become the largest owner of regional malls in California and the
second-largest in the United States, after Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Westfield's Southern California holdings comprise seven shopping
centers in Los Angeles County, eight in San Diego County and one in
Palm Desert.</TE>
<TE>   The company typically adds the Westfield Shoppingtown name to
malls it buys, but Lowry said the company hasn't decided whether that
will be the case with the properties in which it is only part owner.</TE>
<TE>   "We do brand all of our properties over time," he said, "but where
we have joint-venture partners we will need to talk to them about
bringing the centers into the brand."</TE>
<TE>   Westfield has embarked on extensive remodeling and renovation
projects at many of the centers it has acquired, including the
Promenade in Woodland Hills, but Lowy sees no immediate need for
refurbishing any of the Southern California properties the company is
acquiring from Rodamco.</TE>

<LD>Retail gasoline prices fell 0.4 cent to an average $1.101 a gallon in
the week ended Monday, the Energy Department said in its latest
survey of 900 filling stations.</LD>
<LD>   Pump prices were down 36% from a record $1.713 a gallon in May.
Driving habits and gasoline demand have changed little as the U.S.
economy slowed, even as the recession helped drag down crude oil and
fuel prices, analysts said. U.S. motorists are paying 35.9 cents a
gallon less than they were a year ago. Prices dropped to a 21/2-year
low of $1.059 a gallon Dec. 17.</LD>
<LD>   The highest U.S. service station prices are on the West Coast,
where a gallon of regular gasoline rose 1.2 cents to an average of
$1.21 a gallon.</LD>

<LD>A new computer virus that poses as a link to digital photos on the
Internet probably will be contained within a few days, a computer
security expert said.</LD>
<LD>   The virus, dubbed "MyParty .Worm," first appeared Saturday, said
Vincent Weafer, a researcher with computer software maker Symantec
Corp. The virus comes in an e-mail containing what looks like a link
to photos from a recent party on a Yahoo Inc. Web site. Clicking on
the link downloads the virus, which then mails itself to everyone
listed in the computer's address book.</LD>

<LD>Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose in the latest
auction.</LD>
<LD>   The Treasury Department sold $15 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.715%, up from 1.670% last week. An additional $14
billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 1.830%, up from
1.735%.</LD>
<LD>   Both the three-month and six-month rates were the highest since
Dec. 26 when the bills sold for 1.720% and 1.850%, respectively.</LD>
<TE>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.748% for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,956.60 and 1.872% for a six-month bill selling for $9,907.50.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said that the average
yield for one-year constant maturity Treasury bills, the most popular

<DL></DL>
<LD>Viacom Inc. has given officials at its CBS television unit
responsibility for certain functions of its smaller UPN network,
according to an internal memo from CBS-TV Chief Executive Leslie
Moonves.</LD>
<LD>   The scheduling, sales, affiliate relations, media relations,
marketing and promotion, research, finance, operations and
engineering, and law and human resources departments at UPN will
report to their counterparts at CBS, Moonves wrote in a memo to UPN
employees.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes after New York-based Viacom folded the money-losing
UPN network into the larger, profitable CBS-TV business this month to
reduce costs and boost advertising revenue. Moonves has said he
intends to maintain UPN as a separately run network with its own
programming executives. Last week, Dawn Tarnofsky-Ostroff was
appointed president of entertainment at UPN.</LD>
<TE>   Adam Ware, UPN chief operating officer, will continue in that
position, Moonves said in the memo. Ware will report to Moonves and
will work closely with Tarnofsky-Ostroff.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom's Class B shares rose 20 cents to close at $39.65 on the
NYSE. They have dropped 26% in the last year.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd. paid a total of $20 million to one of its
outside directors and a charity he controls in exchange for his help
in arranging the $10-billion purchase of commercial lender CIT Group
Inc. last year.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco, which plans to split into four separate companies, paid
Frank E. Walsh Jr. $10 million and contributed $10 million to the
Community Foundation of New Jersey, a charity of which Walsh is
trustee, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which is based in Bermuda and operates out of Exeter,
N.H., said it paid Walsh the fee because he was "instrumental in
bringing about the acquisition" of CIT Group, according to the
filing. Before the acquisition, Walsh owned 50,000 shares of CIT
Group, which is now called Tyco Capital Corp.</LD>
<TE>   The payment was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco shares fell $3 to $42 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc.'s WB, the No. 6-rated U.S. television network,
will add two hours of programming to its weekly schedule in a bid to
draw more viewers to its youth-oriented TV shows and boost profit.</LD>
<LD>   Most WB-affiliated TV stations will air the extra two hours on
Sundays from 5 to 7 p.m., leading into WB's prime-time lineup, a
spokesman said. The stations also have an option to run the
additional programming on Saturday, the only night WB doesn't air
shows.</LD>
<LD>   The 7-year-old network will use the additional time to show
repeats of some of its existing programs, especially newer ones that
are seeking a bigger audience. WB wants to attract new viewers, lift
its overall ratings and generate increased advertising revenue.</LD>
<TE>   The two additional hours will start in September, the spokesman
said. They bring WB's weekly programming hours to 15, the same as
News Corp.'s Fox, the No. 4-rated U.S. TV network.</TE>
<TE>   AOL shares rose 42 cents to close at $27.90 on the NYSE. The stock
has fallen 49% in the last year.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The attorney for a Russian company accused of violating a
controversial U.S. copyright law filed motions  Monday to have the
case dismissed, arguing that the law is vague, too broad and
shouldn't apply to a foreign company.</LD>
<LD>   ElcomSoft Co. faces charges of violating the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act by selling and conspiring to sell a program that lets
people using Adobe Systems Inc.'s eBook Reader to copy and print
digital books, transfer them to other computers and have them read
aloud by the computer.</LD>
<LD>   The Moscow software firm faces $2.25 million in fines if convicted
of breaking the law, enacted in 2000 to bar the creation or
distribution of technology that can be used to circumvent copyright
protections.</LD>
<TE>   But defense attorney Joseph Burton of law firm Duane Morris in San
Francisco said ElcomSoft makes software that allows people with
lawful rights to copyrighted material to use the material in
reasonable ways for personal use.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have lawful access to the copyrighted material you can
circumvent controls in order to exercise a 'fair use' right," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a fair use of an electronic book would be to copy it
from a desktop to a laptop for traveling, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is the statute is unclear," he said. "Someone that
wants to make a tool to allow 'fair use' cannot tell how to do that
without violating the statute."</TE>
<TE>   Movie studios and software companies have relied on the copyright
act to help them restrict the way people use computer programs and
view digital movies. They have argued, successfully so far, that
because electronic material can be so easily distributed it needs as
much or more protection than printed material.</TE>
<TE>   Free speech advocates, including computer scientists and software
developers, argue that the copyright act gives copyright owners and
software vendors carte blanche control over use of digital material
at the expense of free speech and "fair use" rights that people enjoy
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   In his motions, Burton argued that the copyright act, in addition
to being too broad and vague, also infringes on 1st Amendment free
speech rights under the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   A hearing is scheduled April 1 in  U.S. District Court in San
Jose.</TE>

<HD>5 SAG Members Seek  to Block New Election</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five members of the Screen Actors Guild petitioned the U.S.
Department of Labor on Monday to stop the union from scrapping its
November election results because of voting snafus.</LD>
<LD>   The filing comes  amid mounting criticism over the decision this
month by a five-member SAG panel, which ruled that the election of
SAG President Melissa Gilbert and two other nationally elected
officers be scrapped because New York members had two additional days
to vote and because ballots in New York lacked a signature line.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of Gilbert, who is part of the union's moderate wing,
argue that the new election is a coup attempt  by supporters of
defeated presidential candidate Valerie Harper.</LD>
<TE>   They argue that the voting infractions are moderate, and that New
York members have for years had an extra two days to cast ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Harper and her supporters say a new election is needed to preserve
SAG's integrity.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department filing was made by SAG members Mike Farrell,
Paul Petersen, Lisa Lewis, Jane Beard and John J. Fleming. In their
petition, they argue that the SAG panel lacked authority to overturn
the election and accused it of bias because members were supporters
of Harper.</TE>
<TE>   A SAG spokesman said the union had not seen the petition and
refused to comment on it.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting Monday, SAG directors commended the five-member
committee and said they will appoint a  six-member panel to oversee
the new election.</TE>

<HD>Scam Suspect Reportedly Cites Lax Supervision</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Cleveland stockbroker suspected of stealing as much as $100 million
from clients reportedly told authorities before he disappeared that
lax supervision made it possible for him to misappropriate money over
a 15-year period.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Gruttadauria, 45, disappeared Jan. 11. The FBI said Monday
that the agency had not found him.</LD>
<LD>   "I can hardly believe that I could have done this without
detection for so long," Gruttadauria said in a letter to authorities,
according to the Plain Dealer, which said it obtained a copy of the
letter.</LD>
<TE>   "The various firms' greed and lack of attention at the senior
level contributed greatly to that," he wrote. "Be that as it may, I
am unwilling to continue and I'm ashamed and sorry for what I have
done."</TE>
<TE>   Gruttadauria had worked in Cleveland at Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.
since October 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The government is investigating reports that about 25 of
Gruttadauria's clients may have lost at least $100 million and had
their account values falsely inflated by as much as $250 million.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and Justice Department issued an arrest warrant for
Gruttadauria on Friday, charging him with making false statements to
a financial institution. Wall Street regulators also are
investigating.</TE>
<TE>   Gruttadauria said in the letter that he acted alone and didn't
take the money for personal use.</TE>
<TE>   FBI spokeswoman Laurie Fournier said Monday that she could not
confirm the authenticity of the letter or comment on its contents.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman Bros. pledged its cooperation in the investigation, but
said it couldn't comment on whether investors who lost money might be
able to recover it.</TE>

<HD>Xerox Tops Forecast as Net Loss Narrows</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>STAMFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Xerox Corp. reported Monday a fourth-quarter net loss of $4 million,
citing weak economic conditions that contributed to a 13% decline in
revenue.</LD>
<LD>   The Stamford-based printer and copier company's per-share loss
amounted to 1 cent,  narrower than the year-earlier loss of $20
million, or 4 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding one-time items, earnings were $108 million, or 15 cents
a share. That exceeded the consensus estimate of a loss of 1 cent a
share from analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Xerox shares were up $1.34, or 14%, to close at $11.24 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox, which has posted losses for more than a year, hailed the
operating profit as evidence of its successful turnaround effort.
That initiative, announced more than a year ago, includes the
reduction of thousands of jobs and the sale of billions of dollars in
assets. Xerox's year-end employment was 78,900, down 13,600 from the
end of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's results are all about execution--the precise execution of
a turnaround strategy that has significantly strengthened Xerox's
core operations while effectively positioning the company to exploit
future market opportunities in its production, office and services
business," said Xerox Chief Executive Anne M. Mulcahy.</TE>
<TE>   Mulcahy said in October after the third-quarter results that she
was "cautiously optimistic" about returning to operating
profitability in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-quarter revenue was $4.26 billion, down from $4.88 billion.
Sales declined 26% in developing markets, Xerox said.</TE>
<TE>   In other technology earnings Monday:</TE>
<TE>   * Nextel Partners Inc., which sells wireless-telephone service in
smaller U.S. markets under the Nextel brand, posted a wider loss as
costs rose 77%.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-quarter loss widened to $78.2 million, or 33 cents a
share, from $75.3 million, or 32 cents, a year earlier. Per-share
results include preferred dividends. Sales more than doubled, rising
to $120.8million from $53.4 million, as the Kirkland, Wash.-based
company added 81,700 customers.</TE>
<TE>   Costs rose as the company began operations in more U.S. markets.
Growth in the wireless industry is slowing, as almost 50% of
Americans carry cell phones. Shares of Nextel Partners rose 4 cents
to $6.97 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   * Texas Instruments Inc., the No.1 maker of chips for mobile
phones, Monday posted a fourth-quarter loss as world demand remained
weak for cell phones and other communications equipment powered by TI
semiconductors.</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas-based manufacturer posted a pro forma loss of $105
million, or 6 cents a share, contrasted with a profit of $549
million, or 31 cents, a year earlier. The company said it expected
first-quarter results to return to "about break-even" and revenue to
be "about level with the fourth quarter."</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-quarter consensus  forecast was a loss of 9 cents a
share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Revenue fell 41% to
$1.79 billion. Pro forma numbers are adjusted to reflect a number of
one-time charges and gains, TI said.</TE>
<TE>   TI was up 95 cents at $28.40 on the NYSE.</TE>

<PH>TELECOM'S LATEST TUMBLE</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Failures in Sector Expected to Ease</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After a year in which record numbers of companies went bust trying to
wire the world for the Information Age, Global Crossing Ltd.'s
bankruptcy filing Monday may signal the end of big telecommunications
failures, analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   "This is probably the last big bankruptcy for a while, but I think
the fundamental problem for the telecom sector is, 'Where do you get
growth and revenues from?'" said Blair Levin, a former chief of staff
at the Federal Communications Commission and now a telecom analyst at
the Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. investment firm.</LD>
<LD>   The Global Crossing bankruptcy filing is the latest example of how
quickly the carnage has piled up in one of the nation's largest and
most important economic sectors.</LD>
<TE>   During the boom days of the dot-com era two years ago, Global
Crossing was among the strongest of the upstarts, taking on the
established telecom carriers that were perceived as being too slow to
respond to the new economy's demands for more bandwidth to carry
e-mail, Web pages and other data.</TE>
<TE>   But after the collapse of so many dot-com companies, a succession
of big telecom names were caught in a vise: Demand for
telecommunications services was slowing, while many of the new
service providers were saddled with huge debt loads from their rapid
expansion. The result has been a flurry of bankruptcy filings.</TE>
<TE>   Among those forced into Bankruptcy Court were 360networks Inc., a
Canadian telecommunications company run by former Microsoft Chief
Financial Officer Greg Maffei. It listed $5.6 billion in assets when
it filed for court protection in June. The company now ranks as the
second-largest telecom bankruptcy, after Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   360networks had been preceded in April by New York-based Winstar
Communications Inc., which collapsed with billions of dollars in debt
amassed trying to connect businesses to the Internet via antennas on
rooftops.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, PSINet Inc. a Herndon, Va., company, wound up in
Bankruptcy Court in March, despite being among the first to offer
Internet access to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Global Crossing, the companies had pinned their hopes
on consumers and businesses generating insatiable demand for
bandwidth because of growing use of e-mail and other data and voice
services, ranging from video conferencing to cellular phones.</TE>
<TE>   But consumers and businesses are still using only a fraction of
the new electronic capacity for transmitting data around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, prospects for the remaining companies serving the
troubled market may finally be looking up, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   One analyst said Global Crossing fared better than most other
recent telecom casualties, noting that the company has attracted a
$750-million cash offer from two firms to help it maintain operations
while it reorganizes.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing "got [offered] 7 or 8 cents on the dollar, which
is more than Winstar or Teligent [another troubled wireless firm] got
when they filed for bankruptcy" last year, said Herschel Shosteck,
who heads his own Wheaton, Md.-based telecommunications consulting
firm. "That seems to suggest that things may have bottomed out," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Others note that several telecommunications firms that went
bankrupt in recent years have reemerged, albeit in a dramatically
scaled down fashion. For instance, IDT Corp., a New Jersey-based
telecom company, bought Winstar for about $40 million after winning
approval from a bankruptcy judge.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the communications satellite company Iridium, which
filed for bankruptcy in August 1999, emerged from the proceedings
after a well-financed private investment group bought the company for
$25 million. The new owners say they expect Iridium to become
profitable this year.</TE>
<TE>   But no such quick turnaround is expected for the
telecommunications industry as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   Telecommunications equipment makers such as Lucent Technologies,
Cisco Systems and JDS Uniphase are unable to get many customers to
upgrade to new equipment because there remains a glut of used
equipment on the market.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, long-distance telephone providers such as AT&amp;T Corp.
and WorldCom Inc. are struggling because big corporate customers
increasingly are routing long-distance calls over cheaper leased
lines provided by satellite operators or companies such as Global
Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   The cellular phone industry, which has pushed wireless phone rates
to as little as 7 cents a minute, is also a keeping price pressure on
phone carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Washington-based research firm TeleGeography Inc. said a telecom
capacity glut will persist for some time. The current inventory of
used capacity is "frighteningly small," the research firm said. Even
if demand doubled for telecommunications pipelines crossing the
Atlantic, TeleGeography estimates, it would fill less than a sixth of
existing capacity.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say they are heartened that the excess capacity is
slowly being wrung out of the market as the number of players and
their scope are reduced by bankruptcies.</TE>
<TE>   Telecommunications capacity "got overbuilt during the last decade
but ... demand will eventually catch up," said David Cooperstein, an
analyst at the Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester Research.</TE>

<HD>Toys R Us to Cut Jobs, Close 64 U.S. Stores</HD>
<DH>Retail: The move is part of an attempt to reclaim customers
amid increasing competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Toys R Us Inc. said Monday that it is cutting 1,900 jobs and closing
64 domestic stores in a move to speed up modernization of its aging
stores and recoup customers lost to smaller rivals and giant
merchants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The move is part of a broader effort by the nation's
second-largest toy seller to reverse a market-share decline by making
its stores more compelling and its merchandise mix unique.</LD>
<LD>   Although investors reacted positively to the plan, driving the
stock up 6%, analysts say more needs to be done and the slow pace of
change has resulted in further customer defections.</LD>
<TE>   "The good news is that these guys have taken a look at their
portfolio and are cleaning house," said Melissa Williams, a toy
industry analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. "This is
not the last thing they'll do in terms of merchandising and customer
service, which will continue to evolve. In terms of infrastructure
and real estate, this is probably the last part of the U.S. toy store
overhaul."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the plan, the company will shutter 27 older-style Toys
R Us stores and 37 of its troubled Kids R Us stores. Kids R Us,
offering children's clothing in a large-store format, has suffered
against more value-conscious discounters such as Wal-Mart, and many
investors and analysts two years ago said the chain should be
liquidated.</TE>
<TE>   Toys R Us operates 1,609 stores worldwide, including 703
domestically. It was not clear whether any of the company's roughly
130 California stores would be closed. The Paramus, N.J.-based
company also will consolidate much of its administrative and
financial functions, moving operations that had been in five
facilities under one roof.</TE>
<TE>   In a Monday morning conference call with analysts, Chairman and
Chief Executive John Eyler said 10 of the Toys R Us stores could be
relocated. He added that some shuttered Kids R Us stores would find
new homes in revamped combination stores that add Kids R Us apparel
to Toys R Us stores.</TE>
<TE>   Eyler said a test group of nine revamped Kids R Us stores
delivered double-digit sales growth compared with the year before.
Combination Toys R Us and Kids R Us stores, he said, were performing
well and eliciting positive customer response.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement by the 2-year-old management team, led by former
FAO Schwarz chief Eyler, follows a series of steps aimed at
refurbishing the stores--and the image--of a onetime retail giant,
which three years ago lost its top toy-seller title to Wal-Mart.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after his arrival, Eyler revamped the modernization effort
begun by predecessor Robert C. Nakasone, rolling out what he called
the "Mission Possible" store format. The new stores include a
boutique section of higher-priced educational toys, an enlarged
stuffed-toy section called Animal Alley and a more navigable floor
plan, marked by a racetrack-type floor design and an end to legendary
sky-high warehouse shelving.</TE>
<TE>   The cornerstone of the remodel effort came last fall, when the
company opened its Times Square flagship store. Unfortunately, that
opening came just before the Sept. 11 attacks, which severely reduced
tourist visits.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's announced closures, analysts said, is an acknowledgement
that not all of the company's existing stores are worthy of the
significant funds necessary to bring them up to the level of the
newer and refurbished stores.</TE>
<TE>   "The company is pruning under-performing stores that do not meet
return-on-capital requirements, which should help boost overall store
productivity levels," said William Julian, an analyst with Salomon
Smith Barney, in a note to clients. "However, this move shows that
the business is still struggling and the improved performance of
renovated stores isn't strong enough to carry the company through the
recession."</TE>
<TE>   Toys R Us said this month that a 4% overall gain in holiday sales
would enable it to meet Wall Street's earnings estimates for the year
of 93 cents a share, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call. Those estimates had been revised downward after
the company's warning in October that profit probably would come in
at the lower end of expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a logical step in the turnaround," said William Nygren,
portfolio manager for two Oakmark funds that together held about 11
million Toys R Us shares, according to the funds' most recent
reports. Eyler "inherited a franchise that needed a lot of work, and
he had indicated back then it would be a five-year project to put the
company in the position it needed to be in."</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the changes, the company expects to realize a
$25-million gain in pretax earnings in 2002 and $45 million in 2003,
of which payroll savings alone will account for $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   The latest move is expected to result in a charge for the quarter
ending Friday of $126 million after taxes. Shares in Toys R Us rose
$1.15 to close at $19.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Online Travel Shares Rise on Profit Reports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of online travel sites rose sharply Monday after the sites
reported better-than-expected financial results and booking activity
despite reports of significant contraction in other areas of the
travel business.</LD>
<LD>   The year-end earnings reports by Dallas-based Hotel Reservations
Network Inc. and Expedia Inc. of Seattle showed that consumer demand
for travel remained stronger than expected amid the recession and in
the wake of the terrorist attacks. The weakened economy may have
driven more consumers to use the Internet to search for travel
bargains, industry analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Hotel Reservations Network, which is being acquired by USA
Networks Inc., saw its shares rise $7.99 to $52.25 on Nasdaq. The
firm reported that fourth-quarter net income fell to $4.81 million,
or 6.8%, compared with the year-ago period. The drop was smaller than
expected, and the firm also raised its sales and profit forecast for
this year.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Expedia, which reported its first quarterly profit, rose
nearly 10% on Monday, to $50.76 on Nasdaq. The stock continued to
rise in after-hours trading after the release of earnings to $52.93 a
share.</TE>
<TE>   Expedia posted a profit, excluding merger expenses, of $19 million
for its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31. The firm had posted a
quarterly loss of $2.6 million in the year-ago period.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of another prominent Internet travel company,
Travelocity.com Inc., also rose Monday, up $3.86 to $26.60 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Although the online business has fared better than expected, the
hotel business suffered substantially last year, according to lodging
reports released Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel industry room revenue in 2001 dropped nearly 7% or nearly
twice as high as previous forecasts, according to Smith Travel
Research. And hotel development in California dropped sharply last
year, as 77 proposed hotel projects with a total of 13,000 rooms were
deferred or abandoned, according to the Atlas Hospitality Group.</TE>

<HD>Financier's Bid Is Just a Day's Work</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Li Ka-shing succeeds in his brazen bid to take over faltering
telecom giant Global Crossing Ltd., it would be just another day's
work for the Hong Kong billionaire dubbed Superman for his highflying
financial moves.</LD>
<LD>   From a small plastics factory, Li has amassed a global empire that
includes ownership of Hong Kong's leading telecom companies, real
estate firms and supermarkets, the world's largest private port
operation, large stakes in Vodafone/Air Touch and Priceline.com and a
controlling interest in Canada's Husky Oil.</LD>
<LD>   The eldest son of a school principal, Li, 73, is the richest man
in Asia with a net worth of $12.6 billion. He dines with China's top
leaders and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth. His family's holdings
represent 15% of the capitalization of the entire Hong Kong stock
market.</LD>
<TE>   In his latest deal, Li's Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. teamed up with
another Asian powerhouse, Singapore Technologies Group, in a
$750-million bid to buy the assets of Global Crossing, which filed
for bankruptcy protection Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, must be approved
by a bankruptcy judge. Opposition is expected to be fierce because it
probably will leave little for Global Crossing's creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Li's interest has been rumored for months. Asia is one of the
world's hottest markets for mobile phone and broadband development,
and Global Crossing's most-prized assets are its transoceanic cables
that link Asia and Latin America with the U.S. and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Li is an "astute investor" who is accumulating the pieces to cash
in on the broadband revolution as it circles the globe, said Michael
Ingraham, director of research for U.S. Global Investors and head of
the firm's China Region Opportunity Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "Global Crossing did great things for the world's connectivity by
laying fiber optics almost everywhere you can think of and now you're
watching them suffer for that," said Ingraham, whose fund has
investments in Hutchison Whampoa and in Global Crossing's Asian unit.
"But we're also seeing other companies who have better fiscal
policies come in and see the benefits."</TE>
<TE>   Li got his start in the decidedly low-tech field of plastics
production, but he has become one of Asia's leading proponents of a
wired world. Although others have lost their shirts in the telecom
collapse, Li has made several lucrative deals, including the sale of
Orange, a British mobile phone company, to Mannesmann for $14.6
billion in 1999, followed by the sale of his stake in Voice- Stream
Wireless Corp. to Deutsche Telekom for close to $4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Those deals gave Li a war chest to invest in licenses in Europe
and Asia for the next generation of mobile phones--known as third
generation, or 3G. In 2000, Hutchison paid $6.9 billion for a 3G
license in Britain and has plans to roll out service later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The company is seeking financing to set up 3G networks in Austria,
Italy and Sweden and has been asked by the Israeli government to take
a stake in that country's state-owned carrier, Bezeq. The Hong Kong
firm also controls 20% of the mobile market in India.</TE>
<TE>   Both Hutchison and Singapore Technologies are familiar with Global
Crossing's woes, having been investors in separate pieces of Asia
Global Crossing, the Asian subsidiary of the struggling telecom
giant.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchison is a partner in Hutchison Global Crossing, a Hong
Kong-based telecommunications provider. Singapore Technologies
Telemedia is partners with Asia Global Crossing in StarHub Crossing,
which operates a cable pipeline connecting Singapore. Asia Global
Crossing was not included in the bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   By joining forces, the Asian companies are solidifying a
technology network that is based in Asia and encircles the globe. In
addition to fixed and mobile telecom networks, they also are heavily
involved in Internet and satellite television in Asia. After spending
$110 million to increase its stake in Priceline.com, Hutchison
announced plans to launch an Asian version soon.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Li family and STT are moving aggressively into China, the
world's fastest-growing mobile telephone and personal computer
markets. As Hong Kong's largest mobile operator, Hutchison is
positioning Tom.com, its Internet portal, to be a major player as the
wireless Internet takes hold in China. STT has 52,000 mobile- phone
subscribers in Szechuan Province and a joint-venture paging network
with China Unicom.</TE>
<TE>   Not all has gone smoothly. When Li's real estate company, Cheung
Kong Holdings, purchased last fall a coveted piece of Hong Kong
waterfront from the government at a below-market price, it reignited
fierce criticism of the Li family's influence. Li's youngest son,
Richard, the founder of highflying Pacific Century CyberWorks, was
sidelined by the collapse of the Internet bubble and has pulled back
plans to spend $1.5 billion to create a pan-Asian interactive video
service, Network of the World.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Rescue Attempt Will Test Winnick's Acumen</HD>
<DH>Executive: His reputation and investors' faith are on line
after bankruptcy filing by the formerly highflying company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER and KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a city of excessive riches, Gary Winnick once ruled as king.</LD>
<LD>   The former furniture salesman from New York became the wealthiest
man in Los Angeles, paying $94 million for a Beverly Hills mansion,
collecting private jets and schmoozing with the British royal family.
He reached that pinnacle by doing what many believed was impossible:
raising $20 billion to build an audacious undersea phone network
despite having virtually no experience in the telecommunications
industry.</LD>
<LD>   Now that network and the riches that came along with it are in
doubt as Winnick's company, Global Crossing Ltd., on Monday became
the largest telecom firm in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy. The
company has its corporate offices in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<TE>   The burly 54-year-old couldn't stave off financial collapse in the
face of a glutted market and a worldwide collapse of the high-tech
economy, which swept away demand for such services and left the
company buried under a mountain of debt.</TE>
<TE>   Now Winnick, whose business prowess is both admired and feared, is
facing the most formidable sales job of his storied career:
rehabilitating his reputation and salvaging investor faith in Global
Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick has faced adversity in business before. At the helm of a
private investment firm, he was unable to prevent the twin
bankruptcies of a furniture retailer and a mattress company he had
purchased in the late 1980s. Before that, he was caught up in the
controversy surrounding Michael Milken and his notorious bond-trading
firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, where Winnick worked for 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick's gruff style and penchant for firing chief executives cut
an intimidating figure in the business community. But those who have
followed his career aren't ready to count him out.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to land somewhere, he's going to make money again, and
we all want a piece of it," said one Los Angeles-based investment
banker, who declined to let his name be used for fear of being left
out.</TE>
<TE>   For his own part, Winnick is unwilling to concede any defeat in
the face of Global Crossing's mammoth bankruptcy. In the course of
constructing a worldwide network connecting 27 countries on four
continents, Global racked up $12.4 billion in debt. But Winnick plans
to keep the company operating under a proposed reorganization plan
that includes an infusion of cash from Asian investors.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it takes the markets time to catch up to visionary
ideas, and [Winnick] is confident that the markets will eventually
recognize the value of the business," said Winnick's spokesman,
Michael Sitrick.</TE>
<TE>   On a personal level, Global Crossing's bankruptcy won't leave the
company's founder and co-chairman empty-handed. Over the last four
years, Winnick has sold about $602 million worth of stock, according
to a review of regulatory filings by Thompson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The proceeds of those sales financed a lavish lifestyle and
allowed Winnick to become one of the most generous philanthropists in
Los Angeles. In the last three years, he has contributed more than
$100 million to causes ranging from the Special Olympics to the Los
Angeles Zoo. A $40-million gift to the Simon Wiesenthal Center is
being used to build the Winnick Institute Jerusalem, a 3-acre center
in Israel designed by renowned architect Frank O. Gehry that is
dedicated to promoting human dignity and understanding between people
of different faiths.</TE>
<TE>   That's a far cry from Winnick's modest roots in Roslyn, N.Y.,
where his father, Arnold, owned a food service equipment business and
his mother, Blanche, was a homemaker and interior decorator. His
father's company went bankrupt in the 1960s, and he died of a heart
attack in 1966 when Winnick, the youngest of three siblings, was 18.</TE>
<TE>   His mother gave Winnick his father's wedding band. He slipped the
diamond-and-ruby band onto his right hand, where it still rests
today.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a man who keeps his word," said Lodwrick Cook, co-chairman
of Global Crossing. "I think he got that from his family."</TE>
<TE>   Winnick went to college close to home at Long Island University's
C.W. Post campus. In 1972 he joined the staff of Drexel and
eventually moved to California. During his tenure at the company,
Winnick rose from bond salesman to an executive and top aide to
Milken.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick left Drexel in 1985, a few years before it collapsed amid
legal troubles. After Winnick left Drexel, he formed a private
investment company called Pacific Asset Management with financial
help from Drexel executives.</TE>
<TE>   When Milken was charged with breaking securities laws, Winnick was
subpoenaed by a federal court to testify in the case. The case never
went to trial because Milken reached a settlement with federal
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick's investment firm, later renamed Pacific Capital Group,
dabbled in real estate and health care. But after he dispatched one
of his lieutenants to a meeting with AT&amp;T Corp., Winnick turned his
attention toward telecom.</TE>
<TE>   "Telecommunications looked like the wave of the future," said
Cook, who was among the first 10 employees. "It was exciting to be a
part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's rise admitted Winnick to the city's elite
circles. His investment firm paid $41.5 million for the ornate former
MCA building in Beverly Hills and installed its name in gold on the
green metal gates. Inside the building, which is modeled after an
Italian villa, Winnick's office is a replica of the Oval Office.</TE>
<TE>   At its height, Global Crossing was worth $55 billion, making him
the richest man in Los Angeles in 1999. Today its value has sunk
below $120 million. As of Monday, Winnick's remaining 9% stake was
worth a mere $10.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Had it worked out, people would have said this guy was a
visionary," said Jonathan Rosenthal, a partner at Saybrook Capital, a
Santa Monica investment bank. "But, it didn't."</TE>

<HD>Drop-Off Eases in Venture Funding</HD>
<DH>Investments: The rate of decline slowed in the fourth
quarter, leading some experts to look for an improved financing
climate this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Funding provided by venture capitalists for privately held companies
may be stabilizing after a brutal year in which steep losses from
scores of failed technology start-ups led venture firms to slash
investment, according to a study released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Venture capital-backed companies received $6.3 billion in 610
funding rounds in the fourth quarter, compared with $6.6 billion in
629 deals in the third quarter, said research firm VentureOne Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth quarter's funding decline was much less severe than in
recent quarters: The third quarter's $6.6 billion in funding compared
with $8.6 billion in the second quarter and $10.6 billion in the
first quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Funding levels have dropped every quarter from a record $27
billion in the first quarter of 2000, VentureOne reported.</TE>
<TE>   The "absence of multibillion-dollar declines in the fourth quarter
suggests that we may have seen the bottom on the curve," said San
Francisco-based VentureOne.</TE>
<TE>   The firm said it tracked 2,780 venture-capital financing deals
worth a total of $32.1 billion last year, resulting in deal volume
not quite half that of the 5,779 fundings in 2000 and an investment
level about one-third of $91.6 billion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the sharp drops, venture-backed companies received more
funds last year than in any year before 1999, VentureOne said, adding
that venture investment is poised to pick up.</TE>
<TE>   A forthcoming 2001 review by the National Venture Capital Assn.
industry group, research firm Venture Economics and
PricewaterhouseCoopers also is expected to signal recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "It's safe to say 2002 promises to be a better year, considering
the very difficult economic environment in 2001," NVCA spokeswoman
Jeanne Metzger said.</TE>

<HD>Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley Moving N.Y. Jobs</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. are moving jobs out
of New York after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that destroyed the
World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   Goldman will move the trading and research portion of its equities
business to Jersey City, N.J., in 2004, said a company memo made
public Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Morgan Stanley, which lost six employees in the attack and was the
trade center's biggest tenant, agreed Monday to buy the former
headquarters of Texaco Inc., now part of ChevronTexaco Corp., in
Westchester County north of the city for an undisclosed amount.</LD>
<TE>   "We would prefer, of course, keeping these jobs in New York City,
but it is difficult to take issue with these decisions if we cannot
offer a viable alternative," said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New
York City Partnership, a business advocacy organization.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street is shifting jobs out of lower Manhattan in part to
avoid future business disruptions. Firms that have moved jobs to
Jersey City or other areas surrounding Manhattan include Charles
Schwab Corp., Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Lehman Bros. and Bank of America.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley and Goldman plan to keep their respective
headquarters in New York, where Goldman employs 10,000 and Morgan
Stanley employs 14,000.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman's decision on its trading and research arms means the firm
will vacate 15 floors at One New York Plaza, owned by TrizecHahn
Corp. of Toronto, for a new development in Jersey City, across the
Hudson River.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley, the second-largest securities firm by capital,
will move some operations into a four-story, 725,000-square-foot
office building that sits on 107 acres in Harrison, N.Y. The firm did
not disclose the number of workers that will move to the Harrison
facility.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, securities firms will more than replace the jobs that
are leaving the city if business recovers, said Mayor Michael
Bloomberg, who added that he has spoken to Goldman Chairman Henry
Paulson about the loss of jobs.</TE>

<LD>Harvey Goldschmid, a former Securities and Exchange Commission
general counsel, on Monday won backing from Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) for nomination to a Democratic seat on the SEC.</LD>
<LD>   Goldschmid, 61, a Columbia University law professor, was the SEC's
top lawyer from July 1998 to January 2000. Goldschmid was the
architect of Regulation Fair Disclosure, which forbids companies to
give stock analysts first word about earnings or other important
news.</LD>
<LD>   Goldschmid could give Democrats a legal and philosophical
counterweight to SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, a Republican, as the
agency considers new accounting rules after Enron Corp.'s collapse,
analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   By law, only three of the five SEC seats can be occupied by one
political party.</TE>

<HD>The Little Things He Does Power Patriots</HD>

<LD>At 5 feet 10, Troy Brown is so short that the No. 80 on his New
England Patriot jersey seems to occupy three-fourths of his torso. Or
maybe that 80 stands out because it always seems to be in the middle
of the Patriots' big plays.</LD>
<LD>   He isn't a big talker, but his quiet voice stood out in the
silenced city of Pittsburgh after the Patriots threw salt on the
Steelers' Super Bowl hopes with a 24-17 victory at Heinz Field on
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Brown was explaining a motto he shares with other members of the
improbable AFC champion Patriots: Do what you do.</LD>
<TE>   "Kevin Faulk [a former teammate] started saying it to me," Brown
said. "It caught on with everybody else. That's what we've been
doing. Call us what you want to call us, we're just going to do what
we do."</TE>
<TE>   Among the things Brown did Sunday:</TE>
<TE>   * Return a punt 55 yards straight up the middle of the field for
the game's first touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   * Scoop up a blocked Pittsburgh field goal attempt and hustle 11
yards before tossing the ball to Antwan Harris, who ran 49 yards into
the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   * Get the step on his man to haul in a Drew Bledsoe pass on third
and 11, when the Patriots were back in their own territory and needed
to keep the chains and the clock moving.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the MVP of our team," Patriot safety Lawyer Milloy said.
"He's what made our team go. As long as we have him back there, we
always have a chance to score points. That's just what we believe.
When you see guys making that extra block, that extra effort, it's
because that's the type of player he is."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the Patriots made it to the playoffs because they had an
unexpectedly strong backup quarterback in Tom Brady when Bledsoe went
out with an injury. And they took the final step to the Super Bowl
because they had a player of Bledsoe's caliber to send in when Brady
was hurt in the first half of the AFC championship game.</TE>
<TE>   But Brown is the man who kept the Patriots from missing a beat
during the suspended/unsuspended/active/
injured(?)/inactive/suspended saga of wide receiver Terry Glenn.</TE>
<TE>   Brown caught a team-record 101 passes this season for 1,199 yards
and five touchdowns. He was the league's top punt returner, averaging
14.2 yards per runback, including touchdown returns of 85 yards and
68 yards.</TE>
<TE>   If there's one question the Patriots won't mind hearing again and
again this week, it's anything related to Brown. They love talking
about the guy. They'll even go out of their way to talk about him.</TE>
<TE>   When someone asked Bledsoe about the lift provided by two special
teams touchdowns Sunday, he said: "Thank you for the question,
because it leads me to Troy Brown.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm telling ya, if there's a more valuable player to his team in
the league than Troy Brown, I don't know who it is. Without Troy
Brown, I don't know what our record would be this year. But we
certainly wouldn't be standing where we are right now. He's by far
the most valuable player on our team."</TE>
<TE>   Even dour Coach Bill Belichick brightens when he hears Brown's
name.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh man, that guy is some football player," Belichick said. "He
does the big things, but he does all the little things. He does all
the unsung kind of things that make you appreciate him as a football
player. As a coach, you just love to have guys like that on your
team.</TE>
<TE>   "He returns kicks, blocks kicks, blocks on running plays, we count
on him for third-down [receptions] ... he's just a terrific football
player. He puts the team first. I think that's a great model and
example that he sets for our younger players, because he is so
team-oriented. A lot of things come his way because of the hard work
and determination."</TE>
<TE>   A career in the NFL wasn't a given for Brown, an eighth-round
draft pick from Marshall in 1993. He was a return specialist his
first season and was cut during preseason the next year, then signed
back later in the year. He didn't start a game at receiver until last
season.</TE>
<TE>   That's one reason you can still find him on the kick-block unit,
an unlikely place for a player who earned a spot in the Pro Bowl this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't forget where you come from," Brown said. "That's what
kept me on the team.</TE>
<TE>   "Special teams just kept me around a long time, and it's something
I've always been good at. And I always feel like if you've got a
player that's good on special teams, you've got to have him on the
field. Find a way to get him on the field and help your team win
games."</TE>
<TE>   Brown didn't get to play in New England's last trip to the Super
Bowl five years ago because he had a hernia.</TE>
<TE>   If I'm Belichick, I'm finding a way to get Brown on the field as
much as possible this Sunday. Nickel defense. Punt unit. Coin toss.</TE>
<TE>   Good things seem to happen for the Patriots whenever Brown does
what he does.</TE>

<HD>Triple Crowning Moment for L.A.</HD>
<DH>Hockey: The last time All-Star game was here in 1981,
Kings' famed line was there, but it wasn't spectacle it is today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the NHL brought its all-star game to Los Angeles for the first
time on Feb. 10, 1981, local fans packed the Forum to capacity to
honor the Kings' Triple Crown line of Dave Taylor, Marcel Dionne and
Charlie Simmer. But not everyone was excited about the game.</LD>
<LD>   KHJ-TV, the Kings' broadcast partner for television that season,
passed on airing the game, choosing to stick to its usual Tuesday
night lineup of game shows and old movies.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a great hockey team, but people don't want to watch it,"
Charles Velona, then vice president and general manager of the
station, said at the time. "We've put games on at various times--6
p.m., 10 a.m., 5 p.m.--but people don't want to view hockey."</LD>
<TE>   That wasn't too surprising considering some of the big-name
players didn't care enough to participate.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal's Guy Lafleur and Larry Robinson and Toronto's Borje
Salming, all stars among the all-stars, scratched themselves from the
game's lineup claiming various--and mysterious--physical ailments.</TE>
<TE>   Lafleur, who had been in and out of Montreal's lineup because of
several injuries, said he didn't feel he had played enough to warrant
selection to the team. Robinson told reporters he had a low white
blood cell count, and Salming said he had a sinus problem.</TE>
<TE>   And even though all three played in weekend contests leading up to
the All-Star game, they were backed by John Ziegler, then the NHL's
president, who sniffed, "Their business is to play the regular season
and the playoffs. The league shouldn't be put in position of saying,
'Well, you've got to play.'"</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the 16,005 fans at the game made sure it was a
memorable night for hockey in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "When they started the introductions, everyone was introduced
separately," said King broadcaster Bob Miller, who did the
play-by-play of the game for radio. "Then when the Triple Crown line
skated out together, the place went crazy. That's what I will always
remember."</TE>
<TE>   The King line of Taylor, Dionne and Simmer, along with goaltender
Mario Lessard, played for the Prince of Wales Conference team coached
by Scotty Bowman, then general manager of the Buffalo Sabres.</TE>
<TE>   For Bowman, the 1981 All-Star game was supposed to be his last as
a coach. After stepping away from the bench to move to the Sabres'
front office before the 1980-81 season, Bowman said, "this All-Star
game will hopefully be the last game I coach."</TE>
<TE>   Bowman, who will coach the World All-Star team on Saturday, may
have been wrong about his pregame wishes in 1981 but he was right
when it came to understanding the importance of making the NHL a
success on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the game, Scotty talked about this being a great
opportunity to sell the game in Los Angeles," Taylor said. "He was
really good for us."</TE>
<TE>   For Dionne, the game held some personal significance. He had
played for the victorious team in each of his five previous all-star
appearances.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I want to do well because the line is together and
we're playing in L.A.," he told the Los Angeles Herald Examiner. "We
wanted this honor more than any other, and I want to make the most of
it."</TE>
<TE>   After the Triple Crown line was introduced and the game started,
things did not work out for the four Kings in uniform. St. Louis
goaltender Mike Liut earned player of the game honors with 25 saves
in little more than a period and a half of work to lead the Campbell
Conference to a 4-1 victory over the Wales team.</TE>
<TE>   "Our line started slowly, probably because of the reaction we got
during the introductions," Taylor said. "Once we got going, we had a
lot of chances but none of us scored because Mike Liut played a great
game. I know I had five or six great chances."</TE>
<TE>   Fans got a chance to see a fast-paced game featuring skilled
players such as Wayne Gretzky and Mike Bossy. Only two penalties were
called and the game ended in just over two hours.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Triple Crown line was handed a rare shutout, King
fans enjoyed themselves by booing Philadelphia Coach Pat Quinn and
the five Flyer players he had on the Campbell Conference roster. The
Kings had recently played a roughhouse game against Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "The All-Star game back then wasn't as big as an event," Taylor
said. "Now it is almost All-Star week. It has really grown. It's not
just a showcase for the National Hockey League to show off the best
players in the league anymore. There are so many other events leading
up to the game. But it's still a great chance for players and fans to
have fun."</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE MAJORS</KH>
<HD>Twins, Expos Were on the Hit List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With contraction all but dead for this winter, baseball management
told the players' union that Montreal and Minnesota were the only
teams under consideration for elimination before opening day.</LD>
<LD>   Owners voted on Nov. 6 to eliminate two teams but did not identify
them, and contraction has been on hold since Nov. 16, when a
Minnesota judge issued an injunction that forces the Twins to honor
their 2002 lease at the Metrodome.</LD>
<LD>   Management negotiators Rob Manfred and Paul Beeston told the union
last week that if owners succeeded in their plan to eliminate teams
for this season, the Twins and Expos were the only candidates, two
people familiar with the talks said Monday on the condition of
anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Commissioner Bud Selig has refused to rule out folding franchises
for the 2002 season and maintains that no teams officially have been
picked for folding.</TE>
<TE>   Selig has maintained that contraction is theoretically possible
any time before the major league season opener on March 31.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos became the last team to release its schedule, and said
Monday they will install a new playing surface at Olympic Stadium
before the April 2 opener against Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident that baseball will be back in Montreal in 2002
and I just want to express my sincere appreciation for our fans'
patience and support during what has been a very trying off-season,"
Expo Executive Vice President David Samson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hall of Famer Ted Williams was released from a Gainesville, Fla.,
hospital, where he was admitted last week with flulike symptoms,
including a high fever and low blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, 83, returned with relatives to his Florida home, Shands
Hospital said in a statement. He will continue to require daily
at-home kidney dialysis treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Williams and his family wish to thank everyone for their
support and well wishes over the past few days," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Ismael Valdes, who pitched for the Angels last
season, agreed to a one-year, $2.5-million contract with the Texas
Rangers, joining his fourth team in four years.</TE>
<TE>   Valdes can earn an additional $1,225,000 in performance bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle Mariners are close to finalizing an agreement with
right-handed starter James Baldwin.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin was scheduled to take a physical examination Monday, one
of the final steps in completing the deal, a person involved in the
talks said on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin was 10-11 with a 4.42 earned-run average with the Dodgers
and the Chicago White Sox last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Norm Charlton's injury was worse than the Mariners believed.</TE>
<TE>   The left-handed reliever underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum
and a torn rotator cuff.</TE>
<TE>   Charlton's season-ending injury, announced by the team last week,
at first was believed to be only a torn rotator cuff.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Bill Simas agreed to a minor league contract with
Detroit and was invited to spring training.... Atlanta signed
right-handed reliever Darren Holmes to a minor league contract and
invited him to spring training.</TE>

<KH>TOP 25 ROUNDUP</KH>
<HD>Georgetown Upsets No. 14 Syracuse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Georgetown finally saw some reward for having such a tough schedule.</LD>
<LD>   Preston Shumpert could barely see at all, and Syracuse had no
chance without him.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Braswell had 16 points, six steals and five assists Monday
night at Washington in Georgetown's 75-60 upset of the 14th-ranked
Orangemen, giving the Hoyas the type of quality win they need to stay
in contention for an NCAA tournament berth.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Sweetney added 18 points and 13 rebounds for the Hoyas, 13-7
overall and 4-4 in the Big East Conference, who had been 0-6 against
teams currently ranked in the Top 25.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for us to be able to say we beat a team like
Syracuse," said Georgetown Coach Craig Esherick, who beefed up the
nonconference schedule after a disappointing NCAA seeding last year.</TE>
<TE>   Shumpert, a senior forward and the Big East's second leading
scorer, wore goggles after a flare-up of an eye injury and played
only 19 minutes--including one minute in the second half. He scored
three points on one-for-five shooting, his lowest scoring output
since the third game of his sophomore year.</TE>
<TE>   Shumpert scratched the cornea in his right eye during the
Orangemen's loss to Pittsburgh last year in the semifinals of the Big
East tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jim Boeheim said the eye was swollen shut when Shumpert woke
up Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the game, he really couldn't see out of it, but he thought
he could go," Boeheim said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in more pain at halftime. It flared up, and I just didn't
think he could go anymore.... I don't think a good player should be
playing when he can't see."</TE>
<TE>   The Orangemen (17-5, 6-2) also missed eight consecutive free
throws and were eight of 18 from the line for the game.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Georgetown announced that forward Victor Samnick
will sit out the rest of the season after having foot surgery.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Kansas 105, No. 22 Missouri 73--Drew Gooden had 26 points
and 10 rebounds, and Kirk Hinrich had 23 points at Lawrence, Kan.,
and the Jayhawks won in a rout after leading by one point at
halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Boschee and Nick Collison each had 13 points for the Jayhawks
(18-2, 7-0 Big 12), who outscored Missouri by 20 points over the
first six minutes of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   It was the worst loss of the season for Missouri (15-6, 5-3),
which was ranked No. 2 after a 9-0 start but has gone 6-6 since.</TE>
<TE>   It was Kansas' largest margin of victory over Missouri at
Lawrence.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gale Catlett, in his 30th season as coach, is taking a leave of
absence from West Virginia for medical reasons, Athletic Director Ed
Pastilong said.</TE>
<TE>   Pastilong did not say how long Catlett would remain on leave and
did not provide specifics about his condition.</TE>
<TE>   The Mountaineers (7-11, 0-6 Big East) are on a nine-game losing
streak, matching the school record from the 1936-37 season.</TE>
<TE>   While Catlett is on leave, his nephew, assistant Drew Catlett,
will handle the coaching duties.</TE>

<LD>Rick Morrissey of the Chicago Tribune on sports he'd like to see in
the Winter Olympics:</LD>
<LD>   * "Full-Contact Figure Skating: The dream matchup in this new
event would be Sasha Cohen, who reportedly bumped into competitors on
purpose during warmups at the U.S. nationals, against Tonya Harding,
skating's gift to the women of Cell Block C.</LD>

<TE>   Trivia time: Which city has played host to the most Super Bowl
games?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Airing it out: Jeff Gordon in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch:
"Michael Jordan will want to reach a divorce settlement with his
wife, Juanita, ASAP, because our nation's supermarket tabloids are on
the case.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't like M.J. for whatever reason, then you can rush out
and buy the Globe (MICHAEL JORDAN'S SECRET SEX LIFE), the National
Enquirer (MICHAEL JORDAN'S MISTRESS TELLS ALL) or the Star (WIFE'S
OWN STORY)."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's been said: Louisville basketball Coach Rick Pitino,
commenting to the Louisville Courier-Journal on Cardinal forward
Jospeh N'Sima's faulty free-throw shooting this season: "I'm a coach
who's a big believer in execution. And when I watch him shoot free
throws, I want to execute him."</TE>
<TE>   Pitino may have borrowed this quip from the late John McKay, who,
while coaching Tampa Bay, was asked about his team's execution and
replied: "I'm all for it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Positive spin: Some NHL stars reportedly aren't eager to come to
Los Angeles for the All-Star game, but Edmonton goalie Tommy Salo is
looking forward to it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking at it as a holiday," he said. "I'm taking my wife for
the weekend. All I have to do is play for 20 minutes and dig five or
six pucks out of the net."</TE>

coach could be a space alien walking among us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Recount: Michael Ventre of MSNBC.com: "Because they play at Enron

<TE>   And finally: Writing before Sunday's NFL playoff games, Greg Cote
of the Miami Herald predicted runaway victories for Pittsburgh and
St. Louis: "[The] Super Bowl host city, New Orleans, is called the
'Big Easy' because the two NFL teams that will be there are going to
win this weekend's games big, and easy."</TE>
<TE>   Big and easy, huh? The New England Patriots beat the Steelers and
the Rams had to sweat out a 29-24 victory over the Philadelphia

<DH>Pro basketball: Clippers' trip begins with 119-115 overtime
loss to Grizzlies and the late benching of McInnis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Jeff McInnis was in no mood to talk after the Clippers' 119-115
overtime loss Monday night to the Memphis Grizzlies at the Pyramid.
Coach Alvin Gentry spoke only in vague terms when quizzed about
McInnis' absence during the final 3:50 of the fourth quarter and all
of the five-minute overtime.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to play the guys I think can help us win games," Gentry
said. "There's a lot more to being a part of a team than just having
ability on the court. I'm going to have the people out there that I
think will give us the best chance to win."</LD>
<LD>   McInnis left without speaking to reporters.</LD>
<TE>   It seems to always be something with these Clippers, who
squandered a 12-point halftime lead and fell to 3-15 on the road and
0-5 in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis and Gentry seemed to be at odds after McInnis barked at
the referees over a non-call midway through the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   While McInnis was arguing for a foul call, Grizzly point guard
Brevin Knight raced the other way to score an uncontested basket that
tied the score at 65 .</TE>
<TE>   Gentry replaced McInnis moments later and played his starting
point guard for only six minutes in the fourth quarter, sitting him
out in favor of Earl Boykins, who stands 5 feet 5. Boykins had seven
points and seven assists in 22 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers rallied from a 94-85 deficit in the final 4:20 of
regulation, pulling even at 100 on Elton Brand's layup and free throw
after Tony Massenburg fouled him with 12.6 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis pulled away steadily in overtime. Knight made five of six
free throws late and the Grizzlies ended a seven-game losing streak.
Knight had 19 points and 15 assists. Rookie Pau Gasol led the
Grizzlies with 23 points and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Brand had 26 points and 10 rebounds and center Michael Olowokandi
matched his career high with 27 points. But the Clippers were missing
their floor leader in crunch time. McInnis had 14 points in the first
half, but only two in the second. He also had eight assists in 32
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if there was one specific thing that prompted McInnis'
benching, Gentry said, "I'm going to play the people that give us the
best chance to win the game. Do I make the right decisions all the
time? No."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Gentry was slightly more expansive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole lot of things that don't need to be discussed in the
paper," he said. "It's something that will be discussed within the
team."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if McInnis would start tonight against the Mavericks at
Dallas, Gentry said, "Sure he does. Sure he does."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers played an almost flawless first half, leading, 52-40,
shooting 51.2% and limiting the Grizzlies, who were without point
guard Jason Williams because of ingrown toenails, to 40.5% shooting.</TE>
<TE>   But the Clippers, as is their custom on the road, failed to
sustain their energy and enthusiasm in the third quarter. They
stopped making plays and started to get down on each other.</TE>
<TE>   "It can't be like that," Brand said. "We win together. We go down
together. We were bickering and all of a sudden you looked up and we
were down by four points [in the third quarter]."</TE>
<TE>   Soon enough, the Clippers were all but finished. They trailed by
nine points after Knight's basket with 4:20 left in regulation. Brand
took control inside and helped bring the Clippers back, scoring nine
of their final 15 points. He would foul out with 3:10 left in
overtime, however.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi became the go-to guy, making two quick hook shots in
overtime, but the Clippers faded and the Grizzlies surged.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Gentry was asked if versatile forward Lamar Odom, on the
injured list because of a sprained right wrist, would have helped
down the stretch. The obvious answer was, yes, but Gentry refused to
use Odom's absence as an excuse.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got their second-best player sitting out," Gentry said,
referring to the Grizzlies' Michael Dickerson, sidelined by a stress
fracture. "They don't have Lorenzen Wright either [because of a knee
injury]. That's why you have 12 players on the roster. You have to
play with what you have. They have to come through for you."</TE>

<LD>The praise fell on deaf ears. Michael Olowokandi was too upset to be
pleased about personal accomplishments after the Clippers' 119-115
overtime loss Monday to the Memphis Grizzlies.</LD>
<LD>   Olowokandi tied his career best with 27 points, but said, "My
scoring is meaningless." Of losing he added, "It's a huge setback for
us. It's a huge disappointment for us."</LD>
<LD>   Olowokandi made 12 of 23 shots, three of three free throws and
also took eight rebounds in 41 minutes in easily his best game of the
season so far.</LD>
<TE>   "Michael has played great for us," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "We
went away from him for a little bit because they started to front him
and we couldn't get the ball to him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers left Lamar Odom at home. His sprained right wrist,
put in a cast last week, will be examined later this week. Odom,
expected to be out for at least three weeks, will join the team
midway through this seven-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Elton Brand had hoped to hear whether he had been selected to be a
reserve for the Western Conference All-Star team. League officials
told the Clippers to call back this morning. An official announcement

<LD>   What: "Biography: Joe Montana"</LD>
<LD>   Where: A&amp;E, tonight, 8</LD>
<TE>   A&amp;E has joined forces with NFL Films to produce five "Biography"
profiles on NFL legends that are being shown this week, which A&amp;E is
calling "NFL Greats Week." The shows are great, too.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's edition follows Joe Montana through his small-town
beginnings in Monongahela, Pa., to his days at Notre Dame and his
four Super Bowl titles with the San Francisco 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Gifford was featured Monday night. Walter Payton is profiled
Wednesday, Vince Lombardi on Thursday and Joe Namath on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Al Michaels serves as guest host of the series, and A&amp;E's Harry
Smith, as usual, narrates.</TE>
<TE>   The Payton profile may stir the most emotion, the Lombardi show
may be the most revealing and the Namath profile may be the most
appealing. But Montana fans will love tonight's show.</TE>
<TE>   Among those interviewed are Montana's wife, Jennifer--they met on
a commercial shoot--his parents, Theresa and Joe Sr.; his high school
coach, Chuck Abramski; his Notre Dame coach, Dan Devine; former 49er
coach Bill Walsh and a number of Montana's 49er teammates.</TE>
<TE>   The show explores the rift between Montana and Steve Young and
explains it well.</TE>
<TE>   But the part on Montana's early days may be the most interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Montana, an all-around athlete, led Ringgold High to two section
basketball titles, and he was offered a basketball scholarship to
North Carolina State.</TE>
<TE>   "Basketball was probably my No. 1 love," Montana says. "Even my
father thought I was going to take the easy road and play
basketball."</TE>
<TE>   There was a point where Montana wished he had.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got to Notre Dame, I had this illusion that everything
would be easy," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Until I realized that there were seven freshman quarterbacks on
the team.</TE>
<TE>   "You say to yourself, 'Why did I do this?'''</TE>
<TE>   It eventually worked out OK for Montana.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Find the Road to Success</HD>
<DH>Hockey: They complete 3-0 trip with 1-0 victory at St.
Louis, their fourth straight win. Giguere, Kariya star.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>That Mighty Duck team huddle at the end of Monday's game said a lot.
This seemed like the conclusion of another group therapy season,
maybe for a Fear of Success 12-step program.</LD>
<LD>   If so, count this as a breakthrough. The Ducks were superb
defensively. They received excellent goaltending from Jean-Sebastien
Giguere. And, for the first time this season, one goal was enough for
them to win, 1-0 over the St. Louis Blues in front of 18,909 at the
Savvis Center.</LD>
<LD>   There was a little scrambling at the end, when the Blues pulled
their goalie. Giguere had to make two bang-bang saves. But from start
to finish, the Ducks were in control against a good team and made
Paul Kariya's second-period goal stand up.</LD>
<TE>   The payoff was more than just back-slaps and well-dones at the
end. The Ducks  won their fourth consecutive game, a season high.
They finished off a perfect Dallas-Nashville-St. Louis trip, winning
three games in four nights.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the Ducks themselves would have dared predict such a
thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the trip?" defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky said, grinning.</TE>
<TE>   Tverdovsky wasn't the only one a little stunned by the three
victories.</TE>
<TE>   "Has that ever happened before in Duck history?" Marty McInnis
said.</TE>
<TE>   On a trip of three or more games, only once. The Ducks went 4-0 on
a swing through Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg in 1993-94,
their first season. It has been so long that Winnipeg's team long ago
pulled up stakes and moved to Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow," McInnis said. "That's pretty good.</TE>
<TE>   "We have obviously been through a lot this season. The team has
come together a little more on this road trip. We had a couple
dinners out together. A lot of stuff that has been going on off the
ice, in a strange way, has brought us together."</TE>
<TE>   That would be a reference to General Manager Pierre Gauthier's
trade inquiries with other teams, in which he dangled at least six
players on the Anaheim roster. The Ducks responded to that with three
road victories.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's might have been their best performance of the three.
Dallas had just fired its coach. Nashville was, well, Nashville. But
the Blues' 147 goals before Monday were the third-most in the Western
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   They got 15 shots against the Ducks, who clogged passing lanes,
blocked shots and reduced the amount of stress for Giguere. He saw
only five shots in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   The Blues' quality chances were few. In the second period, Giguere
slid across the crease and stoned Keith Tkachuk, who seemed to have
an open net. Scott Mellenby got off a quick wrist shot with 20
seconds left, but Giguere moved to his right and got his body on it.
Tkachuk fired again on a rebound try with 15 seconds left, but
Giguere easily deflected the puck.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks have become used to solid performances by Giguere, who
began the night sixth in the league with a 2.14 goals-against
average, third among goalies who have played 30 or more games.</TE>
<TE>   But Giguere has been supported the last two games. The Ducks gave
up 19 shots against Nashville Saturday and topped that performance
Monday against a better team.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to survive the first period," Duck Coach Bryan Murray
said.</TE>
<TE>   "[Giguere] had to get shutouts [earlier in the season] because
that was the only way we were ever going to win early in the year.
We're finally getting enough goals."</TE>
<TE>   One was enough Monday. Andy McDonald  carried the puck behind the
net and centered a pass that hit St. Louis' Doug Weight. As the puck
lay on the ice, Kariya reached around Weight and flicked a shot that
beat goalie Fred Brathwaite to the glove side.</TE>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks' Jean-Sebastien Giguere is a patient man.</LD>
<LD>   He has been as good as any goalie in the NHL since Dec. 1 and had
very little to show for it. Yet, he remains an optimist.</LD>
<LD>   Giguere has the league's best goals-against average and save
percentage since Dec. 1. Yet his record in that stretch was5-9-3
until the Ducks started their current four-game winning streak. He
has now won his last four starts, playing the same as he has for the
last two months.</LD>
<TE>   "When we weren't winning, I just worked really hard in practice,"
Giguere said. "At some point things were going to change around. At
some point, you're going start winning."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere received ample support Monday in a 1-0 win over St. Louis.
He faced only 15 shots from a team that averages nearly 30 a game.</TE>
<TE>   "We played very well defensively in the neutral zone; that was the
key," Giguere said. "We didn't give them any space to skate. When
they can't skate, they can't create."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere was among the runners-up to Vancouver's Brent Sopel for
NHL player of the week. Giguere had a 3-0 record, a 1.30
goals-against average and a .942 save percentage.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh's Mario Lemieux and Alexei Morozov were also
runners-up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kariya's second-period goal made it five consecutive games
that the Ducks' top line has scored a goal since Mike Leclerc was
teamed with Kariya and Andy McDonald.</TE>

<TE>   MILESTONES</TE>
<TE>   * Ventura Buena had a fourth-quarter lead but lost to Harbor City
Narbonne, 48-35. The defeat dropped Buena to 13-7, the first time the
girls' team has lost as many as seven games in one season.</TE>
<TE>   * Antelope Valley's 46-39 victory at Palmdale stuck the Falcons
with only their 14th home loss in 14 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   LOOKING AHEAD</TE>
<TE>   * Tonight: The last time the teams played each other, it was
standing-room only. It could be more of the same tonight at Buena
when the Bulldogs play host to Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   * Saturday: Seventh-ranked Troy lost twice last week to ranked
opponents, but tries to redeem itself at No. 6 Bishop Montgomery.
Ninth-ranked Woodbridge's game at No. 8 Brea Olinda should be very
close.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not unusual for frustration to lead to an elbow, a push or even
a punch during a game, but the Jan. 18 fracas at Carson High was an
eye-opener.</LD>
<LD>   In the final minute of Gardena's victory over Carson, a student
came out of the stands and hit Gardena player Alexis Johnson,
creating confusion on the floor as players and fans converged.</LD>
<LD>   The instigator was a female student from Hawthorne High, a school
that wasn't even involved in the game.</LD>
<TE>   She ran from the front row of the bleachers to take a swing at
Johnson, who was not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "I never even thought of hiring school police for a girls' event,
but for boys, we always hire school police," said Jeff Davis,
assistant principal at Carson. "It's very sad that this happened, and
we're taking whatever steps we can to ensure it doesn't happen, but
it's totally isolated."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said he had two deans on site, and though there was
apparently a running dialogue between the Hawthorne student and the
Gardena player during the game--Gardena came from behind to
win--there was nothing that indicated it was malicious.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my third year and we haven't had any problem with any
spectator at any sport on our end," Davis said. "And now this,
someone who doesn't even go to our school or live in our community
comes in and causes a problem."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, when the Carson girls play Harbor City Narbonne on
Friday in their next night home game, which also figures to be an
emotional contest, there will be at least two campus security
officers on hand.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said they will be sitting in the stands, which is atypical,
since most security mans the doorways.</TE>
<TE>   At a boys' game last week, Davis had security personnel in the
front row of the stands on both sides of the floor.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to learn," Davis said, "[but] I don't know if I had
someone there [at the girls' game] that it would have mattered."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brentwood flash: Eshaya Murphy of Van Nuys Montclair Prep may be
the top scorer in the Southland, but it was a move by Brentwood
freshman Brie Brown that stole the show in her team's 70-54 victory
over Montclair Prep in a Delphic League showdown last week.</TE>
<TE>   A driving Brown made a behind-the-back layup in the early stages
of a 21-0 run that broke a 17-17 tie in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I taught her that about a month ago," said Brentwood Coach Dan
Smith, a claim that Brown confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   Most impressive was that Brown made the move in a moment of need,
not a moment of vanity.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not looking to be fancy," Brown said. "It was just there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Principal player: Old-fashioned principles paid off on Saturday
for Chandi Gilling, a senior at Chino Hills Ayala, who made a huge
difference in Ayala's 58-55 upset of then-No. 4 Fullerton Troy.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a big game for us and it was my time to step up,"
Gilling said. "I got up early this morning to shoot the ball for
about 90 minutes."</TE>
<TE>   Gilling, who averages eight points, made seven of nine from the
field and scored 14 against the Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   "I said before the season began that she would be the key to what
we do," Coach Mel Sims said. "If she ever comes on, we'll be good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hold on, honey: Troy Coach Kevin Kiernan and his wife, Christine,
are expecting their second child any day now; her expected due date
was Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   But when Troy played San Clemente last week during the MLK
Classic--pitting teams then ranked No. 3 and 4 by The Times--Kiernan
was worried that Christine, who is also an assistant coach, might
have the baby on the day of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope it doesn't happen today," Kiernan said before tipoff.
"Win or lose, I want to see this game."</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente won, 66-62, after Kiernan called a timeout he didn't
have available to him with 2.6 seconds left and trailing, 63-62.</TE>
<TE>   "We checked the tape," Kiernan said, "and it looks like we got
shorted a timeout. It looks like they charged one of San Clemente's
to us. I don't want to take anything away from San Clemente.... We
might not have won anyway."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marquis watch: Things should remain status quo this week for
Alhambra Keppel. The team's coach, Richard Marquis, remains under
investigation for undisclosed reasons, leaving the team under the
direction of Tan Ha.</TE>
<TE>   Lois Nash, assistant superintendent of human resources for the
Alhambra School District, said it's unlikely any action will take
place this week because Superintendent Myrna Rivera will be
unavailable.</TE>

<HD>New Dodger Is Straight Out of Central Casting</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Jordan gives team a solid hitter and citizen ...
and maybe, he says, a new center fielder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The line of players hoping to roam center field for the Dodgers this
spring, already as long as those at Dodger Stadium concession stands,
has grown by one.</LD>
<LD>   Brian Jordan, acquired from the Atlanta Braves in the Jan. 15 Gary
Sheffield trade, will be thrown into a center-field mix that already
includes Marquis Grissom, Tom Goodwin, McKay Christensen and Dave
Roberts.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan, who played right field in Atlanta, is expected to open the
season in left field, but the Dodgers want to get a good look at
Jordan in center during the exhibition season. If Jordan proves he
can play center on a regular basis, the Dodgers may leave him there
and look to trade for a left fielder.</LD>
<TE>   "He approached Jim [Tracy, Dodger manager] and I and said he will
play anywhere in the outfield, but he loves playing center field,"
Dodger General Manager Dan Evans said of Jordan. "Jim makes out the
lineup. But the fact that Brian is an option in center is something
we'll explore in spring training. If he can play there, it gives us
more flexibility, more options."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who was in town Monday for a meet-and-greet session with
the media and Dodger officials, said center field is his most natural
position. Right field is out of the question, because Shawn Green
plays there, and Jordan is more than willing to play left.</TE>
<TE>   "But I could play center field if I have to," said Jordan, who
turns 35 on March 29. "Everything is up in the air right now. I don't
even know if this is the final roster."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers would love to trade Grissom or Goodwin, especially if
either could be packaged in a deal for a closer, but finding a taker
will be difficult: Grissom, who hit .221 with 21 homers, 60 runs
batted in, 16 walks and 107 strikeouts last season, is guaranteed $5
million in 2002, and Goodwin, who hit .231 with four homers and 22
RBIs in 2001, will make $3.25 million this season.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan would be a considerable offensive upgrade in center, but he
also has been on the disabled list 10 times, he underwent surgery on
both shoulders last winter and he plays defense with a reckless
abandon, all of which might persuade the Dodgers to keep Jordan in
left, a less rigorous position than center.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever Jordan plays, the Dodgers are convinced his heart will be
in it. Jordan was so disappointed by the trade that when Brave
General Manager John Schuerholz called to inform him of the deal,
Jordan hung up on him, saying he was "stabbed in the back." Jordan
lives in Atlanta year-round and didn't want to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "But now that the shock has worn off and reality has set in, I'm
looking forward to playing in L.A.," Jordan said Monday. "I look at
this club, and there's a lot of talent. We have a great pitching
staff, and I think we have a good chance of winning a championship if
everybody stays healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Though Jordan has added about 15 pounds of muscle to his 6-foot-1
frame this winter and is now 225 pounds, he doesn't expect to match
the power of Sheffield, who averaged 37 homers and 103 RBIs the last
three years. Jordan hasn't hit more than 25 homers in a season, and
he has topped 100 RBIs only twice in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Every season my goal is to hit 20-25 home runs and drive in 100
runs," Jordan said. "Anything after that is a bonus."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan probably can't match Sheffield's power and penchant for
disrupting a clubhouse, either, and for that the Dodgers are
thankful.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, chemistry was a big thing they were lacking [last season];
they seemed separated," Jordan said. "Hopefully, that will change. My
role is to be Brian Jordan, to bring a winning attitude, give 110%,
and I expect the same from my teammates.... I'm not here to change,
or to take over the clubhouse. If I need to speak up, I will, but I
do more leading by example than speaking up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' pursuit of a closer appears to have cooled somewhat
because teams have focused on the Dodgers' two most promising young
pitchers, right-hander Eric Gagne and left-hander Odalis Perez, in
trade talks. The Dodgers, who have spoken to the Boston Red Sox about
Ugueth Urbina and the Chicago White Sox about Bob Howry, are
reluctant to part with Gagne or Perez and would much rather deal
veteran left-hander Omar Daal. Angel closer Troy Percival remains an
outside possibility, but only if talks between the Angels and
Percival on a contract extension break down. The Dodgers agreed to
trade Grissom, reliever Matt Herges and outfield prospect Chin-Feng
Chen to the Angels for Percival in early January, but the deal was
nixed by Angel upper management.</TE>

<KH>KING REPORT</KH>
<HD>Belanger to Miss Eight Weeks</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Eric Belanger, who was enjoying a productive season for the Kings, is
scheduled to undergo surgery today in Los Angeles to repair ligaments
in his left wrist, a procedure that is expected to sideline the
second-year center for eight weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Belanger, 24, had prepared for the worst since suffering the
injury Jan. 15, but the word Monday that he would need surgery still
came as a severe blow.</LD>
<LD>   "It's really tough," he said from Los Angeles, "because I had a
great season and the team was playing good and doing something right
going into the playoffs. It's the last year of my contract, so at the
beginning of the year I said if I could stay away from the injury, it
would be good for me, but here we go again."</LD>
<TE>   Belanger, who has eight goals and 14 assists in 46 games, is
expected to return to the lineup around April 1, two weeks before the
end of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   His absence has created an opportunity for Brad Chartrand, who has
bounced between the Kings and the minors the last three seasons and
has scored two goals and two assists in the six games since Belanger
was injured.</TE>
<TE>   "You could call it pressure," Chartrand said, "but I think it's
something I kind of thrive on. The last three seasons, it's been like
that for me. I've never had a chance to rest on any sort of laurels.
I've got to be great when I'm up here, and I've got to play great in
the minors because I want to be called back up."</TE>
<TE>   Chartrand, 27, is similar to Belanger in terms of speed and
tenacity.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to sit here and say that I'm maybe the most gifted
offensive player in the world," Chartrand said, "but I think work
ethic is also an attribute that a player can have, and I think I have
that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   King defenseman Mathieu Schneider aggravated a left shoulder
strain when he ran into teammate Ziggy Palffy in the morning skate,
then was bumped again late in the first period Monday night and had
to leave the game. He will fly home to Los Angeles today for more
tests.</TE>

<HD>King Return to Denver Scores Big</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Behind Buchberger and Johnson, L.A. posts 6-4
victory against league's stingiest defensive team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>In their first game at the Pepsi Center since Game 7 of last year's
Western Conference semifinals, the Kings walked away happy this time.</LD>
<LD>   Getting the winning goal from Jason Allison and five goals from
the unlikely trio of Mattias Norstrom, Kelly Buchberger and Craig
Johnson, the Kings surprised the Colorado Avalanche, 6-4, on Monday
in front of a sellout crowd of 18,007.</LD>
<LD>   Buchberger and Johnson scored two goals each as the Kings, who had
scored as many as six goals only three times in their previous 51
games, put together the highest-scoring output of the season against
the NHL's stingiest team.</LD>
<TE>   The Avalanche, which had its six-game winning streak ended,
started the game with a league-leading 1.95 goals-against average and
had not given up more than two goals in any of its previous eight
games, among them a 4-2 victory over the Kings in a tight-checking
game Saturday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   But Johnson, returning to the lineup after sitting out two games
because of a cut on his right eye, scored the first shorthanded goal
of his career and Norstrom scored his first goal in more than two
years, ending a 171-game drought.</TE>
<TE>   Buchberger's two goals, among them an empty-netter, ended a
39-game drought for the veteran winger and doubled his season output.</TE>
<TE>   "That's great to see," King Coach Andy Murray said. "That's what a
team is all about. It's nice to see those guys come through."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who have won six of seven road games this month, are
10-2-2 away from Staples Center since Dec. 8, when they lost to the
Blues, 2-0, at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "We seem to play good hockey when we're playing good teams, and
we've been playing nothing but good teams," Murray said. "You
recognize if you're not prepared to play, you could get embarrassed.
We don't want that to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they embarrassed Avalanche goaltender Patrick Roy, who
before Monday night led the league with a 1.83 goals-against average.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't happen often," said Johnson, whose two-goal effort
was only the third of his career but second this season. "We made
some great shots."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings built a 2-0 lead on Johnson's goals, then saw the
Avalanche tie the score on two power-play goals by Joe Sakic, ending
a career-worst 18-game goal-scoring drought for last season's NHL
most valuable player. The Kings took the lead for good on a goal by
Buchberger with 28 seconds to play in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are 13-1 when leading after two periods, but this third
period was more wild than most. The Avalanche kept the pressure on
until the end.</TE>
<TE>   Norstrom's goal early in the third period again gave the Kings a
two-goal lead, and, after Ville Nieminen had pulled the Avalanche
within a goal, Allison scored the winner on a backhander from the
slot with 5:26 to play.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche, though, got an unassisted goal from Rob Blake with
1:24 to play and was on the offensive again before Buchberger flipped
the puck out of the King zone and into an empty net with six seconds
left.</TE>
<TE>   "Totally different look than what we saw two days ago," Norstrom
said. "[That was] a tight-checking game, low shot count, not a lot of
quality chances. Tonight we saw two teams--and I don't think we
wanted this--way more back and forth."</TE>
<TE>   Norstrom's goal, his first since Jan. 11, 2000, was scored on one
such play, Brad Chartrand carrying the puck into the Avalanche zone
and drawing two defenders to him before dropping the puck as he was
sandwiched between them.</TE>
<TE>   "He almost split the D," said Norstrom, a defenseman who has
scored only eight goals in 498 NHL games. "I just came up behind him
and the puck popped out to the side [into the left faceoff circle]
and I got it pretty good right to the side of Patrick. It was nice to
get it over with. It had been a long time. ...</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it feels good. It's fun to contribute a little bit on
the offensive side of the game once in a while, and it's really been
once in a while."</TE>
<TE>   He said it was fun to see Buchberger and Johnson score too.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Is Not Too Worried</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>They are halfway to where they want to be, to a game they care about,
to a moment they are sure is worthy of them.</LD>
<LD>   Through 41 games, the Lakers stand about where they did last
season: restless, underachieving and wondering probably when the
playoffs start.</LD>
<LD>   They have offered hope to every last-place team in the NBA, a
remarkable lack of achievement given their attempt to become the
fifth team in league history to three-peat.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson, perspiring through a black sweat suit after
practice here Monday, said it was merely part of the process. Both of
his previous three-peat teams have had their clumsy moments.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't unusual," Jackson said. "I'm not in a situation where
... we're anything but fine and OK. If I had a group of guys who were
moping around and they were depressed about basketball, that would be
a different thing."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the practice was filled with laughter. After Philadelphia,
they are 0-1 on a five-game trip General Manager Mitch Kupchak said
could dictate his mood going into the Feb. 21 trading deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm gauging about who I can play and who I can't," Jackson said.
"Who can play in critical times, who can play in the soft moments of
the ball game. That's what I'm gauging."</TE>
<TE>   He is assuming this 13, then.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not crying out for any more help," Jackson said. "We
obviously have not found a rhythm yet as a team, where we really know
how to play together as a group. But, we still have five or six guys
... who are new to this franchise, to this system."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In keeping with his recent disregard for the Los Angeles media,
Shaquille O'Neal issued a profane no comment after Sunday's loss in
Philadelphia, but spoke later to the Philadelphia Inquirer.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the six-point defeat and Dikembe Mutombo's 13-point,
18-rebound game against him, O'Neal said the Lakers have nothing to
fear in the 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   "Hell, no," he said. "They're obviously good. But I don't see that
intensity I saw last season. I don't see that fire. I just don't.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about them at all. If they want to prove me
wrong, all they have to do is make it back to L.A. for the Finals and
go against us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant came away from Monday's visit to the White House
impressed by President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't vote for him, but I like him," he said. "I'm glad he's
our president in this situation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tex Winter was back at practice Monday, happily bouncing entry
passes to forwards and swingmen in a 30-minute drill in a gym at
Philips Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Despite signs of an irregular heartbeat that will be tested in Los
Angeles, Winter will stay with the club for the remainder of the
trip, Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mark Madsen turned 26 Monday.... Last time in Atlanta, the Lakers
lost, 108-106. They haven't lost to the Hawks at home since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Atlanta, 4:30 PST</TE>
<TE>   Channel 9, 5:30 (delayed)</TE>
<TE>   Site--Philips Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 29-12, Hawks 14-29.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Hawks (2000-2001)--1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Hawks were expected to be much better, but have lost
154 man-games to injury, and have not had a player start every game.
Center Theo Ratliff, the key figure in the trade that sent Mutombo to
Philadelphia last season, has missed all but three games because of a
hip injury. Toni Kukoc and Emanual Davis are on the injured list,
each with a fractured wrist. Coach Lon Kruger's two-year record is
39-86. The Hawks have lost nine of 10 games. Five of the losses were
at home.</TE>

<HD>This Time, Chief Hails Lakers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Madsen nearly provides encore at White
House as President Bush honors NBA champs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON, D.C.</DL>
<LD>Mark Madsen took two large steps toward the President of the United
States, toward White House immortality, before changing his mind.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush on Monday morning had asked him to reprise the
unwieldy dance that celebrated the Lakers' NBA championship in June,
and Madsen appeared to accept.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm ready," said Madsen, a huge grin on his face, as he started
away from his teammates along a gold curtain in the East Room. "Let's
go."</LD>
<TE>   Alas, Madsen reconsidered, and let lie Al Gore's legacy for motor
grace.</TE>
<TE>   At the podium, Bush looked over his left shoulder and said,
"Actually, I just said I was hoping. I'm afraid the Secret Service
might react violently if you did."</TE>
<TE>   On a mild morning that smelled of spring though the White House
trees were bare and its front lawn yellow, the Lakers took one more
lap around the 2000-01 season and their repeated NBA title. They
toured the White House and then stood behind Bush as he greeted them
with a short speech on his way to a meeting with Hamid Karzai,
Afghanistan's interim leader.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, across Pennsylvania Avenue, a handful of demonstrators
stirred beneath their sleeping bags. They surrounded a large yellow
sign with thick black letters intended for Bush: "Live by the bomb,
die by the bomb"--a day after the Lakers missed 14 of 17
three-pointers and lost to the Philadelphia 76ers, 93-87.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant presented Bush with a Laker jersey and Shaquille
O'Neal followed with a basketball, signed by the team. Coach Phil
Jackson, who campaigned for Bill Bradley in the last Democratic
presidential primary race, introduced the players to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. President, it was an honor to have been here when your father
was here, to have been able to present a team at that time, as it is
this time," Jackson said. "I want to say that this group showed the
country and NBA basketball how to work together as a group. And I
only hope that you and the Congress can do as much."</TE>
<TE>   Bush addressed a small gathering that sat in gold-backed chairs.
Included in the group were six members of Congress from California,
Laker executives Jeanie and Jim Buss, two dozen children from nearby
Boys and Girls Clubs, and Laker assistant Tex Winter.</TE>
<TE>   Winter was hospitalized in Philadelphia briefly Sunday because of
an adverse reaction to spicy food, but rejoined the team that night.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't stop him," assistant Frank Hamblen said of the
resilient Winter, who will be 80 next month. "You can only hope to
contain him."</TE>
<TE>   It was Hamblen, apparently, who suggested Winter sample the hot
sauce with a postgame meal.</TE>
<TE>   NBA Commissioner David Stern, Laker commentators Stu Lantz and
Paul Sunderland, the coaching staff and the team's decent-sized
traveling party also attended.</TE>
<TE>   "Being champs on the court means you've got to be champs off the
court as well," Bush told them. "I know these players understand that
every time they do something, some kid is watching. Every time they
say something, some kid is listening. I want to thank the players who
understand that with victory comes a huge responsibility to encourage
people to make the right choices in life. To me, that's the true sign
of a champ."</TE>
<TE>   Bush then looked to the Buss children.</TE>
<TE>   "I also want to thank the L.A. Lakers for being involved in your
community," he said. "People ask me all the time after the attack of
9-11, 'What can I do to help? How can I participate in the war
against terror?' And the answer is, you fight evil with acts of
decency and kindness. You fight evil by doing something good. You
fight evil by teaching a child that somebody loves them. You fight
evil by being an L.A. Laker that convinces somebody to be a mentor
for some child in inner-city Los Angeles who wonders whether there's
any love or hope in the world. That's how you fight evil."</TE>

<HD>Jazz Beats the Heat to End Losing Streak</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Bryon Russell scored a season-high 20 points to break out of a
shooting slump as the Utah Jazz ended a three-game losing streak with
a 101-89 victory over the Miami Heat on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Karl Malone, who battled foul trouble all game, scored 19 points
and Jarron Collins shot 12-of-13 from the foul line for 18 points.</LD>
<LD>   The Jazz had lost five of six games, including consecutive blowout
losses to Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   Utah took advantage of the absence of Alonzo Mourning, who stayed
at the team hotel with flu, and shot 54.5%, a season-best mark for
the Jazz and by a Heat opponent,</TE>
<TE>   Rod Strickland scored 16 points and Eddie Jones had 12, but made
only three of 16 field-goal attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Jones had scored at least 20 points in a season-high six
consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   The Heat lost for the second time in its last nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Miami cut the lead to 86-81, the closest margin since the first
half, on Eddie House's jumper with 6:43 to play.</TE>
<TE>   But John Stockton made a jumper and Collins and Malone added pairs
of free throws. After Jimmy Jackson's bank shot, Russell sealed the
win with a three-point shot with 2:32 remaining to make the score
95-83.</TE>
<TE>   Without Mourning in the middle for the Heat, the Jazz drove the
lane often for layups and easy jumpers on kick-out passes.</TE>
<TE>   When it didn't score, the Jazz was often fouled going in.</TE>
<TE>   Utah made 36 of 44 free throws, while Miami was 18 of 21.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz put guard John Crotty on the injured list with tendinitis
in his left knee and planned to sign Rusty LaRue to a 10-day contract
today.... The New Jersey Nets signed guard Anthony Johnson and
forward Donny Marshall for the rest of the season.... Vin Baker's
availability to the Seattle SuperSonics this week is in question
because of a badly bruised left shoulder. Baker can't lift his left
arm over his head and is listed as questionable for tonight's game
against Portland.</TE>

<HD>Monarchos Is Retired</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He ran the second-fastest Kentucky Derby in history, but Monarchos
will race no more. Injured in a gallop Sunday at Gulfstream Park, the
4-year-old colt has been retired and will begin a stud career next
month, owner John Oxley announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Preparing to run in the $500,000 Donn Handicap at Gulfstream on
Feb. 9, Monarchos suffered a tendon injury near his left front ankle.
At first John Ward Jr., his trainer, thought that Monarchos had just
nicked himself, but an ultrasound examination showed that the injury
was more serious.</LD>
<LD>   "We had high hopes about this horse from the start," Oxley said.
"He fulfilled all the hopes and dreams we've had after being in this
business for 30 years."</LD>
<TE>   The gray colt won last year's Derby in a time of 1:59 4/5 for the
11/4 miles, missing Secretariat's 1973 record by two-fifths of a
second.</TE>
<TE>   In the Preakness two weeks later, Monarchos never reached
contention and finished sixth. He was third in the Belmont, but
beaten by 13 lengths. Point Given won both of those races.</TE>
<TE>   It was not a good week for the Ward barn at Gulfstream. The day
before Monarchos was injured, Yvonne Azeff, an assistant trainer whom
Ward credited with helping develop the Derby winner, was crushed when
her stable pony fell on her during training hours. Azeff, 41, who
rode on the California fair circuit when she was a jockey, was still
in a coma Monday.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry, the popular gelding voted horse of the year in 1981
and 1984, had about three feet of his intestine removed during
surgery in Lexington, Ky., last Friday. John Henry, who earned $6.5
million, is 27.</TE>

<TE>   Two Cuban players sought help from a Cuban-American advocacy group
before defecting from a team that took part in the Gold Cup
tournament, an official of the organization said.</TE>
<TE>   Strikers Rey Angel Martinez, 20, and Alberto Delgado, 22,
contacted the Miami-based Cuban American National Foundation before
they decided to leave the Burbank Hilton, where the team was staying,
late Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "They told us they wanted to defect and asked for some help," CANF
Executive Director Joe Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   The men were staying with a friend in the Los Angeles area. They
met with an attorney on Saturday and were trying to obtain
identification forms, Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cuban delegation held their passports and they have no form
of identification," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian national team and coach have been fined for actions
during and after a 2-0 loss to Ecuador at the Orange Bowl in Miami
last week in a group match of the CONCACAF Gold Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Lawes, director of communications for CONCACAF, said Canada
Coach Holger Osieck was fined for "acting disrespectfully toward game
officials as well as match officials on the bench and in the
technical area."</TE>
<TE>   After the match, Lawes said, the Canadian team destroyed locker
room property at the Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "The Canadian Soccer Assn. was fined $5,000, as was the coach,"
Lawes said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been told the association is appealing its fine. It will
be reviewed by the disciplinary committee for the Gold Cup."</TE>

<TE>   Northwestern assistant football coach Mike Dunbar was named
offensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Dunbar replaces Kevin Wilson, who left Northwestern for Oklahoma
last month. Wildcat Coach Randy Walker also named defensive
coordinator Jerry Brown assistant head coach, a position Wilson had
held.</TE>
<TE>   Sprinter Jake Jensen retired from track and field after failing a
drug test, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen, of Mobile, Ala., tested positive for a banned anabolic
steroid after finishing third in a meet in Linz, Austria, on Aug. 20,
the agency said. He was suspended from competition for two years
beginning Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State will play Texas Tech in the Pigskin Classic on Aug. 24
in Ohio Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The game gives the Buckeyes 13 regular-season games and eight home
games--both for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   The Pigskin Classic could be the start of a 15-game season for
Texas Tech if the Red Raiders qualify for the Big 12 championship
game and a bowl game.</TE>

<HD>Schottenheimer, Chargers Are Close</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marty Schottenheimer and the San Diego Chargers negotiated contract
details on Monday, and a news conference introducing him as coach
wasn't expected until today.</LD>
<LD>   Amid reports that he'd agreed in principle to a four-year deal to
take over a team that has won only six games in two seasons,
Schottenheimer met for much of the day with owner Alex Spanos, team
President Dean Spanos and General Manager John Butler.</LD>
<LD>   At mid-afternoon, Alex Spanos left Charger headquarters. Asked if
he had a new coach, Spanos shrugged and said: "See you tomorrow
morning."</LD>
<TE>   Neither Butler nor Schottenheimer's agent, Tom Condon, returned
phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Schottenheimer, 58, has been the leading candidate since he was
fired by the Washington Redskins on Jan. 13, opening the way for the
Redskins to hire Steve Spurrier.</TE>
<TE>   Schottenheimer, who would be San Diego's fourth coach in six
seasons, interviewed with Butler and Dean Spanos in Las Vegas on Jan.
17.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers and Condon had hoped to have a deal done by Thursday,
after two days of face-to-face meetings in Mobile, Ala., where Butler
was scouting Senior Bowl workouts.</TE>
<TE>   But a snag developed, apparently over how much salary the Chargers
will pay Schottenheimer, who was 8-8 last year in his only season as
the Redskins' coach.</TE>
<TE>   He is owed $7.5 million over the next three seasons by the
Redskins, who fired him after he refused to surrender authority over
player personnel matters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lee Flowers blamed the Pittsburgh Steelers' failure to make the
Super Bowl on his teammates' inability to take special teams
seriously enough.</TE>
<TE>   The strong safety said that some younger players--he didn't name
names--lack the desire to be good and probably should be cut. He also
said the Steelers should begin using starters on special teams.</TE>
<TE>   Two special teams breakdowns--a punt return touchdown and a
blocked field goal return for a score--allowed the New England
Patriots to upset the heavily favored Steelers, 24-17, Sunday in the
AFC title game.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers, admittedly still upset, said the Steelers would be in New
Orleans if they had made more of a commitment to special teams.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not taking it seriously enough to be a dominating team,"
Flowers said. "We dominated most teams on defense and offense, but to
have the game before you go to the Super Bowl come down to two
returns on special teams ... is very disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, players need to buckle down and stop being babies
and blaming stuff on the coaches. They give us a plan and they're
paying us all this money, it's our job to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Denver Broncos promoted Ted Sundquist to general manager and
made former GM Neal Dahlen the team's director of football
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Sundquist, 39, a rising star in the organization, has been
director of college scouting since 1996 and in May was a candidate to
become general manager of the Chicago Bears.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not only did the New York Rangers fall to the Tampa Bay Lightning,
they watched Eric Lindros limp off with another injury.</LD>
<LD>   Nikolai Khabibulin stopped 42 shots, 22 in the third period, and
Vincent Lecavalier scored on a breakaway as the Lightning earned a
1-0 victory Monday night at New York.</LD>
<LD>   Lecavalier's goal 3:27 into the third helped the Lightning end a
three-game losing streak, and ended the Rangers' win streak at three.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Richter stopped 20 shots for New York, which scored 19 goals
in its three previous games.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers lost Lindros midway through the second period when he
sprained a ligament in his right knee when he banged knees with
Lightning defenseman Cory Sarich.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure it's frustrating," said Lindros, New York's third-leading
scorer. "It seems to be the way it's going as of late."</TE>
<TE>   Lindros, scheduled to play in the upcoming All-Star game and
Olympics, missed three December games because of a sprained right
knee, and seven others from Dec. 29-Jan. 13 after sustaining his
seventh career concussion. He is day to day.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 5, Nashville 1--Markus Naslund took over the NHL scoring
lead with a hat trick as the Canucks won at Vancouver, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   The win allowed Vancouver, 12-3-0-1 in the last 16 games, to stay
tied with the Kings for eighth place in the Western Conference
playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 4, Atlanta 2--Daniel Briere scored the tiebreaking goal
for Phoenix midway through the second period and Sean Burke had a
fairly easy night in his return to goal at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Burke, who missed seven games because of a groin strain, faced 16
shots and had to make only a handful of tough saves in his first
appearance since a Jan. 9 loss to San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 2, Chicago 1--Bill Guerin scored with 21.1 seconds left and
Byron Dafoe made 26 saves for the Bruins at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The Blackhawks are 10-12-5 on the road despite starting the night
with the second-most points in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 3, Minnesota 2--Jarome Iginla scored on a tip-in 46
seconds into overtime, leading the Flames to a victory at St. Paul,
Minn. Calgary, which started the season 13-2-2-2, has eight wins in
its last 33 games.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 4, Columbus 2--Rob DiMaio broke a tie with 7:04 to play at
Dallas, leading the Stars to their first win under interim Coach Rick
Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas ended a three-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 1, Edmonton 1--Tomas Holmstrom scored a power-play goal at
14:42 of the second period to lift the Red Wings to a tie at
Edmonton, Canada.</TE>

<LD>For a goaltender, being selected to play in the NHL All-Star game is
the most thankless honor in professional sports.</LD>
<LD>   Think about it. After earning the right to be among hockey's top
players by keeping opposing teams from scoring all season, a
goaltender is rewarded by being put in a situation where a fragile
ego could easily be crushed.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not the most fun for goalies," said King goaltender Felix
Potvin, who played in two NHL All-Star games when he was a member of
the Toronto Maple Leafs in the mid-1990s. "You have to just approach
it as a good honor.</LD>
<TE>   "You just go to the games to have fun. I don't think you are going
to be judged or anything. You are playing against the greatest hockey
players in the league. You can't worry too much about how many go
in."</TE>
<TE>   Scoring goals in bunches has become common in NHL All-Star games.
Twenty-six goals were scored in last season's game, an All-Star
record.</TE>
<TE>   "You wish the game featured more defense," said Potvin, who was a
starter for the Western Conference in the 1994 All-Star game played
at Madison Square Garden. "It would be more fun for goalies ... but
with the tough schedule that we play, it's become a point that
everyone approaches the game just to have a good experience. The fans
enjoy seeing a lot of goals scored. There are so many good players in
the league, you get a chance to see them make plays and score goals.
What more can you ask?"</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always this way.</TE>
<TE>   When the league last held its all-star game in Los Angeles at the
Forum in 1981, the final score was 4-1 and the most valuable player
was a goaltender, St. Louis' Mike Luit.</TE>
<TE>   "The game itself was good," said Dave Taylor, a King all-star in
1981. "Unfortunately we were on the losing end. We helped make
goaltender Mike Luit the player of the game. He was outstanding."</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, Luit's performance wasn't uncommon to NHL All-Star games.
He split time with Philadelphia's Pete Peeters and they combined to
stop 24 of 25 shots. A goaltender may face that many shots in one
period Saturday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Until 1989, there had been only four All-Star games with more than
10 goals scored. Since then, there has been only one game in which
there have been less than 14 goals scored.</TE>
<TE>   "The game is a lot more wide open today than it was back then,"
Taylor said. "There's not as much emphasis on defense."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the NHL has had several all-star game formats.
Starting in 1947, the defending Stanley Cup champions played a group
of all-stars, but that changed to an East vs. West format in 1969.
The league switched to a Campbell Conference vs. Wales Conference
setup in 1975 with special all-star games against the Soviet Union in
1979 and 1987.</TE>
<TE>   The league's current North America vs. the World all-star format
began in 1998 and has averaged 16 goals.</TE>
<TE>   Goaltenders aren't alone when it comes to yearning for the old
'low-scoring' days.</TE>
<TE>   "The game itself was better then," Hockey Hall of Fame broadcaster
Bob Miller said. "It was lower scoring without a lot of hitting. I
broadcast the game on radio in 1981 and then did another game in
Montreal in [1993].</TE>
<TE>   "The game I did in Montreal, the score was 16-6. Every time I
looked down to write who scored, someone else scored."</TE>
<TE>   According to Potvin, look for more of the same Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the one game in a season that is a little different than any
other night," he said. "You just want to see an enjoyable game as
long as it is not a blowout. When a game is close no matter what the
score, that's a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Starting From Scratch</TE>
<TE>   Imagine where the Mighty Ducks would be without Coach Bryan
Murray, who picked up his 500th victory last week.</TE>
<TE>   When General Manager Pierre Gauthier picked Murray to take over
the dismal Ducks after last season, few around Southern California
were excited. After all, the Florida Panthers had fired Murray only a
few months earlier and who could blame Duck fans for wanting a
higher-profile coach?</TE>
<TE>   But Murray seems to be a perfect fit. His positive outlook and
patience has helped him keep the offense-challenged Ducks together
despite the team's numerous deficiencies.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been great," team captain Paul Kariya said. "He's been
through a lot and has a lot of experience. I don't think he has gone
through a streak like this before, with so many one-goal games. He
has kept the focus on team-oriented things....</TE>
<TE>   "It helps that your coach respects you and is trying to teach you
to become a better player."</TE>
<TE>   Kariya can speak from experience, having seen other styles.</TE>
<TE>   "Other coaches might throw their stick in the stands or yell at
you to get off ice," he said. "When things aren't going well, he
stops and teaches."</TE>
<TE>   As usual, Murray took his latest accomplishment in stride.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought when I was young guy coaching college hockey ...
that I'd ever be in the league let alone have this number of wins,"
Murray said. "I'm real proud of that and certainly real proud of a
lot of the players who played for me over that time."</TE>
<TE>   Tired Act</TE>
<TE>   When players tune out a demanding coach, there's no turning back.
Just ask former Dallas Star coach Ken Hitchcock, who was fired last
week in a surprise move pulled off by team management.</TE>
<TE>   The warning signs had been floating around Dallas for weeks and
after more players began to complain about Hitchcock's refusal to
change, it was time for him to go even though he is the only coach to
lead the Stars to a Stanley Cup championship.</TE>
<TE>   "He can go out in Frank Sinatra style, saying 'I did it my way,'"
said former Star and current Calgary assistant Brian Skrudland. "Now
it's up to those players, who I imagine have prompted a large part of
the decision and why the change was made."</TE>
<TE>   Dallas will attempt to regroup under assistant coach Rick Wilson,
who was promoted to Hitchcock's job and is expected to keep it at
least until the end of the season.</TE>
<TE>   If Wilson can't turn things around and get the Stars to play up to
their capabilities, Dallas is expected to go after Guy Carbonneau, an
assistant with Montreal and a former Star, once the season is over.</TE>
<TE>   That would not be a surprise to Canadien General Manager Andre
Savard.</TE>
<TE>   "Guy has done excellent work for our organization and we don't
want to lose him, that's for sure," Savard said. "If the Stars ever
contact me to see if he's available, I'll be in a delicate situation.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an unwritten rule in sports that you don't stand in the
way of someone taking a step upward. At least that's how it works in
the NHL. Happily, we're not at that point."</TE>
<TE>   If the Stars do decide on Carbonneau, it will be interesting how
he deals with Star forward Brendan Morrow, who is engaged to his
daughter and is planning to get married this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Line Shift</TE>
<TE>   All you can do is hope the best for Pittsburgh winger and former
King Kevin Stevens, who left the Penguins nearly three weeks ago and
is undergoing counseling for an undisclosed problem, according to
Pittsburgh General Manager Craig Patrick.</TE>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Stevens sought help for
an unspecified behavioral problem at a facility in New York. Stevens
was required to go through the NHL's substance-abuse program after
being arrested two years ago in suburban St. Louis on a crack cocaine
possession charge.</TE>

<HD>Robinson Is Fired by the Devils</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No more Mr. Nice Guy, and the New Jersey Devils have only themselves
to blame.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Robinson was fired as the Devils' coach on Monday with the
club struggling to make the playoffs less than a year after coming
within a victory of winning consecutive Stanley Cups.</LD>
<LD>   The easygoing Robinson was replaced by former Pittsburgh Penguin
coach Kevin Constantine, a noted disciplinarian.</LD>
<TE>   Constantine will make his debut tonight against the Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   "This team needs a coach of Kevin's personality, structure,
discipline and accountability," General Manager Lou Lamoriello said.
"The players are underachieving. They know why and I'll leave it at
that."</TE>
<TE>   Perennially one of the NHL's strongest teams, the Devils
(21-20-7-3) are in ninth place in the Eastern Conference, one spot
out of a playoff position.</TE>
<TE>   The Devils have been inconsistent all season.</TE>
<TE>   Good games have been followed by bad games, and the players have
shown little spark no matter how much Robinson has tried.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody says that I'm too soft to be a coach," Robinson said.
"Well, if that means I have to change the person that I am, to coach
a club, then maybe that's not what I want to do."</TE>
<TE>   So, Lamoriello made the coaching change, the second major switch
in the NHL in less than a week. Ken Hitchcock, who led the Dallas
Stars to Stanley Cup finals in 1999 and 2000 (winning in 1999), was
fired last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I still think Larry's an excellent coach," Lamoriello said.
"Larry did everything and anything he possibly could. They [players]
weren't responding on a consistent basis."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit captain Steve Yzerman will miss up to two weeks after
having arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. Yzerman expects to
play at least a couple of games for the Red Wings before playing in
Canada's first game in the Salt Lake City Olympics on Feb. 15.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings called up forward Sean Avery, who played 13 games
earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dallas forward Jere Lehtinen will undergo arthroscopic surgery on
his left knee today, causing him to miss this weekend's All-Star
game. Lehtinen will have loose cartilage removed in what is
considered a minor operation. Lehtinen is expected to recover in time
to play for Finland in the Olympics next month.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida assigned center Byron Ritchie to Lowell of the American
Hockey League.... Calgary recalled forward Jason Botterill from Saint
John of the AHL and sent forward Oleg Saprykin to Saint John....
Phoenix reassigned goaltender Patrick DesRochers and center Jason
Jaspers to Springfield of the AHL.</TE>

<HD>Olympics to Get More Security</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The federal government agreed to send about 50 more security officers
to the Salt Lake City Games, the top Olympic security officer said
Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft agreed with local law enforcement
officials that more security was needed in one undisclosed area
outside the venues, said Robert Flowers, the commander of the Utah
Olympic Public Safety Command.</LD>
<LD>   "We're talking about enhancing something that is already there,
not creating something new," Flowers said. "Where we have four
officers it would be nice to have six."</LD>
<TE>   When Ashcroft visited Salt Lake City earlier this month, Flowers
said a local law enforcement person brought the area to his attention
at a briefing.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft agreed the area was of concern and agreed to find more
security personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers said he was surprised at Ashcroft's response because he
had believed there were no more federal bodies available for the
17-day games.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take as many as they can give us," Flowers said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have open shopping areas downtown and other places people will
be enjoying. It's like they're giving us another bottle of water on a
long hike. We don't need it but it's nice to have."</TE>
<TE>   Flowers said other than this area, Ashcroft was satisfied with the
security planning effort by state, local and federal officers.</TE>
<TE>   More than 60 agencies are involved in Olympic security, including
city police and fire departments, statewide agencies such as the
Department of Health, as well as the FBI and Secret Service.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1996 Olympics at Atlanta, one person was killed when a pipe
bomb exploded in Centennial Park. Flowers said that area had a large
number of people--90,000--who were not checked for explosives. There
is no comparable area at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Flowers said all Olympic-related venues have as much security as
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking about securing a worldwide event across four
counties, with a million people here," he said. "It's difficult to do
and we would could use a few more resources."</TE>

<DH>Patriots: Coach will wait to announce Super Bowl starting
quarterback.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Mum's the word with Bill Belichick.</LD>
<LD>   The New England Patriot coach declined to name a starting
quarterback for the Super Bowl and dodged the question when asked if
he had made a decision. He plans to wait until after Wednesday's
practice to announce whether the job belongs to Tom Brady--who
suffered a sprained ankle in Sunday's victory at Pittsburgh--or Drew
Bledsoe.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm just not in a position to do it right now," Belichick said at
a news conference. "I know that I want to try to help you out on
that."</LD>
<TE>   Whether Belichick is itching to help the media is debatable. But
Patriot linebacker Tedy Bruschi understands the hesitancy to name a
starter, especially considering how well Bledsoe played in relief.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a tough decision that I'm glad I don't have to make,"
Bruschi said. "I think a lot is riding on how [Brady] is feeling. I
talked to Tom on the bus yesterday; he said he's feeling good--the
ankle's a little swollen. But he's getting treatment on it, [he]
keeps getting it raised on the plane and in the buses, doing the best
he can to get back.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'Tom, whatever guy is in there, Drew or you, we feel
confident that we can win the game.'"</TE>
<TE>   Ram Coach Mike Martz said he is expecting Bledsoe to start, based
on reports Brady suffered a high-ankle sprain, which is especially
tough to overcome. "My experience is it takes four to six weeks [to
recover]," Martz said.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe, who had not played in 126 days and lost his job after
suffering a chest injury against the New York Jets, completed 10 of
21 passes for 102 yards and a touchdown against the Steelers. He was
so overcome, TV cameras caught him wiping away tears near the end of
the game.</TE>
<TE>   And he wasn't the only one.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know is I had tears in my eyes," guard Mike Compton said.
"I squatted down as time ran out and I cried. It's just
unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Neither quarterback was made available to the media Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Brady was the starter Nov. 18 when the Patriots lost to the Rams,
24-17, throwing for 185 yards with two interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The way Ram defensive players see it, Brady is better at buying
time with his feet and releasing the ball quickly; Bledsoe stays in
the pocket longer and will take a big hit if he has to.</TE>
<TE>   "Brady is more of an improvisational quarterback," safety Kim
Herring said. "He'll move around and try to find a throw downfield,
whereas Bledsoe will either take a sack or just throw it away."</TE>
<TE>   Patriot receiver Troy Brown said Brady can throw harder but
sometimes has problems taking heat off his passes.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom sometimes gets a little too jacked up and throws a short ball
too hard," he said. "We've been doing a good job of making plays on
it. But he's been getting better as the season went on. You know Tom
was a baseball player, so he gets the ball back there, and you can't
see it until it comes out of his hand.</TE>
<TE>   "Drew's got that [Dan] Marino-type release where you can see the
ball the whole time."</TE>
<TE>   Through all the tumult, Brady and Bledsoe have remained friends,
even though a recovered Bledsoe was visibly upset in October, the day
he learned Belichick was sticking with Brady for the rest of the
season. Brady wound up making the Pro Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Although Brady and Bledsoe are friends, they have vastly different
temperaments on the field. Bledsoe is the calm, tested veteran who
already has Super Bowl experience. And his counterpart?</TE>
<TE>   "Brady is young, and he has a lot of years left in the NFL,"
Compton said. "It's like he's still in college. This is the Rose Bowl
for him."</TE>

<LD>Bottles sailed. Trash rained. Danger flew.</LD>
<LD>   Angered by an official who made a call against their team, fans
littered the playing surface with debris, causing a delay of the
game.</LD>
<LD>   Cleveland Stadium in December?</LD>
<TE>   No, Staples Center on Saturday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The unsophisticated, unruly fan behavior we find so reprehensible
in distant towns occurred right down the street, when angry King fans
cluttered the ice and caused a 10-minute delay in the final moments
of a 4-2 loss to the Colorado Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   Two dumpsters and one wheelbarrow worth of trash. Clutter that
could have stuck into the ice and injured a player. Junk that could
have wounded another fan.</TE>
<TE>   It was just as awful as that nationally celebrated December
disturbance by Brown fans, with one exception.</TE>
<TE>   The Browns and their fans were vilified.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings and their fans have been all but applauded.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction has been as if while one group was soiling the
stately image of professional football, the other was simply
following the natural rhythms of hockey.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly during a week when the NHL's most skilled players
will be gathering at Staples Center, it is an expectation that is
unfair to the sport and this city.</TE>
<TE>   Look at the differences.</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland incident resulted in 14 arrests.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings reported no arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Brown officials were so badly ripped for not immediately
criticizing their fans, one day later they retraced their steps and
issued heaping condemnations.</TE>
<TE>   King officials didn't criticize their fans either, yet nobody
cared.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if I hadn't called them Monday, two days after the
incident, they might never have criticized their fans.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the game, Coach Andy Murray said, "I thought the
fans were great tonight. I think they were just like us. They were
frustrated."</TE>
<TE>   Granted, he had been ejected from the game just before the debris
incident and was in the locker room at the time, but surely some one
must have told him.</TE>
<TE>   A day later, given another chance to talk about the fans with a
cooler head, Murray said, "They thought we were getting hosed, and
that was their reaction. For me to criticize the fans for being
supportive, I don't think I can do that."</TE>
<TE>   One of Murray's most admirable traits--and there are many--is that
he rarely disowns any of his controversial or critical statements.</TE>
<TE>   But come on. Insisting that breaking the law and endangering
players and fans is "supportive"? Who does he think he is, Al Davis?</TE>
<TE>   Before Murray could say something else that would make parents
afraid to take their children to a hockey game, I called his boss.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Tim Leiweke, King president, condemned the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, though, it took him three days to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a reputation here of our fans not getting that worked up,
so I loved it that we were so emotional," he said. "But I hated that
they showed it in that way."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "Throwing things on the ice is wrong.... This is not
going to happen again.... This is not a trend.... We will not let it
happen."</TE>
<TE>   So what if his coach doesn't necessarily agree?</TE>
<TE>   "I know Andy agrees," Leiweke said. "He is just saying it in
different words."</TE>
<TE>   So I called Murray and gave him a chance to use those words.</TE>
<TE>   "After the game, I wasn't sure what happened," Murray said from
Denver. "I can't condemn the support of the fans, but throwing stuff
on the ice is wrong. It's never right. You can't do that."</TE>
<TE>   It was good to hear. But after three days, it was a little stale.</TE>
<TE>   I was not at Staples Center on Saturday. But watching it on
television was close enough. It was the worst behavior by any of our
fans since Aug. 10, 1995, and you remember that.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Lasorda was ejected from a Dodger game in the ninth inning,
then souvenir baseballs came flying from the Dodger Stadium stands.</TE>
<TE>   The situation became so dangerous, the umpires declared a forfeit
and gave the St. Louis Cardinals, leading 2-1 at the time, a victory.</TE>
<TE>   Said Lasorda afterward: "I'm disappointed in the ones who threw
the balls."</TE>
<TE>   Said General Manager Fred Claire one day later: "It's a feeling of
sadness for everyone involved."</TE>
<TE>   Is it too much to expect all of our sports leaders feel the same
way under the same circumstances?</TE>
<TE>   Shouldn't these people understand that, at times, they aren't only
leading the players, but also the fans?</TE>
<TE>   Granted, the Kings have the most passionate, persevering fans in
town. They have endured bad owners, bad trades, more than three
decades with only one appearance past the second round of the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   It is understandable that, when so blatantly jobbed by officials
Saturday, they would want to vent.</TE>
<TE>   But they are this town's most knowledgeable fans. And here's
guessing that most of them understood that venting with that water
bottle would only make things worse.</TE>
<TE>   Here's guessing most of them are like Andrew Jamner, a Los Angeles
businessman who has held season tickets for 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   He loves the game. He knows the game. But on Saturday afternoon,
for the first time, he was frightened at a game.</TE>
<TE>   "When stuff started coming out of the stands it was bizarre, it
was scary," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To make it worse, Jamner and wife Elizabeth had brought their
two-month old daughter to the game. Elizabeth clutched Isabella to
her chest while the trash landed on the ice beyond them.</TE>
<TE>   "We were watching our backs," Jamner said. "Andy was right, the
Kings got hosed. But there's no excuse for throwing things."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps down deep, the Kings are afraid to condemn the behavior of
a fan base they have worked so hard to cultivate.</TE>
<TE>   But they should understand that to even implicitly condone that
behavior is not a tribute to those many thousands who weren't
breaking the law.</TE>
<TE>   It is an insult.</TE>

<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>My Super Bowl diary: Day 1</LD>
<LD>   NEW ORLEANS--The last thing Sports Editor Bill Dwyre told me
before he began another vacation was not to write about Georgia
Frontiere every day at the Super Bowl, or he would force me to return
to L.A. before the end of the week.</LD>
<LD>   Now ordinarily I would just write Georgia Frontiere, Georgia
Frontiere and Georgia Frontiere, stick a thumb in each ear, wiggle my
fingers, have someone take a picture, send it to Dwyre, get on the
next plane, find the golf course where Dwyre is playing and take my
punishment like a man by finishing the round with him.</LD>
<TE>   But as you know, the NHL All-Star game is in L.A. this week, which
is even a better reason than a Super Bowl to leave town, so I intend
to be on my best behavior and make no mention of Georgia Frontiere.</TE>
<TE>   Now had Dwyre not made such a stern point about not writing about
Georgia Frontiere, I would probably have chronicled Georgia
Frontiere's appearance on stage at the awards ceremony after Sunday's
NFL championship game when she told everyone she played every play in
the NFC championship game, adding that she was "feeling weak in the
knees."</TE>
<TE>   (I know what you're expecting here--but no way am I going to put
myself in the position of having to go to that All-Star hockey game.)</TE>
<TE>   Since I can't write about it, I can only hope you were watching
when Georgia Frontiere showed the national TV audience the Super Bowl
ring the Rams won two years ago, which Georgia Frontiere had designed
to cover two fingers at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   As you know, she gave the fingers to all of America to see,
holding them high in the air while trying to explain how the ring can
expand and do other wonderful things, before Fox broadcaster Ron
Pitts cut her off. I guess we know who husband No. 8 won't be.
(Sorry--old habit).</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, I'm here for the week--the whole week--and there's so much
more important stuff to tell you about, so I promise--no more Georgia
Frontiere.</TE>
<TE>   Did you know that St. Louis Coach Mike Martz's dog is a dachshund
named "Buddy"? The St. Louis Post Dispatch, in what had to be an
exclusive, reported Buddy will not be making the trip to New Orleans,
which is certainly going to disappoint reporters who regularly cover
the Chargers and Lions, which would have given them an edge on
everyone else trying to interview the dog.</TE>
<TE>   That reminds me, as soon as I left town the Dodgers scheduled a
get-acquainted media session Monday with Brian Jordan. I don't bite.</TE>
<TE>   I can even be downright friendly. I called New Orleans-area
resident Steve Rosenbloom to catch up on old Ram times and to ask if
he'll be getting together with his stepmother, you know, Georgia
Frontiere.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope not," Rosenbloom said, and I asked if he was under similar
orders from Dwyre not to talk about Georgia Frontiere, and he said he
was free to do as he pleased, so it wasn't as if I could stop him.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenbloom, son of Carroll Rosenbloom, who owned the Rams and was
married to Georgia when he died in a drowning accident, was fired a
short time after by his stepmother.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any relationship with her," Steve said. "I talk with
my half-brother and half-sister because none of this is their fault.
We can't help who our parents are."</TE>
<TE>   On that uplifting note, I made my way to the media center to
officially begin the week of hype, and the first person I ran into
was Jim Rome, L.A.'s very own Jim Rome on the run from the NHL
All-Star game just like me. I agreed to go on his radio show because
the folks in Nebraska listen, and I wanted to ruin their day.</TE>
<TE>   And I'll tell you this, if Barry LeBrock ever has one of those bad
hair days, my first pick to replace him as host on "The SIMERS Show"
will be Rome. I think it would be a good boost for his career.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving Rome, I ran into Steve Brener, L.A.'s very own Steve
Brener on the run from the NHL All-Star game just like me. Brener
does public relations work for the NFL, and while he's the guy who
could probably get me close to national anthem singer Mariah Carey at
Thursday's press conference, it probably wouldn't look good on his
resume if that prompted Carey to have another nervous breakdown.</TE>
<TE>   As part of my job, I read some of the NFL's press releases--happy
to see fans will not be allowed to bring "weapons, explosives or
strollers" into the Superdome. The NFL, however, is allowing 22
cannons inside to blast four million pieces of confetti on the
winners. The losers have to pick up the confetti.</TE>
<TE>   I noticed the cannon-confetti folks are based in Van Nuys, so I
called spokesman Kerry Millerick, and you guessed it, about six
Artistry in Motion employees intend to get out of town before the NHL
All-Star game, and join me at the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   There's so much security here you can't go anywhere without being
patted down, which should make the walk down Bourbon Street later
tonight very interesting. A good reporter goes where the news is, and
from what I can tell here there's more interest in the opening of
Gennifer Flowers' new night club in the French Quarter than the
arrival of the Rams and Patriots.</TE>
<TE>   I'd still rather interview Mike Compton or Adam Timmerman and
learn more about offensive line play in the big game, so that's why
I'll be going to the bar now being run by Bill Clinton's former
mistress--figuring that's where the players will be.</TE>
<TE>   I'm told Flowers' barroom was once the location of a restaurant
staffed entirely by Asian transvestites, and before that a brothel.
That's not how I remember it the last time I was here, but maybe I
just wasn't paying attention.</TE>

<HD>Esperanza Is Lovein His Stellar Play</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Whenever Mark Lovein steps on the court for Anaheim Esperanza High,
the students ought to be chanting, "UN-der-RA-ted."</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-8 junior is one of the best-kept secrets in Orange
County basketball.</LD>
<LD>   Averaging 20 points and 11 rebounds, Lovein is a 16-year-old with
a bright future.</LD>
<TE>   It's surprising one of the high school basketball powerhouses
hasn't sent out one of its talent scouts to gauge Lovein's interest
in transferring.</TE>
<TE>   That's how it seems to work these days--show potential at an
under-publicized program, then abandon friends and teammates right
when you start getting good. Except Lovein says he isn't going
anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning is everything right now in high school basketball," he
said. "I think it should be more about community. I grew up in Yorba
Linda and you should build a team by what you have and not by
bringing people in or having people from our area go to different
schools."</TE>
<TE>   Lovein has played varsity since his freshman year, with Coach John
Cyrus working hard to develop his potential.</TE>
<TE>   "When you suggest something to try, he does it," Cyrus said. "You
have to take some chances and risks to grow."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Lovein weighed 225 pounds. This season, he's a lean
205, thanks to trading late-night burgers for fruit.</TE>
<TE>   "The healthier diet has made a dramatic difference. He's in the
best shape of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was weighted down [last season]," he said. "I wasn't
able to jump very high or play to my full capability. I'm able to run
the court and not get tired. I can play the whole game hard. I've
lost a lot of fat. I feel my body hasn't gone through all its
changes."</TE>
<TE>   If Lovein can add more strength and keep improving his three-point
shooting, he'll have a chance to play college basketball.</TE>
<TE>   He already has shown he can perform well in big games. This season
for the 14-9 Aztecs, he scored 16 points against Newport Harbor and
28 points against Claremont, two quality opponents. He's among the
top players in the always competitive Sunset League.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, Lovein is still trying to gain attention.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think many people have heard of me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Lovein plans to join Rockfish, a travel team that
will allow him to test his skills against players with college
aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   He has great confidence in Cyrus, a sixth-year coach who's always
offering advice.</TE>
<TE>   "A coach knows what he's doing," Lovein said. "That's why he has
the job. Why not listen to him?"</TE>
<TE>   Cyrus wants his players to succeed, but success isn't always
measured in wins and losses.</TE>
<TE>   "We follow rules and if you don't, there's consequences," he said.
"It's about helping them grow up to become young men."</TE>
<TE>   Lovein has a 3.5 grade-point average and possesses the work ethic
to keep improving.</TE>
<TE>   "I love basketball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last Thursday, he went to Pauley Pavilion to watch the
UCLA-Stanford game.</TE>
<TE>   It was a chance to envision himself in a college atmosphere. He's
confident that if he keeps improving, he'll have the opportunity to
fulfill his goal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Lingua of Canyon Country Canyon was a soccer player who knew
little about football when he went out for the team last fall.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, he leaves for a visit to Fresno State and is expected
to accept the school's offer of a football scholarship, completing a
meteoric rise in a sport he's still learning.</TE>
<TE>   Lingua will become a punter for the Bulldogs. Credit Canyon Coach
Harry Welch for bringing Lingua to the attention of Fresno State
Coach Pat Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Welch put together a highlight video of Lingua's punts.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes his leg is equal to what they are in the NFL," Welch
said. "His leg strength is incredible."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All-City guard Steve Smith of Woodland Hills Taft demonstrated
he's in basketball shape, scoring 29 and 35 points in consecutive
games last week. Smith sat out the first month this season to rest
his knees from football.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, a junior receiver, will be pursued intensely by USC and
UCLA this year. That former Taft quarterback Brandon Hance is
transferring to USC from Purdue helps the Trojans. Smith's father
said last week that his son is "leaning" toward USC because of Hance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Torey Lovullo, 36, who played baseball for Van Nuys Montclair
Prep, UCLA and in the major leagues for eight years, has been hired
as manager of the Cleveland Indians' Class-A team at Columbus, Ga.</TE>

<KH>COUNTDOWN TO THE OLYMPICS: 10 Days Until the Games</KH>
<HD>Setting Up Another Street Festival</HD>
<DH>Skiing: Former Olympic champion has recovered from
devastating injuries and hopes to go out in style after the Salt Lake
City Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Picabo Street has literally gone from Triumph (Idaho) to triumph and
experienced more than a redheaded tomboy from a two-hitch town could
ever have imagined.</LD>
<LD>   She has bagged two Olympic medals--silver and gold--two World Cup
downhill titles, a world championship and all that comes with the
spoils: wealth, fame and a Nike contract.</LD>
<LD>   Her collection also includes an array of surgical scars, including
one she calls her "Bride of Frankenstein," a 10-inch zipper that runs
along her left thigh.</LD>
<TE>   This gruesome flesh wound came via Crans Montana, Switzerland, the
result of a Friday the 13th spill in a World Cup race only a month
after Street stunned the world by winning gold in super-giant slalom
at the 1998 Nagano Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   The Crans crack-up should have ended all talk of skiing for the
red, white and blue in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Street's career should have been over the second she slammed into
that fence, shattering her left femur and blowing out her right knee.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought maybe it was done for her," recalls Herwig Demschar,
U.S. women's team coach at the time and one of the first persons to
reach her at the accident site.</TE>
<TE>   The injuries cost Street two seasons on the World Cup circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, here she is, four years later, after plunging into physical
rehab and out of depression, after watching another World Cup
compatriot lose her life on a mountain, ready to risk it one last
time at the Salt Lake Games.</TE>
<TE>   The obvious question, of course, is, 'Why?'</TE>
<TE>   Gold medal?</TE>
<TE>   Has that.</TE>
<TE>   Legacy?</TE>
<TE>   Secured.</TE>
<TE>   Personal life?</TE>
<TE>   Recently engaged to be married.</TE>
<TE>   Finances?</TE>
<TE>   Set.</TE>
<TE>   Nike deal?</TE>
<TE>   Just did it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not coming back to prove myself as an athlete to myself or
anyone else for that matter," says Street, who is expected to retire
from ski racing after the Salt Lake City Games. "That's not why I
have returned. I have returned because I don't want to walk away from
the sport on anyone's terms but my own, and that includes the fence."</TE>
<TE>   This is not the same freckle-faced dervish who burst on the scene
in 1994, sucking oxygen out of every room she entered en route to
winning a silver medal in the downhill in Norway.</TE>
<TE>   Street is 30 now, street smart. In her life as a downhill racer,
she has dished and taken it, plowing through sets of coaches,
teammates, boyfriends, joys and traumas.</TE>
<TE>   She is now more pragmatic than precocious--with time comes wisdom.
Her smile still lights a room but it is more of a long burn. Street
has been heightened and hardened by reality, like a cop who has
walked the beat a few years.</TE>
<TE>   That she sometimes slips into talk of fatalism might be expected,
given the treacherous backdrop to her life's story. In 1994, Street
was leading the pre-Olympic race at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany,
in which Austrian star Ule Maier was killed. Street watched from
below on a video screen as Maier tumbled and struck her head on a
timing box.</TE>
<TE>   Last October, French star Regine Cavagnoud died after a freak
accident in which she collided with a coach during a training run.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times when I'm siting on a chair lift when I think
about Ule and I think about Regine," Street says. "To be honest, I'm
not afraid of dying. I'm not afraid of death, obviously. To do what I
do I couldn't be.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid of the people I'll leave behind. What they'd go
through. Maybe that's a warped reality, I don't know. But that's me.
That's where I live.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care about me. I can go. If I were to hit the wall and
go, immediately, ski racing, how much more perfect could it be for
me? For me. Only me, however. Everybody else? Complete nightmare.
Absolutely horrific. Just like Ule and Regine. They both died doing
what they loved, but they left all of us behind to be sad and to
wonder why. And I guarantee you, every single one of us said, 'Am I
next?'"</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to link this Street to the sailor-tongued girl who
was ski-booted off the ski team in 1990 for insubordination, the girl
who preferred suds to sit-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Who could have envisioned she would develop the fortitude and
discipline to become an Olympic champion and mount against-all-odd
comebacks not once, but twice?</TE>
<TE>   "She has matured a lot through the years," says Demschar, the
former Austrian coach who guided Street to her gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Her victory in super-G at Nagano was a minor miracle given she had
shredded left knee ligaments in a spill at Vail, Colo., in December
1996. Yet, her motivation then was vivid and clear: to return in time
for the 1998 Olympics and fulfill her dream of winning gold.</TE>
<TE>   "Nagano was definitely a godsend, a gift from above; it all just
fell in place and clicked for me," Street says.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, but the second comeback, what could possibly be in it for her
now?</TE>
<TE>   Her terrible tumble in Switzerland should have been a jumping-off
point, as she writhed in almost unbearable pain begging for an
injection that could numb her lower torso.</TE>
<TE>   Street is spiritual more than religious and saw Crans as the evil
karma that had come to counter-balance her Olympic fame.</TE>
<TE>   As she lay there, knowing her left leg had been pulverized, she
thought, "It's not the way I foresaw my career going. I thought I'd
be the tough guy that never hurt myself. I told myself if I had three
knee surgeries I was quitting."</TE>
<TE>   Crans was worse than feared. Not only would she need to have a
metal plate inserted to bracket her broken femur, it was discovered
she had blown out her right knee--the pain in her left leg was so
intense Street had hardly noticed.</TE>
<TE>   Street had twice previously blown out her left knee; now her right
knee was rubble.</TE>
<TE>   The public generally sees athletes at their best, in victory's
afterglow or staged appearances. What it doesn't often see is what
goes on behind closed doors, when Olympic ski champions return home
at age 26 in wheelchairs and need help getting to the restroom.</TE>
<TE>   Picabo Street made such a retreat in the spring of 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "I got depressed," Street says. "I really did. I sat in my room
with the blinds shut, literally, TV off, no radio, in bed, staring at
the ceiling. I slept a lot. I would cry and make myself so sad to
wear myself out so that I would sleep."</TE>
<TE>   Street says this "funk" lasted a month.</TE>
<TE>   Notions of another comeback overwhelmed her.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take so much to make it back, and I don't know if I
can pull it off," she thought.</TE>
<TE>   Street remembers precisely when the veil began to lift. It was 2
p.m., on a Sunday in May 1998. On that day, at that hour, she dragged
herself into the kitchen and wished her mom, Dee, a happy Mother's
Day.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry it took so long to get out here," Street said.</TE>
<TE>   As her physical recovery took time, so did her mental healing.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in limbo, and I don't like time in neutral," Street says.
"If I set limbo up for myself for the weekend, if it's on the agenda,
limbo's fine. But when limbo is forced on me, and I have to sit there
and endure, then I start to squirm and get upset."</TE>
<TE>   Street's second comeback road was paved by father Ron, a former
Marine-turned-1960s free spirit who, with Dee, reared Picabo and her
brother, Baba, in the rural remoteness of Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   Street was born at home, in April 1971, and it was Ron who blew
life, his mouth on hers, when "Baby Girl" turned blue on arrival.</TE>
<TE>   No one has been more engaged in Street's career than her father,
no one more possessive and proud, and it was Ron in 1998 who set down
the new law.</TE>
<TE>   In her book, "Nothing to Hide," Street recounts how her father
told her, "If you never ski again, I don't care. If you ski again and
win, I don't care. I just want you to become a healthy, whole woman
again. That's all I care about."</TE>
<TE>   She broke down and cried.</TE>
<TE>   So, the plan was set.</TE>
<TE>   "The dream was to make it to the Salt Lake Games," she says. "The
goal was to make it back on the ski team, but the mission was to get
healthy. I knew if I set the dream to make the Olympics, worst-case
scenario I'd be healthy. And that's what I promised my father."</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 27, 1999, a year and nine months after her crash in Crans,
Street was back on skis, making a leisurely run down the Sun Valley
run, Payday, on which she won her first downhill race at age 12.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Street returned to the ski team and had to claw her
way up the world rankings like some "B" team scrub.</TE>
<TE>   She wondered at times if this was the way it was going to end,
like quarterback Joe Namath limping up behind center late in his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the pain had subsided, but not the fear. Not the memory of
that bad karma in Crans. There were occasions last year when she
examined a downhill course and said, "Oh my God, how am I going to
get through this?"</TE>
<TE>   Yet, she worked through it.</TE>
<TE>   Her breakthrough came at a triple-A race last spring on the
Olympic downhill course at Snowbasin, outside Odgen, Utah. It wasn't
a World Cup race, but most of the world's top skiers had entered to
get a sneak-preview run on the Olympic course.</TE>
<TE>   Street won.</TE>
<TE>   Demschar, who left the U.S. ski team after the '98 Games to become
Alpine director for the Salt Lake City Games, knew then that Street
had a shot to make it all the way back.</TE>
<TE>   "If she's lucky, if she's smart about it, if she doesn't get
injured, I think she could be a very, very serious competitor in
Snowbasin for the Olympic Games," Demschar says.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Street has steadily improved as she works her way
toward Showtime--the women's Olympic downhill Feb. 11.</TE>
<TE>   She is not the Picabo of old, yet two top-10 finishes in World Cup
downhill races this year prove she is capable of pulling off the
improbable in her signature event. Street is ranked 12th in World Cup
downhill.</TE>
<TE>   But because she finished a lackluster 38th, 40th, 48th and 33rd in
four World Cup super-G races, Street will probably not get to defend
her Olympic title in that event. Kirsten Clark, Caroline Lalive,
Jonna Mendes and Katie Monahan have secured the four available U.S.
slots based on results. Street was not included in the super-G lineup
when the U.S. Olympic team was announced Monday, although the U.S.
does not have to make its final decision on the racing slots until
just before the Feb. 17 event.</TE>
<TE>   Super-G has never been Street's best event. Her Olympic triumph
was her only major win in the discipline, while in downhill she has
won nine World Cup races, two overall titles, a world championship
and a silver medal at the 1994 Lillehammer Games.</TE>
<TE>   She is able to "categorize" her fear again and says performing on
her home stage has become more significant since Sept. 11. She has
always been paranoid about security at big events, but says her
patriotism in the face of terrorism has "upped the ante for me."</TE>
<TE>   She says, "I would have loved nothing more than to go to New York
and been there since Sept. 11 until now, cooking burgers, or giving
massages, or washing firefighter clothes, scrubbing, doing something.</TE>
<TE>   "But this is my something. So, come February, my something better
be great. It's a different something, but it's still something."</TE>
<TE>   Those who doubted Street now think she has a legitimate chance of
pulling it off.</TE>
<TE>   "She could rewrite history," Demschar says. "I was looking at the
statistics, and everyone that does knows if you're gone from the
World Cup for two years, well, basically no one so far has made it
back on the podium.</TE>
<TE>   "But I saw her [race] at Lake Louise [Canada]. The way she is
going now, chances are she could have a very good result. At this
stage, for me, it's not a surprise anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics are, in many ways, a medal crapshoot. In Nagano,
Street won her gold by 0.01. The weather cleared and hardened the
course just before she raced from the No. 2 start position.</TE>
<TE>   There is no guarantee Salt Lake will provide another "godsend."</TE>
<TE>   Marjan Cernigoj, the current U.S. coach, says Street is still
possessed by demons at times.</TE>
<TE>   "It's normal," he says. "She got banged up in the past and she
remembers those days. It's hard to block that out totally."</TE>
<TE>   Cernigoj says it will take the right set of circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "If she's well, if it's perfect weather conditions, if she's
confident at the start and it's just a good environment for her to go
all out."</TE>
<TE>   If the conditions are poor and the light is not good?</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to see Picabo protecting herself," Cernigoj says,
"and that is the smart thing to do. This is how you survive the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Street proved in Norway and Japan she is capable of instant karma.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how to do it now; I've done it twice," she says. "I can
create it again."</TE>

<HD>Patriots Have Rams' Respect</HD>

<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>St. Louis Ram safety Kim Herring doesn't have a problem with New
England making the Super Bowl. It's just that he, like much of the TV
audience, squirmed in his seat over the controversial call in the
Patriot-Oakland Raider game.</LD>
<LD>   In that snowy showdown, an apparent fumble by Tom Brady was--after
a review of the replay--ruled an incomplete pass. That allowed the
Patriots to maintain possession, kick the tying field goal, and
eventually win in overtime.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not saying anything about that," Herring said with a smile.</LD>
<TE>   "Controversy reigned through that whole area. Naw, I'm not going
to say too much about that--but it was a fumble."</TE>
<TE>   Like Herring, teammate Tyoka Jackson was watching from the warmth
of his own living room. But he felt the Raiders' pain.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have felt sick if I was them. Sick," Jackson said. "It's
one of those things. Usually a football game doesn't come down to one
play. You can point to five, six, seven things. But that was a
heartbreaker for Oakland. But New England still had to make plays to
win the game.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is going to say that [the Patriots] don't deserve to be in
the Super Bowl, believe me. At least no one on this team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just as they did last time they made the Super Bowl, the Patriots
overcame an 0-2 start. That, linebacker Tedy Bruschi said, should
give every team hope.</TE>
<TE>   "Every team going into training camp, every fan in the NFL
cheering on their team going into training camp, the way the NFL is
now, you can realistically say, 'We've got a shot to go all the
way,'" he said. "Us being 5-11 last year, the Giants and the Ravens
not even making the playoffs the year before, and they're the two
representatives in [last year's] Super Bowl....</TE>
<TE>   "When we started 0-2, of course there was a little bit of doubt.
But we had started 0-2 before and reached this point, so there was
hope in our locker room."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patriot assistant coaches spent Monday in Foxboro, Mass., working
on the game plan and are not due to arrive in New Orleans until this
afternoon.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>'The Pit' Doesn't Swallow Bruins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oregon's McArthur Court, a.k.a. "The Pit," is one of the most
difficult venues in the nation for visiting teams. Yet, UCLA has won
two of its last three men's basketball games there, including 88-73
last season.</LD>
<LD>   As the No. 13-ranked Bruins prepare to visit Eugene on Thursday,
they don't need to be reminded of the key element of that
victory--taking an early lead. UCLA led by 12 at the half and
extended the margin to 21 in the first five minutes of the second
half.</LD>
<LD>   Oregon (15-6) is tied for first place in the Pacific 10 Conference
with USC at 7-2, but fell out of the top 25 after splitting at the
Washington schools last week. The Ducks are 11-0 at home, and their
victims at The Pit include Stanford, Arizona and California.</LD>
<TE>   Matt Barnes and Jason Kapono, the Bruins' top scorers of late,
were especially good last season at Oregon. Barnes made 10 field
goals for 21 points and Kapono had 20 points and a career-high 13
rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rico Hines practiced Monday and it appears the headaches related
to the concussion he suffered Jan. 8 are behind him.</TE>
<TE>   The senior guard played five minutes against California on
Saturday after sitting out three games and felt fine afterward.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is 10-1 with Hines in the starting lineup, but Coach Steve
Lavin said freshman point guard Cedric Bozeman will continue to
start.</TE>
<TE>   Hines does not play point guard, and when he started, Kapono moved
to that position. Inserting Bozeman into the lineup enables Kapono,
the team's leading scorer, to play on the wing and get more shot
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Hines averages less than one point, but he is regarded as the best
defensive player besides center Dan Gadzuric.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt so good to get back in a game," Hines said. "My head felt
fine. I just want to get back to playing defense, taking charges and
doing whatever I can to help us win."</TE>

<HD>Clancy's Decision Is Paying Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Part of Sam Clancy's reasoning for returning for his senior season
was to work on his overall game, making him more attractive to NBA
teams in the June draft.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-7, 240-pound power forward is getting more desirable by
the game.</LD>
<LD>   After a ho-hum nonconference schedule in which Clancy averaged
15.8 points and 9.7 rebounds in 10 games, Clancy has turned it on in
Pacific 10 Conference play.</LD>
<TE>   Through nine conference games, Clancy is leading the Pac-10 in
scoring (21.4 points) and rebounding (9.6), and is tied with teammate
Errick Craven for the lead in steals (2.44).</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone thinks Sam Clancy is just an offensive player, but he
blocks shots, he gets steals," Coach Henry Bibby said in a rare
moment of flattery. "He enjoys the press. He does some good things in
it with his big wing span."</TE>
<TE>   In USC's 90-82 victory over Stanford on Saturday, Bibby sat Clancy
early in the game for what he perceived to be a lack of effort.</TE>
<TE>   That would explain Bibby's helter-skelter substitution patterns in
the early going, when he had the likes of football
player-turned-power forward Greg Guenther in the game instead of
Clancy.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think [Clancy] was rebounding, moving or running," Bibby
said. "I wanted him to sit a bit and think about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, sitting is the best lesson for guys."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently so. Clancy finished with 24 points and 13 rebounds in
37 minutes for his league-leading 11th double-double this season. It
also was Clancy's fifth consecutive double-double, a USC achievement
last accomplished by Jaha Wilson in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   USC (15-4), which is tied for first place in the Pac-10 with
Oregon at 7-2, moved up two spots in the coaches' poll, to a
season-high No. 20.</TE>
<TE>   But the Trojans remained behind two Pac-10 teams they have beaten
already, No. 13 UCLA (14-5) and No. 15 Stanford (12-5). Arizona
(13-6), which thumped the Trojans, 97-80, was ranked 18th.</TE>
<TE>   In the Associated Press poll, the Trojans remained at No. 23,
behind No. 13 UCLA, No. 18 Stanford and No. 19 Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon dropped out of both polls.</TE>

<LD>At some point during John Michels' rookie season with the Green Bay
Packers, the days became a blur of cheeseburgers and steaks, pizza
and ice cream.</LD>
<LD>   The offensive lineman was a first-round draft pick, selected for
his quickness and technique, but at 285 pounds he was considered
small in the modern, super-sized NFL. His coaches wanted him to reach
the industry standard of 300.</LD>
<LD>   So he ate.</LD>
<TE>   "The battle became trying to eat six meals a day," he said. "It
didn't matter if I was hungry or not, I always had to put something
in my body."</TE>
<TE>   Food became so monotonous that anything different, even liver and
onions, was appealing. Each night before bed, if the bathroom scale
read a few pounds light, he went back downstairs for a box of cereal
or several peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches. The next morning, just
before weighing in at practice, he drank a nutritional shake.</TE>
<TE>   And one more thing.</TE>
<TE>   Creatine became a staple of his diet. The over-the-counter
supplement, which promises to add bulk, has come under scrutiny by a
medical community that suspects it might be linked to kidney damage.
Michels shrugs off any mention of risk, saying his coaches needed him
to protect Brett Favre from monstrous defensive ends and, if he
didn't make weight, "it could cost me my career."</TE>
<TE>   Such is the culture of a league growing by leaps and pounds. Not
only have linemen gotten bigger each season, so have running backs
and linebackers and safeties. The prototypical receiver runs like a
sprinter and looks like a tight end. While size and speed have made
the game more spectacular, an increasing number of medical
experts--and players--wonder if there is a price to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Simple physics suggest that more mass puts more stress on the
body. The resulting collisions are more violent.</TE>
<TE>   "We've forced ourselves to be bigger athletes, but our bone
structure is the same as it was 50 years ago," says Ed Cunningham,
who played for the Arizona Cardinals and Seattle Seahawks in the
1990s and now works as a television analyst. "We're getting to a
point where the norm will be catastrophic injuries--broken necks,
broken femurs--on a regular basis."</TE>
<TE>   Just as worrisome is the pressure to add pounds. While Michels
speaks of gorging himself and ingesting a potentially dangerous
supplement, others have been caught taking anabolic steroids. This
dynamic reverberates throughout football, down through the college
ranks and into the high schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the brakes were going to hit this one, really, 10, 15
years ago," New England Patriot Coach Bill Belichick said. "Each
year, you walk out there and say, 'This year's group is bigger than
last year's group.'"</TE>
<TE>   Arms Race</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham might be overstating things when he predicts more
broken necks, but the league could experience an increase in other
injuries exacerbated by players carrying more weight, the former
president of the NFL Physicians Society said.</TE>
<TE>   "Human bone and human articular cartilage has been formed to
withstand a certain degree of stress," said Dr. Pierce Scranton, who
spent 17 years as orthopedic surgeon for the Seahawks and recently
wrote a book: "Playing Hurt: Treating and Evaluating the Warriors of
the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Scranton believes large players are more at risk for non-contact
injuries, their tendons and hamstrings rupturing in the heat of
competition.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, all of a sudden, the guys who are playing these games are
325 pounds and they're running 4.75 40s and benching 525 pounds," he
said. "Their bones and joints just aren't made to withstand that."</TE>
<TE>   With collisions "equivalent to a car accident," the doctor also
expects more contact injuries ranging from concussions to pinched
nerves. San Diego Charger defensive end Marcellus Wiley suffered the
latter when he took on Terrell Davis of the Denver Broncos.</TE>
<TE>   Two months later, Wiley still has trouble turning his head.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are mountains, man, and they're fast mountains," he
said. "You can't bring them down with just an arm anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Consider the last 10 years in the evolution of the league.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring of 1991, USC offensive lineman Pat Harlow was a
first-round draft pick at 288 pounds. That seems boyish compared with
last April's highest-rated lineman, 365-pound Leonard Davis of Texas.
In the last decade, the number of 300-pounders in the NFL has
increased from 50 to 290.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 49er cornerback Ahmed Plummer learned the changing
physics of the game by practicing each day against the 6-foot-3,
226-pound Terrell Owens. Though Plummer is 191, hardly light for his
position, it's enough to make him yearn for a few more pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Wide receivers are bigger and more physical," he said. "They can
get off bump-and-run coverage because of their strength. You don't
ever want to get pushed around."</TE>
<TE>   So, while some teams still favor athletic linemen or small, fast
receivers, scouts often look for a player with, as they say, lead in
his pants. Even quarterbacks are being evaluated by height and weight
as front offices throw themselves into the arms' race.</TE>
<TE>   "If one team has a big offensive line, the other teams in that
division will draft bigger defensive players to compensate," said
Mike Golic, a former Philadelphia Eagle defensive tackle who follows
the game as an ESPN radio host. "They feel they've got to keep up."</TE>
<TE>   Needing to Gain</TE>
<TE>   This dynamic has added a twist to the traditional weigh-in before
practice.</TE>
<TE>   For years it was common to see big guys sweating in the sauna,
hoping to lose a few pounds and avoid a fine. Now, just as many
players are chugging a last-second protein shake, needing to gain.
And coaches are more accepting of guts that hang over belts.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times where you just have to hang on for dear life as
an offensive lineman," Cunningham said. "Technique is out the window.
The only thing that lets you win is that you weigh 300 pounds."</TE>
<TE>   But medical experts cite a litany of concerns related to playing
heavy. The death of Minnesota Viking lineman Korey Stringer last
summer raised questions about heat illness, a problem that can be
explained by something called the "body mass over surface area
ratio."</TE>
<TE>   In plain terms, if a 270-pound player adds 30 pounds of muscle, he
significantly enhances his body's ability to generate heat,
especially during practice or a game. But he has barely increased the
surface area of his skin, crucial to dissipating that heat. "When you
get these people who are 300 pounds and 6-foot-5, those are not good
numbers," said Robert Girandola, an associate professor of
kinesiology at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Other problems can arise over the long run.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, the heavier you are, the greater your risk of
diabetes, heart disease and other problems," said Dr. Gary Green, an
associate professor at the UCLA School of Medicine who specializes in
athletics. "High cholesterol also goes into your risk factors."</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
surveyed almost 7,000 men who had played in the NFL from 1959 to 1988
and found that linemen had a 52% greater risk of dying from heart
disease than the general population. "Anyone considering bulking up
to play football should also consider the very real threat of heart
disease,'' researcher Dr. Sherry Baron said.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to know how many current players are pushing their body
sizes to extremes. At Green Bay, Michels recalls at least two other
offensive linemen who struggled to maintain bulk, especially during
the rigors of training camp and a long season.</TE>
<TE>   The former USC star battled a metabolism that burned calories as
fast as he could stuff them in his mouth, even with lunches of four
cheeseburgers and "a ton of fries." For most people, that sounds like
heaven. For him, it was a curse. At least it kept his cholesterol and
blood pressure in check.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham wasn't as lucky. Every meal was "a stuffing situation"
as he struggled to stay at 290, his cholesterol ratio peaking at an
unhealthy 9.6. But high cholesterol was preferable to the potential
side effects of a well-known alternative: steroids.</TE>
<TE>   These banned substances have been linked to an array of health
risks, yet each season brings new rumors of widespread use. In recent
months, players ranging from Seahawk cornerback Shawn Springs to
defensive tackle Henry Taylor now with the Miami Dolphins, were
caught cheating.</TE>
<TE>   Girandola, for one, cannot imagine how so many players could have
gotten so big without steroids.</TE>
<TE>   The general population, he said, is growing at a rate of about one
or two inches and 30 pounds every 30 years. The NFL has grown that
much in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's magical," the kinesiology professor said.
"There are so many anabolic products out there, it would be naive to
think that people are not going to take something."</TE>
<TE>   Ripple Effect</TE>
<TE>   The new generation of college and pro players is making an
impression on youngsters who watch sports on television. Wiley sees a
ripple effect when he goes to Pop Warner games.</TE>
<TE>   "Those kids will be drinking sports drinks and protein shakes," he
said. "They leave the snack bar alone with those candy bars and
potato chips."</TE>
<TE>   The desire to get bigger takes on urgency when they reach high
school, where 300-pounders, once a rarity, are becoming common. This
season, Long Beach Poly had four of them. Alta Loma had three on its
offensive line.</TE>
<TE>   Better nutrition at an early age--the awareness that Wiley
witnessed--deserves some credit. More high schools have expensive
weight rooms and training personnel. Still, coaches worry about the
pressure kids put on themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like if you're not 300 pounds and not 6-foot
whatever, you're not going to make it," Upland Coach Tim Salter said
earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   Some youngsters simply increase their intake of pizza and
chocolate malts without the nutritional supplements or supervised
training that players such as Michels get in the NFL. "We get some
kids who come in so big they can't move," said Chris Carlisle,
strength and conditioning coach at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Carlisle's job is to trim the fat and replace it with muscle. The
process can take months, causing players to redshirt their freshman
seasons, but he prefers the big eaters to the ones who seek other
methods. Especially troublesome are athletes whose frames aren't
quite large enough to carry the added weight.</TE>
<TE>   Green, the UCLA professor, asks a critical question: "At some
point if your body can't get any bigger ... what do you do?"</TE>
<TE>   As chairman of the NCAA's drug testing committee, he says that
undersized teens with oversized aspirations represent a particular
risk for steroid use. Many of them end up at junior colleges and
smaller universities where, unlike big-time college football or the
NFL, there is no testing.</TE>
<TE>   For want of extra pounds, cheaters could suffer everything from
heart and liver damage to interference with reproductive functions
over the long term.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't care about an increased risk of prostate cancer when
they're 60," Green said. "Whenever there's pressure, there will
always be people who are going to cheat."</TE>
<TE>   Genetically Designed Bodies</TE>
<TE>   It's a simple equation.</TE>
<TE>   Fans want the spectacle, the speed and violence. Football teams
keep improving nutrition and conditioning techniques to remain
competitive. Some players search for ways to use
performance-enhancing substances and avoid detection.</TE>
<TE>   The result: No end in sight for the enlarging of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We look at ESPN Classic and say 'Wow, players now are so much
bigger and faster,'" Wiley said. "One day we'll be on ESPN Classic
and folks will be checking us out and saying the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   And what of the risks?</TE>
<TE>   Nutrition and training advancements that are feeding the flames
also could act as mitigating factors. Strength coaches such as
Carlisle believe they can better prepare athletes for physical
punishment. Plummer, of the 49ers, hopes the technology will catch up
to collisions on the field.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, experts are studying retired players. Having
already documented maladies among athletes who left the game in the
1960s and '70s, they expect the situation to worsen because of the
size factor.</TE>
<TE>   Some players--such as Cunningham--quickly shed 60 or more pounds
after retirement, which reduces their risk of developing problems.
But Green said others struggle with weight control, high cholesterol
and high blood pressure. Often, they are too beaten up to exercise.</TE>
<TE>   And Scranton estimates that, in coming years, every player
retiring from the NFL will suffer from arthritis or other ailments
related to substantial joint damage in the neck, lower back and
knees. He considers it inevitable with 300-pound men who can run
faster and hit harder than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   "We have cultivated a superhuman," he said. "But in the course of
doing that, they're also subjected to forces far beyond their
genetically designed bodies."</TE>
<TE>   Taking Another Shot</TE>
<TE>   Michels also has doubts about the bigger-is-better theory, though
his concerns are slightly different. He proudly recalls a time during
his rookie season when he fell ill and his weight plummeted to 269.
Playing against the St. Louis Rams, he held his own against Leslie
O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "Good feet. Used my hands," he said. "Shut him down."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Packer coaches weren't convinced, telling him to report the
next summer at 315 or 320, figuring he would lose pounds as the
season progressed. Even at 6-6, Michels believes the added bulk
robbed him of valuable endurance and quickness.</TE>
<TE>   His performance slipped, and he lost his starting spot. A torn
knee ligament wiped out the next season. By the fall of 1999, he'd
been traded to the Eagles, released and was out of football.</TE>
<TE>   His weight dropped by 50 pounds as he reveled in the freedom to go
an entire day eating only a blueberry muffin. "A beautiful thing," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, after several years working as a youth pastor and coaching at
Mission Viejo High, the 28-year-old is back in the weight room, back
at 285, preparing for another shot at the NFL. This time, he hopes to
join a team such as the Rams or 49ers who favor somewhat smaller
linemen.</TE>
<TE>   If need be, he will return to his old dietary regimen.</TE>
<TE>   He jokes about growing accustomed to NFL-style eating even as his
metabolism slows with age.</TE>
<TE>   "You watch, the day I retire I'm going to be 330 pounds and I
won't be able to shed a pound," he says. "Wouldn't that be a cruel,
sick twist of fate?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   Caution, Wide Load</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, rule changes permitted offensive linemen to extend their
elbows beyond the span of their shoulders, allowing them to hand
check when they blocked. These rule changes brought about a new era
in offensive line play, where linemen needed more bulk and less
maneuverability against the defensive line. The 300-pound players:</TE>

<HD>National Monument in Utah Proposed</HD>
<DH>Land: The move would protect the San Rafael Swell.
Environmentalists find the administration's motives suspect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush is moving to establish his first national monument,
which would protect Utah's San Rafael Swell, a dramatic sweep of desert
canyons where environmentalists have long sought stronger federal
protection.</LD>
<LD>   Utah's Republican governor, Mike Leavitt, announced in a speech Monday
evening that state and local officials will request creation of San
Rafael National Monument on a 620,000-acre expanse that was once a hiding
place for Butch Cassidy.</LD>
<LD>   A Bush administration spokesman said he could not confirm that a White
House designation is forthcoming, but he praised the fact that the San
Rafael Swell request came not from Washington bureaucrats, but from
people in Utah.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal received a mixed reaction from leading environmentalists.
They said they were surprised by the move from an administration often at
odds with them over the protection of wilderness areas. But they were
concerned that the White House might use the monument designation to
accommodate widespread off-road vehicle use and mineral development.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will be a real litmus test for the Bush administration,"
said Heidi McIntosh, conservation director of the Salt Lake City-based
Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. "If the administration really uses
this as an opportunity to do something positive and visionary, we will
support them on it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At the Sierra Club, Executive Director Carl Pope claimed the Utah
congressional delegation has made several efforts to pass what he called
"bogus wilderness protection" to allow activities that would not be
allowed in other wilderness areas.</TE>
<TE>   "This may be the real thing. But given our previous history of
bait-and-switch with the San Rafael Swell, the devil is in the details,"
Pope said.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has been sharply critical of monument designations
by former President Clinton, saying that many were done without
consulting local residents, some of whom did not welcome the restrictions
that monuments can bring.</TE>
<TE>   The San Rafael Swell proposal is different, one spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's coming from the bottom up, instead of the top down," said Mark
Pfeifle, spokesman for Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton. "The monuments
created under this administration will be created the right way, with
local community members brought into the process at the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   When asked if such praise for the proposal signified that Bush favored
a monument, Pfeifle said simply, "You certainly could read that into it."
Leavitt also hinted he expected a positive response.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Utah's congressional delegation complained bitterly in 1996
when Clinton proclaimed 1.7 million acres of canyon land in southern Utah
as the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.</TE>
<TE>   That monument and others are governed much in the manner of national
parks, with limits placed on commercial activities, such as mining and
cattle grazing, and on off-road motorized recreation.</TE>
<TE>   An advocate for off-road vehicle use of public lands, Don Amador said
he was encouraged by the proposed approach to the San Rafael monument.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly support decisions made at the local level," said Amador,
western representative for the Blue Ribbon Coalition, a national group
lobbying for multiple recreational use of public lands.</TE>
<TE>   "Our members would look forward to working with Gov. Leavitt and the
administration to craft a monument that has local input and not something
that is crafted back in Washington, D.C.," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Monuments can allow for designated trail routes for off-road vehicles,
he said. "You'd probably see access limited to designated trails. . . .
It sounds like that's an effort that's got good local support, and that's
something we've always supported, so we'll watch and see where it goes."</TE>
<TE>   The San Rafael Swell today is a popular site for off-road vehicles,
which in turn has angered environmentalists who want the canyon-climbing
ATVs controlled or even banned. Pfeifle said that both off-road
enthusiasts and environmentalists would be part of any monument planning.</TE>
<TE>   The San Rafael Swell includes sandstone arches, archeological sites,
wild horses and desert bighorn sheep.</TE>
<TE>   Located about 150 miles southeast of Salt Lake City, it is expected to
draw visitors during the upcoming Winter Olympics. In fact, local
environmental groups have been showering the media with packets featuring
the area and other Utah wilderness havens in hopes of prompting stories
about their efforts to protect such lands from off-troad vehicles, oil
exploration and development.</TE>
<TE>   Leavitt approached the Bush administration with the idea, according to
Pfeifle, the Interior Department spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Pfeifle said that if Bush does declare the land a monument, a
management plan would be assembled over 18 months to three years,
including many meetings with local residents.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Leavitt announced that in contrast to the Grand
Staircase-Escalante proposal, the San Rafael proposal grew out of seven
years of intense talks among interested parties.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no stealth proposal," Leavitt said. "We will ask President
Bush to allow sufficient notice and additional discussion before acting.</TE>
<TE>   "And you want my guess? The president will like this."</TE>
<TE>   Leavitt described the San Rafael Swell as "these 620,000 acres of
canyons, pinnacles and rock formations . . . placed in our backyard by a
generous providence, and we will now prove ourselves worthy of that

<TE>   An aide to Utah's senior senator, Republican Orrin G. Hatch, said that
the senator supports the designation of a monument because the local
people want more protection for the area, which has become very popular
in recent years and is being misused by off-road vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The aide said Hatch has been trying for years to get additional
protections for the San Rafael Swell passed by Congress, but his efforts
were bogged down in politics over other wilderness issues.</TE>

<HD>600-Mile Journey in Nowhere Land</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Scotsman sets off on foot through some of the Earth's
most forbidding terrain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HERAT, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>For breakfast Sunday morning, Rory Stewart ate four fried eggs and
a fistful of naan, the flat Afghan bread. Then he walked to the local
bazaar and bought 20 tablets of the antibiotic Cipro, two dog-eared
English-language books and a walking stick.</LD>
<LD>   Now he was ready to walk across Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Stewart, an Oxford-educated Scotsman, set out Sunday afternoon on a
600-mile walk through some of the most inhospitable terrain on Earth. He
intends to hike from Herat, in western Afghanistan, to Kabul in the east,
through snow and ice, past bandits and gunmen, wolves and guard dogs,
famine and drought.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart is fairly certain--and there are no known challengers--that he
was the first tourist to enter Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban
regime late last year. He is unquestionably the most unconventional
foreigner in these parts, with his skeletal 126-pound frame and his dream
of walking the path once taken by Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and
Tamerlane.</TE>
<TE>   His journey will take him through a region abandoned by tens of
thousands of hardy villagers who fled crop failures caused by a four-year
drought. He will have to climb as high as 12,900 feet, along ice packs
where Stewart says a Russian weather station has recorded temperatures of
40 below zero.</TE>
<TE>   When Herat's warlord, Ismail Khan, heard of Stewart's plan, his bushy
eyebrows shot up. Then he ordered two of his soldiers to walk with this
strange Scotsman for at least part of the journey. The bodyguards joined
Stewart on a dusty Herat street Sunday afternoon, toting ragged sleeping
bags and looking aggrieved.</TE>
<TE>   "These two chaps must have made some enemies," Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   Since abandoning a promising career in the British Foreign Service two
years ago, Stewart said, he has walked across Turkey, Iran, India,
Pakistan and Nepal. But the ultimate challenge, he believed, was
war-ravaged Afghanistan, where his mother traveled part of the same route
in the 1930s, albeit in a Land Rover.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart is traveling light. The only food in his backpack is a yellow
container of emergency rations dropped over Afghanistan by American
planes last fall. He said he plans to survive on bread and eggs provided
by villagers he stays with along the way.</TE>
<TE>   He carries no maps, saying he doesn't want to be accused of being a
spy. He has a few pages torn from a 1977 Afghanistan guidebook, a Dari
language dictionary, two pairs of socks, a single change of clothes and a
sleeping bag. In addition to antibiotics, he has packed chlorine tablets
for purifying water.</TE>
<TE>   His two bodyguards were carrying even less. One of them, Abdul Haq,
had stuffed his ammunition pouches with a carton of cigarettes, three
packs of biscuits and a roll of pink toilet paper. Slung over his
shoulder were a sleeping bag and an AK-47 assault rifle.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Haq said diplomatically, trudging down a dirt road in the
countryside a few miles east of Herat, "we are obliged to serve this
gentleman because our supreme commander has ordered us."</TE>
<TE>   His fellow bodyguard, Said Qasim, had two things to say:</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first time we have heard of something like this." And: "The
road is not safe."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, 29, a pale, wispy fellow with long mutton chops and a faint
goatee, said he knows that the route is perilous. "It would be a pity to
be killed, of course," he said. "But I'm willing to take that chance."</TE>
<TE>   He said his parents were horrified when he quit the Foreign Service
and are now sick with worry. Borrowing a satellite telephone from a new
acquaintance in Herat, Stewart consoled his mother in Scotland on
Saturday night. "I'll be just fine, Mummy," he said in the most assured
tone he could muster. He promised to return home to Scotland after his
anticipated six-week trek in Afghanistan--walking up from the southern
coast of England, of course.</TE>
<TE>   On the phone from Crieff, Scotland, on Monday night, Sally Stewart
confessed to a reporter that she was so terrified, she dreamed about her
son the night before. "Oh, dear--why of course I'm worried," she said.
"It seems rather frightening."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, she said, young Rory comes from a long line of
venturesome souls. His grandfather lived in Calcutta for half a century,
and his father was a British diplomat for 50 years, serving in Hanoi
during the Vietnam War. Rory himself served in Indonesia and Yugoslavia.</TE>
<TE>   "We have confidence that Rory won't do anything too terribly foolish,"
she said. "I only hope the Americans don't bomb him, like they bombed his
father in Hanoi."</TE>
<TE>   Informed in a separate phone call that his son had left Herat on foot
Sunday, Brian Stewart replied, "Oh, he's set off, has he? Well, then."</TE>
<TE>   The guidebook pages Rory Stewart is carrying are not particularly
encouraging. They quote a journal entry by the Mogul emperor Babur, who
made part of the same journey in the winter of 1506-07. Babur wrote of
snow up to the horses' stirrups, of a guide who lost his way in a
blizzard and of dragging the horses down a mountain through snow as high
as the men's shoulders. But he also reported ultimately reaching a
village of "warm houses . . . good bread and fat sheep."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart said he was inspired to walk the world during a long,
melancholy stroll in Scotland. "I suddenly thought it would be magical to
put one foot in front of the other across the world--to look back and see
my footprints stretching back."</TE>
<TE>   He spoke of the soothing rhythm of walking, the shifting landscape,
the quiet hours of reflection and inner peace. "Of course," he pointed
out, "one problem with the walking is that it doesn't really impress the
ladies."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart spent Sunday night at a police post in Shaidayee, a village a
few miles east of Herat. There, the trek was interrupted when Stewart
realized he had left letters of introduction to village chiefs, written
by one of warlord Khan's police functionaries, at a police station in
Herat. Bodyguard Haq was more than willing to catch a ride back to town
and fetch them, unloading his responsibilities on a replacement, slender
young Said Aziz.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart had hopes of bonding with his bodyguards when he heard that
their radio call sign was the name of an ancient Afghan poet. But then,
on a side trip to a local garden and shrine, a dove flew over Stewart's
head--and one bodyguard offered his rifle, shouting, "Shoot it! Shoot
it!"</TE>
<TE>   Secretly, Stewart was hoping that the bodyguards would give up soon
and go back home.</TE>
<TE>   He took note when one of them stopped at a roadside stand and
exchanged his military boots for cordovan dress shoes that were sure to
raise blisters. He considered warning the man but thought better of it.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart had a fine Sunday night, dining on roast lamb, potatoes and
buttered rice at the mud hut of the village headman. Just past dawn
Monday, he was spotted on the dirt track out of Shaidayee, headed east.
He and his bodyguards had just finished a breakfast of naan, clotted
cream and green tea.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart was walking at a fast clip, and his companions struggled to
keep pace. He wanted to make the next village before dark. He had 600
miles to cover in six weeks. He averages 27 miles a day "on the flat," he
said, and six or seven miles a day in mountain snow. His plan was to
obtain a letter of introduction from each village headman, addressed to
the next headman down the trail.</TE>
<TE>   In his brown Afghan blanket, worn like a cape in the Afghan way, and
his dark cap, he looked like a monk. The monotonous way he struck the
ground with his walking stick gave him a meditative air.</TE>
<TE>   He pounded on, one foot after the other. Step, step, step. Before the
sun had risen over the silver peaks of the Bande Baba mountains, Rory
Stewart was a faint black speck on the horizon.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Files for Chapter 11</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Debt of more than $12 billion drags down builder of
massive fiber-optic network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd., which built the world's largest
communications network under the ocean floor, sank into bankruptcy Monday
under the weight of more than $12 billion in debt.</LD>
<LD>   The Chapter 11 filing by the Beverly Hills-based company is the
largest by a U.S. telecommunications firm, and a huge setback for founder
and Chairman Gary Winnick, a feisty former bond trader who was crowned
the richest man in Los Angeles in 1999 when his Global Crossing stake
grew to be worth $6 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Winnick's push to build a vast global network was not ill-conceived,
just ill-timed, analysts say. The fiber-optics web may have ended up with
extra capacity and overwhelming debt, but now it represents a near-steal
for whoever buys it at a fraction of its cost.</LD>
<TE>   That buyer may be an investment group led by Hong Kong billionaire Li
Ka-shing that, as part of the bankruptcy filing, plans to pump $750
million into Global Crossing in an effort to keep it afloat. But that was
little consolation for the company's creditors and shareholders, who
stand to recover little, if any, of their investments.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a complete debacle . . . everyone's worst nightmare," said
Patrick Comack, an analyst at Guzman &amp; Co. "It's awful for debt holders.
It's awful for shareholders. It's a shame."</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, who will stay on as chairman for now, declined to comment.
Global Crossing Chief Executive John Legere called the bankruptcy
filing--the fifth-largest in U.S. history--"a hard decision."</TE>
<TE>   "The company at this level and size is just not able to handle the
debt," said Legere, the company's sixth CEO in the last 4 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   In its filing, Global Crossing said it had $12.4 billion in debt and
assets of $22.4 billion. Its largest creditors are investors who
purchased $6 billion in bonds and other debt securities and a group of 81
banks led by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citibank, owed about $2.25 billion,
Legere said.</TE>
<TE>   Other creditors are a who's who of telecommunications equipment
makers, including Lucent Technologies Inc., Nortel Networks Corp., Cisco
Systems Inc. and Alcatel, as well as large phone companies such as SBC
Communications Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders who held $55 billion worth of Global Crossing stock at
its peak will get nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The company's remaining 8,000 employees, including several hundred in
Beverly Hills, will not be affected, Legere said. The thousands of
recently laid-off workers, however, will not receive severance and other
benefits initially promised them.</TE>
<TE>   Comack and other analysts had hoped Global Crossing could limp through
the downtrodden market for telecommunications services by selling off
units and slashing costs.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Global Crossing cut more than 3,000 jobs, closed dozens of
offices, sharply reduced spending and moved to pay preferred dividends in
stock instead of cash to save money. But in the end, it wasn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   Legere said the company's bankruptcy filing is just part of a plan
aimed at rescuing Global Crossing. The central component is a tentative
agreement with Asian powerhouses Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.--controlled by
Li--and Singapore Technologies Telemedia, which have agreed to pay $750
million for a majority stake of undefined size in Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   If negotiations go well, Legere said, Global Crossing could emerge
from Bankruptcy Court before the end of the year. Under the worst-case
scenario, Global Crossing's assets could be liquidated and its network
shut down, leaving customers to line up space on competing networks.</TE>
<TE>   Both of the prospective Asian saviors already have close ties to
Global Crossing and its affiliated companies through overseas ventures.
Hutchison owns half of Hutchison Global Crossing, a communications
provider in Hong Kong, while Singapore Technologies owns half of StarHub
Crossing, a carrier in Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say both companies probably see the investment as a way to
secure relatively cheap access to worldwide communications networks,
which they need to serve their international corporate customers. With
the investment, the companies also would pick up Global Crossing's 59%
stake in Asia Global Crossing, a separate company that runs a valuable
communications network in Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe the core assets at Global Crossing--a nearly complete
network that covers more than 100,000 miles and connects 200 major cities
in 27 countries--could draw other bidders in Bankruptcy Court.</TE>
<TE>   The current deal with the Asian firms is not exclusive and still must
win the approval of various stakeholders and the Bankruptcy Court. Other
companies, such as Deutsche Telekom, WorldCom, SBC Communications or
Verizon Communications, may weigh in with offers, according to analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an unreasonable expectation," said Tom Soja, who heads
Boston-based telecommunications analysis firm T. Soja &amp; Associates.
"Anyone with cash, you can't rule out as a bidder, particularly if they
have customers who need that worldwide connectivity."</TE>
<TE>   The prerequisite for any buyer, though, will be a dramatic reduction
in debt, which currently costs Global Crossing about $600 million a year
in interest.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are getting hurt by this, but ironically, the fact
that they may not have debt payments anymore would make them a strong
competitor in the future," said Soja, whose firm has worked for some of
Global Crossing's bankers, as well as some of the company's competitors.</TE>
<TE>   But even if Global Crossing emerges from bankruptcy protection, as
upstart provider Covad Communications did recently, it's not likely to
help restore Winnick's once-stellar reputation as a Midas-like
businessman.</TE>
<TE>   That image helped Winnick, who worked in Michael Milken's once-vaunted
junk-bond operation at Drexel Burnham Lambert in the 1980s, raise
unprecedented amounts of money for the construction of Global Crossing's
network. In all, he raised nearly $20 billion, including money from
public stock and debt offerings as well as bank loans.</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by that cash and a stock price that soared along with many
other technology newcomers, Global Crossing became the first company to
build a vast undersea fiber-optic network without government subsidies or
the use of giant quasi-governmental consortia.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny company made itself impossible to ignore by embarking on a
buying spree that included the purchase of long-distance company Frontier
Communications, England's Racal Telecom, Cable &amp; Wireless' Global Marine
cable-laying unit and IPC Communications, a company with strong ties to
Wall Street customers.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Global Crossing made a brash bid to buy U.S. West, a
Baby Bell local phone company that ultimately went to Qwest
Communications--leaving Global Crossing with a lucrative break-up fee,
and giving stockholders (including Winnick) a chance to cash in $3.5
billion worth of Global Crossing stock.</TE>
<TE>   But there were signs of trouble along the way. Winnick proved
difficult to please, and it showed in a revolving door of executives so
active that one analyst dubbed Winnick "the George Steinbrenner of
telecommunications."</TE>
<TE>   Winnick also has drawn stinging criticism for selling huge chunks of
Global Crossing shares--grossing more than $600 million on sales of 43
million shares--before the company's fortunes, and its stock price, went
into a deep dive. Other top executives also have pocketed millions along
the way.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholder lawsuits have piled up, with 13 pending cases to date,
most of them focused on alleged improprieties in the way Wall Street
firms handled Global Crossing's public offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Trading of Global Crossing shares was halted Monday morning. The
shares fell 23 cents, or 45%, to 28 cents in early trading before U.S.
markets opened. Shares closed down 21 cents to 30 cents on the New York
Stock Exchange. Global Crossing's stock, which traded at $62 at its peak,
has fallen more than 95% in the last year, with the price languishing
below $1 for the last few months.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing is expected to post losses of $2.5 billion for 2001,
bringing cumulative losses above $4.8 billion. The company will announce
its year-end results next month.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Losing Clients, CEO Says</HD>
<DH>Probe: Joseph Berardino acknowledges errors in judgment in handling
of Enron documents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accounting giant Andersen said Monday that it is losing business in
the wake of the Enron Corp. scandal, but the company's chief executive
sought to dispel speculation that the firm would be sold or shut down.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Joseph F. Berardino said Andersen's destruction of
Enron-related papers and alleged accounting lapses are marring the
company's credibility and scaring off potential clients.</LD>
<LD>   "People who know us well continue to hire us and stand by us,"
Berardino said Monday at a news conference at Andersen's Chicago main
office. "Those who don't know us well are less anxious, frankly, to hire
us, and yes, we've lost some business."</LD>
<TE>   President Bush didn't help the company's image, joking over the
weekend that Saddam Hussein has now agreed to weapons inspections. "The
bad news is he wants Arthur Andersen to do it," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the company, until last year known as Arthur
Andersen, declined to identify specific accounts it has lost.</TE>
<TE>   But Berardino said his company committed "serious errors in judgment
in destroying documents" related to its Enron audit after the energy
trader announced it was the subject of a Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   But he added that there are 85,000 Andersen employees who "did not
work on the Enron engagement" and who are unfairly suffering from the
fallout.</TE>
<TE>   Berardino said the 88-year-old company has no intention of selling all
or part of its assets to any of the other Big Five accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   "We have absolutely no interest in going there," he said. "We feel
very confident that we can get through this, difficult as it is."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen representatives said Monday that the company may complete an
internal investigation of its auditors' conduct in the Enron collapse by
the end of the week. Berardino said his company will "make the changes
needed to maintain confidence in our firm."</TE>
<TE>   The remarks came as Andersen is taking heavy fire from all sides. The
$9-billion-a-year auditing conglomerate is the subject of dozens of
lawsuits as well as Justice Department and congressional investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting giant already has admitted that employees in its
Houston office shredded documents and e-mails after top executives knew
that the SEC was investigating Enron.</TE>
<TE>   An Andersen executive also confirmed Monday that employees outside the
Houston office that conducted the Enron audit deleted Enron-related
e-mails after the SEC probe became public.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have questioned whether Andersen's judgment as an auditor had
been clouded by the huge consulting fees generated from Enron. Andersen
received about $25 million from auditing Enron in 2000 and $27 million
from consulting. An Andersen executive told lawmakers last week that the
accounting firm gave Enron a better rating in its internal risk
assessment in 2001 than in 2000 and didn't lower the rating even as the
energy giant's problems mounted.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if his auditors had been compromised in the Enron case,
Berardino pointed to "a balance between getting to know your client [so]
you understand the business and getting too close."</TE>
<TE>   "So I don't know if we've crossed that line," he said. "What I do know
is we will, we will, get to the bottom of what people knew and the
judgments they made on the accounting, and we just aren't there yet."</TE>
<TE>   Competitors, however, see an opportunity to profit from Andersen's
image crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "We're developing a marketing plan now to figure out which niche we
want to go after," said John Knape, a senior executive at Spain, Price,
Reader &amp; Thompson, a Houston firm that provides consulting and tax
services. "There's a good possibility of recruiting talent [away from
Andersen] too."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is fighting back with a public relations blitz. The company
is set to run advertisements in major newspapers today defending its
conduct, and Berardino is expected to make a series of television
appearances this week, Andersen representatives said.</TE>
<TE>   But the face-saving may come too late, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's fate rests partly on "damage control by management, and
it's not clear to me that Andersen has done a good job on that so far,"
said Bala G. Dharan, an accounting professor at Rice University in
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they really understand the amount of reputational
damage they've had," he said. "If you look at the cartoons, if you look
at Jay Leno, it's much more pervasive than they might think."</TE>
<TE>   The company's name suffered another blow Monday as political circles
buzzed over President Bush's Andersen joke at a dinner Saturday evening.</TE>
<TE>   The remark was notable because the accounting giant and its partners
contributed more money to his campaign than Enron executives. Andersen
was the fifth-biggest donor to Bush's White House campaign, ranking it
several notches above Enron, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics. Andersen's political action committee and individual executives
contributed $146,000 to Bush's presidential run, according to records
compiled by the Washington-based center.</TE>
<TE>   D. Stephen Goddard, the managing partner of Andersen's Houston office,
made the Bush campaign's list of "pioneers," individuals who raised at
least $100,000 for the Texas governor's run for the White House. Goddard
is one of four Andersen executives who were stripped of their managerial
duties after disclosures of document shredding in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen also has been a major backer of the Republican Party,
donating more than $236,000 in so-called soft money contributions in the
2000 election cycle.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Andersen has received a more public spanking by Congress
than Enron. Andersen executives said the company plans to intensify its
political efforts, in part by providing employees with information on how
to contact lawmakers to voice support for the company.</TE>

<DH>After new legislation, Japan finally faces up to the prevalence and
horror of domestic abuse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO
</DL>
<LD>Kimiko tells her story with calm detachment. How her husband beat
her dozens of times during their 32 years together, raining blows down on
her face, thighs and stomach, pounding her back with wooden boards,
kicking her hard enough to break a rib.</LD>
<LD>   When he wasn't abusing her body, he tortured her spirit, making her
feel ugly, awkward and worthless and forcing her to attend to his every
whim.</LD>
<LD>   "I was a slave," says Kimiko, who asked that her last name not be used
out of fear that her ex-husband might track her down. "No, it was worse
than that. Even slaves have more freedom than I had."</LD>
<TE>   Until recently, abuse victims such as Kimiko were all but invisible in
Japan, ignored in a society in which laws are largely made by middle-aged
men and people learn not to notice bruises, sunglasses and other telltale
signs of domestic violence.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, however, Japan became the last major industrialized
nation to formally recognize the problem, enacting legislation aimed at
preventing such violence and protecting its victims.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly shocking for many Japanese as the issue has gained
prominence is how widespread domestic violence--known here as DV--is and
how high up the social ladder it extends in a society long proud of its
civility, refinement and understated emotions.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's first nationwide survey on the topic, done by the government
Cabinet Office in 1999, provided a wake-up call when it revealed that one
in 20 Japanese wives had suffered life-threatening violence at some point
during marriage, while four times as many had endured some sort of
physical abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Since the new law went into effect Oct. 13, complaints to police have
jumped 50%, to about 1,500 a month. Some of the cases can be attributed
to stress caused by higher unemployment, experts say, but a larger factor
in the increase appears to be a greater willingness to report abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is finally spreading that you don't have to put up with DV,
that it's all right to speak out," said Mariko Mitsui, chief of a
government Gender Equality Center in Osaka.</TE>
<TE>   Changing the law is one thing. Changing culture and social traditions
is quite another. At the root of Japan's long-standing myopia toward
domestic violence, say counselors, activists and victims, is a conspiracy
of silence, an assumption dating back to samurai days that the way a
husband treats his wife behind the shoji screen is his business.</TE>
<TE>   Japan's tepid first steps toward recognizing and treating domestic
abuse--decades after its Western counterparts--are part of a sea change
here. Experts say shifting values and social structures are gradually
empowering weaker members of society, encouraging some to question
male-dominated traditions and the often-substantial social price Japan
has paid for its material success.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people still view women as property of their husbands," said
Kazuhito Shinka, a deputy director with the central government's Gender
Equality Bureau. "There's been a view that legal issues shouldn't intrude
on the family."</TE>
<TE>   Japan found itself rather embarrassed on this count three years ago
when Shuji Shimokochi, then a 51-year-old consul general, was charged
with punching his wife in the face during a fight at their residence in
Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   Questioned by Canadian police, he reportedly dismissed the incident as
"a Japanese cultural issue," claimed that his wife deserved to be struck
and told officers that the matter was not serious. Domestic violence
experts say the mind-set of Shimokochi, who was shipped off to a think
tank affiliated with the Japanese government, is all too common.</TE>
<TE>   Noriko Yamaguchi, an official with the Batterer Intervention Assn., a
Tokyo civic group, blames in part a system that offers almost no
counseling or treatment for the abuser. Japanese men are brought up not
to show emotion or reveal weakness, Yamaguchi said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they finally do show something of themselves, it all too often
comes out through anger," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There also is a long-held misconception in Japan that domestic
violence is largely a problem of the poor and uneducated.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, it's often lawyers, policemen, bureaucrats and professionals
doing it," said Stephanie, a counselor for Japanese and foreign victims
at Tokyo's HELP Asian Women's Shelter and hotline, who asked that her
last name not be used out of concern for her safety.</TE>
<TE>   Hiroko Sato once told reporters that she had been beaten repeatedly by
her husband, former Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, who in 1974 received
Japan's only Nobel Peace Prize.</TE>
<TE>   Women's groups say the new law leaves much to be desired. It carries
no penalties, leaves treatment to a legion of competing agencies,
provides little new funding and limits restraining orders to cases of
physical abuse, not sexual or psychological damage.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, it protects only battered wives, not their children,
opening the door for husbands to grab offspring and use them as leverage.
Spousal rape, which is a crime in all 50 American states, is not illegal
here.</TE>
<TE>System of Shelters Far From Sufficient</TE>
<TE>   The nation's shelter system also is woefully inadequate. Japan plans
to set up a nationwide network of government facilities in April by
converting existing halfway houses for prostitutes. It also plans to hire
more outside counselors after complaints that bureaucrats doing the job
are cold, insensitive, even reproving of victims.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the new government shelters are expected to continue
housing prostitutes as well, adding to the social stigma felt by abused
wives. And the locations will be well known to batterers as well as
victims because the shelters are frequently in prominent government
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, the vacuum has been partially filled by about 35 nonprofit
shelters nationwide. Some are little more than an extra room in someone's
house, and most lack basic security systems. Visitors to these tiny
enclaves, when allowed in at all, are required to cover their eyes and
endure maze-like trips designed to hide the location from violent
husbands.</TE>
<TE>   "Financially, we face great difficulty," said Kazuko Hirakawa, founder
of the modest Feminist Therapy Center and shelter in Tokyo. "Compared to
the U.S., we're working with almost nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The HELP emergency shelter, located in an older neighborhood of Tokyo,
houses as many as 15 women and children. The bedrooms are small, many
lined with bunk beds. Victims are sometimes forced to double up. Yet this
is one of Japan's best and largest facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Finding the courage to leave an abusive husband and being lucky enough
to secure a spot in a shelter still leave many hurdles to be surmounted.
In Japan's recession-battered economy, women often have few skills
employers want.</TE>
<TE>   Ritsuko Nomoto, a longtime victim of domestic abuse and now a
counselor, recently started a small restaurant called Saya-Saya to give
battered women jobs, but it's a drop in the bucket.</TE>
<TE>   "Every woman thinking of leaving worries about finances," said Nomoto.
"Women find themselves forced back into abusive marriages because they
can't earn a living."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, most landlords won't rent to a single mother; such
discrimination is widely tolerated in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Over several hours, 61-year-old Kimiko, a mother of two grown
daughters, described in measured phrases her three decades of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Family court records in Japan are confidential, and Kimiko refused to
provide her husband's whereabouts, given her deep-seated fear that any
contact could lead to his finding her. She said she hopes to die without
ever speaking to him again.</TE>
<TE>   Details of her story, however, matched those provided by a longtime
confidant. Her attorney said the court agreed to handle all financial
negotiations without direct contact between the parties because of the
obvious trauma Kimiko had endured. Domestic violence counselors say
stories such as Kimiko's are increasingly common as more people seek
professional help.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want other women to avoid what I went through," Kimiko said.</TE>
<TE>   The problems started shortly after her arranged marriage in 1965 to a
hard-working, seemingly responsible man. He started breaking things--a
transistor radio, plates, a rice cooker. Then he began throwing objects
at her. Eventually, all pretense of decorum broke down as he attacked her
physically, a pattern that would define their marriage.</TE>
<TE>   At various times, he choked her, swung her by the neck and threatened
her with a kitchen knife before stabbing a box of tissues and telling
her, "Next time it'll be you."</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes he beat me once a year, sometimes several times," she said.
"If he'd been violent all the time, I would have left him much earlier."</TE>
<TE>   But the psychological abuse was unending. He was possessive and
watched her every move. He complained about the way she spoke, what she
wore, how she comported herself and the way she served meals. Virtually
every night after work, he cross-examined her about whether she had left
the house that day, when she had returned, whom she had seen.</TE>
<TE>   To make sure she stayed in the house during the day, he made her tape
a long list of television programs and called at random times. When he
was home, incoming calls were an immediate cause for suspicion. He would
drill her about who called, what they talked about, why a conversation
lasted so long. He accused her of laughing at him behind his back. A look
he didn't like was enough to set him off.</TE>
<TE>   Each night he drank, forcing her to sit attentively as he rambled on
or snapped at her, his words slurred by alcohol. She risked a beating or
verbal attack if she read, looked away or hesitated when he demanded more
sake or fresh ice.</TE>
<TE>   Once, after a rare visit to her family, she returned to find he had
cut up her clothes with scissors. Particularly humiliating was his habit
of making her kneel before him for no apparent reason.</TE>
<TE>Shame, Fear, Reticence All Protect a Secret</TE>
<TE>   Shame and fear on her part and an unwillingness to speak out--shared
by those around the couple--protected their secret. He upended a huge
cupboard one day, and the entire family--including his mother, who lived
with them--acted as though nothing had happened.</TE>
<TE>   Although neighbors in the upscale, densely populated community must
have heard the blows, crashes and screams coming from the house over the
many years, Kimiko said, they never asked what was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "It's such a delicate matter in Japanese society to intrude," she
said. "It's part of Japanese custom."</TE>
<TE>   One day, Kimiko's then-teenage daughter worked up the courage to call
the police, but Kimiko forced her to hang up, fearing her husband's
retribution. The police traced the call, and she told them her children
had been playing with the phone.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, she developed survival tactics. Foremost among these
was doing what her husband wanted, averting her gaze, remaining as
inoffensive as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Now and again, she thought about leaving, but she worried about money,
what the neighbors would think or--even well after her daughters had
moved out of the house--how it would affect the children. The prospect of
giving up everything was simply too daunting.</TE>
<TE>   "I was cornered," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even death started to look attractive.</TE>
<TE>   "I hoped that he or I would die, get cancer, have a terrible accident,
that something heavy would fall on his head," she said. "That was the
only way I could imagine getting away from the suffering."</TE>
<TE>   When her husband retired in the mid-1990s, Kimiko convinced herself
that their problems would disappear once his work stress was gone.
Instead, things got worse. His time at work had at least given her a few
hours of peace each day. Now she found herself subject to abuse for most
of her waking hours.</TE>
<TE>   Studious by nature, her husband filled his days with economics
courses, reading and playing go, a Japanese game of strategy, all on a
strict timetable. And she respected his diligence and desire to improve
himself. But he refused to extend her the same courtesy, preventing her
from attending classes or joining a club, discouraging her from seeing
friends and relatives.</TE>
<TE>   One day, he punched holes through her guitar with a large pair of
scissors and threw it out the window. About the same time, he flew into a
jealous rage after she ran into a friend, kicking Kimiko repeatedly and
breaking one of her ribs.</TE>
<TE>   Those two events convinced Kimiko to escape. Deciding to start life
over in her late 50s was incredibly difficult. But in times of doubt, she
stood before the bathroom mirror and asked herself whether she wanted to
be battered into her 60s and 70s.</TE>
<TE>   She set a date several months in advance. A brochure she had read
advised battered women to leave in warm weather, so she chose a spring
day, started reading psychology books on the sly and got in touch with a
psychiatrist. As her deadline approached, she sent a few boxes of
clothing and photo albums to close friends and relatives.</TE>
<TE>A Heart-Pounding Final Departure</TE>
<TE>   Putting money away in advance would have tipped her husband off, so
she waited until the day she left to withdraw several thousand dollars
from a savings account. That day, she dutifully prepared lunch for her
husband and his mother and left just before noon for a "dental
appointment," carrying only a small shopping bag and a day pack. Her
heart pounded as she walked out the door, terrified he would notice
something was different.</TE>
<TE>   She stayed in a shelter for five months, started receiving counseling
and attended support groups. She found a small apartment and took
vocational training courses.</TE>
<TE>   After months of searching, she found a job as a building
superintendent earning $800 a month--not enough to live on. Her lawyer
successfully pressed her husband to provide $1,050 a month in support,
and her financial dependence on him has so far kept her from suing for
divorce under Japan's less-than-generous laws.</TE>
<TE>   Kimiko remains afraid of her husband. She hasn't even told her
daughters where she is.</TE>
<TE>   But she also feels free for the first time in decades.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel so happy that I've escaped a life of terror," she said. "I'm
free. I'm free."</TE>

<HD>Davis and Foe Close in Poll</HD>
<DH>Richard Riordan is neck-and-neck in a matchup with governor, a
Times survey finds. Incumbent's image has taken a beating from energy
crisis, economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES POLITICAL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five weeks before election day, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan holds a double-digit lead over his top rivals in the GOP
gubernatorial primary and runs even with Democratic Gov. Gray Davis in a
prospective fall matchup, according to a Los Angeles Times poll.</LD>
<LD>   Republican Bill Simon Jr. seems poised to emerge as the conservative
alternative to the centrist Riordan, running ahead of Secretary of State
Bill Jones, and could do particularly well if voter turnout is low.</LD>
<LD>   But Simon and Jones lose handily to Davis in trial heats, and
Republicans overwhelmingly believe that Riordan--with his edge in name
recognition and fund-raising--is the strongest candidate the party could
put up against Davis in November.</LD>
<TE>   The survey, conducted Wednesday through Sunday, offered little good
news for the incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than half of Davis' fellow Democrats are committed to supporting
his reelection. The governor received poor marks among registered voters
for his leadership abilities and just about 8 in 10 of those surveyed
opposed Davis' solution to the state's $12-billion budget shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   On education, the signature issue of the governor's 1998 campaign,
just about half of the electorate said that schools have failed to
improve over the three years Davis has been in office; nearly 1 in 5
believe public education has actually gotten worse.</TE>
<TE>   That said, Davis ran even with Riordan among registered voters, 44% to
43%, in a trial contest for November. He handily defeated Simon and
Jones, 51% to 33%.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, too, Californians remain upbeat--a helpful environment for an
incumbent seeking reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 6 in 10 registered voters believe the state is doing well
economically and just over 2 in 5 believe California will be doing even
better six months from now.</TE>
<TE>   Californians will vote in primary elections March 5, a departure from
the traditional June primary date. Only Republicans and independents can
vote in the GOP primary. Several initiatives are also to be decided,
though none at this point looks to generate the heat of some of the
state's measures.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing the ballot descriptions, nearly two-thirds of likely
voters said they support Proposition 40, a $2.6-billion bond measure to
improve the environment and protect open space.</TE>
<TE>   Opinions were more closely divided on Proposition 45, a measure to
amend the state's legislative term limits, with 48% of likely voters
supporting the proposal and 39% opposed.</TE>
<TE>   In the governor's race, Riordan's lead over Simon and Jones was
sizable but hardly impenetrable. When a moderate turnout of likely GOP
voters was assumed, the former mayor leads the Republican field with 34%
support, followed by Pacific Palisades businessman Simon with 20% and
Secretary of State Jones with 13%.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan is hoping to expand the primary electorate by emphasizing his
centrist stand on abortion and other social issues, appealing to
independents eligible to vote in the GOP contest. Under a high turnout,
Riordan's lead widens to 37%, with Simon at 18% and Jones at 14%.</TE>
<TE>   Simon and Jones, in turn, are appealing to the party's conservative
core, convinced they are more apt to come out to vote in the state's
unusually early primary. In a low turnout election, Riordan's lead slips
to 26% to 21% for Simon and 14% for Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan appears to be benefiting the most from his wide name
recognition, as well as the eight years he spent as Los Angeles mayor.
When asked why they were supporting their candidate, nearly 4 in 10
registered Republicans said they would vote for Riordan in the primary
because of his experience in City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   His support had a definite geographic tilt. Of Riordan's Republican
backers, nearly 3 in 4 came from Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   "He seemed to do a pretty good job," Jim St. Denis, a 58-year-old San
Diego retiree and self-described "liberal Republican", said in a
follow-up interview. "What he did in L.A., he'd do for the state, I
hope."</TE>
<TE>   Among GOP hopefuls, Riordan received the highest marks among likely
Republican voters on the issues of public education, crime, the economy
and who is best equipped to handle the state's energy situation, followed
by Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, the poorest of the candidates, hopes to begin advertising in
the final stretch of the campaign, and he is not out of contention
despite his third-place standing. Close to half the likely Republican
voters who are leaning toward a candidate at this point said they may end
up changing their minds before March 5.</TE>
<TE>   But at this point, Riordan is seen as by far the most formidable
candidate to face Davis in November. Nearly half of likely Republican
voters said the former mayor would be strongest, 12% cited Jones and 11%
said Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan does face one unique hurdle: A quarter of likely voters said
he was too old to be governor. Sixty-nine percent, however, disagreed.
Riordan would be 72 by inauguration day, while Jones is 52, Simon 50 and
Davis 59.</TE>
<TE>   The former mayor's centrist message appears to be getting through to
voters. He is seen as the Republican candidate furthest to the left, with
nearly 4 in 10 GOP voters saying Riordan is more liberal than themselves.</TE>
<TE>   More than 2 of 5 of those Republicans who favor abortion rights
supported Riordan's candidacy; among opponents of legalized abortion,
Riordan and Simon were essentially tied.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, about 4 in 10 Republicans who advocate tougher gun controls
favored Riordan; GOP opponents of stricter gun laws backed Simon, 37% to
25% over the former mayor. Jones was favored by 16%.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Stolhand, a 27-year-old gun owner in the Westchester area of Los
Angeles, criticized Riordan's support for gun control while mayor.
"You've got to protect your family and your interests," said Stolhand,
who said he could never back Riordan because of his position on guns. He
is supporting Simon instead.</TE>
<TE>   Although the son of the late U.S. Treasury secretary is making his
first run for political office, Simon appears to have benefited from the
modest TV advertising he began last week, starring former New York City
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   On the Democratic side, Gov. Davis is running essentially unopposed in
his party's primary, giving him about nine months to rehabilitate his
image--time he can evidently use.</TE>
<TE>   Just 47% of registered voters approved of Davis' job performance; 45%
disapproved. And while the governor won stronger support for his tough
stance on crime, with 51% approving, he received negative marks on his
handling of the economy and, in particular, the state's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Just about half of registered voters said Davis has failed to show
decisive leadership as governor and his handling of the electricity
crunch made them less likely to back his reelection. Among the latter
were 43% of his fellow Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 in 3 registered voters said things have gotten worse in
California since he became governor; only 17% said things had gotten
better.</TE>
<TE>   "I pictured him being more forceful," said Shirley Reeder, a lifelong
Democrat who backed Davis when he ran for governor in 1998 but now wishes
she had another choice in the party primary. "It seems like he always
acts after the fact. . . . I see him doing things that will get him
votes, not always what's right."</TE>
<TE>   Davis won little support for his promise not to "advocate" new taxes
as a way of closing the state's $12.4-billion budget gap. Nearly 6 in 10
registered voters said Davis' position made no difference in how they
would vote; two-thirds said they expect the Legislature and Davis would
end up raising taxes anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Given various alternatives, 24% favored cuts in programs to close the
budget hole, 15% favored higher taxes and 52% supported some combination
of the two.</TE>
<TE>   An overwhelming 79% of registered voters rejected Davis' proposed
solution, which involves borrowing against anticipated revenues at a
potential cost of higher interest payments down the road.</TE>
<TE>   But few--only 18%--blamed Davis for the state's fiscal problems. The
biggest factor cited was the slowing economy, named by almost 3 in 10
voters. Another group, about 13%, also blamed the bursting of the
high-tech bubble and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>

<HD>Never Mind Olympics; Park City Already Full</HD>

<DL>PARK CITY, Utah
</DL>
<LD>Along with the natural splendor that surrounds Utah's best-known
ski town, something man made will greet spectators at next month's Winter
Olympics: sprawl.</LD>
<LD>   Until recently, farmland ringed this quirky 19th century mining
center. Now, tract housing hugs six miles of highway leading to Park
City. Million-dollar homes creep up the bold Wasatch Mountains. Cranes
and bulldozers clog the streets of Old Town, the heart of Park City. The
pace is so dizzying that in one short decade, the population of Park City
and the county around it has nearly doubled, making this the fastest
growing part of Utah--and one of the most rapidly growing places in the
U.S.</LD>
<LD>   The almost 100% leap in Summit County's population points to Park
City's appeal--and to the fact that this area stands out as a proud and
raucous anomaly in a stern and strait-laced state.</LD>
<TE>   Sports and partying make Park City a place where people move to have
fun at more than 100 bars and restaurants within a 20-block area.Long
ago, the Mormons dubbed the town "Sin City."</TE>
<TE>   Even the way this area has expanded--not through birth rate but
because so many out-of-staters sought its laid-back image--puts it at
odds with the rest of Utah. As host to nearly half of the events at the
XIX Winter Games, Park City hopes to show the world just how separate it
is from a state known primarily as the home of the Mormon Church.</TE>
<TE>Many Come From Southern California</TE>
<TE>   The meteoric growth has brought new sophistication, new attitudes and
new money--much of it from a stampede of Southern Californians. Some of
these non-Mormon transplants liken their adopted home to the Hong Kong of
Utah: an island of sorts at odds culturally, religiously and politically
from the state around it.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is," said city planner Myles Rademan, "we have never been
as allied with Utah as we are with Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   All the expansion has infused the local economy, creating a 72%
increase in jobs in 10 years. Manufacturing jobs alone doubled.
Construction work went up 300%. The surge in service industry jobs
boosted the Latino population by 638%.</TE>
<TE>   With so many wealthy people moving in, the mean income in Summit
County (where Park City is by far the largest town) jumped to
$42,000--against $29,000 in the rest of Utah. Summit County's population
also is the state's most highly educated.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic jams on the narrow, winding roads and a pushy metropolitan
mentality among many newcomers troubles some longtime residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago was where I wish Park City had stopped," said Karri
Hays, a 40-year-old ski racer who has lived here most of her life. "It
was perfect. You could still go down to the post office and know
everyone."</TE>
<TE>   But others said the torrent of newcomers helped preserve the town's
status as a rebel colony--a small oasis of dynamism and diversity in an
otherwise conservative state so homogeneous that it's 90% white and 70%
Mormon. Lisa Cilva Ward, an ex-Californian who is co-editor of Park City
magazine, said that instead of discussing whether to install new traffic
lights, "you hear conversations like 'how do we broaden as a community?'
"</TE>
<TE>   Some broadening of a different sort clearly is in progress as
development booms in an unincorporated area adjacent to Park City called
Snyderville Basin. Although not within town limits, condominiums and
"starter castles" alike in this basin enjoy a Park City postal
address--giving them cachet along with strong property values.</TE>
<TE>   The real Park City is small--just 7,400 year-round residents. Its
civic anchor, Old Town, boasts a village quality. The two-story wooden
houses look small. Inside, many have been elaborately redone, a
reflection of just how chic the neighborhood has become.</TE>
<TE>   Sybaritic pursuits abound. Listings for sports clubs and spas take up
several pages in the local phone book. A chairlift for the Park City ski
resort runs to the foot of Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   But the rustic charm of Main Street, Old Town's major artery, is
fading as New Age shops and funky stores are pushed out in favor of fur
salons, real estate offices and pricey boutiques.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest consequence of Park City's evolution, residents say, is
that neighbors no longer know neighbors. Dell Fuller, an airline pilot
who moved here 21 years ago from Los Angeles, said so many new people are
moving in that these days, "almost nobody in Park City is from Park
City."</TE>
<TE>   Stirrings of change began in the late 1970s, when Salt Lake City
developed as an aviation hub. Just 36 miles from the Salt Lake airport,
Park City attracted so many airline staffers that the town came to be
called a Delta ghetto. High-tech entrepreneurs chose Park City's emphasis
on recreation over Salt Lake City's focus on religion. Ski bums just came
for the snow.</TE>
<TE>   One of them, Robert Redford, set up shop nearby in an area he named
Sundance. Thousands of celebrities and film industry pilgrims annually
converge on Park City for a festival started by Redford that brings the
area millions of dollars in income and publicity.</TE>
<TE>Transition to a Year-Round Resort</TE>
<TE>   A Park City adage is that people come for the winter but stay for the
summer. The lure of year-round recreation has bolstered the town's resort
economy. Seasonal work--including a plethora of sports medicine clinics
that cater to injured athletes--now continues after the snow melts. Small
businesses are multiplying simply because the owners like the lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "If the whole world found out how really cool this place is, they'd
all come," Fuller said.</TE>
<TE>   Census figures suggest that may be what is happening. Yet while
conceding that almost 100% growth in 10 years is "tough to swallow,"
Rademan--public affairs director of the Park City Municipal Corp., one of
the town's governing boards--cautioned that even against Utah's
population of just 2.2 million, some perspective is in order.</TE>
<TE>   "The truth is that in Summit County we went from 15,000 to 30,000.
That's half a block in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   No one keeps precise tabs on how many Southern Californians have fled
here. But Realtors and movers say the majority of out-of-state buyers
come from California--mainly Los Angeles and San Diego, each a little
more than a one-hour flight away.</TE>
<TE>   "Southern California is our major market, no doubt about it," said
Steve Chin, a Realtor here who bolted from Los Angeles in 1974. The
biggest draw is quality of life: "It's safe, it's clean, there's a strong
work ethic, low crime, no earthquakes and almost no drugs."</TE>
<TE>   John Desha moved his family 10 years ago from Rancho Santa Fe to Park
City. They'd planned to stay for one winter so Desha's two children could
learn to ski. Now the children are students at the University of Utah and
Desha is a Summit County developer. Once a month, he flies to San Diego,
where he still does some business.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to talk about change, take a look at north San Diego
County," Desha said. "When I come back here, I think, 'Whoa, I'm back in
the country,' even though I'm behind 30 cars at a stoplight."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, ground will be broken on Flagstaff, a development that will add
more than 1,400 luxury residences near Deer Valley, Park City's most
exclusive address. Still more monster houses are under construction at
the Colony, near the Canyons ski resort. One home in that gated enclave
measures 35,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the big, showy homes at Deer Valley and elsewhere in Park City
will be rented during the Olympics, with corporations or affluent
individuals paying steep fees. An average home in Park City costs
$500,000, but the most extravagant residences can run from $8 million to
$10 million.</TE>
<TE>   County Commissioner Pat Cone said the money these new home buyers
bring to the area is creating a gap between Park City and the villages
around Summit County.</TE>
<TE>   "Our county's annual budget is $30 million, and there are individuals
in Park City who make more than that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The frantic pace of expansion also makes some people uneasy.</TE>
<TE>   "We all came here as renegades," said Frank Normile, an attorney who
left Los Angeles in 1994. "We identified with Butch Cassidy and the
little hole in the wall, and we found it. Then the whole world came in."</TE>
<TE>   In an area once made rich by silver, all the development has been a
gold mine. Primary residences here are taxed on 55% of their property
value. But Rademan said up to two-thirds of Park City's dwellings are
second homes, whose owners are taxed on 100% of their property's value.</TE>
<TE>   County commissioner Cone said some longtime residents are so upset
about the breakneck rate of development that they vote for regressive
candidates, hoping that will keep the growth at bay.</TE>
<TE>   To Hays, who helped found a group here called Citizens Allied for
Responsible Growth, the implications of widening income discrepancies are
most disturbing of all. But she said crowded streets and traffic jams are
pretty awful too. "It's insane," Hays said. "We've gotten so big and so
busy, it's ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   A new report from the governor's office projects that in the next 10
years, growth in Summit County will slow to a mere 60%.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Fuller, for one, said it would take one of the many bulldozers
digging house foundations to move him out of his adopted home.</TE>
<TE>   "I do more cultural things here than in all the years I lived in Los
Angeles," he said. He gazed out at blue skies over the mountains cradling
Park City, peaks dusted with a fresh coat of powdered-sugar snow.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds corny," Fuller said, "but it feels so good just to get up
here and go outside."</TE>

<HD>Diary of Russia's Gen-S (for Scumbag)</HD>
<DH>Books: Pair's bestseller is part 'Steal This Book' and part Eminem.
It captures the cliche of the modern young male.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>It was a terrible day for Spiker and Sobakkaa, two young Russian
"scumbags"--as they liked to call themselves--living in London. They
hadn't stolen a thing.</LD>
<LD>   But, recording the gloom of Day 13 in his diary of the London trip,
Spiker suddenly brightened with a memory. They had stolen! But it was
something so mundane, it had slipped his mind: some rice and chicken to
eat.</LD>
<LD>   Since the pair's 1999 London tour, podonok--scumbag--has become a term
of endearment among certain young Russians, notably soccer hooligans,
skinheads and their ilk. And the diary, which Spiker swears is 100%
nonfiction, has exploded in Moscow as a controversial bestseller.</LD>
<TE>   Though it reads at times like a how-to guide on crime and fraud, the
book took a major prize as the best Russian literary debut.</TE>
<TE>   Spiker and co-author Sobakkaa--the name is similar to the Russian word
for dog--made thousands of dollars on "Bigger Than Ben." And despite the
pleasant notoriety, Spiker--25-year-old Sergei Sakin--has decided he
quite likes making money the honest way.</TE>
<TE>   But he has to share the royalties with Sobakkaa--Pavel Tetersky in
real life--whom Sakin claims contributed almost nothing to the writing.
Tetersky hotly denies that contention. The two are no longer on speaking
terms.</TE>
<TE>   The book brilliantly captures the cliche of the contemporary young
Russian male: hard-edged, dishonest and callous, distilling his creative
flair into nefarious, if not criminal, activity.</TE>
<TE>   In a country where opportunities for young people are limited and
often governed by family connections, Sakin's example is not exactly
luminous. The one thing that can be said is that he has made it on his
own terms. Now he's waiting for Hollywood to call.</TE>
<TE>'Bigger Than Ben' Released Only in Russia</TE>
<TE>   Densely stuffed with obscure Russian street slang, the book contains a
"Clockwork Orange"-style glossary for the reader, including the entry
"podonok (scumbag): good guy."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the book has been released only in Russia. The title, "Bigger
Than Ben" (Bolshe Bena), is a reference to London's Big Ben. Sakin liked
the alliteration in the title.</TE>
<TE>   Tetersky admits that Sakin came up with the idea of turning the London
diaries into a book and edited the entries somewhat, but he insists that
he wrote half the original.</TE>
<TE>   "I was doing it just to take it back home, show to my friends and have
a good laugh about how we spent our time in London," he said, admitting
that the diary is no masterpiece and is "definitely a far cry from 'War
and Peace.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sakin's second book, due out soon, follows the themes of the first. It
details his experiences as a skinhead and as an employee at Moscow travel
agencies, where he used many dishonest tricks--for example, failing to
declare some clients to an employer and keeping the profits.</TE>
<TE>   "I always turned out to be smarter than my employer," boasted Sakin,
who said in an interview that he was never caught.</TE>
<TE>   His inspiration was his father, an honest engineer who struggled, poor
and threadbare, refusing to go into small business until he could do so
without sacrificing his principles. Sakin was determined not to live that
way.</TE>
<TE>   Replete with repellent racist nuggets and tales on how they made
hundreds of British pounds a day by stealing mobile phones and cheating
banks over loans, "Bigger Than Ben" has made Sakin financially
independent. But it came as a blow to his father and mother.</TE>
<TE>   "She said: 'I thought you were much kinder than this, much smarter and
much cleverer. You're capable of much better than this.' My father had
the same opinion," said Sakin. He shares a small Moscow apartment with
his parents and his new wife, Anna, who offered a visitor cake and said
parts of his second book make her feel physically ill.</TE>
<TE>2nd Book Reflects Muscovites' Racist Views</TE>
<TE>   Like his first book, the second reveals the ugly underbelly of racism
in Russia. Sakin despises people from the Caucasus, a predominantly
Muslim region of southern Russia, convinced that they are ruining Moscow.
It's a view many Muscovites share.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitri Lipskerov, author and co-chairman of the board for the Debut
Prize, an important Russian literary award given by a charitable trust,
argues that the references "which may be perceived as racist" do not
constitute real racism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a manifestation of the way young people overdo things," he
said. "It's an urge to attract attention."</TE>
<TE>   But he now sounds almost regretful that Sakin and Tetersky won the
prize.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually, we granted the prize to these guys as a kind of advance,
because we saw some potential in their writing," Lipskerov said. "And
also for me personally they seemed to be representing the cultural lining
of the new generation, the 20-year-olds, a generation I don't know much
about.</TE>
<TE>   "But it seems to me now that these two guys are more interested in
material gains than in writing literature."</TE>
<TE>   Sakin, however, makes no apologies for being commercial and scorns
what he calls the traditional mold of Russian writers: poor fellows with
dirty hair.</TE>
<TE>   "Bigger Than Ben" reflects a favorite Russian pastime: classifying and
stereotyping foreigners. In the book, the English are robots and cyborgs
who have an unhealthy passion for work and go around smiling all the
time.</TE>
<TE>   The book claims to have found the reason that Britons find the Russian
soul so mysterious.</TE>
<TE>   "The answer to the riddle is simple. Russians simply have a soul and
the English don't. The place of the soul in the average Englishman is
occupied by a small calculator to work out his salary."</TE>
<TE>   Sakin dropped out of university and dabbled in journalism but found it
frustratingly restrictive and boring. He and Tetersky arrived in London
with 400 pounds, or about $560, between them, which lasted less than a
week.</TE>
<TE>   "Mindful of the fact that we are scumbags and should carry this title
with honor, we committed our first theft--a stack of envelopes in order
to mail letters home," the book says.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the simplicity of the theft, the pair were sweating,
terrified.</TE>
<TE>   "Here is the trick: The huge Sobakkaa hides me from the camera with
his bulk while I shove the envelopes under my shirt. That is all.
Encouraged by our first success, I nicked a bottle of wine using the same
scheme, in order to celebrate at our housewarming party."</TE>
<TE>Writer Falls Into World of Drugs</TE>
<TE>   They had some embarrassments, like the time a bottle under Sobakkaa's
coat crashed to the floor as he waited to pay for some trifle at the cash
register. Sometimes storekeepers gave chase, "but we always outran them."</TE>
<TE>   A diary entry ponders whether their stealing was such a sin. "We are
stealing for the sake of maintaining life in our bodies, but it's stupid
to deny that it gives us pleasure."</TE>
<TE>   Though a few weeks of stealing was fun, long-term it made for an
unpleasant lifestyle, Sakin said in the interview. He could feel himself
gradually being degraded. The book tells of his spiral into heroin
addiction, which he said was the main reason he returned to Russia. He
fled to his parents' apartment in Moscow, convinced that if he stayed in
London he would wind up a drug addict, in jail or both.</TE>
<TE>   Sakin evinced no fear that he'll be denied future visas to Britain
after "Bigger Than Ben."</TE>
<TE>   "We left no traces," he boasted. And he could always argue that the
book was fiction--though both he and Tetersky are on record as swearing
it is true.</TE>
<TE>   "There is presumption of innocence," Sakin growled in
English--apparently unaware that the concept does not apply in visa
applications.</TE>
<TE>   Since "Bigger Than Ben" was published, Sakin and Tetersky have married
and moved on. Sakin's wife does not like to hear talk of his old, evil
lifestyle. And Sakin vows that he is on the straight and narrow now that
he is a writer and in great demand.</TE>
<TE>   With his first two books written about episodes of his wild young
life, one wonders where the material for future books can come from, now
that he's settled down.</TE>
<TE>   He scoffed at the question. He had seen so much in 25 years, he
boasted, it could fill 10 books.</TE>
<TE>Success Kills Co-Authors' Friendship</TE>
<TE>   Sakin expressed no regret at the loss of a friend in Tetersky. But to
Tetersky, what happened to the friendship is sad.</TE>
<TE>   "We never really quarreled. We just stopped being the kind of friends
described in 'Bigger Than Ben,' " he said despondently. "Fast popularity
spoiled him very quickly. In the past, I treated Sergei like my brother.
But I do not want to have a brother or even a friend like the new Sergei.</TE>
<TE>   "The book is there, but the friendship is gone."</TE>

<HD>Syria Faces Pressure to Halt Alleged Iraqi Oil Flow</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Britain brings up issue at U.N. committee meeting on trade
sanctions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>The United States and Britain are pressuring Syria to halt what
they say are massive illegal imports of Iraqi crude, an oil flow that
many believe is Saddam Hussein's biggest source of undisclosed and
uncontrolled hard-currency income.</LD>
<LD>   In a closed-door meeting Monday of the Security Council's committee on
Iraq trade sanctions, Britain called for a formal "clarification" of
allegations that Syria is piping in Iraqi crude in defiance of U.N.
orders. It was the first time the issue has been officially broached by
the committee, which is charged with monitoring enforcement of the
sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</LD>
<LD>   The committee plans to resume discussion of the alleged oil shipments
within the next two weeks, in what Western diplomats described as an
effort to force Syrian compliance with the sanctions. Syria did not
respond to the allegations Monday. Iraq denies that it clandestinely
exports oil to its neighbor.</LD>
<TE>   "Some members believe that smuggling is taking place," Ole Peter
Kolby, the Norwegian ambassador who chairs the committee, acknowledged
after Monday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   While the term "smuggling" suggests a clandestine contraband
operation, Western officials and industry experts say Iraq has been
sending Syria 150,000 to 200,000 barrels of oil a day through a large
cross-border pipeline since early last year. The Iraqi crude has allowed
Syria to double its own oil exports, analysts say, while providing
Hussein with half a billion dollars or more outside the U.N.'s control.</TE>
<TE>   After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the Security Council imposed strict
controls on Iraqi trade, with payments for approved imports coming from a
U.N.-administered account that is supposed to receive all income from
Iraqi crude exports.</TE>
<TE>   In November 2000, Syria reopened an old 550-mile pipeline to oil
fields in neighboring Iraq for what it said were "testing" purposes. The
tests appear to have been successful, industry analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, after reports that oil was flowing through the
pipeline, the State Department proposed to Syria that it report any
payments for overland oil shipments from Iraq to U.N. sanctions monitors.
Officials in Damascus denied that they were buying Iraqi crude--an
assertion that industry experts say may have been temporarily true, as
the pipeline was apparently shut down last January.</TE>
<TE>   Extrapolating from verified Syrian production and export figures, Iraq
has been supplying Syria with about 180,000 barrels of oil a day since
last February, calculates John van Schaik of the New York-based Energy
Intelligence Group. Although sales arrangements between Iraq and Syria
have not been disclosed, "we do know that it is sold at a steep
discount," perhaps as little as half the world market price, Van Schaik
said.</TE>
<TE>   Syria produces about 500,000 barrels of oil per day, while its daily
domestic consumption has risen to nearly 300,000 barrels, according to
U.S. government reports and private industry estimates. Yet Syria is now
exporting at least 400,000 barrels per day, industry experts and Security
Council officials concur.</TE>
<TE>   Syria could be earning $50 million or more a month from its estimated
Iraqi crude imports, with Iraq pocketing a similar amount. Some U.N.
analysts believe Hussein's government is clandestinely exporting an
additional 100,000 barrels of oil a day or more by truck to Turkey and
Jordan and by ship through the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq, meanwhile, in what is regarded by many here as an attempt to
deflect growing U.N. pressure to readmit weapons inspectors, has
unexpectedly agreed to let a U.N. human rights investigator into the
country for the first time in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Andreas Mavrommatis, the U.N. special rapporteur for human rights
issues in Iraq, will travel to Baghdad for "an exploratory mission" next
month, the U.N. announced Monday. The last time Baghdad permitted a visit
by a representative of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights was in 1992.
In April, the Geneva-based commission accused Iraq's government of
subjecting its people to "all-pervasive repression" and "widespread
terror."</TE>
<TE>   A successful crackdown on illegal oil exports could help convince Iraq
to open itself up to U.N. weapons inspections, some Western diplomats
believe.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the pipeline dispute is Syria's entry into the Security
Council this year. While Syria could obstruct an inquiry into the
pipeline, its desire to wield influence within the council on other
issues could make it open to compromise, some diplomats suggest.</TE>
<TE>   John D. Negroponte, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., raised the
pipeline issue with the Syrian government in a visit to Damascus last
week, U.S. officials said.</TE>

<HD>China Gives Smuggler of Bibles Two Years</HD>
<DH>Religion: Supporters had feared the death penalty for man charged
with shipping 33,000 copies of Scripture to mainland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>Chinese authorities on Monday ordered a Hong Kong businessman who
carried thousands of Bibles into China to spend two years in prison--a
lighter sentence than many had expected.</LD>
<LD>   Hong Kong merchant Li Guangqiang was convicted of "illegal business
activities" by a court in the southeastern province of Fujian, relatives
and fellow church members said. Two associates of Li from the mainland
were sentenced to three-year prison terms, and each of the three was
fined the equivalent of $18,000.</LD>
<LD>   The three were detained in May and indicted in December on the far
more serious charge of "using a cult to obstruct enforcement of the law."</LD>
<TE>   "We are quite relieved because he could have been sentenced to death"
if convicted of cult-related crimes, said one of Li's fellow church
members, speaking by phone from Hong Kong on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of Li's supporters protested outside the courthouse, loudly
singing Christian songs until the trial ended at midday Monday, church
members said.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong church and human rights groups welcomed the ruling as a nod
to international opinion. But some critics assailed the abrupt switch of
indictments as political manipulation of the legal system.</TE>
<TE>   "By changing charges based on political expediency, they're damaging
the seriousness of their own laws," said Frank Lu, director of the Hong
Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy. Lu,
however, also said the original charges were misguided.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, who is scheduled to visit China next month, had
expressed concern about the case. But China's Foreign Ministry dismissed
outside criticism, calling the case an internal affair and claiming to
have "incontrovertible evidence" that the materials Li transported into
China were cult publications.</TE>
<TE>   Although China allows printing of the Bible by government-approved
publishers, the case suggested to observers that Beijing considers some
versions to be cult materials.</TE>
<TE>   The accusations appear related to the fact that the Bibles are used by
the Shouters, a Protestant group outlawed by the Chinese government.</TE>
<TE>   According to the official indictment, Li had shipped more than 33,000
copies of the New Testament Recovery Version of the Bible into Fujian
province at the request of the two mainland associates, who are Shouters
members.</TE>
<TE>   The Anaheim-based Local Church publishes the Recovery Version through
its Living Stream Ministry and distributes it in the U.S. through the
group Bibles for America.</TE>
<TE>   Li is a member of the Hong Kong branch of the Local Church. Both the
Local Church and the Shouters evolved from congregations founded in China
during the 1920s by Chinese evangelist Nee Tosheng, also known as
Watchman Nee.</TE>
<TE>   China's government has tried to stamp out underground sects that, like
the Shouters, reject government management and have links to overseas
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Li's congregation disavowed any ties with the Shouters and
other Protestant groups on the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   "We have only spiritual relations with other groups. One group that
understands the Bible better may guide another group," said Li's fellow
church member. "But it's best if we don't have any contact with them at
all."</TE>

<HD>Pope Urges Lawyers to Avoid Divorce Cases</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II urged judges and lawyers to refrain from taking
on divorce cases, calling the ending of marriages a "festering wound"
that is devastating society.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the 81-year-old pontiff said, lawyers and judges should help
couples reconcile to preserve the divine "insolubility" of marriage,
which he called the cornerstone of society.</LD>
<LD>   John Paul made his comments in a speech to the Roman Rota, the Vatican
court that handles annulments. Critics from across Italy's political
spectrum expressed outrage at the pope's remarks. Lawyers groups said
they didn't think his comments would affect their work.</LD>

said.</LD>
<LD>   The Boeing 727-100 from TAME, an Ecuadorean carrier, was heading from
the capital, Quito, to Tulcan, 110 miles northeast. It crashed near
Ipiales, Colombia, just over the border from Tulcan, TAME spokeswoman Toa
Quirola said.</LD>

<HD>Israel Steps Up Patrols in Wake of Attack</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Government mulls response and seeks to learn more about
the female bomber.</DH>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israeli security forces flooded downtown Jerusalem on Monday,
taking up prominent positions on sidewalks and rooftops a day after the
latest bomb attack in the city, and the government weighed a response as
it tried to determine the political affiliation of the female bomber.</LD>
<LD>   A Palestinian man, meanwhile, was shot and killed on the outskirts of
Tel Aviv after driving his car through a roadblock, running down and
injuring an Israeli soldier and a policeman.</LD>
<LD>   The motorist's motive was not clear: Palestinian police said he was a
car thief, and Israeli police said they did not find any weapons on the
man. However, Gideon Ezra, Israel's deputy minister of internal security,
said anyone who "runs over a soldier and then a policeman . . . is a
terrorist."</LD>
<TE>   In Irtas, a Palestinian-controlled village near the West Bank town of
Bethlehem, Israeli tanks and troops arrested three Palestinian militants
before withdrawing today, sources from both sides said.</TE>
<TE>   Five tanks and several dozen troops entered the village before dawn,
encountering fire from local Palestinian gunmen, Palestinian security
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Four Palestinians were wounded in the ensuing exchange of fire, three
of them security officers and one a civilian, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army said it arrested a senior militant from the Islamic
Jihad group and two other Palestinians suspected of "involvement in
terror activities." The troops left three hours later.</TE>
<TE>   In Jerusalem, soldiers were stationed every few yards along Jaffa
Street, the busy thoroughfare where a bomber killed herself and an
elderly Israeli man Sunday. Marksmen were stationed on rooftops, and
police from the anti-terrorism unit cruised up and down the street on
motorcycles.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen people were hurt in the bombing, and more than 100 were
treated for shock.</TE>
<TE>   American Mark Sokolow, 43, who survived the World Trade Center attack
Sept. 11, was among those injured. His wife, Rina, and their daughters
Jamie and Lauren were also hurt, though none of the injuries was life
threatening.</TE>
<TE>   The family, from Woodmere, N.Y., was visiting a third daughter, who is
studying in Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard a loud whoosh, like a bang, and I kind of saw things flying
around a little bit, and then I realized I was able to get up and walk
around," Sokolow told Israeli television from his hospital bed.</TE>
<TE>   No group claimed responsibility for the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Palestinian security forces evacuated several buildings in
West Bank towns, fearing Israeli retaliation for Sunday's bombing.</TE>

demanding work Monday as President Eduardo Duhalde sought economic aid to
help the nearly bankrupt government.</LD>
<LD>   About 5,000 people crowded the Plaza de Mayo in the latest large-scale
protest against Duhalde's efforts to revive an economy mired in four
years of recession.</LD>
<LD>   Hoping to win billions of dollars in emergency aid, Duhalde dispatched
Foreign Minister Carlos Ruckauf to Washington, where he met Monday with
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.</LD>
<TE>   Ruckauf also was to meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill
and officials from the International Monetary Fund as part of a two-day
visit seen as crucial to unlocking aid for Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina reportedly is seeking at least $15 billion in IMF aid, but
the agency is demanding that Duhalde first present a "sustainable"
economic plan to reduce the country's large budget deficits.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>The Israel Airports Authority said Monday that it was investigating
a breach in security at Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv in
which a passenger flew to New York with a pistol packed in his hand
luggage.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli man realized he had been carrying the gun in his carry-on
luggage when he arrived in New York over the weekend. He immediately
informed Israeli officials of the security breach, an Israel Airports
Authority spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   "We are carrying out an internal inquiry," the spokesman said. "The
main thing is to find out whether it was a human failure or a technical
failure. We hope to get an answer. . . . It's worrying us."</LD>
<TE>   The spokesman declined to name the airline involved. But security at
Ben Gurion airport, which is usually regarded as extremely rigorous, is
the responsibility of the Airports Authority rather than individual
airlines.</TE>
<TE>   "When he arrived at the hotel, he started to sweat when he found his
personal handgun in his luggage," the spokesman said. "He went right away
to the [Israeli] Consulate [in New York]."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Japan agreed to compensate a group of 150 leprosy patients not
covered under a previous settlement.</LD>
<LD>   Under the accord, the government apologized for curtailing the rights
of patients to receive treatment under a 1953 law that forced many into
isolated sanitariums.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the government agreed to pay millions of dollars to about
500 leprosy patients.</LD>
<TE>   The new compact extends the benefits to about 150 more who were not
exiled but still suffered discrimination under the law, which was
abolished in 1996. The government will pay from $37,313 to $104,500 to
each patient or their relatives.</TE>

<HD>Australia Indicates It Might Relocate Asylum Seekers</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SYDNEY, Australia
</DL>
<LD>The government hinted today that it might close an outback
detention center and move illegal immigrants held there to other
sites--one of the key demands of asylum seekers on hunger strike at the
center.</LD>
<LD>   It was not immediately clear whether the apparent softening of the
government's position on immigration policy would affect a suicide pact
made by 11 youngsters at the Woomera camp.</LD>
<LD>   The refugees, mostly Afghans ages 14 to 17 and without parents or
guardians at the detention center, said Monday that they would attempt to
poison themselves or throw themselves onto razor wire surrounding the
camp today if their demand to be removed was not met, their lawyers said.</LD>
<TE>   Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said today that the center could
be scaled down as other holding facilities are built. Closing Woomera
outright might be possible in the future, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever approach you take, Woomera will be required for certain
contingencies and quite possibly for holding other groups of people who
have exhausted their asylum claim opportunities," Ruddock said.</TE>
<TE>   As the crisis entered its 14th day today, the government's Immigration
Detention Advisory Group recommended closing the Woomera camp, a former
missile testing base on a hot, dusty plain 1,120 miles west of Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   "Woomera is an extremely harsh environment in which to detain
anybody," said Paris Aristotle, a member of the Immigration Detention
Advisory Group.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of mostly Afghan asylum seekers are on hunger strike at
Woomera. The protesters are demanding that the government speed up their
asylum claims and move them out of the camp. Some protesters have
stitched their lips closed as part of the strike.</TE>
<TE>   Detainees at other centers across Australia have joined the hunger
strike in a show of solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   Late Monday, the detainees said some people would remove the stitches
from their lips out of respect for the Immigration Detention Advisory
Group, which is trying to solve the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Also, 22 detainees at Melbourne's Maribyrnong detention center
abandoned their hunger strike Monday after five days without food,
refugee advocates said.</TE>
<TE>   About 175 Woomera detainees have not eaten for nearly two weeks. They
have grown increasingly weak as dehydration and temperatures as high as
104 have taken their toll.</TE>
<TE>   Ruddock's comments came after church leaders and the Red Cross joined
a growing chorus criticizing the government's policy of locking up all
illegal immigrants while their asylum applications are considered--a
process that can take as long as three years.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 3,000 illegal immigrants--mainly from Afghanistan,
Iraq, Iran and southern Asia--in detention in five camps across
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference called on the
government to reassess how it deals with asylum seekers, saying its
policy is being implemented at "too high a moral cost."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross said the detainees were in crisis and their behavior
stemmed from despair.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister John Howard has refused to back down. The issue
threatens to overshadow his weeklong visit to the United States, which
starts today.</TE>

<HD>Hundreds Drown in Nigeria</HD>
<DH>Africa: Bodies pulled from canals belong to people who fled blasts
at army weapons depot.</DH>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LAGOS, Nigeria
</DL>
<LD>As onlookers wept and wailed, hundreds of corpses were pulled out
of canals here in Nigeria's largest city Monday. The victims drowned
while trying to flee explosions at an army weapons depot.</LD>
<LD>   Many victims apparently did not realize how deep the water was and
drowned after they ran or drove vehicles into the Oke Afa drainage canal,
witnesses said. They were fleeing explosions at the city's Ikeja military
base that propelled shrapnel and shock waves for miles Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   Rescue volunteer Ben Nwachukwu said more than 200 bodies had been
pulled from just one section of the canal.</LD>
<TE>   "The people who fell in here are strangers to the area," Nwachukwu
said. "They didn't know there was water until they were drowning."</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers and other rescue workers brought out between 200 and 300
bodies from the adjoining Pako canal, said local residents who helped in
the operation.</TE>
<TE>   Obtaining an accurate death toll was difficult in part because the
current in the Oke Afa canal was carrying bodies downstream. Authorities
issued no official count.</TE>
<TE>   More than 700 children in one district alone were reported separated
from their parents after the worst disaster in the city of more than 13
million since deadly political riots in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Army spokesman Col. Felix Chukwumah said the explosions began when a
fire spread to the depot, which is surrounded by crowded slums and
working-class neighborhoods. He did not know how the fire started, but a
police officer said Sunday that it began at a gas station.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of blasts sent fireballs towering over the city and shattered
windows six miles away at the international airport. The explosions
continued into the early morning Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Workers and volunteers in canoes used long poles to search for corpses
in the canals in the northern neighborhood of Isolo, five miles from the
weapons depot.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents said the tragedy could have been much worse.</TE>
<TE>   If the explosions had occurred on a weekday, about 3,000 children
would have been attending three schools that were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think those who say God is a Nigerian are correct," said a soldier
at the Ikeja barracks.</TE>
<TE>   "We are fortunate that most of the weapons were stored underground,"
he said. "Otherwise, the whole of Lagos could have been on fire."</TE>

<HD>14 U.S. Soldiers Injured in Copter Crash Landing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Fourteen soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division were injured
Monday when their transport helicopter crashed while landing in rough
terrain in eastern Afghanistan, U.S. military officials said.</LD>
<LD>   No one was killed and none of the injuries were life-threatening,
officials said. The injured were flown to a medical facility at Bagram
air base north of Kabul, the Afghan capital.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook helicopter made what officials described
as a "hard landing" near the city of Khowst, injuring 14 of the 24 people
aboard and severely damaging the aircraft.</LD>
<TE>   Officials said the cause of the early-evening accident was under
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Pentagon on Monday denied reports by Afghan villagers
that a compound raided by U.S. Special Forces soldiers last week was
actually run by non-Taliban local residents. Countering residents'
reports that civilians had been killed in the raid, Rear Adm. John D.
Stufflebeem, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said intelligence reports had determined that those inside the compound
had been Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   That assumption appeared confirmed when they fired on the U.S.
soldiers who raided the compound, north of the city of Kandahar.
Intelligence spotters had seen stolen United Nations vehicles moving in
and out of the site at night, Stufflebeem said.</TE>
<TE>   "This had the clear indications of being a legitimate military target,
based on the indicators that we had been observing over time,"
Stufflebeem said. The site was guarded "much like compounds we have seen
where Taliban and Al Qaeda have gathered before."</TE>
<TE>   Despite reports that civilian buildings were bombed, Stufflebeem said
only an ammunition depot was struck by U.S. warplanes, and it was hit
after soldiers had cleared the compound. Fifteen suspected Taliban
fighters were killed, and 27 were taken into custody.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about reports that some of the dead were bound by plastic
restraints, Stufflebeem said the Taliban soldiers had captives in
detention.</TE>

<HD>6 Al Qaeda Holdouts Killed in Afghan Hospital Battle</HD>
<DH>War: U.S. Special Forces soldiers team up with government
militiamen to overcome six guerrillas holed up since December.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>After a dramatic 10-hour battle Monday, a combined force of Afghan
government militiamen and U.S. Special Forces soldiers overwhelmed six Al
Qaeda fighters who had been holed up in a wing of Kandahar's biggest
hospital since early December.</LD>
<LD>   All six Arabs were killed in the operation, ending a standoff that had
dragged on for so long that authorities had contemplated starvation,
flooding and electrocution as ways to overcome the men.</LD>
<LD>   "They [the holdouts] are all dead," Kandahar government spokesman
Khalid Pushtoon told reporters outside the hospital a few minutes after
the small-arms fire had stopped. "They fought until the last drop of
their blood."</LD>
<TE>   The raid began before dawn with an ultimatum to surrender and ended in
the early afternoon with a 45-minute final assault that included
percussion grenades, tear gas and a hail of small-arms fire.</TE>
<TE>   Five Afghan militiamen were injured. One reportedly was shot in the
head and was taken for treatment to a U.S. military base at the Kandahar
airport about 10 miles south of the city. None of the Americans were
hurt.</TE>
<TE>   According to those involved in the battle, the assault force consisted
of about 100 Afghan militiamen and 15 American Special Forces personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans are giving the instructions," Afghan police officer
Mohammed said in an interview outside the hospital grounds during a lull
in the fighting. "Whatever they say, we do. It's a joint operation."</TE>
<TE>   One Special Forces soldier wore a New York Yankees baseball cap, while
another had an "I Love New York" button pinned to his headgear.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's battle was part of an arduous mopping-up operation to rid
Afghanistan of the remaining pockets of Taliban and Al Qaeda forces still
holding out in parts of southern Afghanistan. The operations are usually
conducted with little publicity, but Monday's action was an exception
because it unfolded near the center of the country's second-largest city.</TE>
<TE>   Special Forces Maj. Chris Miller indicated that the Arab fighters
rejected the ultimatum to surrender, then repelled an initial assault by
the U.S. and Afghan forces.</TE>
<TE>   "The Afghans fought fiercely but had to pull back and reorganize,"
Miller told reporters at the scene. "The Taliban fought to the death."
Though he referred to the dead as Taliban, they are known to be Arabs,
most likely from Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Algeria.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, firetrucks were brought in to pump water into the wards
where the Arabs were holed up, apparently in an attempt to flood them
out. Hyat Mohammed, an officer with the Kandahar provincial police, said
there had also been discussions about trying to kill the holdouts by
dropping live electricity cables into the water.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was rejected, he said, because "the Americans want to take
them alive."</TE>
<TE>   The final assault was believed to have been carried out by Afghans,
who went methodically, room to room, down a long corridor, throwing
percussion grenades and directing small-arms fire into each chamber as
they went. As the assault neared its conclusion, those outside the
hospital heard the loud "boom" of the percussion grenades, followed by a
series of pistol shots, then bursts of sustained automatic weapons fire.</TE>
<TE>   Those who viewed the scene after the fighting said at least one of the
holdouts blew himself up, while the others appeared to have died of
gunshot wounds.</TE>
<TE>   The battle ended a prolonged and tense standoff in the city's Mir Weis
Hospital that began last month when 19 Al Qaeda wounded receiving
treatment at the hospital refused to surrender after anti-Taliban forces
captured the city. Armed with grenades and at least one pistol, they
strapped themselves with explosives and threatened to kill themselves and
anyone who tried to approach them.</TE>
<TE>   Ten of the fighters quickly escaped, and two others were later lured
into a trap and captured. Another, a Yemeni, blew himself up with a hand
grenade in an abortive escape attempt Jan. 8.</TE>
<TE>   That incident came two weeks after the new government ordered a halt
to all food supplies in an attempt to starve the men out. But the order
drew criticism from the International Committee of the Red Cross and
apparently also met with resistance from some hospital staff members, who
are believed to have supplied the men with food.</TE>

<HD>Asia's New Hotbed of Moderation</HD>
<DH>Politics: Pakistan's shift away from extremist Islamic groups will
have effects far beyond its borders, many say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAHORE, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>President Pervez Musharraf's decision to reshape Pakistan as a
moderate Islamic state carries implications that extend far beyond its
borders, many people in this region believe.</LD>
<LD>   Among other things, they argue, Pakistan's new moderate course will:</LD>
<LD>   * Undercut extremist groups from throughout the Arab and broader
Muslim world that have used Pakistan as both an important support base
and a way station in the conduct of global terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   * Ease long-standing tensions in Central and Southwest Asia that in
many instances date back to the end of the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   * Give hope to political moderates in other Muslim countries as they
watch one of their own reset the course of a nation by means of a
carefully argued case against militant Islam as a social ill.</TE>
<TE>   For Pakistan itself, Musharraf's plan--outlined in an address to the
nation this month--signals an end to a quarter-century in which political
power has flowed gradually yet steadily in the direction of conservative
religious forces, turning the country into a haven for extremists.</TE>
<TE>Police Hold 2,500 With Alleged Ties to Militants</TE>
<TE>   In the last two weeks, police have rounded up 2,500 people suspected
of links to five banned militant Islamic groups. Although smaller sweeps
have occurred before, only to be followed by the release of the detainees
a few days later, the extent of the current operation and assurances from
the government that many of those taken into custody will be prosecuted
under Pakistan's anti-terrorism law have lifted the crackdown to another
level, observers believe.</TE>
<TE>   After two weeks of relative calm, those affected by the crackdown have
begun to react. On Sunday, about 2,000 religious conservatives staged a
demonstration in Peshawar, near the border with Afghanistan, demanding an
end to Musharraf's new path. In Karachi, a group called Harkat
Moujahedeen is believed to be responsible for the kidnapping Wednesday of
38-year-old Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl.</TE>
<TE>   Although some moderates worry about a greater backlash and about
Musharraf's resolve to follow through on his plan, they still view the
fast-unfolding events as a watershed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first time in the history of our country that these people
are being pushed into retreat," said Kamila Hyat, joint director of the
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. "It's going to change the way we
live and think."</TE>
<TE>   Because Musharraf's speech was timed mainly to defuse the immediate
threat of war with India--by signaling to New Delhi that he was prepared
to crack down on terrorist groups launching attacks against India from
Pakistani soil--some listeners questioned both the sincerity of Pakistani
intentions and the breadth of the initiative.</TE>
<TE>   However, reflections of the shift--including announced reforms of
hard-line religious schools known as madrasas, a noticeable easing of
long-standing constraints on intellectual debate, and apparently
broad-based public support--have combined to convince many observers that
it is not only real but highly significant.</TE>
<TE>   One example: Najam Sethi, editor of the country's most liberal weekly
newspaper, the Friday Times, said in an interview that he is suddenly
receiving invitations to address groups that once banned him as too
provocative.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing how expression has been freed," said Khaled Ahmed, a
columnist who serves as the paper's most aggressive public voice. "One
speech, and the entire nation has turned moderate."</TE>
<TE>   One Pakistan-based Western diplomat who tracks political developments
in the region is convinced that the U-turn is genuine.</TE>
<TE>   "We're watching the world's second-largest Muslim country moving from
extremism to moderation," he said. "This is hugely important."</TE>
<TE>   Others seem to agree.</TE>
<TE>   "Historic," said Secretary of State Colin L. Powell of Musharraf's
speech and the course it charted. During a stopover this month in the
Pakistani capital, Islamabad, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
called it "one of the most powerful, meaningful . . . consequential
speeches we've heard from a leader in this region for a long, long time."</TE>
<TE>   The enthusiasm is understandable.</TE>
<TE>   For the last 25 years, Pakistan has hosted an array of Islamic
militant organizations drawn first by the Muslim world's jihad against
the 1979-89 Soviet occupation of neighboring Afghanistan and later by
other causes, including resistance to Russian forces in the breakaway
region of Chechnya, to ruling Arab elites in Algeria and Egypt, and to
post-Soviet governments in Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan was also the preferred transit route into Afghanistan for
members of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist organization. Many
observers are convinced that without Pakistan's kid-glove approach toward
extremist groups, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the United
States would have been far more difficult to carry out.</TE>
<TE>   "For militants from all over the Arab world . . . Pakistan has been
crucial," said Rasul Bakhsh Rais, director of the Area Studies Center at
Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad. "Here was a large political and
social space to organize, plan, strategize, regroup or seek shelter. Now
this space is no longer available."</TE>
<TE>   Friday Times columnist Ahmed claimed that the brother of one of the
assassins of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat used to taunt Sadat's
successor, Hosni Mubarak, from his haven in Peshawar by sending Mubarak
threatening telex messages.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Arab recruits have been seen moving through the cities
of Lahore, on the Indian border, and Karachi, on the Indian Ocean,
apparently to terrorist training camps in the remote frontier areas of
Afghanistan and eventual missions beyond. About 25 Arabs were spotted
recently by one observer in the anteroom of the Lashkar-e-Taiba extremist
group's office in Lahore.</TE>
<TE>   Lashkar-e-Taiba has been linked to several terrorist operations in
Indian-controlled areas of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir and
to a deadly attack on the historic Red Fort in New Delhi in late 2000.</TE>
<TE>Extremist Groups Had Government Allies</TE>
<TE>   Evidence, mainly anecdotal, indicates that these extremist groups
often operated with the protection and tolerance--and sometimes with the
full cooperation--of the Pakistani government. One political insider in
Islamabad recalled an incident in early 2000 when senior members of
Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or ISI, sat around a table
plotting strategy at the Islamabad Hotel with the head of the extremist
Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen, Syed Salahuddin, at the same moment that Foreign
Minister Abdus Sattar was telling a news conference a few miles away that
his country had no ties with terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   The government offered such support because many of its conservative
leaders saw these groups as sharing Pakistan's national goals--such as
maintaining strong ties with Afghanistan to the west and breaking India's
grip on much of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   "Most jihadis are natural allies of the army," said former ISI
Director Hamid Gul, widely considered the midwife of Afghanistan's
Taliban regime. "They are pursuing the same objectives."</TE>
<TE>   But on Jan. 12, Musharraf rejected the extremist option and declared
these groups de facto enemies of the state.</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown on militant groups is expected to further calm tensions
in parts of Central Asia already quieted by the Taliban's demise. Nations
headed by former Soviet-era leaders had come to view Pakistan as a
troublesome accomplice to the Taliban and a supporter of extremist
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Uzbekistan, for example, claimed that an Islamic militant named Juma
Namangani had used Karachi as his starting point and the Afghan border
areas as his launch pad for a guerrilla campaign against the Uzbek
government.</TE>
<TE>   "Musharraf's new direction will provide a better understanding for
Pakistan's relations with these countries," Rais said.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of Pakistan's shift on the larger struggle between
advocates of moderate and extremist Islam is far harder to assess,
Pakistani observers believe. Newspaper editor Sethi believes that the
collapse of the Taliban and the rout of Al Qaeda have already triggered a
reassessment in the Muslim world about the limits of hard-line Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "People all over the Arab world who were drifting to the extreme are
now coming back toward the center," he said. "Musharraf has demonstrated
a state can do this too."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, note that cultural, linguistic and historical
differences are likely to diminish the impact of Musharraf's move in the
Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   Javed Iqbal Cheema, head of the Interior Ministry's National Crisis
Management Cell, which is coordinating Islamabad's crackdown against
extremists, agreed that Pakistan's new course will affect Arab
governments' thinking. But Cheema quickly echoed the sentiment of many
moderates here: The international community, he said, must work to
resolve disputes in the Middle East and Kashmir that feed extremist
sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   Cheema added that Musharraf's new policy was timed not just to defuse
the threat of war over Kashmir but also to crush extremists while they
were still reeling from the defeat of their cause in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "They are confused, in a state of shock," he said. "Now is our
chance."</TE>
<TE>   Deeper change in Pakistani society--erasing a generation's worth of
conservative religious influence in areas such as the judiciary,
education, civil service and the military--could take decades, observers
believe.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be dogged resistance," Sethi predicted.</TE>
<TE>   The extent of conservative Islam's inroads in Pakistan was illustrated
several years ago when Bashiruddin Mehmood, then a respected member of
the nation's Atomic Energy Commission, delivered a scientific paper at a
seminar proposing that the country's energy problems could be resolved by
harnessing the power of Muslim supernatural beings known as jinn. Mehmood
was arrested in October in connection with unspecified activities in
Afghanistan, though he was later released.</TE>
<TE>   Broadening both public education and the narrow Koranic focus of the
madrasas is seen by many as the key to long-term change.</TE>
<TE>   "Education is crucial," noted Anis Ahmad, a scholar at the
International Islamic University in Islamabad. "It's values that change a
society, not a police crackdown."</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Train Afghan Forces, Bush Pledges</HD>
<DH>Security: Hamid Karzai, Kabul's interim leader, meets with the
president, seeking to bolster ties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The United States will help Afghanistan develop its national army
and train its police forces, President Bush said Monday as he met for the
first time with Hamid Karzai, the head of the Afghan interim government.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's pledge deepened his administration's commitment to rebuild a
country ravaged by 23 years of war and rebellion--and most recently by
U.S. military strikes that crumbled the ruling Taliban regime and
uprooted the Al Qaeda terrorist organization.</LD>
<LD>   But the president made clear he had not budged from his insistence
that other nations provide the troops for a peacekeeping force in
Afghanistan, despite Karzai's hope that the U.S. military would take
part.</LD>
<TE>   "Better yet than peacekeepers, let's have Afghanistan have her own
military," Bush said. He termed that "the most important part of this
visit."</TE>
<TE>   The White House also offered new details of U.S. humanitarian
assistance for Afghanistan, released assets that had been frozen during
the Taliban rule and extended credit to encourage private investment.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai, who is interim prime minister, said he would return home
"satisfied" with the results of his U.S. trip. He also vowed that "we
will not allow terrorism to return" to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the visit to the White House, Karzai's schedule in
Washington was crowded with events to strengthen support for his nation
and reestablish its ties with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai spoke to students and supporters at Georgetown University on
Sunday night and sat for at least three television interviews Monday. He
also witnessed the raising of the Afghan flag at his nation's recently
reopened embassy here.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to meet today with the House International Relations
Committee and then attend a program on U.S. assistance for education in
Afghanistan. First Lady Laura Bush and the head of the U.S. Agency for
International Development are scheduled to attend the latter event.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai also is expected to be in the gallery tonight when Bush
delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   During a news conference with Karzai in the Rose Garden, Bush noted
that for the first time since 1979 an American flag flies over the
offices of the U.S. Agency for International Development mission in
Kabul, the Afghan capital.</TE>
<TE>   "That flag will not be lowered," the president said. "It will wave
long into the future, a symbol of America's enduring commitment to
Afghanistan's future."</TE>
<TE>   But the precise nature of Bush's commitment to help Afghanistan
establish its military and police forces remained uncertain. White House
officials said no details had been worked out.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a generation, the military role in Afghanistan has been
played by competing militias controlled by warlords whose allegiances
were often shifting and, more recently, by troops commanded by the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the U.S. will offer logistical support for the international
peacekeepers and assistance in gathering intelligence. He also said
American forces stood ready to provide "a kind of a bailout if the troops
get in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   In opposing a U.S. peacekeeping role, Bush has argued that American
troops are equipped and trained to fight wars and then head home to stand
ready for their next engagement. In addition, the Bush administration
says the Pentagon's forces, stretched as they are, need to be prepared
for future assignments in the anti-terror campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview on PBS, Karzai said Afghanistan would like the
multinational peacekeeping force--now made up of about 5,000 soldiers,
led largely by British units and operating in Kabul--to play an expanded
role. He called for deploying troops throughout the country to
demonstrate an international commitment to security.</TE>
<TE>   In a joint statement, Bush and Karzai also committed their countries
to "a lasting partnership for the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   The administration has already pledged $297 million in aid to
Afghanistan. On Monday, the U.S. announced that it had released $223
million in frozen Afghan assets. Bush also said the Overseas Private
Investment Corp. will make a $50-million line of credit available to
companies wanting to invest in Karzai's nation.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. assistance will be provided to print and distribute 10 million
math, science and reading textbooks in time for the start of the Afghan
school year in March, to provide basic training for 4,000 teachers and to
vaccinate 2.2 million children against measles, the White House said.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai has displayed a keen understanding of the workings of the U.S.
government, recognizing that while the White House largely controls
foreign and military policy, Congress holds sway over financial aid.</TE>
<TE>   Even before his U.S. visit, Karzai courted members of Congress,
meeting in Kabul with several delegations. Among the lawmakers was Rep.
Jim Kolbe (R-Ariz.), chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on
foreign operations, who helps shape the $15-billion international aid
budget.</TE>
<TE>   "Karzai is a very dynamic individual, kind of the right guy at the
right time for that country," Kolbe said. "He can talk--literally and
figuratively--our language."</TE>

<DL>MANILA
</DL>
<LD>The Philippines plans to deploy about 1,000 police officers in key
tourist spots after the slaying of an Israeli visitor at a famous island
resort, Tourism Secretary Richard Gordon said today.</LD>
<LD>   The move to step up security for tourists comes as U.S. troops prepare
for a joint military exercise in the southern Philippines as part of
Washington's first significant expansion of its war against terrorism.
The exercise is to start in a few days.</LD>
<LD>   Gordon said the 26-year-old Israeli was stabbed to death while walking
with his girlfriend on the beach at the island resort of Boracay in the
central Philippines on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "These tourists have been there for the last two months. . . . A third
party was involved," Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   He said police had detained several men for questioning. The killing
came immediately after a regional tourism conference in Indonesia at
which Southeast Asian ministers insisted that their countries are safe
for travelers.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said that some of the 1,000 police officers will be posted by
summer at tourist spots, including Boracay, which is one of the country's
top tourist destinations.</TE>

<HD>Charity Sues Over Anti-Terror Law</HD>
<DH>Courts: Muslim group says freezing of its assets by federal
government was unconstitutional.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>An Illinois charity targeted by the Treasury Department as an
alleged accomplice to terrorist groups sued the federal government
Monday, saying use of a sweeping new anti-terrorism law to freeze the
group's assets was unconstitutional and unfair.</LD>
<LD>   Legal experts predicted that the lawsuit, filed by the Global Relief
Foundation, will be a test case in determining how far the government can
go in attempting to thwart the work of groups it believes are associated
with terrorist activity.</LD>
<LD>   The suit "will sort out what is the government's case [against Global
Relief] and it will probably test the extent of the law," said Jack Blum,
a Washington attorney specializing in financial criminal law.</LD>
<TE>   A lawyer for Global Relief filed the civil lawsuit in the Northern
District of Illinois, seeking an immediate overturning of the Dec. 14
order the Treasury Department issued freezing the group's funds, using
the provisions of the Patriot Act.</TE>
<TE>   That legislation, passed overwhelmingly by Congress after the Sept. 11
attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, was meant to provide
authorities with enhanced powers to combat terrorism, including
staunching the flow of funds to alleged terrorist organizations.</TE>
<TE>   But representatives of Global Relief said the legislation enabled the
government to unfairly freeze about $900,000 of the Bridgeview,
Ill.-based charity's funds and seize all its financial records without
providing any evidence of wrongdoing. It also alleged that the government
has "falsely smeared [the group] as having ties to terrorism but have
failed to disclose any credible evidence or provide GRF with any notice
of charges against it."</TE>
<TE>   The financial freeze, lawyer Roger Simmons said, has virtually shut
down the U.S.-based Muslim charity organization, cutting off paychecks to
its employees and thwarting its relief efforts worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic essence of what is happening here is they froze our assets
without ever giving us our day in court," Simmons said. "If they can do
it to us, they can do it to anyone. They could walk into IBM and freeze
their assets simply because they want to investigate it."</TE>
<TE>   Simmons and other Global Relief representatives said the group has no
connections to terrorism, and that their offers to cooperate with federal
authorities have been repeatedly rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Global Relief describes itself as a humanitarian organization
dedicated to helping victims of poverty and war, mostly in Muslim
nations. It has offices throughout the world, including Afghanistan, but
raises most of its money from donors in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury officials had little comment, citing the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "This matter is now before the court," said Treasury spokeswoman Tasia
Scolinos. "We are confident that the government's action will be judged
appropriate in this case."</TE>
<TE>   FBI and Treasury agents raided the group's offices early Dec. 14, at
the same time they targeted another Chicago-area Islamic charity,
Benevolence International Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Those efforts marked the first time the Bush administration's
financial war on terrorism linked U.S.-based charities to alleged
terrorists, including Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network,
authorities said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown came as NATO-led peacekeepers and United Nations police
raided Global Relief's offices in Yugoslavia and detained several people
on suspicion of being linked to international terrorism. Authorities
received "credible intelligence information that individuals working for
this organization may have been directly involved in supporting worldwide
international terrorist activities," according to a North Atlantic Treaty
Organization statement.</TE>

<HD>Officials Agree on Prisoners' Status</HD>
<DH>Law: Bush, advisors say all are now in accord that detainees in
Cuba aren't POWs, but unlawful combatants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush and other top officials said Monday that the
administration now is united in its position that the 158 terrorist
suspects incarcerated at a U.S. naval base in Cuba are not prisoners of
war.</LD>
<LD>   They promised soon to provide the legal reasoning, which they hope
will silence criticism over how the detainees are being treated.</LD>
<LD>   After a morning meeting of top foreign policy advisors, Bush and other
White House officials sought to end reports that Secretary of State Colin
L. Powell was troubled over the murky legal status of the arrestees.</LD>
<TE>   The question centers on whether the suspected terrorists should be
treated as prisoners captured in the Afghan war, who cannot be forced to
speak to U.S. authorities, or as unlawful combatants who can be
interrogated about the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and any plans for
further attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "These are killers," Bush said, speaking at the White House with
interim Afghan leader Hamid Karzai at his side.</TE>
<TE>Bush: 'They Know No Countries'</TE>
<TE>   "These are terrorists. They know no countries. The only thing they
know about country is, when they find a country that's been weakened,
they want to occupy it like a parasite."</TE>
<TE>   The president said he would release his legal basis for that
definition of the detainees. Other government sources said there would be
a separate announcement "in the relatively near future" on the rules for
trying the detainees.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, reports surfaced that Powell had asked the White
House to consider giving the detainees the Geneva Convention's
prisoner-of-war safeguards. These stipulate that prisoners must be
treated humanely and that they cannot be forced to talk.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld visited the naval base
at Guantanamo Bay and announced that he had "absolutely full confidence
in the way the detainees are being handled and treated."</TE>
<TE>   He also said that as far as he was concerned, the arrestees being held
in outdoor wire cages, until more permanent facilities can be completed,
were unlawful combatants and subject to interrogation. "They will not be
determined to be POWs," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>'Spirit' of Geneva Convention Followed</TE>
<TE>   Powell, who was in Washington, made no public comments Monday.
Government sources said he "has supported and does support the decision
that Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters are not prisoners of war."</TE>
<TE>   The president and others stressed that while the detainees were not
considered prisoners, they nevertheless were being treated humanely.</TE>
<TE>   "We are adhering to the spirit of the Geneva Convention," the
president said, explaining that even though the government considers the
detainees to be international terrorists and enemies of the United
States, they will not be abused.</TE>
<TE>   "We're giving them medical care; they're being well-treated," he said.
"There's no evidence that we're treating them outside the spirit of the
Geneva Convention. And for those who say we are, they just don't know
what they are talking about."</TE>
<TE>   Many civil liberties groups, clergy and legal organizations have
complained that the White House is trying to have it both ways. They
worry that the administration wants to circumvent the Geneva Convention
rules even though most of the detainees were captured while fighting the
United States and its allies in the Afghan region.</TE>
<TE>   The groups also have been suspicious that the administration is
ignoring tradition and attempting to rewrite how enemy soldiers should be
treated once they are captured.</TE>
<TE>   But the White House said Monday that the detainees were simply
terrorists--not soldiers in the conventional sense--and that the American
public supported anything the government could do to learn about future
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer echoed the president's stance that
Al Qaeda is not a recognized government, and that anyone fighting for the
terrorist organization should not be considered a traditional soldier.</TE>
<TE>   "For these people who are now detainees, the choice was either be
captured or be killed," he said. "And they've been captured."</TE>
<TE>   At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher said government
lawyers were searching for the "exact legal interpretation of why they
are not prisoners of war."</TE>
<TE>   "There are different views of that, and so that's what's being
discussed," Boucher added.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said that there also would be a decision soon on the fate of
the individual detainees, and that they could be tried in military
tribunals, turned over to the U.S. federal courts, deported to their home
countries or sent to a third country for prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   "It all will be done on a case-by-case basis," one official said.</TE>

officials said.</LD>

<HD>N.Y. Readies for Forum Protests</HD>
<DH>Meeting: Mostly peaceful demonstrations are expected at this year's
world economic conference--but police are prepared just in case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>In 1971, Klaus Schwab, a professor of business policy at the
University of Geneva and an avid cross-country skier, convened a
little-noticed meeting of European corporations in the Alpine resort of
Davos to discuss the international marketplace.</LD>
<LD>   Over three decades, the Davos conference has grown to become an
impressive gathering of corporate chieftains, world political leaders,
academic experts, media representatives and officials of non-governmental
organizations--seasoned with a soupcon of celebrities.</LD>
<LD>   Status and skiing mixed with the ambitious goal of bringing business
and society together in a partnership to improve the world.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, the five-day meeting--a magnet for anti-globalization
activists--descends from the scenic Alps to the streets of
Manhattan--posing the prospect of possible violent clashes between police
and demonstrators who have pledged to try to disrupt the conference.</TE>
<TE>   The list of 3,000 invitees to the World Economic Forum ranges from
George L. Carey, the archbishop of Canterbury, to Hamid Karzai, the
interim leader of Afghanistan, and includes 30 heads of governments, 74
ambassadors, hundreds of corporate leaders and at least six members of
President Bush's Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>Meeting Moved to New York After Attack</TE>
<TE>   Almost 200 scheduled events include discussions of prospects for
economic recovery, how to achieve a safer world, the root causes of
conflict, the future of terrorism, understanding global anger and an
update on international migrations after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   A special message from United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan
will conclude the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The conference was moved from Davos to show solidarity with New York
City after the World Trade Center attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I happened to be here with my wife on the 11th of September and I
witnessed what happened," Schwab told a heavily guarded news conference
at a midtown Manhattan hotel on Monday. "We said we have to change the
program. We really are living in a new world.</TE>
<TE>   "When security issues are arising, you always have to be concerned,"
he added. "We know we are in very good hands. We can see the authorities
are taking very good measures."</TE>
<TE>   In a preview of what would be a prompt and very tough response, New
York's new Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly recently invited reporters
to a rehearsal at Shea Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   On display in the parking lot were lines of helmeted officers wearing
gas masks who carried riot batons and were equipped with sheaves of
plastic restraints.</TE>
<TE>   The contingent was supported by helicopters, police on horseback and
emergency vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where the meeting will convene, is being
turned into a fortress with police and federal agents guarding the
lobbies and corridors and snipers strategically placed on nearby roofs.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic will be banned from some streets.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, police tightened security even further. Chief of Patrol
Joseph Esposito announced the department would enforce an 1845 city
ordinance prohibiting three or more protesters from wearing masks.</TE>
<TE>   "Three or more with masks and they're marching, they're under arrest,"
Esposito promised.</TE>
<TE>Police Trained to Be Mobile</TE>
<TE>   To help prepare for the meeting, police sent teams of officers to
Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington, Quebec and Genoa, Italy, where
previous violent anti-globalization rallies have occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Last year in Genoa, a demonstrator was killed in a street battle with
security forces.</TE>
<TE>   After protests at an Organization of American States meeting in
Ontario and a World Petroleum Conference in Calgary, the Canadian
Security Intelligence Service issued a report on anti-globalization
groups.</TE>
<TE>   It said protesters are motivated by a variety of causes ranging from
accusations of exploitation of workers by multinational corporations in
the Third World to mismanagement of natural resources. Included in their
grievances are the mistreatment of animals and the philosophy of
capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   "Not unlike the massive and often vigorous out-of-Vietnam and
ban-the-bomb protests of the '60s and '70s decades, today's
demonstrations, resurrecting the anarchist theme of direct action, employ
a host of novel methodologies that have given a whole new complexion to
the nature of the protests," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   It warned that police must be prepared to be extremely mobile to match
the mobility of demonstrators, whose leaders communicate using cell
phones. Extremist elements in the past have used moderate protesters as
shields to prevent police from viewing violent activities and from
stopping the damage.</TE>
<TE>   Some activists have climbed buildings and other lofty sites to stage
sit-ins and hang banners. Others have resorted to violence, including
smashing windows, starting fires and trashing stores and fast-food
outlets, the report said.</TE>
<TE>Protests May Be Bad PR, Activists Say</TE>
<TE>   Police in New York have assigned 4,000 officers to the World Economic
Forum, with additional forces held in reserve. With a department of
40,000, commanders expressed confidence they can handle multiple protests
and provide adequate protection for the rest of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Police predict mostly peaceful demonstrations. Debate exists among
activists over the propriety and public relations value of scenes of
violence in a city trying to recover from the trauma of the trade center
tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Some protest leaders argue that violence against policemen who were
heroes could produce backlash harmful to the cause of anti-globalization
in the long run.</TE>
<TE>   This has caused activists who planned to visit New York to instead
travel to Porto Alegre, Brazil, where some 50,000 delegates representing
about 6,000 different non-governmental organizations are expected to
attend the World Social Forum, a sort of anti-globalization summit
meeting which also starts on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "The forum is intended to give voice to a critique of the dominant
economic model," said Sergio Haddad, president of a Brazilian association
of non-governmental organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Three candidates in this year's French presidential elections will
also attend the meeting in Brazil, as will Jose Bove, a French farmer and
activist who received notoriety for his assaults on McDonald's in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   At last year's World Social Forum, also in Porto Alegre, Bove joined a
group of landless Brazilian peasants in the destruction of experimental
genetic crops.</TE>
<TE>   The summit is being held in Porto Alegre at the invitation of the
local government, which is controlled by the leftist Workers Party.</TE>

<HD>Prescription Drug Funding on Way</HD>
<DH>Medicare: Pair of programs would give states some federal funds to
help low-income seniors with costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration Monday announced two initiatives that would
give states some federal funds to provide prescription drug coverage to
low-income elderly.</LD>
<LD>   If fully funded by the states and Congress, the programs could
eventually help pay drug costs for 3 million low-income seniors--three
out of every 10 seniors who currently have no prescription drug coverage.</LD>
<LD>   The two programs are aimed at reducing the impact of spiraling drug
costs on the elderly, whose Medicare benefits do not cover prescription
drugs.</LD>
<TE>   AARP, the leading seniors' lobby with 35 million members, said last
week that passage of a prescription drug benefit for the elderly is its
No. 1 priority this year.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of an election year, the administration wants to show
that it is concerned about the problem and that the president's
priorities extend beyond the anti-terrorism and homeland security efforts
that have dominated the political agenda since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and a bipartisan group of lawmakers who met with him at
the White House on Monday afternoon acknowledged that such programs are
stopgaps until a prescription drug benefit can be provided for all 40
million people covered by Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   "The long-term goal is to modernize Medicare and include prescription
drugs," Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) said after the meeting. "But we also
have to act now."</TE>
<TE>   The larger program would provide federal aid to help all states, once
they provided prescription drug coverage to all their poor elderly, to
extend the coverage to the near-poor.</TE>
<TE>A $77-Billion Tab</TE>
<TE>   The federal government would pay $77 billion over 10 years to expand
drug coverage to seniors whose income fell between 100% and 150% of the
poverty level. The federal government would cover 90% of the costs, while
the states would pay the remaining 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will include funding for the program in his fiscal year 2003
budget, which will be submitted to Congress on Feb. 4. Congress would
have to approve the program and authorize funding for it.</TE>
<TE>   A separate proposal, Pharmacy Plus, would allow 18 states that already
provide coverage to immediately expand their drug benefits for low-income
seniors.</TE>
<TE>   The states, which include California, provide coverage to seniors
earning no more than poverty-level income ($8,590 for a one-person
household). They would receive Medicaid matching funds to provide similar
benefits to seniors earning up to twice that amount.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois received permission from the government Monday to undertake
such a program.</TE>
<TE>   Many state Medicaid programs, which cover 44 million low-income
people, already are having serious problems funding current benefit
levels.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the national recession, state revenue is declining just as
the numbers of unemployed workers and Medicaid-eligible residents are
increasing.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, it is unclear how many states would be able to afford an
expanded drug benefit for poor seniors, even if the federal government
shared the cost.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the Medi-Cal program already spends roughly $2.5
billion to provide drug benefits for about 3 million seniors who earn up
to 133% of the poverty level, said Glen Rosselli, undersecretary of the
state Health and Human Services Agency.</TE>
<TE>   An additional 1.3 million seniors could benefit under the new
administration proposal, Rosselli said, but he did not know immediately
if the state could afford its share of their benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very tough year to ask the states to pay more of a share of
Medicare," Rosselli said. "These are tough times.</TE>
<TE>   "We are encouraged by any new ideas" the administration has, he added.
"But at first blush, this looks like another example of the federal
government trying to shift responsibility . . . to the states."</TE>
<TE>   The California government pays 49% of the cost of the Medi-Cal program
while the federal government picks up 51% of the tab.</TE>
<TE>Prior Commitments</TE>
<TE>   The announcement in Washington by Health and Human Services Secretary
Tommy G. Thompson of what he called a five-point plan to strengthen
Medicare came on the eve of the president's State of the Union address.</TE>
<TE>   Some elements of the plan--a $190-billion, 10-year effort to overhaul
Medicare and a revised prescription drug discount card for seniors--are
intended to symbolize the administration's renewed commitment to
proposals it made last year.</TE>
<TE>   Both of those proposals ran into trouble: The administration's first
discount card plan was blocked by a federal judge, and many Republican
and Democratic lawmakers continue to say that Bush's $190-million
Medicare plan is too little, too late. Administration officials estimate
that a comprehensive drug benefit for seniors cannot be implemented until
2006.</TE>
<TE>   The president's proposals show that access to affordable prescription
drugs is "one of the foremost domestic issues facing Americans,
especially seniors," Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) said outside the
White House on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is willing to commit political capital [to the issue]
in an election year," said Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.). "This is a
must-do."</TE>
<TE>   John Rother, director of policy and strategy for AARP, said the
administration's reiteration of its commitment to a Medicare drug benefit
was "a positive step, even though in the end we are going to need more
money."</TE>
<TE>   Craig Fuller, president of the National Assn. of Chain Drug Stores,
also had qualified praise for the proposals.</TE>
<TE>   The trade group sued the administration last year over its discount
drug card proposal, and remains opposed to any benefit that would reduce
the earnings of drugstores and limit the role of pharmacists.</TE>
<TE>   Prescription drug costs increased more than 17% in 2000 and overall
health-care costs now are increasing at double-digit rates for the first
time in 10 years.</TE>

<LD>Twenty people, including 18 current or former Philadelphia city
officials, were indicted in an alleged bribery scheme that cost the city
more than $2 million.</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors say city workers accepted bribes in the form of
cash and merchandise--including air conditioners, computer equipment,
televisions, car alarms and microwave ovens--in return for helping the
now-defunct AAA Electric Motors Corp. overcharge the city for repairs.</LD>
<LD>   Lynne Abraham, the Philadelphia district attorney whose office
investigated the case with the FBI, said city employees in five
departments would take cash or merchandise equaling about one-third of
the overcharged amounts, with the rest going to AAA.</LD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Massachusetts' highest court has overturned the child pornography
conviction of an art student who photographed a 15-year-old girl with her
breasts exposed.</LD>
<LD>   The Supreme Judicial Court said that John C. Bean, 40, who was taking
courses at the Worcester Art Museum, "had no lascivious intent" and the
pictures were "neither obscene nor pornographic."</LD>
<LD>   A judge had sentenced Bean to six months' probation on a charge of
"posing a child in the nude." Bean also faced having to register as a sex
offender.</LD>
<TE>   Bean "was trying to work in an artistic manner and if his conviction
had been upheld it would have been a devastating message to people trying
to earn a living creatively," said Benjamin Keehn of the Committee for
Public Counsel Services, who handled the appeal.</TE>

<LD>After a battle by the state to wipe out citrus canker in South
Florida, the crop-destroying disease has spread to the Indian River grove
country, which provides most of the bagged and boxed grapefruit sold to
tourists and mailed around the country as gifts.</LD>
<LD>   Federal inspectors searched door to door after canker blemishes were
discovered last week on grapefruit trees in Brevard County, marking the
northernmost penetration of the disease.</LD>
<LD>   The bacteria cause unsightly brown blemishes on fruit and can cause it
to drop prematurely from trees; they do not harm humans.</LD>

<PH>THE FALL OF ENRON</PH>
<KH>NEWS ANALYSIS</KH>
<HD>Hearings Playing as Political Theater</HD>
<DH>Congress: Lawmakers are using the Enron investigations as a forum
to show that they are part of the solution, not the problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Congress is about to unleash a flurry of hearings on the Enron
Corp. bankruptcy in which lawmakers will hear hours of testimony on
derivatives, off-balance-sheet partnerships and accounting arcana.</LD>
<LD>   But evidence and testimony are not the sole purpose of these events.
Even more than with high-profile hearings in the past, the upcoming
sessions have been seized upon by lawmakers eager to dramatize that they
are part of the remedy for the fiasco rather than, as eager recipients of
Enron contributions, part of the problem.</LD>
<LD>   "It may very well be that having received these contributions, they
feel the spotlight on them. And they're going to be more aggressive than
they would otherwise be to try to separate themselves from Enron and
Arthur Andersen," said Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for
Responsive Politics, a Washington-based watchdog organization.</LD>
<TE>   Of the 248 members of investigating House and Senate committees,
Noble's group found, 212 received contributions from Enron; its former
accountant, Andersen; or both.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, Congress is gathering the facts about the Enron bankruptcy
case to determine what new laws may be necessary. The hearings, including
one today, are looking into a wide range of subjects, such as new rules
governing accountants, pension reforms and financial disclosure by
corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on Monday asked Sen. Jeff Bingaman
(D-N.M.), chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, to hold a hearing into
"what role Enron had in the California energy crisis with respect to
market manipulation and price gouging."</TE>
<TE>   But the hearings are as much political theater as investigative
process, and nearly a dozen committees have claimed a spot onstage.</TE>
<TE>   Former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay is next week's star witness; he
is scheduled to appear before both a House panel and a Senate committee
that says it will bow out of the investigation once Lay testifies. Other
panels are competing for executives who, like fired Andersen auditor
David B. Duncan last week, are unlikely to say anything.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional offices have been churning out news releases, laboring
to come up with the most TV-worthy sound bites. (The winner last week was
Pennsylvania Rep. James C. Greenwood's line to Duncan: "Enron robbed the
bank, Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car, and they say you were at
the wheel.")</TE>
<TE>   Then, with cameras clicking away, Duncan invoked his 5th Amendment
right against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   "Committee hearings are all about drama and TV," said Marshall
Wittmann, a political scholar with the conservative Hudson Institute.</TE>
<TE>   One House committee will hold a hearing in which all 57 of its members
will be allowed to deliver opening statements, usually five minutes
apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is falling over each other to pick away at Enron," said
Robert Bennett, the energy company's Washington attorney, whose clients
have included former President Clinton. "I do not question the legitimacy
and right of Congress to make inquiry. But I think they should complete
their investigations before they complete their conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   However, Thomas Mann, an expert on Congress at the nonpartisan
Brookings Institution think tank, said: "It's perfectly appropriate, and
in fact necessary, for Congress" to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an issue that touches on many public policy concerns. It's
probably the most serious matter that they have investigated in a long
time."</TE>
<TE>   A key difference between these hearings and others--Whitewater, for
example--is that lawmakers have avoided partisanship so far.</TE>
<TE>   That could change next week when Lay, a political patron of President
Bush, appears Monday before House and Senate panels.</TE>
<TE>   The political importance of hearings is well understood.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), chairman of the Governmental
Affairs Committee and a potential Bush rival in 2004, has recalled being
"captivated by television coverage of the Army-McCarthy hearings and Sen.
Estes Kefauver's investigation of organized crime" in the 1950s.
Kefauver's hearings gave the Tennessee senator a springboard for several
unsuccessful attempts at the Democratic presidential nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "Every committee chairman is looking for that confrontation such as we
saw with Howard Baker during Watergate: 'What did you know and when did
you know it?' " Wittmann said, referring to the former senator. "I
suspect that one congressman may utter the same line [from the McCarthy
hearings] to an Enron executive: 'Have you no sense of decency, sir?' "</TE>
<TE>   "Since the public has a short attention span, effective investigations
have to obtain the media spotlight and hammer home the point day by day
in order to influence public opinion in favor of whatever reform seems
necessary to cure the ills exposed," said Senate historian Donald A.
Ritchie.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently, there is competition among various committees to be the
first to take testimony from a key witness.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years in congressional investigations, there has been
competition between the House and Senate, and sometimes in the same
body," said Michael J. Madigan, former chief counsel to Sen. Fred
Thompson (R-Tenn.), whom he aided in supervising hearings on campaign
finance abuse and reform.</TE>
<TE>   Such rivalry may explain why, last week, the House Energy and Commerce
and the Senate Governmental Affairs committees held hearings on the same
morning.</TE>
<TE>   One congressional aide said it appeared that the House hearing--which
included Duncan's dramatic refusal to answer questions--was intentionally
scheduled to upstage the Senate hearing, which focused on broader public
policy issues.</TE>

<HD>Firm Did Not Get His Help, President Says</HD>
<DH>Enron: Bush also defends refusal to release energy task force's
records. GOP lawmakers concerned about fallout from company's collapse.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Monday called the Enron Corp. debacle "a
corporate governance issue . . . not a political issue," and he declared
unequivocally that his administration provided no help to the
now-bankrupt energy company despite large contributions from its
employees, directors and political action committee to his presidential
campaign.</LD>
<LD>   "There are some on Capitol Hill who want to politicize this issue,"
Bush said, clearly seeking to inoculate himself against political fallout
in the burgeoning controversy.</LD>
<LD>   "And, you know, Enron had made contributions to a lot of people around
Washington, D.C. And if they came to this administration looking for
help, they didn't find any," the president added.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's comments--his most extensive yet on Enron--came a day after a
poll showed that 45% of those surveyed believe Enron had closer ties to
Republicans than Democrats; only 10% believed Democrats had closer ties.
In the CBS/New York Times poll, more than half also said the Bush
administration is either hiding something or lying about the Enron
matter.</TE>
<TE>President Defends Stance on Records</TE>
<TE>   Republicans on Capitol Hill are growing deeply concerned over such
perceptions, fearful that Enron could derail key Bush
priorities--including a national energy policy--as the president enters
his second year in office.</TE>
<TE>   That angst was further fueled by Bush's adamant refusal Monday to
disclose White House contacts last year with Enron and other energy
industry executives while Vice President Dick Cheney developed the
administration's controversial energy policy.</TE>
<TE>   With nearly a dozen congressional committees looking into various
aspects of the Enron collapse, the matter is likely to hang heavily over
the administration, even as Bush delivers his State of the Union address
tonight and then campaigns for his agenda around the country.</TE>
<TE>   At a Rose Garden news conference on Monday, the president spoke
animatedly as he defended his refusal to release details of Cheney's
energy task force.</TE>
<TE>   Pivoting from his lectern, Bush pointed to the Oval Office and asked
rhetorically: "Should an administration be allowed to have private
conversations in this office without everybody knowing about it?"</TE>
<TE>   With fervor, the president answered his own question, saying:</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of how you make decisions, is to call people in and say,
'What's your opinion? What's your opinion on stem cell? What's your
opinion on energy? What's your opinion on the war?' "</TE>
<TE>   Demands by Congress for such information amount to an "encroachment on
the executive branch's ability to conduct business," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to let the ability for us to discuss matters between
ourselves to become eroded. It's not only important for us, for this
administration, it's an important principle for future administrations,"
he continued.</TE>
<TE>   "In order for me to be able to get good, sound opinions, those who
offer me opinions, or offer the vice president opinions, must know that
every word they say is not going to be put into the public record," the
president added.</TE>
<TE>Friendship With Lay Poses Another Problem</TE>
<TE>   The General Accounting Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm of
Congress, is threatening to sue the administration to gain access to
those task force records.</TE>
<TE>   In his State of the Union address tonight, Bush is not expected to
mention Enron directly. He may call for pension reform--an Enron-related
topic, since the company's bankruptcy left thousands of its employees
with retirement plans that are all but worthless.</TE>
<TE>   The president made his remarks on Enron and the looming legal battle
with the GAO during a wide-ranging joint news conference with visiting
Afghan interim leader Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   As the repercussions of Enron's collapse continue to spread, the White
House has become increasingly defensive--in part because of campaign
contributions to Bush and other Republicans, and in part because of a
friendship between the president and Enron's just-ousted chairman,
Kenneth L. Lay.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear to whom Bush was referring Monday when he accused
"some" of seeking to politicize the issue. The committees probing the
Enron matter in the House are chaired by Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's comment about contacts between Enron and his administration was
a reference to previously disclosed calls from Lay to Commerce Secretary
Don Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. Both Cabinet
secretaries said they did nothing after the calls that could be construed
as helping Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston-based company, the seventh-largest in the country until
its sudden demise, has been the source of large campaign donations for
the last decade or more. While its employees, directors and political
action committee gave to Democrats as well, 74% of nearly $6 million in
various types of contributions went to Republicans. Bush personally
raised more than $114,000 in PAC and individual contributions from Enron
in the 1999-2000 election cycle. Bush's inauguration fund received
$300,000 from the company.</TE>
<TE>'This Is Not a Political Issue'</TE>
<TE>   Presidential counselor Karen Hughes, one of Bush's top advisors,
further sought on Monday to distance the president from Lay, whom Bush
had once nicknamed "Kenny Boy."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview on CNN, Hughes said Bush was "understandably outraged"
over Enron's accounting practices and treatment of its employees, and she
quoted him as having said: "This stinks."</TE>
<TE>   During the Rose Garden session, Bush characterized Enron's collapse as
"a corporate governance issue. This is a business problem that our
country must deal with and must fix--that is, full disclosure of
liabilities, full understanding of the effects of decisions on pension
funds, reform of the pension system, perhaps."</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a political issue," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The president said Enron "went bust" for one simple reason. "It seems
like to me--and we'll wait for the facts to come out--it went broke
because there was not full disclosure of finances."</TE>

<HD>Justice Dept. Puts Statues Under Wraps</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>It's a Washington cover-up of a different sort.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department has spent $8,000 on blue drapes to hide two
giant partially nude statues in the Great Hall of the agency's
headquarters, spokesman Shane Hix said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Drapes were occasionally hung in front of the aluminum Art Deco
statues before formal events "for aesthetics," Hix said. The department
used to rent the drapes, but has now purchased them and left them
hanging.</LD>
<TE>   The drapes provide a nice background for television cameras, Hix said.
ABC News reported that Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, a religious and
conservative man, ordered the statues covered because he didn't like
being photographed in front of them.</TE>
<TE>   But Barbara Comstock, another spokesperson, said the decision was made
by an Ashcroft aide. "He did not know this was being done," Comstock
said. "The attorney general has more important things to do than worry
about what appears in pictures."</TE>
<TE>   Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Ashcroft has been
photographed several times in front of the statue of a woman that
represents the Spirit of Justice. The 10- to 12-foot statue has its arms
raised and a toga draped over its body, but a single breast is exposed.</TE>
<TE>   The other statue, of a man with a cloth covering his midsection, is
called the Majesty of Law. Both statues were installed in the 1930s when
the building was finished, the Justice Department said.</TE>
<TE>   The statues were hidden by rented curtains on Nov. 20, when President
Bush came to the Justice Department to name the building after the
assassinated former attorney general Robert F. Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   The Great Hall is an ornate, two-story room that the department uses
for special ceremonies.</TE>

<HD>Bush Budget Includes $9-Billion Cut in Highway Funds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush's budget would slice $9 billion out of federal aid
to state highway programs for next year, largely because of a drop in
gasoline tax collections, federal and state officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest loser would be California, which would face a reduction of
$663 million from the $2.5 billion in federal aid it is receiving this
year, according to the U.S. Transportation Department. "That's
significant money," said Caltrans Director Jeff Morales.</LD>
<LD>   Federal aid played a major role in Gov. Gray Davis' planned
billion-dollar increase for transportation programs next year to relieve
congestion and improve the flow of goods. Morales said state officials
had not begun to figure out where they would make the necessary trims.</LD>
<TE>   "Our goal first and foremost is to head this off," Morales said. "In
tough economic times, you don't turn away from investment in
infrastructure, which has tremendous benefits for job creation and
economic growth."</TE>
<TE>   The looming $663-million federal cut represents the equivalent of 7%
of Davis' $8.9-billion transportation budget. Morales said not all of the
reduction would be absorbed by his department, however, since some
federal money goes directly to counties and cities.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the federal aid cut--nearly 29% from the $31.8 billion
budgeted this year--sparked plans for intense lobbying by state officials
and the road-building industry.</TE>
<TE>   After California, the big losers in the federal aid derby would
include Bush's home state of Texas and the state of Florida, where his
brother, Jeb Bush, is governor.</TE>
<TE>   John Horsley, executive director of the American Assn. of State
Highway and Transportation Officials, said the construction industry was
projecting a loss of 90,000 jobs nationwide in 2003 if the cuts are made.</TE>
<TE>   "In an economy that's in recession, do we want to worsen the
situation?" Horsley asked.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration officials say their hands are tied. A senior
Transportation Department official, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified, said Congress had decreed that highway money be distributed
according to a formula.</TE>
<TE>   The formula depends on revenue from federal taxes on gasoline and on
sales of big trucks, both of which have declined substantially in the
recession. The problem has been magnified because federal highway funds
distributed to the states for 2002 were based on overly optimistic
revenue projections, and the law requires that such generosity in any one
year be followed by compensating cuts in the next year.</TE>
<TE>   The official also warned that bailing out the states would add to the
federal deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Horsley said the states should not have to pay for the federal
government's faulty estimates. Like Davis, he said, many governors had
already assumed that the federal dollars would be in their budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "The forecast was exaggeratedly high," he said, "and now we are being
told we have to pay the price."</TE>
<TE>   The federal highway trust fund has a positive balance of $18.5
billion, and the states want at least some of that used to ease the sharp
cutback.</TE>
<TE>   But federal trust funds exist in account ledgers only. The revenue
from the gasoline and truck sale taxes goes into the same big pot as
personal income tax revenue. Drawing down the $18.5-billion "balance" in
the highway trust fund would entail spending money from other sources,
including the personal income tax.</TE>
<TE>   The American Road and Transportation Builders Assn. has scheduled a
lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill next week, when Bush formally releases
his budget. Dozens of contractor executives will descend on members of
House and Senate transportation panels, as well as on the Federal Highway
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a done deal yet," said Matthew Jeanneret, a spokesman for
the industry group. "We're bringing out the grass-roots lobbying army.
There's going to be a blitz up on the Hill."</TE>
<TE>   Texas stands to lose $568 million; Florida, $336 million. Other large
states facing significant shortfalls include Pennsylvania, $371 million;
and New York, $371 million.</TE>

<HD>Lesson Learned, Afghans to Retry Vote</HD>
<DH>Organizing: After an attempted Southland election turned
chaotic, guidelines will change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Organizers of a plan to choose 10 Southern California Afghan
representatives will look for a bigger venue and consider an
electoral college-style vote after a community election Sunday
dissolved into verbal sparring and was ultimately disbanded by
sheriff's deputies.</LD>
<LD>   The organizers said Monday that they might even hold candidate
forums and debates.</LD>
<LD>   One thing is clear: What started as a seemingly simple
task--electing representatives--has turned into a logistical
headache.</LD>
<TE>   Members of the organizing committee, Council for Peace of
Afghanistan, said Monday that they remain committed to their goal of
selecting Southern California Afghans who will sit on a 40-member
national council. That council will act as a liaison between Afghan
Americans and the U.S. and Afghan governments.</TE>
<TE>   ''To me, it's been 23 years,'' said organizer Hasan Nouri of
Laguna Hills. ''I have been through war with the Soviet Union. I have
been through war with the Taliban. [Sunday] was just another day in
23 years. I'm not going to give up.''</TE>
<TE>   The council has met several times since Sept. 11, first in small
groups at homes and later in public halls, where hundreds of people
attended. It even held elections to vote in the organizers.</TE>
<TE>   But there were rumblings that the Southland's varied and often
politically divided 40,000 Afghans were not adequately represented.
So organizers started over. They announced Sunday's election in
Laguna Hills, declared the meetings public and said any of those over
21 could be candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's turnout exceeded expectations. Roughly 1,000 people from
Orange, Los Angeles, San Diego, Ventura and Riverside counties came
to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Some people were turned away when the meeting hall filled up,
sparking outrage among some of those present. There was jeering and
shouting. Organizers blamed what they called a pro-Taliban presence,
whose aim was to disrupt the election. Those people denied being
pro-Taliban and said they were merely seeking broader representation.
Critics charged that the election was rigged. And when private
security guards could not control the crowd, Orange County sheriff's
deputies were called.</TE>
<TE>   "What we tried [Sunday] was to put convention, campaign and voting
all in three hours," Nouri said. "You can't do that.... We've got to
find a way to do it, and we'll do it."</TE>
<TE>   Akbar Kabir, 22, of Reseda, a member of the Afghan American Youth
Council, said Monday that despite Sunday's chaos, he witnessed a
group committed to the same goal: bettering Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to see Afghans do things in a more open and democratic
way," Kabir said. "I don't consider it a breakdown. I learned that
everyone would like to take part in something that will benefit
Afghanistan. If people are willing to put in the effort ... they will
get it right."</TE>

<HD>State Growers Sue to Stop Import of Mexican Avocado</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Lawsuit says federal ruling allowing the fruit
into the U.S. could unleash pests on California's crop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's avocado growers have filed suit seeking to stop the
importation of Mexican avocados, saying it could unleash a host of
crop-destroying pests on domestic markets.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit by the California Avocado Commission contends that a
decision by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to allow the
importation violated federal law, because the USDA didn't fully study
the infestation risks.</LD>
<LD>   Under the import program, approved by the USDA in 1997 and
expanded last year, Mexico is allowed to ship avocados to 31 states
from October through March. California is not one of them.</LD>
<TE>   But in avocado-rich regions such as Ventura County, where the
fruit generated $73 million in sales and was the fifth leading cash
crop in 2000, that decision does not sit well with growers already
battling bugs.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't afford any more imported pests," said veteran grower
Roger Essick, who farms 200 acres of avocados in Ojai and Fillmore
and serves on the avocado commission's board of directors. "It's
incredibly serious; we're talking about the future of our industry."</TE>
<TE>   For decades, the USDA enforced a federal law that prohibited the
importation of fruits and vegetables from places known to be infested
with pests not prevalent in the United States, according to the suit
filed last month in U.S. District Court in Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1997, when the USDA allowed avocados from the Mexican state
of Michoacan to enter the country, it used a "new and unproven"
approach that relies on inspections and shipping restrictions to
prevent pests from entering, the lawsuit states.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico initially was allowed to ship avocados between November and
February to 19 Northeastern states. The USDA took the importation
program a step further last year, allowing Mexican avocados to be
sold from October through March and as far west as Utah, Colorado and
Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have identified eight pests in Mexican groves that have
not yet gained a foothold in domestic orchards. The lawsuit contends
that the imports also endanger other domestic produce, such as
citrus, apple and cherry crops.</TE>
<TE>   "As it pertains to risk assessment, we believe that the way the
USDA has gone about its decision-making is simply wrong," said
Richard Rossier, a Washington attorney representing the avocado
commission.</TE>
<TE>   The commission is a state-mandated agency created to promote and
protect the interests of California's 6,000 avocado growers.</TE>
<TE>   A USDA spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   But in the past, agency officials have said they have conducted an
in-depth assessment of the importation program and concluded that
there would be a minimal threat to California's groves.</TE>
<TE>   Since the program began, thousands of weevils and fruit flies have
been trapped in the groves of areas in Mexico approved for such
shipments, according to the California Avocado Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, current fruit-cutting techniques for Mexican avocados
cannot detect eggs or the early larval states of the fruit fly, the
commission said. It says that is a critical deficiency when it comes
to the expansion that took place last year.</TE>
<TE>   If California groves became infested, it could cost more than $500
million to control an outbreak and lead to import restrictions,
resulting in statewide job and monetary losses, the commission said.</TE>

cannot detect eggs or the early larval states of the fruit fly, the
commission said. It says that is a critical deficiency when it comes
to the expansion that took place last year.</TE>
<TE>   The original program only allowed shipments into the Northeast
during winter months, under the belief that cold weather would kill
any bugs that happened to hitch a ride from Mexico into the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   But under the expanded program, shipments are now going to states
with warmer climates, where pests might be better able to establish a
foothold. And fruit can be shipped later in the year, meaning Mexican
avocados could stay in the distribution system well into the summer
months, further increasing infestation risks.</TE>
<TE>   If California groves became infested, it could cost more than $500
million to control an outbreak and lead to import restrictions,
resulting in statewide job and monetary losses, the commission said.</TE>
<TE>   For those reasons, the avocado commission took the unprecedented
step of filing suit against the USDA. And it's for those reasons that
growers in Ventura County, the state's second-largest avocado growing
region, will be watching closely as the case unfolds.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen in past years how [uncontrolled] pests can cause huge
economic consequences to agriculture," said Santa Paula avocado
grower Richard Pidduck,referring to a 1994 Mediterranean fruit fly
discovery near Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   The medfly infestation caused more than $50 million in damage to
area growers and prompted foreign importers to consider enacting an
embargo on crops from the county.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it can be understood why we are a little bit gunshy,"
Pidduck said. "Pest introduction can very quickly develop huge
economic ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   "Beyond the fact that we have to figure out how to get them out of
our orchards, it can destroy markets."</TE>

<HD>Activists Press Geffen for Beach Path</HD>
<DH>Malibu: In test case, the mogul is being asked to make good
on a promise of access if the route is properly maintained.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new nonprofit group of coastal activists has agreed to maintain a
never-opened public walkway to the beach across movie and music
producer David Geffen's Malibu estate and is pressuring him to open
the gates.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first time a nonprofit group has tried to force access to
the beach through one of Malibu's private enclaves. The activists say
the move is born of frustration with two decades of government
inaction.</LD>
<LD>   The group, Access for All, picked the 9-foot-wide easement on the
edge of Geffen's property as a test case because it lies in the heart
of a 3-mile stretch of Malibu coastline that is walled off by an
unbroken phalanx of multimillion-dollar homes.</LD>
<TE>   "If Mr. Geffen will stand behind his offer to open access, then we
want to do this in the most sensitive, tasteful and gentle fashion,"
said Steve Hoye, a former Sierra Club fund-raiser who launched Access
for All.</TE>
<TE>   If not, Hoye said, he is prepared for a fight. He has lined up
lawyers and liability insurance, and will mount a public fund-raising
campaign should Geffen or his neighbors resist. Geffen's neighbors
include billionaire businessman Eli Broad, Jeffrey Katzenberg, who
co-founded DreamWorks with Geffen, and Nancy Daly Riordan, wife of
Richard Riordan, the former mayor and a current candidate for
governor.</TE>
<TE>   Geffen declined comment on the access issue, spokesman Andy Spahn
said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But Spahn, who handles such matters, said he welcomed a chance to
meet with Access for All to better understand the group's plans. "We
are interested in sitting down with them."</TE>
<TE>   Property records show Geffen made an "irrevocable offer to
dedicate public access" in 1983 in exchange for a permit to remodel
his home on Carbon Beach on the seaward side of Pacific Coast
Highway.</TE>
<TE>   That was a time when the California Coastal Commission required
such promised pathways to the shoreline in exchange for permission to
build or remodel homes located between the highway and the beach.</TE>
<TE>   That practice was sharply restricted in 1987, when the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled it illegal to force such concessions from
property owners as a condition of development. But the courts have
upheld the validity of easements that were dedicated by property
owners before the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   However, many of these "offers to dedicate" public access expire
after 21 years. It was assumed that would be enough time for cities,
counties, park agencies or nonprofit organizations to adopt these
easements, maintain walkways or staircases, install trash cans and
assume liability should anyone get hurt.</TE>
<TE>   But the threat of lawsuits, budget cuts and other headaches have
led to inaction by most public agencies, particularly in Malibu. As a
result, many of the 1,300 offers to dedicate land along the state's
1,100-mile coast are set to expire in the next few years, prompting
the interest of nonprofit groups to adopt them.</TE>
<TE>   Some Malibu residents oppose opening these walkways, saying the
beaches have no lifeguards, and limited parking could create a
traffic hazard.</TE>
<TE>   The Geffen easement, which connects Pacific Coast Highway to the
public beach below the mean high tide line, was set to expire in
2004. So Hoye, executive director of Access for All, decided to make
it a priority.</TE>
<TE>   Hoye's group, which he co-founded with Malibu environmental
activists Marcia Hanscom and Robert "Roy" van de Hoek, spent months
drawing up management plans for the path. Earlier this month, the
group won approval for the adoption from the Coastal Commission and
the state Coastal Conservancy, ensuring the Geffen easement will
never expire.</TE>
<TE>   Yet opening it to the public is another matter.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other long-promised walkways blocked by tennis courts and
concrete walls, the Geffen easement would be easy to
open--physically. All it would take is opening a set of handsome
wooden gates. Geffen has already separated this strip of sand from
the rest of his estate with a wall.</TE>
<TE>   Hoye said he wants to install automatic time locks on the gates so
they open at sunrise and close at sunset--to be consistent with Los
Angeles County beach hours of operation.</TE>
<TE>   Access for All also adopted three other easements that Geffen
offered to the public over the years in exchange for building a sea
wall to protect his property that extends across four oceanfront
lots. These horizontal easements run for 225 feet along on the sandy
beach in front of Geffen's estate and would be available for
beach-goers to spread their towels and blankets.</TE>
<TE>   Hoye wants to post signs on the gate and the beach marking the
location of the public walkway and the 225-foot stretch of public
sunbathing area.</TE>
<TE>   The signs, he said, would also ask the public to "Please respect
homeowner's 10-foot privacy buffer" along the sea wall.</TE>
<TE>   "Access for All would like to move forward to survey and open
these new easements as soon as is mutually convenient, and would like
to meet with your representatives to assure that this process is
carried out with the utmost sensitivity to both your interests and
those of the People of California," Hoye wrote in a Jan. 25 letter to
Geffen.</TE>
<TE>   If the walkway is opened, it will be the first in Malibu since
1981, when Los Angeles County unveiled the Zonker Harris Access Way
about 1,000 feet up the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Locklin, coastal access manager for the Coastal Commission,
said the Coastal Act allows nonprofit groups to open and maintain
access ways.</TE>
<TE>   The Mendocino Land Trust in 1996 became the first nonprofit in
California to open such an access way to the shoreline. It now
operates two such pathways to the sea.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a wine and cheese opening one day and got sued the next
day by the property owner," Locklin recalled. Ultimately, the Coastal
Commission and the land trust prevailed in court.</TE>

<HD>Man Faces 3 Murder Charges</HD>
<DH>Crime: Estranged boyfriend is accused of stabbing to death
a Sun Valley woman and their two young daughters.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Stanton man accused of stabbing to death his estranged girlfriend
and their two young daughters in their San Fernando Valley home was
charged Monday with three counts of murder, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Julian Beltran, 27, appeared in Van Nuys Superior Court to face
the charges, but his arraignment was postponed until Feb. 11.
Prosecutors said he could be eligible for the death penalty because
there were multiple victims.</LD>
<LD>   Beltran is being held without bail at the Twin Towers jail in the
slayings of Maria Michelle Barahona, 24; Marissa Beltran, 6; and
Natalie Beltran, 2.</LD>
<TE>   According to authorities, Beltran called California Highway Patrol
dispatchers twice from his cellular phone Jan. 23, the night of the
killings, telling a dispatcher that "somebody was hurt" at a house on
the 7400 block of Craner Avenue in Sun Valley.</TE>
<TE>   About an hour later, authorities said Beltran called again,
telling another dispatcher, "I have a knife and I am sorry I hurt
her."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County deputies found Beltran standing in front of his car
in Stanton, bleeding from cuts on both wrists and waving a knife.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies at the scene believed Beltran wanted them to shoot him to
death, Orange County sheriff's spokesman John Fleischmann said.
Instead, deputies fired four beanbags at him after he refused to
surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran, a trucker who had been with Barahona on and off for about
eight years, later told authorities about the killings and where they
could find the bodies, Orange County sheriff's officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran and Barahona had no documented history of verbal or
physical abuse, Los Angeles Police Det. Mike Coffey said.</TE>
<TE>   "This jumped from a quiet, reserved individual to a breakup to
some more arguments and then slaughtering everyone," Coffey said.</TE>

<HD>Bike Station Is a Commuter's Headache Cure</HD>
<DH>Transit: Long Beach pioneers service for dropping off
cycles for the work day. Other cities may follow the effort to reduce
traffic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER and NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If this were Tokyo, if it were Copenhagen or Amsterdam, what Pat
Madden is doing just now would hardly be unusual. But this is
car-crazy Southern California, which makes Madden's actions seem
practically revolutionary.</LD>
<LD>   A Superior Court judge, Madden is a sight to behold as he makes
his way to work in downtown Long Beach on a chilly morning. Perched
on his head is a white plastic helmet; strapped on his shoulders a
black backpack. He's outfitted head to toe in a pale blue jumpsuit
for warmth.</LD>
<LD>   Madden is pumping the pedals of a mountain bike.</LD>
<TE>   He parks outside a little corrugated steel building and hops off
his bike. "Just dropping off," he says to an attendant, giving up his
cycle, which he will retrieve at day's end. In less than a minute the
judge, who has biked four miles from home, is walking off to work.</TE>
<TE>   Like many in his city, Madden is an enthusiastic user of the Long
Beach Bike Station, a sort of bicycle valet service deluxe that's
gaining popularity.</TE>
<TE>   The station has a simple goal: Make it easy to choose a bike over
a car, not only by providing free parking close to connections with
buses and trains, but also by offering other enticements, from
refreshments to restrooms to repairs.</TE>
<TE>   The site is nestled in the corner of a parking lot in the heart of
Long Beach. Scores use the station daily, making it a national model
for bicycle transit and creating a crossroads for a diverse set of
local cyclists.</TE>
<TE>   They are lawyers and librarians, businessmen and busboys, pilots
and professors. Some are ardent environmentalists. Others like the
practicality. Some park their bikes and walk to work. Others take the
nearby Blue Line light-rail train heading to downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone using this place is looking to cut some of the hassles
of commuting out of their lives," said Pete Babij, a geologist and
regular patron.</TE>
<TE>   Added Mark Shandrow, who has helped manage the bike station since
its 1996 inception: "We think we're on to something special. The idea
you can ride up on your bike, drop it off for the day, that someone
is going to watch it until you pick it up later ... we think it will
entice a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   That idea seems to have caught on, judging by business at the
station--a yellow, green and red structure. When the station opened
five years ago, it was thought to be the first such urban biking
oasis in the country, and it had just a trickle of customers. Now,
attendants park nearly 1,500 bikes each month.</TE>
<TE>   Bike storage is free. Cyclists ride in, swipe a membership card
over a keypad, and hand off their two wheelers to an attendant who
stores the bikes in racks placed securely behind the small station.</TE>
<TE>   For a charge, there are plenty of other services.</TE>
<TE>   Need a jolt of coffee and a muffin before work? There's a little
cafe. Want to use the facilities? There's a large, clean bathroom.
Need a tire pumped, a spoke straightened? Attendants make the
repairs. The station also offers bike rentals, even lending electric
bikes on an experimental basis the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "Our philosophy was to provide as many amenities as possible,"
said John Case, the Long Beach businessman who introduced the concept
to the city. "We wanted to make it as easy as we can for people to
use."</TE>
<TE>   Expanding on the alternative transportation theme, the station
used a federal grant to procure a small fleet of electric cars. The
Ford Think, tiny and thumb-shaped, travels about 50 miles per charge.
The Bike Station plans to start offering the Think for rentals in
March, with the idea that it will give cyclists a way to travel
longer distances without burning fossil fuel.</TE>
<TE>   "Any way we can promote alternatives," said Shandrow, while
driving the car around Long Beach as passersby gawked.</TE>
<TE>   Recent studies show that the number of bikers using the station,
though growing steadily, accounts for just a sliver of all trips
taken in the area.</TE>
<TE>   But Shandrow thinks if the station can keep growing in popularity,
it can help make a dent and ease traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, about 1% of trips in Long Beach are made on a bike. If
we can help that go up just a little--that's still a small
percentage--but it's a lot of cars off the road."</TE>
<TE>   Case, the businessman, was hardly a biking fanatic when he brought
the concept to Long Beach. He was just an observant traveler
impressed by the vast networks of public bike stations in Holland,
Denmark and other countries.</TE>
<TE>   "There are probably 8,000 of these in other parts of the world,"
he said. "People in many other countries use them all the time. They
tend to be much more utilitarian, but that's what you have to do when
you are serving so many people."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, Case promoted the concept of a downtown bike station with
city officials. He helped secure funding through a Metropolitan
Transportation Authority program, receiving $300,000 in 1992. Four
years later, the station opened. Today, Long Beach pays for the
station; it costs about $50,000 each year from the general fund.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach had its drawbacks--most notably the lack of a known
cycling community. But Case preferred to see its possibilities: a
city of 461,000 with great weather, flat topography and a busy
downtown with thriving light-rail service.</TE>
<TE>   "We may not be known as a bike town, like a Boulder [Colorado] or
a Palo Alto," Case said. "But that actually made the challenge more
exciting, [and] now you have other cities catching on."</TE>
<TE>   Shandrow and Case started the Bikestation Coalition, a nonprofit
group, to share the lessons they've learned. Shandrow has served as a
consultant for three years, helping to create bike stations or push
planning in cities including Berkeley, Boston, Denver and Seattle. He
even gave pointers to bike mecca Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   "We found out how to run our project by looking at Long Beach,"
said Amanda Jones, a transit developer for the city of Palo Alto,
which parks about 1,000 bikes a month. "We learned from them things
that would and wouldn't work, and how to market our service to
people. They've been great."</TE>
<TE>   Shandrow hopes more bike stations can be added in Los Angeles,
particularly at sites close to transit hubs. He has his eye on a
number of subway stops along the MTA's rail network, especially the
Red Line station in North Hollywood. It already bustles with
cyclists, and should grow during a planned redevelopment project. It
could even attract the next convert like Long Beach's Judge Madden.</TE>
<TE>   In the foggy early morning on his walk from the bike station to
his courthouse, Madden ponders the future of bike stations.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like a good match" for Southern California's lifestyle,
he says. "It gets you out of traffic, it adds to recreation, it's
good for the environment, and it's healthy. Perfect."</TE>

<LD>Two men were arrested Monday on suspicion of stealing a car and
leading police on a short chase before crashing into a patrol car,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony Smith, 19, of Burbank was jailed on suspicion of auto
theft, assault with a deadly weapon, providing police with false
identification and possessing marijuana. His bail was set at $60,000.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Kahn, 27, of Simi Valley was being held on suspicion of auto
theft and providing false identification. He was held without bail
because his arrest violates the terms of his parole from state
prison, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Shortly before 1 a.m., the pair stole a Ford Mustang from the 1000
block of Standford Drive in Simi Valley and drove down Sycamore Drive
before arriving at a dead-end, making a U-turn and ramming a pursuing
police car, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The pursuing Simi Valley police officer, Chris Martin, was not
injured.</TE>

<LD>A Los Angeles man was sentenced to four years in prison Monday for
setting off a powerful firecracker in a dog's mouth and illegally
possessing an explosive.</LD>
<LD>   Compton Superior Court Commissioner Ronald Slick sentenced Gil
Raul DeLara, 19, after DeLara pleaded no contest.</LD>
<LD>   The dog, a stray that appeared to be a German shepherd, lost its
lower jaw.</LD>
<TE>   It was euthanized at a veterinary hospital.</TE>
<TE>   DeLara's lawyer, Fred Browne, said: "It was not a very bright
thing to do, and he's very remorseful."</TE>
<TE>   Officers responding to a call from a resident found the animal
tied to a stake in an alley in the 10400 block of Hickory Street on
Dec. 30.</TE>
<TE>   DeLara was accused of 11 counts of recklessly possessing
explosives, each of which carries a sentence of two to six years, and
one count of animal cruelty, a felony that can bring a term of 18
months to three years.</TE>
<TE>   He was sentenced to concurrent terms of four years for possession
and two years for cruelty.</TE>

<HD>Defense Argues Killer Is Insane</HD>
<DH>Courts: Lawyer tells jurors in the retrial that it's the
only explanation for why his client set a man on fire outside a San
Fernando store.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A defense attorney asked a San Fernando jury Monday to find a
22-year-old pyromaniac insane for killing a man he set on fire in
1997.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Manuel Carranza of Sylmar was convicted of first-degree
murder and arson last year, but the jury deadlocked on whether he was
insane when the crimes were committed. In the retrial, which is
drawing to a close after a week of testimony, the jury must decide
only that question.</LD>
<LD>   Luciano Olmeda, 45, was drunk and unconscious, propped against a
wall outside a San Fernando convenience store, when Carranza attacked
him May 18, 1997. Carranza kicked him in the face, breaking his jaw,
loosening teeth and causing bleeding on the brain, Deputy Dist. Atty.
Richard Taklender said. He also kicked Olmeda in the groin before
pouring paint thinner in his lap and igniting it.</LD>
<TE>   Olmeda suffered third-degree burns over half his body and died
later that day in a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before the attack, Carranza, who had been diagnosed as a
pyromaniac, started two trash can fires and burned the front doors of
churches in San Fernando and Pacoima, both sides agree.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Meredith C. Taylor could
sentence Carranza to 30 years to life in prison, his attorney, Dale
Rubin, said. Or the ninth-grade dropout could be sent to a mental
institution, possibly for life, if the jury finds him legally insane.</TE>
<TE>   In his closing arguments, Rubin said his client's conduct cannot
be explained, except by insanity.</TE>
<TE>   "If he is not legally insane, why did this happen? What is the
motive?" Rubin said.</TE>
<TE>   He showed jurors a home video of Carranza, then 9, being hit in
the forehead with a baseball bat at a pinata party. He said the blow
may have caused a mental disorder.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin said Carranza hears voices and sees "little faces" in the
flames. The young man blames his victim for dying, the lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   Reading from a medical report, Rubin said Carranza told a
court-appointed doctor, "I didn't kill him. He killed himself."</TE>
<TE>   Carranza said Olmeda should have rolled to put out the flames.</TE>
<TE>   Although he doesn't have a criminal record, Carranza may have been
responsible for as many as 50 fires over the years, Rubin said. At
13, he was apprehended by police for starting a fire at a school but
was never charged, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutor Taklender argued Carranza has never been treated
for a mental disorder, not even while in jail.</TE>
<TE>   He said Carranza is manipulative and cruel and is using an
insanity defense to shun responsibility for killing Olmeda.</TE>
<TE>   "This should be an easy one for you," he told jurors. "There is no
evidence that the defendant was so sick that he didn't know what he
was doing."</TE>
<TE>   Closing arguments are expected to conclude today.</TE>

<HD>Teen Tells of Disabilities After Dental Treatment</HD>
<DH>Testimony: Defendant's former patient says she cannot write
or shower on her own. Prosecutors blame dentist's overuse of an oral
sedative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Slurring her words and moving with difficulty, a young woman told
jurors Monday that brain damage she suffered after a visit to a
Pasadena dentist left her unable to write, tie her shoes or shower on
her own.</LD>
<LD>   Melissa "Missy" McGrath's injuries, prosecutors allege, are the
result of pediatric dentist Drueciel Ford's overuse of an oral
sedative, chloral hydrate. McGrath, 18, who uses a walker, suffered a
heart attack on March 15, 1999, at Ford's office shortly after taking
the sedative.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors allege that Ford's practice resembled a production
line, where over-sedated children were "stacked up like cardboard,"
amounting to child endangerment.</LD>
<TE>   McGrath told the Los Angeles Superior Court jury she cannot recall
the visit to Ford's office. Prosecutors allege that she was
clinically dead for 28 minutes before paramedics resuscitated her.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath, who needs daily therapy, said she can read but cannot
write. Walking and talking "is a lot harder for me now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   McGrath already was seated when jurors entered the room, but
moments earlier in the hall she had struggled past them with her
walker.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Albert MacKenzie said Ford, 50, gave McGrath
six times the maximum dose of chloral hydrate. Ford faces more than
five dozen charges, including numerous counts of felony child
endangerment and one count of conspiracy. She could face more than 30
years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Her attorneys said she gave an acceptable dosage of chloral
hydrate.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, what happened here is a medical misadventure," attorney
Edi M.O. Faal said after McGrath's testimony. "There was a patient
who suffered an adverse reaction while receiving dental treatment.
The issue is: Did Dr. Ford do anything which caused that adverse
medical situation? The answer is no."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys outside court said there is no scientific
evidence to connect the sedative and the heart attack, and that it is
a matter for civil not criminal court.</TE>
<TE>   Under cross-examination by Ford's attorneys, Mike Guerrero, a
dental board investigator, testified that neither he nor Pasadena
police had obtained samples of McGrath's blood taken at the hospital
and never sought a test for levels of chloral hydrate.</TE>
<TE>   Since the trial began in November, prosecutors have called several
of Ford's staffers and patients' parents to the witness stand to show
that children often were over-sedated and released in a rag-doll
state, and that dental assistants did work such as fillings and
crowns illegally. Pasadena Police Officer Jennifer Howlett testified
Monday that she saw two unconscious children in Ford's office moments
after McGrath was taken to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys say Pasadena police and dental investigators
persuaded witnesses to give statements favorable to the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero on Monday testified that initially Dana Harmon, a Ford
assistant, told him she gave McGrath a few teaspoons of chloral
hydrate, within the allowable dosage of 2,000 milligrams. Based on
that statement and other evidence, a prosecutor who headed the Los
Angeles County district attorney's medical case unit in October 1999
rejected the case.</TE>
<TE>   But Guerrero testified that in December 1999, Harmon told him she
lied and it was actually a cup of the sedative. Prosecutors say that
is six times the recommended maximum.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys noted that Harmon by that time had filed a
workers' compensation claim against Ford's practice for job stress,
and the allegation aided her case.</TE>
<TE>   However, Guerrero testified that McGrath's mother, Jan McGrath,
had also told investigators her daughter was given two half-cup
doses.</TE>
<TE>   Jan McGrath was due to testify Monday. But Judge Lance Ito
postponed her appearance because he believed she needed her own
lawyer present. In a separate case, the district attorney's office
has charged her with perjury related to statements she made to
receive welfare benefits. Ford's lawyers said they wished to question
her about her truthfulness.</TE>
<TE>   Ito said her attorney could advise her on whether to testify or at
least whether to answer certain questions using the 5th Amendment
right against self-incrimination.</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Wrap Up Disaster Fund Drive</HD>
<DH>Charity: Local efforts raise $410,000 for families of
comrades killed on Sept. 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boots in hand, hundreds of Ventura County firefighters took to the
streets last fall to raise money for their comrades who were victims
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the Ventura County Professional Firefighters Assn.
announced it had brought in almost $410,000 from passing the boot and
other efforts, including a bachelor auction and golf tournament.</LD>
<LD>   In one October day, the men and women collected more cash in their
boots from passing motorists, $183,000, than from all of the
association's charitable drives the past two years.</LD>
<TE>   There were 344 New York City firefighters who died after two
planes slammed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center and
caused the buildings to collapse. The New York Firefighters 911
Disaster Relief Fund has so far received $128 million, 100% of which
will go to the families of firefighters who died.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters for the cities of Ventura and Oxnard also recently
finished their own fund-raising efforts. The Oxnard firefighters
union usually collects about $5,000 annually, but has received more
than $40,000 since the attacks, said Capt. Bill Gallaher.
Firefighters "usually have a hard time asking people for money, but
the response from people was overwhelming," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Five firefighters from the city of Ventura have already gone to
New York to deliver the $25,000 their co-workers had collected.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law prohibits firefighters working at Naval Base Ventura
County from accepting charitable donations, but many participated in
events at other fire departments in Ventura County, said Rick
Brockman, chief of the base's fire department. Others donated
personally to a federal fund set up after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters say they weren't prepared for the overwhelming
response from people wanting to help victims' families.</TE>
<TE>   Accustomed to the demands of battling blazes, they were suddenly
tracking huge amounts of loose coins and dollar bills, said Capt.
Chris Mahon of the Ventura County Fire Department, president of the
Ventura County Professional Firefighters Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Automobile trunks were loaded down with sacks of coins and wads of
dollar bills, and all that cash made firefighters nervous, Mahon
said. "Guys were sweating bullets," recalled Mahon, who works at a
fire station in Oak View.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters had difficulty finding banks in Ventura County that
would count the large bounty of coin dollars, quarters, nickels and
pennies. But no one lost sight of the goal.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an almost immediate understanding that New York Fire
had suffered a huge loss and it would be beyond their means to cope,"
Mahon said. "It was our desire to help and do whatever we could."</TE>
<TE>   About half of the nearly $410,000 has already been distributed to
the New York firefighters relief fund, Mahon said. The rest will be
turned over to the fund during a February dinner event in Simi
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Kaufmann, a Thousand Oaks firefighter, had become friends
with John Moran, a battalion chief with the New York City Fire
Department's special operations unit who died when the towers
collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufmann and other county firefighters will present a check to
Moran's brother Mike, also a New York firefighter. "If there was
someone to pattern your life after, it would be John. He was a role
model," Kaufmann said.</TE>

<HD>Official's Bribery Charges Dismissed</HD>
<DH>Court: Federal judge rules lack of jurisdiction, but keeps
mail fraud counts in highway billboard case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUGLAS HABERMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Monday threw out bribery charges against San
Bernardino County Supervisor Jerry Eaves but kept in place mail fraud
charges.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Court Judge Manuel Real also dismissed all bribery
charges against billboard company owner William Shepardson McCook,
the businessman Eaves and others allegedly conspired with and
received bribes from, according to a federal indictment.</LD>
<LD>   Real said the bribery charges lacked any connection to federal
programs or dollars, so federal prosecutors lacked jurisdiction over
that portion of the case. He indicated it would have been more
appropriate for state prosecutors to bring bribery charges against
Eaves. The 17 counts against McCook had included charges he bribed
several Colton city officials, none of whom remain in office, as well
as San Bernardino County's former top administrator, James Hlawek.
McCook allegedly wanted permission to place billboards along
Interstate 10 on county flood control land within the city of Colton,
according to the indictment.</LD>
<TE>   McCook faces no additional charges at this time.</TE>
<TE>   Two former Colton City Council members, Abe Beltran and Donald
Sanders, already pleaded guilty to federal bribery charges, based in
part on allegations McCook bribed them. They have not been sentenced.</TE>
<TE>   One of Eaves' attorneys, Arthur Lemann of New Orleans, said after
Monday's hearing that he expects these men may seek to withdraw their
pleas in light of Real's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling, after a hearing that lasted less than an hour, leaves
Eaves facing six federal felony mail fraud charges.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy," he said. "I said all along I thought the system
would work, and this shows it does work."</TE>
<TE>   The mail fraud charges allege Eaves mailed statements of economic
interests to the state Fair Political Practices Commission that
failed to disclose gifts from McCook. Eaves voted on matters
concerning McCook, but voters didn't know of this alleged conflict of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   "The use of the mails makes it a federal offense," Real said.</TE>
<TE>   The gifts from McCook were hotel stays in Las Vegas for Eaves and
some of Eaves' children and colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Eaves' trial on the mail fraud charges is set for April 16.</TE>

<HD>Henry Escalante, 86; Movie Stuntman</HD>

<LD>Henry "Blackie" Escalante, scion of a family of circus trapeze
artists who went on to become a Hollywood stuntman, doubling for such
stars as Johnny Weissmuller in "Tarzan" films, has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Escalante died Wednesday in a Montebello hospice of complications
of Alzheimer's disease, said his niece, Louisa Caucia. She is working
on a documentary about the family Escalante Brothers Circus, which
flourished in the 1930s.</LD>
<LD>   Reared in the Boyle Heights area of East Los Angeles, Escalante
was the great-grandson of a circus owner in Mexico and grandson of
Mariano Escalante, who founded the Escalante Brothers Circus after
the family moved to Los Angeles in 1911.</LD>
<TE>   Like his grandfather, father and uncles, Henry Escalante mastered
the trapeze and "flew" with the family circus and others.</TE>
<TE>   As the popularity of circuses waned in the West, Escalante veered
successfully into Hollywood stunt work. Caucia said he was one of the
first Mexican Americans presenting a positive image on screen.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Weissmuller, Escalante worked with the Marx
Brothers in "At the Circus."</TE>
<TE>   Escalante remained before the cameras for more than four decades,
performing various character roles, as well as acrobatic and other
stunts. He was a pirate in the 1944 film "Frenchman's Creek"; an
Italian named Brutus in the 1950 "Captain Carey, U.S.A.," starring
Alan Ladd; and an acrobat in the 1953 "Salome: The Dance of the Seven
Veils," starring Rita Hayworth. He was cast as boat crewman Chico in
the 1954 cult favorite "Creature from the Black Lagoon."</TE>
<TE>   After other feature films such as "Hell's Island" (later released
as "South Sea Fury"), "The Three Outlaws" and "Sol Madrid," Escalante
had a successful run in guest roles on television. He appeared on
such action series as "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.," "Mission Impossible"
and "Hart to Hart," and as recently as 1981 in "The Fall Guy."</TE>
<TE>   Escalante is survived by his wife, Sylvia; two daughters, Louise
McPherson of Vancouver Island, Canada, and Sandra Escalante of La
Crescenta; one sister, Mrs. Johnny Cline of Lakeland, Fla.; five
grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. His son, Henry Jr., died
earlier this month of asthmatic complications.</TE>
<TE>   Mass is scheduled at 10 a.m. today at St. Alphonses Church, 532 S.
Atlantic Blvd., Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that any memorial donations be sent to the
Alzheimer's Assn.</TE>

<HD>Party Politics Enters Race for D.A.</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Bamieh tries to rally Republicans at a candidates
forum. Totten objects, saying the office is nonpartisan with good
reason.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>District attorney candidate Ron Bamieh tried to whip up support among
fellow Republicans on Monday by telling a group his election would
benefit the party and bring needed change to the prosecutor's office.</LD>
<LD>   "We are going to win this election on March 5," Bamieh said. "Not
only will this county benefit, but our party will benefit."</LD>
<LD>   Bamieh's remarks outraged opponent Greg Totten, who avoided any
discussion of partisan politics at a noon forum between the
candidates at the Sterling Hills Country Club in Camarillo.</LD>
<TE>   "I am a lifelong Republican," Totten said after the forum. "But a
district attorney is a nonpartisan office for good reason: Lady
Justice wears a blindfold. That means that in the administration of
justice, partisan politics has no place."</TE>
<TE>   The two candidates spoke before members and guests of Camarillo
Republican Women Federated, touting their experience as tough
prosecutors, while offering different views on how best to lead the
district attorney's office. The men later fielded questions about the
death penalty and California's penal system.</TE>
<TE>   Totten and Bamieh are vying to replace retiring Dist. Atty.
Michael D. Bradbury in a costly and bitterly contentious race.</TE>
<TE>   Totten, the 47-year-old second-in-command in the district
attorney's office, has won key endorsements from labor unions, local
politicians and law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   But Bamieh, an aggressive 36-year-old prosecutor and son of a
well-connected GOP contributor, has spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars--most of it donated by his father--to get his name before
Ventura County voters.</TE>
<TE>   One mailer sent out this week pictures Bamieh in a tuxedo standing
next to former President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara.
Bamieh previously worked as a Bush appointee in the U.S. Department
of Justice.</TE>
<TE>   The mailer features a message from former state Sen. Cathie Wright
of Simi Valley touting Bamieh as a candidate "committed to building
our Republican party."</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh has sent a different mailer to Democrats and produced a
third targeting Latino voters.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at Monday's forum, Bamieh discussed the need to boost
voter registration countywide, particularly in Latino neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "Reach out with me because that is where I am going," he said. "As
Republicans, we want to be the party of this county."</TE>
<TE>   After the forum, Bamieh said he has been talking to
disenfranchised residents in Santa Paula, Fillmore and Oxnard and
encouraging them to vote on election day.</TE>
<TE>   Bamieh said his mailers are targeting 55,000 households countywide
and are part of a goal to improve voter turnout regardless of party
affiliation.</TE>
<TE>   Totten predicted his opponent's tactic would backfire.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pandering," Totten said, "and it's shameless."</TE>

<HD>10 Arrested at Submarine Base</HD>
<DH>Point Loma: Suspected illegal immigrants were doing
painting work. Six found to be legal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD and TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>U.S. Border Patrol agents in San Diego arrested 10 suspected illegal
immigrants who were working at the Point Loma Submarine Base,
authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The arrestees, whose names and nationalities were not immediately
made available, were employed by a private firm that had been hired
by a separate Navy contractor, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The workers were chipping and painting on a dry dock at the base
and were not aboard a Navy ship, officials said. Navy officials said
the border agents were undergoing training on the oiler Tippecanoe on
Sunday when they noticed the workers and decided to check their
immigration status.</LD>
<TE>   Navy spokesman Cmdr. Dave Koontz said responsibility for checking
the immigration status of civilian workers rests with the contractor,
not the military. Before the workers came onto the facility, where
nuclear-powered submarines are based, security guards checked
identification cards against a list of names provided to the Navy by
the contractor.</TE>
<TE>   The use of private contractors on bases and ships is increasingly
commonplace as the Navy tries to lift menial duties such as painting
from enlisted personnel.</TE>
<TE>   "The Point Loma security guys did their job by the book," Koontz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the workers were employed by Coastal Coating
Inc., a National City-based firm. Company officials were not
available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Navy Cmdr. Al Green said that a check of records of the prime
contractor, Southwest Marine, turned up documents indicating that six
of the workers were in the country legally.</TE>
<TE>   Special agents of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
were interviewing the arrestees, said Lauren Mack, a spokeswoman for
the INS in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "Our special agents were called in to the case. They are
interviewing them and will make a determination into whether any
further investigation is warranted, or if there is special interest"
in the case, Mack said.</TE>
<TE>   Such an investigation could include looking into their employer,
pursuing suspected terrorism links or examining whether a smuggling
ring was involved in sneaking the suspects into the country, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Border Patrol spokesman Merv Mason said he did not have
information on the nationalities of the detainees.</TE>
<TE>   He said officers involved in the arrests were not immediately
available to provide details on the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have specifics as the hows and whys of the situation.
It's an ongoing investigation," Mason said.</TE>

<HD>Third Youth Hit by Truck That Jumped Curb Dies</HD>
<DH>Accident: The boy was among five who were struck while
walking home from a store. Four were from same family.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A third young person died Monday from an accident in which a driver
apparently lost control of his pickup truck and plowed into a group
of five walking home from a store in Lawndale, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Coroner's spokesman Scott Carrier identified the victim as Jayshun
Williams, 12, of Lawndale. Killed in the accident Sunday night were
his cousin, Dino Downs Jr., 18, and Downs' girlfriend, Antonisha
Beverly, 18, both of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Severely injured, according to relatives, were Jerone Downs, 13,
and Lawrence Scott, 8, of Lawndale.</LD>
<TE>   William Coy, 41, of Hawthorne is being held in jail on suspicion
of first-degree murder and drunk driving, a sheriff's spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Motor Vehicles said Coy had a clean
driving record before Sunday's accident.</TE>
<TE>   Coy's truck struck the five victims about 7 p.m. when he turned
into a gas station at Inglewood Avenue and 160th Street. After
veering away from the pumps, the pickup hit the young people and
struck a shed, demolishing it.</TE>
<TE>   The grandmother of four victims, including two who died, said
those who survived described a scene of sudden terror.</TE>
<TE>   Josie Murchison of Torrance was not at the gas station, but heard
what happened from her injured 13- and 8-year-old grandchildren. They
told her the driver tried to flee the scene, but was held down by
bystanders until police and rescue workers arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those hit lived around the corner, on 159th Street, from
where the accident occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Scott "ran home in shock, where his mother noticed blood
on his shirt," Murchison said. "When she opened his shirt, he had a
hole in his chest.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the kids went to the store. They were on the way home when
this happened." She said she spent part of Monday visiting the two
grandchildren who survived the accident.</TE>
<TE>   The 13-year-old underwent surgery Monday morning, but remained in
critical condition at county Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. The
8-year-old was upgraded from serious to stable condition at the same
hospital.</TE>

<HD>Federal Plan for Water in Klamath Basin Is Accused of
Favoring Farmers Over Fish</HD>
<DH>Dispute: The proposal, environmentalists say, will hurt
fishermen, tribes and endangered species. Officials counter that it
would alleviate tension in the region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A proposal heralded as a first step by the Bush administration to
cure the Klamath Basin's heated water war came under criticism Monday
from environmentalists who say it favors farmers over endangered
fish.</LD>
<LD>   Foes say the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's draft blueprint for the
next 10 years seems motivated by a desire to test the limits of the
federal Endangered Species Act, not to help revive sagging fish
populations in Upper Klamath Lake and the river downstream.</LD>
<LD>   "James Watt would be proud of this plan," said Reed Benson,
executive director of Oregon WaterWatch, a Portland environmental
group. "The Bush administration is creatively ignoring their duties
to commercial fishermen, tribes and endangered species."</LD>
<TE>   Officials at the bureau, which for nearly a century has operated
the network of canals and culverts for agriculture in the Klamath
area, countered that they are trying to avoid a reprise of last
summer's vitriolic fight.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett Raley, an assistant secretary for the Interior Department
who oversees the bureau, emphasized that the document released Monday
is only a draft and that the snap judgments by critics are
"absolutely not founded."</TE>
<TE>   Raley said the draft contains several innovative concepts intended
to ease tensions in the fight over water in the basin. Those include
proposals to help fish in dry years by buying water from willing
sellers, including farmers in the Klamath Basin. In addition, the
agency talks of shifting irrigation practices to make better use of
winter runoff that otherwise drains out of the basin, upgrade water
quality and improve wetlands that act as nurseries for fish.</TE>
<TE>   Raley said the bureau wants "to turn this basin back to a place
where the communities can work together."</TE>
<TE>   For the past year, the region has been whipsawed by strife. In the
face of a fearsome drought, farmers were told their traditionally
plentiful irrigation supplies would be virtually suspended because of
concerns over the survival of two species of suckerfish in Upper
Klamath Lake and coho salmon downstream.</TE>
<TE>   Klamath's agricultural community mounted a summer-long siege of
protests, including several successful attempts by demonstrators to
crank open the head gates that block the flow of water to farms.</TE>
<TE>   This year looked to be more promising, given a far more abundant
snowpack in the sprawling drainage basin of the Klamath as well as
new public resolve by all sides to work toward a solution.</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists, fishermen and Native American tribal
leaders said the draft "environmental assessment" released by the
bureau seemed to undo all goodwill.</TE>
<TE>   Klamath Tribal Chairman Allen Foreman called the document "just
another empty promise" that would undercut tribal water rights and
hurt the suckerfish, which once served as a source of food and
remains part of the tribe's cultural heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Felice Pace of the Klamath Forest Alliance said the draft seemed
"motivated by high-level political agendas" that, if enacted, would
represent "a clear signal that the Bush administration intends to
aggressively dismantle the Endangered Species Act" and tribal water
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Release of the draft marks the start of a flurry of activity that
should by April 1 decide how the water is divided between fish and
farmers. The bureau document is open to public comment until Feb. 8,
then will be forwarded to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Agency and the
National Marine Fisheries Service, which have the scientific
responsibility for determining whether changes are needed to ensure
the survival of the suckerfish and salmon.</TE>
<TE>   By the start of the April planting season, the bureau would be
expected to release an operations document telling farmers how much
water they can expect during the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   In a related matter, a land-rights advocacy group is planning to
file a lawsuit this week challenging the federal endangered species
listing of the coho salmon in the Klamath River.</TE>
<TE>   The Sacramento-based Pacific Legal Foundation plans to use the
same tactic it deployed to successfully challenge the salmon's status
on the Oregon coast. The group argued in federal court that
biologists failed to make a valid argument that discernible
differences exist between plentiful farm-spawned salmon and their
scarce wild cousins.</TE>

<DH>Violence: Family of mentally ill woman files a $25-million

<LD>An attorney for relatives of a mentally ill woman shot to death by
Long Beach police after she allegedly raised a knife at them accused
the Police Department on Monday of "executing" her.</LD>
<LD>   The attorney, John E. Sweeney, also filed a $25-million claim
against the city of Long Beach. Such claims are normally rejected,
leading to lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Officers encountered Marcella Byrd after responding to a report on
Jan. 19 that a woman had left a market without paying.</LD>
<TE>   Sweeney said police have improperly characterized Byrd "as a
300-pound, out-of-control behemoth who knocked over a grocery store
and tried to make a getaway." In fact, he said, "she was closer to
260 pounds, stood 4 feet, 5 1/2 inches tall. She was a kind, gentle
person who was diagnosed 20 years ago as having schizophrenia.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this was nothing less than a summary execution."</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, 57, had been in and out of mental institutions and
patient-care programs, the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   The claim contends that the city "negligently hired, trained,
managed and/or supervised each of the Long Beach officers involved in
this incident, leading to actions, failures to act and negligent
conduct."</TE>
<TE>   It also alleges that the city "should have known" that each of the
officers who shot Byrd "was an aggressive and dangerous officer."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Police Department spokesman Sgt. Steve Filippini
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach City Atty. Robert Shannon said, "We believe it was a
legitimate police response, but our own investigation is continuing."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, authorities said they had no choice but to shoot the
knife-wielding woman.</TE>
<TE>   Police repeatedly ordered Byrd to stop and drop the steak knife as
they followed her toward the bustling downtown Pine Avenue restaurant
district.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, a resident of a downtown seniors apartment complex, ignored
the commands. Fearing Byrd posed a public threat, police initially
fired beanbags, which seemed to have little effect, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd was shot several times in the torso after she raised the
knife to a throwing position, authorities said. Long Beach Fire
Department paramedics took her to a hospital, where she died during
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Byrd's son, Tirus Parhms, said, "I'm still in
shock. I can't understand it. My mother was not a threat to anyone."</TE>

<HD>Astrid Lindgren, 94; Creator of Pippi Longstocking
Adventures</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Tell me a story," begged 7-year-old Karin, who was bedridden with
pneumonia. "Tell me about Pippi Longstocking."</LD>
<LD>   Her mother creatively complied, and a few years later when she was
bedridden with her own problem--a twisted ankle from a fall--she
wrote down all the stories she had invented for the fictional child
her daughter had impulsively named.</LD>
<LD>   One of the most popular children's authors in the world was
launched right along with the colorful character.</LD>
<TE>   Astrid Ericsson Lindgren, the self-described "mother" of freckled
Pippi Longstocking whose prodigious writing includes some 115 books,
a dozen plays, two dozen screenplays, plus songs and poems, and whose
satirical letters reduced Swedish taxes and prompted an animal rights
law, has died. She was 94.</TE>
<TE>   Lindgren died Monday in her sleep at her home in Stockholm.No
specific cause of death was reported, but she had been ill for
several days.</TE>
<TE>   Her written works have sold more than 130 million copies around
the globe and have been translated into more than 60 languages, from
Afrikaans to Zulu. More than 40 feature films and television series
have been based on Lindgren's stories, including the critically
panned Americanized "The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking" in
1988.</TE>
<TE>   Lindgren's plethora of awards included the 1958 Hans Christian
Andersen Medal, the most prestigious international award in
children's literature, for her book "Rasmus and the Vagabond."</TE>
<TE>   On Lindgren's 80th birthday, Sweden honored her by issuing a
series of 49 stamps based on her characters.</TE>
<TE>   And Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson visited to say her
published letters to him pleading such wisdom as "Every pig is
entitled to a happy pig life" had won him over.</TE>
<TE>   The Animal Protection Law, to be popularly known as Lex Astrid, he
told her, would curb abuses of Sweden's "factory farming" in which
livestock were immobilized in barns and slaughtered inhumanely.</TE>
<TE>   The law, passed in 1988, earned Lindgren the Albert Schweitzer
Award of the Animal Welfare Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Her other major political victory occurred a decade or so earlier,
and resulted partly from her success as an author. In 1976, Lindgren
faced a 102% tax on her income. Irate that she had to "pay to write
books," she penned a biting satire for a Stockholm newspaper
criticizing the Social Democratic Party, which had ruled Sweden for
more than four decades. Titled "Pomperipossa In the World of Money,"
her article is credited with reducing the tax and defeating the party
in that election.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the postage stamps, Sweden created a theme park in
1989 featuring settings from Lindgren's books and later established
Astrid Lindgren's Children's Hospital, one of the biggest such
hospitals in northern Europe.</TE>
<TE>   But Lindgren's most durable contribution to humankind
unquestionably remains her children's stories.</TE>
<TE>   She taught readers they could be brave even when scared--like the
fatherless boy in "Mio, My Son," who fights evil in the Land Far
Away, and "The Brothers Lionheart" in which young Rusky proves
himself just as courageous as his older brother.</TE>
<TE>   The author's personal favorite of all her creations was Emil, the
5-year-old imp of "Emil in the Soup Tureen," "Emil's Pranks" and
"Emil and Piggy Beast," based on tales her father told of his own
childhood escapades.</TE>
<TE>   Another well-known protagonist--an adult--was
"Karlsson-On-the-Roof" who had a propeller on his back, conveniently
enabling him to fly from his penthouse apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Pippi Longstocking (Laangstrump in Swedish), however, remains
Lindgren's internationally best-known and most beloved character.</TE>
<TE>   "Way out at the end of a tiny little town was an old overgrown
garden, and in the garden was an old house, and in the house lived
Pippi Longstocking. She was nine years old, and she lived there all
alone," began the first book originally published in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   Irrepressible Pippi had braids that stuck straight out, one black
and one brown stocking, and shoes "exactly twice as long as her
feet." With a dead mother and a ship's captain father away at sea,
she spent her time with a monkey named Mr. Nilsson and a horse named
Alfonso that she kept on the porch.</TE>
<TE>   She slept with her feet on the pillow and her head under the
quilt, never went to school, and was so strong she could toss
bullies, robbers and interfering policemen high in the air or off her
property as needed. A chest full of gold in the kitchen of her Villa
Villekulla paid for her necessities.</TE>
<TE>   Pippi's international popularity has long been attributed to
fulfilling every child's fantasy of rebelling against authority.</TE>
<TE>   But Lindgren was adamant that she did not create Pippi or any of
her other characters with their needs in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't write books for children," she once told the New Yorker.
"I write books for the child I am myself."</TE>
<TE>   Astrid Anna Emilia Ericsson was born Nov. 14, 1907, on a farm
called Naas near Vimmerby in the rolling Swedish countryside of
Smaaland.</TE>
<TE>   The setting and her happy childhood with three siblings and a
continuing stream of hired field hands and household help who told
little Astrid stories and read her fairy tales greatly influenced
Lindgren's future writing.</TE>
<TE>   Her first job was as a reporter and critic for the Vimmerby
newspaper. At 19, pregnant and unmarried, she left her shocked little
community for Stockholm, where she took secretarial training and
worked as a secretary to support her son, Lars.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, she married Sture Lindgren, an executive with
the Royal Swedish Automobile Club where she worked.</TE>
<TE>   They added a daughter, Karin, to the family, and Lindgren became a
housewife and mother, making up stories for her children but writing
nothing other than a couple of automobile travel guides.</TE>
<TE>   Then came little Karin's request in 1941. Always writing in
shorthand, Lindgren put the Pippi stories into manuscript form three
years later--only to be rejected by a publisher.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, she submitted the teen story "Britt-Mari Opens Her Heart"
to a contest sponsored by the Raben &amp; Sjorgen publishing firm. The
book won second prize and became her first to be published.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, she won top prize with "Pippi Longstocking"
and also went to work as children's book editor for Raben &amp; Sjorgen
from 1946 to 1970.</TE>
<TE>   With her eyesight failing, the author who turned out at least one
remarkable book after another each year from the 1940s through the
1980s largely abandoned writing after the 1988 "The Ghost of Skinny
Jack."</TE>
<TE>   Widowed in 1952, Lindgren was also preceded in death by her son.
She is survived by her daughter, Karin Nyman; seven grandchildren;
and several great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>South Gate Councilwoman's Silence Disturbs Critics</HD>
<DH>Profile: Even as chaos boils around her, Maria Benavides
rarely speaks. Now the woman some call the 'meow lady' is the target
of a political corruption probe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>South Gate quakes with political upheaval, public meetings degenerate
into ugly shouting matches and investigators have raided City Hall
searching for illegal weapons. But even as the chaos boils around
her, Maria Benavides stays silent.</LD>
<LD>   The councilwoman has rarely addressed her public. When casting
controversial votes, she offers no explanation. When mocked by
residents with meowing sounds--a caustic reference to her soft,
cat-like voice, she stares blankly.</LD>
<LD>   If residents press her to answer questions, the mayor and city
attorney cut them off in mid-sentence. Maria, they say, doesn't have
to answer.</LD>
<TE>   But Benavides may soon have some explaining to do.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, investigators in the district attorney's office
launched a political corruption inquiry, suspecting her of lying
about her home address to run for office.</TE>
<TE>   Benavides has not been charged. But the investigation deepens the
intrigue surrounding the improbable political career of the woman
some residents have dubbed the "meow lady."</TE>
<TE>   Benavides, a 29-year-old beautician, breaks with the popular image
of long-winded, small-city politicians who live for access to
microphones and captive audiences.</TE>
<TE>   Her silence mystifies and troubles people for different reasons in
the working-class city of 96,000. Is she a puppet, disturbingly
indifferent to civic life? Or a well-intentioned politician gagged by
intimidation?</TE>
<TE>   To her many critics, she is the carefully scripted creation of a
corrupt political machine that shields her from the media and
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody gets to talk to her. We've all asked. You're not allowed,"
said 82-year-old Mildred Ward.</TE>
<TE>   But supporters call her a caring, misunderstood mother of two.
Vice Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba, Benavides' cousin, said hostile crowds
at council meetings have soured Benavides' experience in public life.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a politician, but she doesn't like politics," Ruvalcaba
said.</TE>
<TE>   Benavides was elected in November 2000. Her campaign portrayed her
as a victim of pollution at a time when most voters vehemently
opposed the construction of a power plant in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Her father, according to one mailer, died from a chemical fire.
And when she was 8, her mother died of cancer, possibly because of
pollutants, the mailer said.  Her opponents say the campaign was
based on a deceptive ploy to gain voters' sympathy. They agree that
Benavides was orphaned, but they say her father died in a house fire,
her mother of natural causes.</TE>
<TE>   Benavides' campaign relied heavily on mailers, and her opponents
say she did not attend candidate forums or public events. Even so,
she won in a landslide, with 51% of the votes, 3,000 more than the
nearest of her three competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Her election dramatically changed the course of the city. She
became the swing vote on the five-person council, and the majority
embarked on a series of moves that infuriated many residents.</TE>
<TE>   They ousted several city officials, tripled their own salaries and
approved a massage parlor despite heavy opposition from church
groups. They also started exploring whether to dissolve the Police
Department and contract with the Sheriff's Department for law
enforcement services.</TE>
<TE>   Council meetings--attended by many off-duty officers--have turned
into rowdy shouting matches as people have protested, jeered and
heaped insults on the majority and city officials.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the chaos, Benavides' expression reveals nothing. A short,
brown-haired woman usually cloaked in a black leather jacket, she
leaves her thick agenda binder open, but rarely turns the pages.</TE>
<TE>   And while her allies--Ruvalcaba and Mayor Raul Moriel--sometimes
comment before voting, Benavides rarely talks except to say four
words: "yes," "no," "present" and "second [the vote]."</TE>
<TE>   After the mayor asked police to warn residents not to mock her by
meowing, critics brought signs reading "meow" and waved them at her.
Some still meow anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Getting Benavides to say anything has become almost an obsession
with some residents. City officials say they don't have her telephone
number, nor does the Police Department, which has responsibility for
notifying city officials of emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   Readers of the city directory are told to contact Ruvalcaba if
they want to reach Benavides. Frustrated by it all, some residents
have tried to challenge Benavides at council meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to ask a question of Mrs. Benavides, but you cannot
get hold of her any time during the daytime unless you go through Ms.
Ruvalcaba," said 70-year-old Shirley Bobrick, standing at the lectern
during a dispute with the mayor last week.</TE>
<TE>   "You can leave a message," Moriel suggested.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to leave a message. Then it goes to Ms. Ruvalcaba,
and Mrs. Benavides does not answer," Bobrick replied.</TE>
<TE>   Watching from the dais, inches from her microphone, Benavides said
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you afraid to let Mrs. Benavides talk?" Bobrick asked.</TE>
<TE>   Moriel did not respond, and threatened to have Bobrick removed
from the chamber. Then Bobrick told the mayor to "go to hell," and
stomped back to her seat to the cheers of residents.</TE>
<TE>   Benavides never uttered a word.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last year, Ruvalcaba said Benavides has been
frightened by hostile crowds. It started with her first council
meeting when, Ruvalcaba said, she was jostled while on the way to the
dais.</TE>
<TE>   "She's not a woman who is strong like me. She doesn't like to
fight," Ruvalcaba said.</TE>
<TE>   But that explanation rings hollow with some in a community where
activists and politicians have been shot and seen their businesses
firebombed.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't tell me about intimidation," said Councilman Hector De La
Torre, whose ally, former Mayor Henry Gonzalez, was shot in the head
in 1999. (Gonzalez was not seriously wounded in the crime, which has
not been solved.)</TE>
<TE>   "The public does not prevent [Benavides] from saying more than
four words at council meetings," De La Torre said. "Don't tell me
you're intimidated by a senior citizen, a petite senior citizen at
that."</TE>
<TE>   Benavides remains a puzzle to most of her constituents, and some
residents of the largely Latino city have asked aloud whether she
speaks English. She does. A divorcee, she is said to live with her
two children in a cottage behind her mother's home on Santa Ana
Street.</TE>
<TE>   Residents have trouble finding out how she raises funds: Her
campaign finance information is not on file at City Hall, as required
by law.</TE>
<TE>   The electoral fraud investigation is believed to stem from
Benavides' stating in a divorce settlement that she lived in El Monte
at the time of the 2000 campaign.</TE>
<TE>   If she is indicted, even some critics say they would sympathize
with her, believing that she has been manipulated.</TE>
<TE>   "The poor thing, I feel sorry for her, because I don't think she
realizes what she's gotten herself into," Ward said.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach Benavides for comment were unsuccessful.
Ruvalcaba, her contact, did not return phone calls.</TE>

<HD>2 State Teachers Receive Honors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES EDUCATION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two California educators known for promoting opportunities for
minorities are among the winners of the 2001 Harold W. McGraw Jr.
Prize in education, one of the most prestigious honors in the field.</LD>
<LD>   One of the winners is Carl W. Cohn, 56, chief of the
96,000-student Long Beach Unified School District, who is the
longest-serving head of an urban district in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   After 10 years at that post, he plans to leave this summer for a
teaching position at USC.</LD>
<TE>   The other California winner is Mary Catherine Swanson, 57, founder
of the AVID program, based in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   AVID stands for Advancing Via Individual Determination, and its
focus is on helping underachieving low-income and minority students
get ready for college.</TE>
<TE>   The prizes, which carry a $25,000 award, are to be announced in
New York today.</TE>
<TE>   Under Cohn, the Long Beach district has often been ahead of
national reform trends.</TE>
<TE>   Among its firsts: requiring students to wear uniforms, sending
third-graders with reading difficulties to summer school and
diverting struggling eighth-graders to an academic prep school for a
year before high school.</TE>
<TE>   But Cohn said Monday that he was proudest of forging a solid
working relationship with the district's governing board.</TE>
<TE>   "We've stayed together as a team, and that's allowed us to spend a
lot of time on academic improvement," Cohn said.</TE>
<TE>   Test scores have gone up significantly in the last three years in
the district, where the student population is 45% Latino, 20% black,
18% white and 12% Asian.</TE>
<TE>   Swanson was honored for founding AVID in 1980 and the program's
subsequent growth. It now serves 65,000 students in 21 states and 15
foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   The program uses mentors to teach students the value of hard work
to develop good study habits and strong test-taking skills.</TE>
<TE>   The third winner of the 2001 McGraw prize is Freeman A. Hrabowski
III, president of the Baltimore County campus of the University of
Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Hrabowski founded a program to increase opportunities for aspiring
African American scientists, engineers and mathematicians.</TE>
<TE>   The McGraw prize is named for the chairman emeritus of the
McGraw-Hill publishing companies.</TE>
<TE>   Former winners of the 13-year-old annual prize include Secretary
of Education Rod Paige, former first lady Barbara Bush, North
Carolina Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. and Los Angeles Unified School
District Supt. Roy Romer.</TE>

<HD>Costa Mesa Man Faces 22 Molestation Counts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A convicted Costa Mesa sex offender, who was reportedly planning to
make a bid for freedom next month from a state psychiatric hospital,
has been charged with 22 counts of sexually abusing a boy five years
ago, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County prosecutors allege that Cary Jay Smith, 41, molested
a neighbor he had befriended over a six-month period beginning in
September 1996. Prosecutors said the boy, whose name was withheld,
was younger than 14 when the abuse started, but they declined to
elaborate.</LD>
<LD>   In an unusual twist, authorities said, they were tipped off to the
alleged molestation by a private investigator who had interviewed
Smith in the hospital, telling Smith he planned to write a book about
the patient's life. But after Smith told him grisly details about
crimes he said he had committed, the investigator called detectives.</LD>
<TE>   The new charges, which carry a maximum sentence of 50 years in
prison, are likely to derail Smith's chances of getting released
soon, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a very dangerous individual who should not be out on the
streets with children or anybody else," Deputy Dist. Atty. Beth
Costello said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was convicted in 1983 of a misdemeanor charge involving a
child that required him to register as a sex offender.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Smith was committed to Patton State Hospital in San
Bernardino after his wife found a letter describing detailed sexual
fantasies he wanted to fulfill with a 7-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   Once he had been admitted, doctors at the hospital said, Smith
spoke to them about molesting as many as 200 children, but detectives
were unable to corroborate any of the claims.</TE>
<TE>   Patients at Patton can request release every six months. If
hospital officials reject the request, the patient can appeal by
demanding a jury trial to resolve the matter. In 2000, Smith asked an
Orange County jury to approve his release and was turned down.</TE>
<TE>   After the verdict, a private investigator befriended Smith and
fooled him into discussing details of his alleged crimes, Costello
said. Many of the claims, which included murders of children, proved
bogus. But detectives were able to find one victim, the prosecutor
said.</TE>
<TE>   Costello said she did not know who had hired the private
investigator, but stressed that he was not working on behalf of
police or Smith's alleged victim.</TE>
<TE>   Smith was planning a second attempt to win his release at a
hearing next month, she said. He is expected to be arraigned Feb. 11
and will remain in Orange County Jail pending the outcome of his
criminal case.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The district attorney's office filed a civil lawsuit Monday against
three auto repair shops that allegedly charged for unneeded car
repairs and parts not replaced.</LD>
<LD>   The defendants are Goodyear Advanced Tire and Service at 25502
Marguerite Parkway, Mission Viejo; El Toro Tire &amp; Service at 23211
Cherry Ave., Lake Forest; and Quality Care Auto at 2705 S. Grand
Ave., Santa Ana. Also named as a defendant was Homayon Bakhtar, owner
of the three repair shops. Bakhtar could not be reached late Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit alleges that the shops misled customers about repairs
needed, and sometimes charged for parts not installed.</LD>
<TE>   The state Department of Consumer Affairs sent seven undercover
agents to the three shops from October 1999 to March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The shops allegedly charged a total of $3,809 in unneeded repairs
and parts invoiced but not replaced.</TE>

<HD>Beware of Lumpy Envelopes, Especially the Ones From Real
Estate Agents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anthrax fears have lessened, but one West L.A. real estate agent is
taking no chances. He labeled his lumpy envelopes "Refrigerator
Magnet--SAFE TO OPEN."</LD>
<LD>   Of course, no such guarantee was needed if, like me, you toss out
all real estate agents' letters unopened.</LD>
<LD>   Such a deal: Today's questionable bargains (see accompanying)
include a body treatment that sounds painful (from Suzanne Phillips
of L.A.), a coupon worth one half of a cent (from Lee Wade of South
Gate) and some scary-sounding tires (snapped by Steve Wong of West
L.A.).</LD>
<TE>   Second lives: The item here about a defunct Islanders restaurant
that became Slanders restaurant through a bit of sign editing was
obviously no isolated case.</TE>
<TE>   Ty Wood recalled that when he was delivering beverages in San
Bernardino County, one of his customers was "a bar that was
originally the Oasis. But the 'O' had fallen off and so the name had
been changed to the As Is."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Proctor nominated an L.A. bar called Sports that was relieved
of its "S" by a new owner "and voila! Instant atmosphere: Ports!"</TE>
<TE>   And Neil Cuadra remembered a Farrell's ice cream shop in Woodland
Hills whose new owners changed the name "to Barrell's by filling in
the right side of the 'F.'"</TE>
<TE>   Added Cuadra: "I would give them a B for frugality but an F for
spelling."</TE>
<TE>   Al's Bar lives! Sort of. The grungy downtown L.A. rock joint
itself has shut down. But former owner Marc Kreisel has created an
Al's Bar Collection, consisting of works by downtown artists as well
as artifacts from his old dive.</TE>
<TE>   The collection will be displayed at L.A. Harbor College next
month, but some priceless mementos of Al's are missing.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a police report out," Kreisel told the L.A. Downtown
News. "There are only a few things I want returned: the cover for the
pool table, the door to the women's bathroom.... "</TE>
<TE>   Memories.</TE>
<TE>   Disconnected: The police log of the Irvine World News listed a
complaint involving kids brandishing cell phones "in a threatening
manner." Were they threatening to make separate calls in a
restaurant? I know I would flee the scene in terror.</TE>
<TE>   Stupid driving tricks: I'm guilty of this infraction and, yes, it
involved my cell phone. I was driving balls at the Dominguez Golf
Course in Carson on Saturday afternoon when I lost my phone.</TE>
<TE>   I recovered it through the efforts of course starter Bryant
Gonzales, who not only took my name and number but asked each group
going out to play afterward to watch for the missing gadget.</TE>
<TE>   A Golfing Samaritan turned it in the next day. In the meantime, I
had placed a dozen calls to the phone, silently cursing each time I
heard my cheerful voice on the recorded message. Luckily, I have free
weekend minutes.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Are you excited about the playoff prospects of our
local pro football team? And I don't mean those faithless Rams who
deserted us for the Midwest. No, I'm talking about the Long
Beach-based California Quake, which knocked off Sacramento, 40-13,
over the weekend to capture the Pacific Coast title in the Women's
American Football League.</TE>
<TE>   The Quake thus moved one step closer to qualifying for the Women's
World Bowl, Feb. 24 in San Diego. Will there be male cheerleaders?</TE>

<HD>Highflying Financier Held in Ponzi Probe</HD>
<DH>Courts: Laguna Niguel man, 78, allegedly pocketed $17
million in fees for loans that were never made.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard A. Parker, a 78-year-old Laguna Niguel financier who once
offered to fund construction of the world's tallest skyscraper, has
been arrested by federal authorities and accused of pocketing more
than $17 million in a worldwide Ponzi scheme.</LD>
<LD>   An 18-month investigation into allegedly fraudulent practices at
Parker's Laguna Hills firm culminated late last week in an FBI raid.
Agents arrested Parker because they feared he was preparing to flee,
according to court documents.</LD>
<LD>   In papers filed Monday at federal court in Santa Ana, authorities
charged Parker with using false promises of a loan to fraudulently
obtain $100,000 from International AirFinance Ltd., a firm that had
hoped to borrow $400 million from Morgan, Weinstein &amp; Co., which
Parker operates with his son, Richard Parker II.</LD>
<TE>   Concerns that the elder Parker might flee prompted FBI agents to
arrest him last week.</TE>
<TE>   Despite investigators' belief that Parker is a flight risk, a
federal magistrate set his bail at $250,000. Parker has yet to post
the $25,000 bond required for release.</TE>
<TE>   If he does, he will be prohibited from soliciting funds while free
on bail.</TE>
<TE>   He was ordered to appear in federal court in Los Angeles next
month to answer to the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Parker nor his attorney, James Henderson, would comment on
the government's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, Weinstein has described itself as one of the nation's most
successful loan brokers, a firm that has provided loans for hotels,
casinos, racetracks and office buildings worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, however, former clients have complained about their
dealings with the firm, and in a civil fraud case that Morgan,
Weinstein lost in July, a $30-million judgment was entered against
the company.</TE>
<TE>   In federal court papers filed in Santa Ana, FBI investigators say
Parker pocketed at least $17 million in hefty retainers he demanded
from loan clients.</TE>
<TE>   Although Parker's firm promised that the retainers would be
refunded if loans failed to materialize, investigators said this
rarely occurred.</TE>
<TE>   In the few cases when the retainers were refunded, Parker and
others did so by using retainer fees paid by other victimized
clients, documents allege.</TE>
<TE>   In flashy brochures that promised funding for multimillion-dollar
ventures, Parker said he controlled more than $30 million in assets
in Asia as a source of loan funds.</TE>
<TE>   But federal investigators say $22 million of that consisted of
fraudulent Japanese bonds and checks, and $10 million allegedly in a
Singapore bank has turned out to be "a nonexistent, or phantom
account," authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Exec Is Held in Ponzi Probe</HD>
<DH>Courts: 78-year-old Laguna Niguel man allegedly kept more
than $17 million in improper fees. Bail is set despite hints that he
could flee.</DH>

<LD>Richard A. Parker, a 78-year-old Laguna Niguel financier who once
offered to fund construction of the world's tallest skyscraper, has
been arrested by federal authorities and accused of pocketing more
than $17 million in a worldwide Ponzi scheme.</LD>
<LD>   An 18-month investigation into allegedly fraudulent practices at
Parker's Laguna Hills firm culminated late last week in an FBI raid.
Agents arrested Parker because they feared he was preparing to flee,
according to court documents.</LD>
<LD>   In papers filed Monday at federal court in Santa Ana, authorities
charged Parker with using false promises of a loan to fraudulently
obtain $100,000 from International AirFinance Ltd., a firm that had
hoped to borrow $400 million from Morgan, Weinstein &amp; Co., which
Parker operates with his son, Richard Parker II.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said they had originally planned to await expected
federal grand jury action next month against Parker, and possibly
others at Morgan, Weinstein.</TE>
<TE>   But officials' concerns that the elder Parker might flee prompted
FBI agents to arrest him last week.</TE>
<TE>   Despite investigators' belief that Parker is a flight risk, a
federal magistrate set his bail at $250,000. Parker has yet to post
the $25,000 bond required for release.</TE>
<TE>   If he does, he will be prohibited from soliciting funds while free
on bail.</TE>
<TE>   He was ordered to appear in federal court in Los Angeles next
month to answer to the charges against him.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Parker nor his attorney, James Henderson, would make any
comment on the government's allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, Weinstein has described itself as one of the nation's most
successful loan brokers, a firm that has provided loans for hotels,
casinos, racetracks and office buildings worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, however, former clients have complained about their
dealings with the firm, and in a civil fraud case that Morgan,
Weinstein lost in July, a $30-million judgment was entered against
the company.</TE>
<TE>   In federal court papers filed in Santa Ana, FBI investigators say
Parker pocketed at least $17 million in hefty retainers he demanded
from loan clients.</TE>
<TE>   Although Parker's firm promised that the retainers would be
refunded if loans failed to materialize, investigators said this
rarely occurred. In the few cases when the retainers were refunded,
Parker and others did so by using retainer fees paid by other
victimized clients, court documents allege.</TE>
<TE>   In flashy brochures that promised funding for multimillion-dollar
ventures, Parker said he controlled more than $30 million in assets
in Asia as a ready source of loan funds.</TE>
<TE>   But federal investigators say $22 million of that consisted of
fraudulent Japanese bonds and checks, and $10 million allegedly in a
Singapore bank has turned out to be "a nonexistent, or phantom
account," authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether such funds existed was central to a civil case that Parker
and his company lost in July to developer Scott Toberman and a group
of other investors. Toberman and his group had hoped to build the
world's tallest skyscraper in Chicago and hired Parker's company to
bankroll the $500-million project.</TE>
<TE>   After Toberman and the others paid Morgan, Weinstein a
half-million-dollar retainer, the loan funds failed to materialize
and the project died.</TE>
<TE>   "It's astonishing what they've been able to do," said Jay D.
Bennett, the lawyer who represented Toberman. "We've got a [court]
judgment for $30 million [against Parker], but I'll be surprised if
anybody gets any money from these people."</TE>
<TE>   Parker has had previous brushes with the law.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, he was convicted in Santa Clara County of grand theft and
securities fraud violations involving a scheme to build a spa in the
Bahamas.</TE>
<TE>   Court files in the case state that the spa was to be an outlet for
a synthetic hormone called LHRH, "which some magazine articles
claimed had a rejuvenation effect" and for which claims also were
made that it "could cure human impotence."</TE>

<HD>Contrary OCC Professor Back; Students Seem Oblivious to
Bait</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four months after he was accused of slurring Arab students and
stirred a national debate over academic freedom, an Orange Coast
College professor braved a battery of reporters and photographers
waiting Monday to chronicle his first day back in the classroom.</LD>
<LD>   But few of the 90 or so students enrolled in Political Science
101, Survey of Current Issues, seemed to have a clue about the fuss
over professor Ken Hearlson's return to the Costa Mesa campus.</LD>
<LD>   "What's he talking about?" one student wondered when a reporter
asked a classmate if the controversy over Hearlson caused her to sign
up for the class. Hearlson, a U.S. flag pinned to the lapel of his
sport coat, was happy to illuminate.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously the media is here because I'm back teaching my first
class," the 57-year-old Hearlson announced.</TE>
<TE>   Walking in front of the class with a bottle of water in his hand,
sometimes sitting, once grabbing his golf-club cane to demonstrate a
point, Hearlson immediately discussed what had taken him from the
classroom Sept. 18 and thrust him into the center of a nationwide
debate over academic freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll look at ... how the administration treated the issue," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He told the class he was a Christian conservative but that they
didn't have to agree with him. "I want you to defend your own
opinions. Certain people take offense to that."</TE>
<TE>   Pause.</TE>
<TE>   "Get a life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Students applauded.</TE>
<TE>   "This is America," Hearlson added. "We have a constitutional right
to be stupid and to offend people."</TE>
<TE>   His recent brush with fame seemed to have done little to attract
students. The number enrolled in his 11:10 a.m. class was the same as
usual. But he does have a reputation for keeping things lively.</TE>
<TE>   Heather Diggs, 19, said she followed the recommendation of her
sister, who said Hearlson was a good teacher who would make class
more interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Hearlson prowled the front of the classroom as if it were a stage,
talking with his hands, his voice growing loud, then soft, but always
grabbing his audience's attention.</TE>
<TE>   He seemed to delight in making outrageous remarks and taking a
contrarian stance. If he was trying to provoke students, none of them
took the bait, at least not on this first day.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm unlike other teachers," he said. "I don't want to be like
you. I'm not going to talk or dress like you. I don't give a rat's
patoot what you think of me."</TE>
<TE>   He said he'd rather take advice from his gardener than elitist
liberal professors. Nor will he grade on a curve because it's "a
liberal idea" that will "dumb down grades."</TE>
<TE>   The government, he added, is "sucking taxes out as fast as they
can go."</TE>
<TE>   Hearlson encouraged his students to take on their professors. "I
want you to challenge them. Ask them questions."</TE>
<TE>   He spent much of the hour-long class talking about himself. "I've
done so many things it's incredible," said the self-styled
"blue-collar professor."</TE>
<TE>   He talked about his stint in the Marines; his jobs as a
steelworker, custodian and carpenter; his being raised in a small
town in Kansas; and his friends who were "Mexicans." "I believe
growing up poor is an asset," he said. "I look back on it, and it was
fun."</TE>
<TE>   After class, Hearlson told reporters he had spent nearly $10,000
in legal fees defending himself.</TE>
<TE>   Hearlson was suspended and later cleared of charges he'd called
four Muslim students "Nazis," "terrorists" and "murderers" in a class
discussion about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. A 73-page report by
an independent investigator concluded that most of the allegations
against him were unsubstantiated.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the political science professor said he'll file a grievance
to keep college President Margaret Gratton from putting a letter in
his personnel file. Gratton's letter cautioned him about singling out
students for their race or religion. Hearlson, his supporters and the
faculty union consider the letter a reprimand.</TE>
<TE>   Hearlson said he would continue to talk about terrorism, the
Middle East and other sensitive subjects.</TE>
<TE>   "I love teaching," he said.</TE>

<LD>A light earthquake rattled the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Simi
valleys Monday night, but there were no reports of damage.</LD>
<LD>   Officials at the Caltech seismological laboratories said the
magnitude 4.2 temblor occurred at 9:53 p.m. Over the next hour, at
least 13 aftershocks were recorded, including a 3.9 at 10 p.m. and a
3.8 at 10:08 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   They said the quake was centered about six miles west of Valencia
and apparently occurred about 1.6 miles below the surface of the
earth.</LD>
<TE>   "It shook this facility quite mightily," said Jeff Lawrence,
manager of the Ventura County sheriff's station in Simi Valley, about
five miles from the epicenter. But nothing fell from walls, and
Lawrence said he thought at first that a water main might have
broken.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Pena, a manager of a Denny's restaurant near the center of
town, said no pots or pans fell during the shaking, but patrons
became uneasy.</TE>
<TE>   "The customers got a little panicky," Pena said. "Most of them
stood up and tried to get to the cash register to pay quickly, and
one girl couldn't wait and she started to make, kind of like,
screaming noises."</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley police said emergency procedures were put into effect
but were not needed. Sheriff's personnel in Santa Clarita said it
"wasn't that bad."</TE>
<TE>   "There was just a jolt," said a dispatcher at the sheriff's
station in Santa Clarita who gave her name as Officer V. Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   "We only got about 15 calls, which shows it wasn't that much," she
said. "It was nothing compared to the [Northridge] quake back in
1994."</TE>
<TE>   The first quake was felt throughout a wide section of Southern
California, including Pasadena, Santa Barbara, West Hollywood and
much of the northwest side of Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Thousand Oaks Embarks on a Hare-Raising Quest for a Mascot</HD>
<DH>Public art: Council members hope sponsors will adopt the
$2,000 fiberglass bunnies, decorate them and display them around
town.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It may not convey the great strength of a grizzly or nobility of an
eagle, but the rabbit is being warmly embraced as a mascot and
cultural icon in Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council recently approved a public arts project to make
and sell fiberglass bunnies for $2,000 each and display them around
the city.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of the 5-foot-tall rabbit statues will be made for those
wishing to reclaim their local heritage and put the conejo-- Spanish
for rabbit--back in the Conejo Valley.</LD>
<TE>   "It gives us a symbol. It says we are a valley of peace and
contentment," Mayor Ed Masry said. "Who hates rabbits? I don't know
anyone who is a rabbit hater. I look forward to seeing them go up."</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ann Tachco, the city's cultural arts coordinator, said the
rabbits initially raised eyebrows. "But these are big rabbits and no
one else in the country is doing rabbits," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati has pigs, Chicago has cows and Orlando, Fla., has
alligators. But rabbits remain unclaimed as city mascots. The
sculpted animals emerge from molds looking identical, but each is
decorated in extravagant fashion by local artists.</TE>
<TE>   It was a sculpted alligator wearing jewels and a handbag that
sparked the rabbit idea, said Jane Brooks, head of the Thousand Oaks
Arts Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in Orlando at a wedding and there was this 8-foot gator on
the front lawn with a pocketbook hanging from an appendage and I
said, 'This is what I want to do.' My husband said, 'The rabbit thing
again?' and I said, 'Yes, the rabbit thing.'"</TE>
<TE>   Brooks figured her city was ready to revisit its rabbit roots. The
affluent community has low crime, good schools and manicured lawns
but little public art. So the City Council two weeks ago unanimously
approved the idea and Brooks commissioned an artist to make a rabbit
prototype.</TE>
<TE>   Jeancherie, the Canoga Park sculptor chosen for the job, said
she's treading a fine line between reality and being cartoonish.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to watch out for being too cute," said the artist, who
doesn't use a last name.</TE>
<TE>   She insists the skittish creatures have many admirable qualities
and are worthy symbols of Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "The rabbit is good, fast, quick-thinking and quick-moving," she
said. "And he's very, very clever."</TE>
<TE>   According to Tachco, the idea for this kind of public art came
from Zurich, Switzerland, where a visiting businessman from Chicago
noticed wildly decorated fiberglass cows standing throughout the
countryside.</TE>
<TE>   He brought the idea home and in 1999 Chicago began setting up
decorated cows around the city. Other cities followed with their own
animal mascots. Norfolk, Va., chose mermaids.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Los Angeles erected 170 fiberglass angels, each standing
more than 6 feet tall, throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   Tachco's plans are more modest. She hopes to line up 10 sponsors
to buy the first of what she expects will be 20 to 30 rabbits. Once
they are sold, there will be maps made of rabbit locations and tours
offered. The first statues may be ready by May.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's kind of kicky," Councilman Dan Del Campo said. "The
sponsors will buy them and commission local artists to depict the
rabbit the way they see it. Someone can put a rabbit in a tuxedo.
They can make them into the City Council members."</TE>
<TE>   As for real-life conejos, Thousand Oaks has plenty.</TE>
<TE>   "We have tremendous amounts of rabbits," Del Campo said. "I get
calls from people every week who say, 'Can you do something about the
rabbits, they're ruining my garden.' "</TE>

<HD>San Diego County on Best-Run List</HD>
<DH>Survey: Orange County, which emerged from 1995 bankruptcy,
also places high in the national rankings. Los Angeles County earns a
grade of C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Diego County is the best managed of California's nine largest
counties, with Orange County--bankrupt seven years ago--coming in
second, according to the first national study of county government
management.</LD>
<LD>   The review by the Maxwell School of Syracuse University and
Governing magazine analyzed the 40 largest counties in the U.S. by
geographic region, based on annual revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Within California, San Diego County earned a B-plus, a grade
beaten by only two others nationally: Maricopa County, Ariz., and
Fairfax County, Va., which received A-minuses.</LD>
<TE>   Ron Roberts, chairman of the San Diego County Board of
Supervisors, credited the privatization of certain county services,
the sale of a money-losing landfill, multiyear contracts for
employees and an incentive-pay system for employees with improving
the county's fiscal health.</TE>
<TE>   "If this had been five or six years ago, we'd probably have been
near the bottom of that list," Roberts said. "It's been a real
transformation and I'm glad other people are recognizing it."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County, the largest county in population and size,
earned a C.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's B grade was a turnaround that stunned even the
study's authors.</TE>
<TE>   "I was startled because, frankly, prior to our beginning this, I
had assumed that they'd look terrible," said Richard Greene, special
projects editor at Washington-based Governing magazine.</TE>
<TE>   He attributed the successful score to the bankruptcy sending a
"wake-up call to the entire county" to change its way of doing
business.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a truism that we've discovered from a variety of levels
of government, that there's nothing like a big financial disaster to
improve management," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's investment pool lost $1.6 billion in December 1994
from risky bets by then-Treasurer Robert L. Citron, who served a year
in jail. Since then, all of the county's top managers have been
replaced or left, including the auditor, treasurer-tax collector and
the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The study analyzed five areas: financial management, human
resources, information technology, capital management and "managing
for results."</TE>
<TE>   Those considered the strongest counties had strategic planning and
a decentralized governing system that rewarded flexibility and
innovation.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, Roberts said the county's system of paying higher
salaries for top-performing employees has helped provide a higher
quality of service to the public. "It's a whole new attitude," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Supervisor Dianne Jacob said the board "has run San
Diego County like a business and it has paid off. It's been a long
haul; we had to be both bold and disciplined."</TE>
<TE>   She noted two innovations: competition among private companies to
provide public services, and a budgeting procedure that sets aside
money received on a one-time basis for specific projects rather than
for continuing costs.</TE>
<TE>   The rankings are a useful gauge of how effectively counties are
doing their job, particularly during a slowing economy, said Dale
Jones, director of the Government Performance Project, a multiyear
analysis funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't realize how important county governments are to
their daily lives," he said. "But the fact is, they're becoming more
important players in American government with each passing year."</TE>
<TE>   Counties are often invisible entities that get scant respect, said
Peter Harkness, editor and publisher of Governing.</TE>
<TE>   "They have little say in the delivery of services they're
responsible for, they get squeezed from both sides on funding, and
they take the heat for city, county and even state elected
officials," he said. "It's a frustrating dilemma and the grades
reflect it."</TE>
<TE>   Counties in the Western states are responsible for managing a
larger slice of government services, the study found.</TE>
<TE>   In California, counties handle such vast responsibilities as law
enforcement, fire protection, health care, welfare and other social
services. They handled annual budgets ranging from $1.3 billion for
Contra Costa to $16 billion for Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But California counties have been hit hard financially in the past
decade, with state government diverting a larger slice of funds
traditionally sent to the local level.</TE>
<TE>   "For all of the California counties, if they [were located] in
another state, they'd be doing better because of what the state has
done to them financially," Greene said.</TE>
<TE>   The largest county studied, Los Angeles County, ranked about
average in every category except capital management. There, the
county earned a D-plus; the average was B-minus. What pulled the
county down, Greene said, was an incomplete inventory of county
buildings and assets, and not knowing what maintenance needs
were--even if the money wasn't immediately available.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's just wrong," Los Angeles County Chief Administrative
Officer David Janssen said of the data showing Los Angeles woefully
behind in capital maintenance. "That's where we've been putting all
of our surpluses--in maintenance and capital."</TE>
<TE>   He said Los Angeles has spent more than $100 million a year on
maintenance and capital improvements in an effort to make up for
years of neglect in the lean, late 1980s and early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County supervisors hired Janssen as chief
administrative officer on the strength of his success as a budget
reformer when he held the same position in San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Among other California counties, Contra Costa earned a B-minus,
while four counties ranked C-plus: Alameda, Riverside, Sacramento and
Santa Clara. San Bernardino County received a C-minus. The
lowest-scoring county, Nassau in New York, got a D-minus.</TE>

<HD>Davis TV Ads Attack Riordan</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor blasts the GOP front-runner on abortion,
crime and energy. Riordan says the incumbent is desperate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROSEVILLE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Gubernatorial candidate Richard Riordan was pushed into defending his
positions on abortion, crime and California's energy mess on Monday
as Gov. Gray Davis released television ads pounding his leading GOP
rival.</LD>
<LD>   On a daylong bus trip from San Francisco to Sacramento, the former
mayor of Los Angeles faced the most aggressive attacks of the
campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The two new Davis ads tap into negative sentiments toward Los
Angeles among Californians in other parts of the state. One of them,
running in the Central Valley, cites rising rates of homicide,
assault and auto theft in Los Angeles and questions whether Riordan
has "a record we can trust."</LD>
<TE>   The other, running in the Bay Area, Monterey and other parts of
Northern California, says Riordan "gouged the rest of the state" on
electricity during the blackouts last year--even though "the rest of
California helped Los Angeles rebuild after the Northridge
earthquake."</TE>
<TE>   The spot invokes the Enron scandal. It says Los Angeles, under
Riordan, charged the rest of the state "more than Enron"--the
bankrupt energy supplier--for electricity produced by the city's
utility.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan said Davis' ads reflected the "desperation" of an
unpopular governor who hopes to divert attention from the $12-billion
state budget shortfall and other troublesome issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis is not going to fool the public," Riordan said after a
visit to a jelly bean factory in Fairfield. "They want to hear from
him about what he's done on education, transportation, jobs, water,
housing and health care."</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, Davis' chief political strategist, said the ads were
a response to Riordan's "personal and vitriolic" attacks on the
governor.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled that Riordan has accused Davis of "gross
mismanagement," and "despicable" and "immoral" actions as governor.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been very patient here with this guy," South said. "I
warned him for weeks that we wouldn't sit by and let him use the
governor as a punching bag without a very aggressive response."</TE>
<TE>   In a vast state where television ads are the essential means of
reaching voters, the Davis barrage poses the most serious challenge
so far to Riordan's candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   A new Los Angeles Times poll shows Riordan with a double-digit
lead over his two opponents in the March 5 Republican primary:
California Secretary of State Bill Jones and Los Angeles businessman
Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Both are more conservative than Riordan, whose moderate views on
social issues such as abortion and gay rights are unpopular in GOP
strongholds such as the Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis ads complicate Riordan's efforts to introduce himself to
voters outside Los Angeles on his own terms. On Monday, Riordan had
planned to focus on his fiscal management skills as he set off on the
final two-day leg of a statewide bus tour. Instead, he started his
day with a hastily arranged gathering with Republican women in San
Francisco to respond to a Davis television spot that depicts him as
an opponent of abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me make one thing clear to you today: I'm pro-choice,"
Riordan said in a corporate conference room with 17 women lined up
behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "I strongly support the right of women to make their own decision
with respect to their bodies, their careers, their families and every
part of their lives. Gov. Davis is acting desperate the last week.
He's trying to keep people's eye off the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan acknowledged that the ad was correct in asserting that he
had donated money to anti-abortion groups in 1987 and 1991.</TE>
<TE>   With his voice trembling in apparent nervousness, he said what's
important is that Los Angeles voters knew about those donations when
they elected him mayor in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "They believed me, they trusted me, and I think I did what they
wanted me to do as mayor," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is they knew I was pro-choice, I knew I was
pro-choice, and that's true today."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan also responded to the Davis ad's assertion that he raised
money for the 1987 campaign to put Robert Bork, an advocate of
overturning Roe vs. Wade, on the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "You can go back over somebody's life and prove anything you
want," he said. "Bork was nominated by President Reagan, and I
supported President Reagan. You can go back over the over $30 million
I've given in my life to charity, and you can come up with a bunch of
questions."</TE>
<TE>   Later, as his bus set off across the Bay Bridge for the Central
Valley, Riordan called the Davis abortion spot a "vicious, personal
attack."</TE>
<TE>   The new ads left Riordan advisors tossing around theories about
why the Democratic governor was running the ads in January.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, they said, is either trying to stop Riordan from gaining
momentum for the general election, or he's trying to help Simon or
Jones win the GOP nomination so he can face a more conservative--and
less electable--Republican in November.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' "favorite scenario," said Riordan campaign manager Ron
Hartwig, is "to run against one of two guys who are pro-life."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, in fact, jumped into the abortion dispute on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like Dick has taken both sides of the issue," Simon
said during a campaign stop in Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't the first time Dick has taken positions on an issue
that are inconsistent....He does take different positions on
different issues, making people wonder where he may be in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   Simon spoke during a swing through the Central Valley to promote
his water policy. He proposed increasing California's water storage
capacity by enlarging the Los Vaqueros, Shasta and Millerton
reservoirs and flooding part of the San Joaquin Delta.</TE>
<TE>   At the jelly bean plant, Riordan responded to the Davis crime ad.
He said that violent crime dropped more than 50% during his eight
years as mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's talk about the real issues, Mr. Davis," he added. "Let's
not go negative. People don't like that."</TE>
<TE>   On his bus, Riordan was asked about Davis' energy ad.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of what we did in Los Angeles," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We supplied the people of Los Angeles power for eight years
without raising rates one penny. We never had any blackouts. And we
sold all our excess energy in the state at the market prices
determined" by the state Independent System Operator.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting of Placer County Republicans in Roseville on Monday
night, Riordan called the governor "the only living person in the
state of California who doesn't think he screwed up the energy
crisis."</TE>

<HD>Safety Officials Call for More Equipment, Staff</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city's public safety officials said Monday that Los Angeles needs
to boost its terrorism preparedness, calling for an additional $7.5
million in new equipment, training and staff.</LD>
<LD>   "It's critical at this time that we ensure that we in the city of
Los Angeles make preparations for terrorism and make anti-terrorist
capabilities a local priority," City Councilman Jack Weiss said at a
news conference at City Hall with Police Chief Bernard C. Parks and
Fire Chief William Bamattre.</LD>
<LD>   "If something happens here in the Southern California region, it
will be men and women from the L.A. Fire Department and the L.A.
Police Department who will be called upon to respond. So we need to
make sure they have the tools they need to do their jobs."</LD>
<TE>   The officials are seeking an additional urban search and rescue
team, a third hazmat unit, additional staffing at the county's
Terrorism Early Warning Group, more bomb squad training,
explosives-sniffing dogs, and a new disaster-preparedness unit in the
Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendations came out of a task force assembled by Weiss
after the September terrorism attacks to evaluate the city's ability
to respond to terrorist threats. On Monday, the city's Emergency
Operations Board endorsed the requests.</TE>
<TE>   But finding money in the city's budget to pay for the new
equipment, training and staff may be difficult. The city is suffering
a revenue shortfall because of a decline in tourism and increased
security costs. By July, the city's security tab is expected to hit
at least $45 million.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn was not optimistic that the new
measures could be paid for out of the city budget.</TE>
<TE>   "'Obviously, we're in very short supply of money these days, and
we're belt-tightening all around the city," Hahn said Monday during a
visit to Brentwood. "I'd love to do it if we can find the money."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn added that the proposals could be funded by the federal
government if Congress approves President Bush's recent proposal to
spend $3.5 billion on homeland security in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But other officials said the measures must be taken sooner.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we can sit back in this city and wait for the
federal government to fund something and put our own safety in
jeopardy," Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   Bamattre noted that much of the additional staffing is so
important that the police and fire departments have been doing it
through overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had an ongoing program of preparedness, but we have to keep
our guard up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss acknowledged that the price tag is steep, but said terrorism
preparedness should be the city's top priority.</TE>
<TE>   "The world changed on Sept. 11, and those of us in local
government need to face up to that and face up to our new
responsibilities," Weiss said. "It is necessary but not sufficient
that we rely on federal funding."</TE>

<HD>Group Paints a Rosier Picture for a Valley City</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The group spearheading the San Fernando Valley secession drive
released a proposed budget for a breakaway city Monday, offering what
it called "a more reasonable and likely scenario" that could save
$200 million annually.</LD>
<LD>   The plan was presented as an alternative to a final report on
Valley secession unveiled Jan. 9 by the county commission studying
the issue, which concluded that an independent Valley city would be
financially viable.</LD>
<LD>   Under that first plan by the Local Agency Formation Commission,
the Valley would pay Los Angeles nearly $1 billion a year for
municipal services such as police and fire protection, public works,
and street sweeping. The city would employ just 36 people, with more
than 8,000 Los Angeles employees providing services to the Valley
under contract.</LD>
<TE>   To make sure that the breakup would not financially wound either
side, LAFCO recommended that the Valley city pay Los Angeles $66
million annually, a so-called alimony payment.</TE>
<TE>   Valley VOTE's analysis found that during a proposed 18-month
transition period that would start Jan. 1, 2003:</TE>
<TE>   * The new city would enjoy a $119.7-million surplus each year,
leaving it $54.3 million after its alimony payment.</TE>
<TE>   * The Valley would spend up to $700 million annually buying
police, fire and other municipal services from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   * The fledgling city would start with 97 full-time employees in
addition to its mayor and council members. By the end of the 18-month
transition period, the Valley would expect to employ more than 8,000
as Los Angeles employees transfer to the new city.</TE>
<TE>   * The Valley city would spend $200 million annually to pay off
debts and other liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   * An independent Valley city could save as much as $200 million a
year by cutting overhead and tailoring services specifically to the
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The new document is meant to augment LAFCO's research. Valley VOTE
and city officials are still negotiating terms of the potential
split, and the commission plans to decide in late spring whether to
put secession to a citywide vote in November.</TE>
<TE>   "This [report] shows that the new city council and mayor will have
extra money that can be used for police, paramedic and other public
services," said Richard Close, Valley VOTE's chairman. "We're going
to be able to make the Valley a safer and better community to live
in."</TE>
<TE>   But representatives of the city of Los Angeles voiced skepticism
over the latest proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is smoke and mirrors if I ever saw it," said Lisa Gritzner,
chief of staff to City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski. "They talk
about contracting with the city of Los Angeles, but they seem to be
setting their own rates. And they're making assumptions that don't
exist in any other place in this process except their own minds."</TE>
<TE>   For example, Gritzner said, the Valley VOTE plan assumes the
transfer of Van Nuys Airport--something LAFCO has not agreed to--and
then credits the new city $4 million, as well as earmarking part of
the city's tobacco settlement money for the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me they're just creating a scenario to meet their
goals," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Dan Miller, a Valley VOTE consultant, said the plan
incorporated ideas from similar-sized cities and combined some city
departments to make them more efficient.</TE>
<TE>   One example of such cost savings is the Office of Administrative
and Research Services. The new Valley city would eliminate this Los
Angeles department, saving $3 million, and its functions would be
performed by the new city manager's office, Miller said. Millions
would also be shaved from the city council and mayor's budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "We basically tried to build the Valley from the bottom up,"
Miller said. "We're making our best projections."</TE>

<DH>Weather: Southland foothills are expected to get a dusting
as one of the coldest storms in years moves through the state.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Heavy snow was predicted in Southern California's mountains this
morning, and lighter dustings are possible in the foothills of the
San Fernando, San Gabriel and Antelope valleys as one of the coldest
storms in years continues its icy march through the state.</LD>
<LD>   Although the leading edge of the Arctic storm dropped up to 2
inches of rain in the Los Angeles Basin and frosted the Tehachapi,
San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains with snow Sunday night, the
main force of the system struck early Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Snow forced schools to close in Sonoma County on Monday, and
flakes fell on San Francisco's Twin Peaks for the first time since
1998. Snow halted traffic on California 17 between Santa Cruz and San
Jose.</LD>
<TE>   The core of the storm was expected to strike Southern California
before dawn today. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm
warning for the mountains of Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles
counties, advising motorists of dangerous winter conditions above
2,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "Accumulations of 6 to 12 inches of snow are possible," the
weather service said Monday evening. "There will be northwest winds
of 25 to 35 mph, with wind chills from zero to 10 degrees below zero.
There will be areas of dense fog."</TE>
<TE>   Drivers heading for Tejon Pass on Interstate 5 and Cajon Pass on
Interstate 15 were warned to prepare for heavy weather and carry tire
chains. Both passes top 4,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters said up to 3 inches of snow might fall in the Antelope
Valley, and flakes could fall in the highest parts of La Crescenta,
La Canada Flintridge, Altadena and Monrovia this morning as snow
levels there dip to as low as 1,500 feet.</TE>
<TE>   The weather service predicted isolated thunderstorms with
occasional heavy downpours and small hail along the coast and in the
coastal valleys. Some small hail fell around Marina Del Rey Monday
night. Forecasters said there could be a waterspout or two this
morning in the Santa Barbara and Catalina channels.</TE>
<TE>   The storm is expected to linger throughout the day today. Bill
Hoffer, a weather service meteorologist, said downtown Los Angeles
could get an additional 2 inches of rain before the system moves east
tonight. He said as much as 4 inches of rain could fall in some
foothill communities below the snow line.</TE>
<TE>   Coastal and valley temperatures will remain chilly, with daytime
highs in the upper 40s and low 50s following overnight readings in
the 30s and low 40s.</TE>
<TE>   The weather is expected to remain cool but get drier during the
remainder of the week, with no additional rain predicted from
Wednesday through Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Studies of Express Lanes Ordered</HD>
<DH>Commuting: O.C. transit agency hires consultants to
determine a fair price for the private tollway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Transportation Authority took the first steps
Monday toward buying the Riverside Freeway's Express Lanes, approving
several studies of the purchase and the hiring of Ernst &amp; Young for
an independent appraisal.</LD>
<LD>   Up to now, the only purchase price--$274million--was supplied by
the toll lanes' operator, the California Private Transportation Co.,
when a nonprofit group tried to buy the lanes several years ago.</LD>
<LD>   OCTA Chairman Todd Spitzer wants an unbiased figure, substantiated
by fresh surveys of future trends, commuter profiles and a study of
economic indicators in Riverside and Orange counties.</LD>
<TE>   "We are not aware of any similar situation in which a governmental
entity has sought to negotiate the purchase of a private toll road,"
Spitzer said. He noted that hiring the accountants will help the
agency during negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to overpay, and we will not be taken advantage of
in negotiations," he added. "That's why it's important to get an
independent, third-party evaluation of an acquisition price."</TE>
<TE>   In all, about $200,000 for three studies on the privately owned
toll lanes was approved at the authority's meeting Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Noncompete Clause Sparked Controversy</TE>
<TE>   Buying the toll lanes has been a hot discussion item since it was
revealed that the original 1993 franchise agreement for the private
turnpike included a noncompete clause prohibiting Caltrans from
improving or adding lanes to the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   After agreeing this month to pay $4million in public funds to the
toll lane operator for the right to widen the traffic-clogged
Riverside Freeway, authority directors concluded they must buy the
tollway to end such payments.</TE>
<TE>   The private toll agency paid about $130million to build the
Express Lanes, Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal here is very positive, and it's to return the private
toll road to public ownership," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young was hired for $125,000 to
determine a price for the lanes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is unique because as far as we know, it's hard to come up
with a measuring stick for a toll road," said George Urch, an OCTA
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier effort to buy the tollway by NewTrac, a nonprofit
agency, failed in 1999. According to OCTA staff, "lack of an
independent cost review ... raised questions about the validity of
the proposed purchase price."</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firm also will review economic and demographic
trends for the region.</TE>
<TE>   Expense Doomed Earlier Attempt to Buy Lanes</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the transit authority tried to have the state buy
all four toll roads, but the $3.5-billion cost--one-fourth of the
state's surplus at the time--proved too expensive. The effort
involved the Foothill, Eastern and San Joaquin Hills toll roads and
the 91 Express Lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Rod Pacheco (R-Riverside) introduced a bill to require
Gov. Gray Davis for an independent appraisal and to establish a local
authority to acquire the private toll lanes. The governor vetoed the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   To help gather information, the authority's directors approved a
$100,000 commuter survey to determine who uses the freeway and why.
The cost will be shared equally by the Riverside County
Transportation Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California Assn. of Governments will hire a
consultant to videotape license plates near the Riverside County line
from 4 to 10 a.m. Questionnaires will be sent to households once
addresses are obtained from the Department of Motor Vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The transportation authority also approved paying $25,000 to a
governmental consultant to study the economic relationships between
Riverside and Orange counties. The Riverside County Transportation
Commission will pay an equal sum toward the study.</TE>

<HD>MTA Report Says Deficits Would Hobble Valley Bus System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Metropolitan Transportation Authority consultant said Monday that
an independent bus system proposed for the San Fernando Valley would
be hobbled by long-term deficits.</LD>
<LD>   But supporters of the breakaway network dismissed that forecast as
too dire.</LD>
<LD>   An MTA report by the consulting firm Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton
estimated the Valley bus operations would run a $6-million annual
deficit for the next 10 years.</LD>
<TE>   MTA officials oppose the plan for a separate bus system in the
Valley, which would cost about $110 million a year. Instead, they
want to designate the Valley one of five transit sectors that would
have limited autonomy within the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   Members of a joint powers authority pushing for the independent
network said they would press on despite the consultant's report.</TE>
<TE>   "The report is just not credible," said county Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, who chairs the authority board. The group also includes
representatives of the city of Los Angeles and eight other
municipalities, including Burbank and Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe a [Valley transit] zone is financially viable," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The board heard a presentation Monday by MTA Chief Executive Roger
Snoble, who outlined his plan to reorganize and decentralize the
regional agency.</TE>
<TE>   Snoble said the proposed Valley sector and a similar one in the
San Gabriel Valley would begin operating by July 1, with those in the
South Bay, Westside/Central Los Angeles and South Los Angeles to
follow.</TE>
<TE>   He said the MTA intends to hire general managers for the Valley
and San Gabriel sectors as early as next week, even though the MTA's
board has not approved the reorganization plan.</TE>
<TE>   "He's moving ahead as if it's a done deal," Yaroslavsky said.
"We're moving ahead as if the [independent Valley] zone's a done
deal."</TE>
<TE>   The MTA board also must approve the Valley breakaway plan. No vote
on either proposal has been scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   If the board signs off on the Valley network, the system would be
entirely independent. Snoble's alternative would give the five
sectors their own staffs and budgets for local bus lines, and let
them keep fare revenues generated within their boundaries. Each
sector also would have a community council to oversee operations, but
the MTA would maintain overall control.</TE>
<TE>   The other cities represented by the joint powers authority are
Calabasas, Hidden Hills, La Canada Flintridge, San Fernando and
Westlake Village.</TE>

<HD>8 Firms to Clean Drinking Water</HD>
<DH>Pollution: Agreement comes more than 20 years after
chemicals were found in San Gabriel Valley supply.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than two decades after the discovery of dangerous chemicals in
the San Gabriel Valley's drinking water, eight of the companies held
responsible agreed Monday to pay for the $250 million cleanup.</LD>
<LD>   The tentative settlement reached by attorneys for the companies
and water suppliers with the help of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency provides for construction and operation of six
plants to clean up contaminated water beneath Azusa, Irwindale and
Baldwin Park.</LD>
<LD>   Those plants would cost a total of $80 million to build and would
operate for 15 years at a cost of $14 million a year. Once working,
they would clean a combined 38,250 gallons per minute. They are
expected to be operating within 2 1/2 years, said Bob Kuhn, chairman
of the San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority.</LD>
<TE>   "We are very excited. For the first time, we will now go into a
room and instead of everyone being on the opposite side of the table,
we will be able to design a cleanup project," said Kuhn, whose state
agency is party to the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1950s and '60s, defense plants in the area and other
heavy industry allowed industrial solvents to leak into the soil and
contaminate the ground water. The plume of contamination has reached
31 public wells, each of which were shut off as it reached them.
Water suppliers have been forced to import Colorado River water,
which cost far more than local ground water.</TE>
<TE>   For more than two years, the companies and water suppliers have
argued over the cleanup of the water, part of a massive aquifer that
serves more than 1 million people.</TE>
<TE>   As they argued, the contamination moved toward the Whittier
Narrows, threatening the ground water in the southeastern part of Los
Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Ratcheting up the tensions, local water companies, the Water
Quality Authority and elected officials including Sen. Barbara Boxer
in recent months have called on the EPA to fine polluters after they
missed a federal deadline for a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pleased a settlement has been reached so that the cleanup
process can move forward," said Boxer, who pressured the EPA for an
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Kuhn said the companies' representatives initialed the deal but
some still must get their corporate boards' approval.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Aerojet GenCorp. will pay the largest portion of the
cost in connection with the plant it owned in Azusa.</TE>
<TE>   "Our counsel has recommended signing," said Rosemary Younts, a
senior vice president.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased we reached an agreement. Aerojet's share is major,
and this will enable us to get this issue behind us."</TE>
<TE>   The other companies are Azusa Land Reclamation Co. Inc., Fairchild
Holding Corp., Hartwell Corp., Huffy Corp., Oil &amp; Solvent Process
Co., Reichold Inc. and Wynn Oil Co.</TE>
<TE>   The companies have the right to sue to recover a fair share of the
project's costs from 11 others that have refused to join the
negotiations, despite an EPA order that names them as responsible
parties.</TE>
<TE>   The area beneath Azusa, Baldwin Park and Irwindale is one of five
pockets of ground water in the San Gabriel Valley designated
Superfund sites by the EPA in 1984, giving them special priority for
cleanup and federal funds.</TE>
<TE>   The cost soared in 1997 when perchlorate-hazardous byproduct of
rocket fuel was detected and linked to Aerojet's plant. A process was
developed to deal with it, and another toxic substance, known as NDMA
or n-nitrosodiumethylamine typically used by defense contractors.</TE>

<HD>Killer Executed at San Quentin</HD>
<DH>Crime: Stephen Wayne Anderson spent 20 years on death row
for shooting an 81-year-old woman during burglary.</DH>

<DL>SAN QUENTIN</DL>
<LD>SAN QUENTIN -- Stephen Wayne Anderson was executed by lethal
injection early this morning, two decades after he went to death row
for shooting a San Bernardino County grandmother and then,
authorities said, cooking noodles in her kitchen while she died.</LD>
<LD>   Around midnight--after federal judges were unswayed by a desperate
campaign for a reprieve--Anderson, 48, was dressed in new denim pants
and a blue work shirt and led into the San Quentin State Prison death
chamber.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson, a small-time burglar who confessed to murdering
81-year-old Elizabeth Lyman during a botched robbery in 1980, had
been given a choice between the gas chamber and lethal injection, and
picked the latter: a cocktail of sodium pentothal, pancuronium
bromide and potassium chloride.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities locked down the prison hours earlier as part of an
extraordinary security routine reserved for execution nights.</TE>
<TE>   His last meal consisted of two grilled cheese sandwiches, a pint
of cottage cheese, radishes, hominy grits, a slice of peach pie and a
pint of chocolate chip ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   While many condemned inmates surround themselves with relatives
and supporters as their execution nears, Anderson had no visitors for
the last three days and did not consult with spiritual advisors,
though they were available to him.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's attorneys said his body will be cremated and his ashes
sent to a friend in Farmington, N.M.--the town where he grew up,
suffered through an abusive childhood, was cast out of his house by
his father and began a life of petty crime that would soon mushroom
out of control.</TE>
<TE>   A few dozen protesters, representing the nation's deep division
over the use of execution as a punishment or deterrent for crime,
gathered outside the main gate of California's oldest correctional
institution, north of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   On a night when temperatures dipped to near freezing, they ranged
from college-age to retirees and held signs that read: "Don't kill
for me" and "Not in my name."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, members of L.A. Catholic Worker held a vigil
outside the Criminal Courthouse in downtown Los Angeles. And Father
Bob Jones, of St. Camillus Pastoral Care Center, offered his
regularly scheduled noon Mass for the repose of the soul of Elizabeth
Lyman.</TE>
<TE>   "In our prayers we ask God to bless the citizens of California;
for what is being done in our name, to pardon us," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson was the 10th man executed by California since voters
reinstated the death penalty in 1978 and the first since
double-murderer Robert Lee Massie was executed last March.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Massie, who had not exhausted his appeals and bitterly
chose the death penalty over a lifetime behind bars, Anderson was
"not a volunteer," one of his attorneys, Margo Rocconi, said in an
interview last week. Instead, attorneys, friends and other supporters
had made him the subject of legal disputes and political
intrigue--which continued late into the day Monday.</TE>
<TE>   His attorneys, for instance, filed a lawsuit demanding that Gov.
Gray Davis recuse himself from Anderson's clemency petition, arguing
that the governor has never granted clemency to a murderer--and has
suggested that he never will. After denying clemency to three
previous killers in the last three years, Davis threw out Anderson's
petition on Saturday. Anderson's final appeals on that point were
denied by federal judges late Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Lyman's survivors joined calls for clemency, arguing in court
documents that they did not want--or need--Anderson to die for his
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's legal team also argued that he received poor legal
representation during his trial. He was defended by S. Donald Ames, a
San Bernardino County attorney whose bumbling trial work forced
courts to throw out two other killers' death sentences.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Ames, who died two years ago, claimed Anderson had
prohibited him from calling witnesses. But federal judges
investigating the case found later that Ames' own notes indicated
that Anderson had provided a sizable list of potential witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson's attorneys also said the jury was not allowed to delve
into Anderson's youth, during which he was abused by his parents,
disowned at 17 and forced to live outdoors in the hills surrounding
his New Mexico home. He began robbing churches and schools to get
food and money.</TE>
<TE>   By 1980, Anderson, then a drifter who had been arrested for
several break-ins and had escaped from a Utah work furlough program,
landed in Bloomington, a small, unincorporated town near Fontana. On
Memorial Day, he broke into the home of Lyman, a retired piano
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson had thought Lyman was not home, but when she rose from
her bed, Anderson panicked and shot her in the face with a
.45-caliber handgun. Prosecutors said he then prepared himself
noodles in Lyman's kitchenDefense attorneys suggested Lyman had
prepared the noodles herself before she was killed, and said
overzealous prosecutors seized on details like that to make sure
Anderson would be executed.</TE>
