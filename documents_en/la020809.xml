<HD>In Flanders Field, a Meditation on War</HD>
<DH>Multimedia: A show traces the interlinking history of
conflict, the media and propaganda through a variety of images and
formats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL AMES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>IEPER, Belgium</DL>
<LD>"The best way to carry out good propaganda," wrote the late British
Cabinet Minister Richard Crossman, "is never to appear to be carrying
it out at all."</LD>
<LD>   Crossman's words echo through the arched chambers of Ieper's Cloth
Hall in a provocative exhibition that explores the relationship
between media and warfare in the 20th century--from the recruiting
posters of World War I to the latest digital images from Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Titled "Dead.lines," the multimedia show explores frontiers
between reportage and propaganda.</LD>
<TE>   It confronts the moral dilemmas of those who earn a living
providing close-ups of war's horror, and shows how governments--both
democratic and dictatorial--have sought to exploit the mass media
that grew up alongside the machinery of war over the past 100 years.</TE>
<TE>   Piet Chielens is the coordinator of Ieper's award-winning In
Flanders Fields Museum, which is dedicated to the battles that
reduced this medieval city to dust during World War I.</TE>
<TE>   The inspiration for "Dead.lines" stemmed from the discovery that a
third of the museum's visitors had never met anyone from the
1914-1918 generation.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized that living in this Western European paradise ... we
have been spared direct contact with war," Chielens said in an
interview. "What contact we have comes only through the media."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition begins in the early 1900s, when photography, film
and radio were in their infancy. It draws visitors along a winding
path through the iconography of modern conflict that unfolds in stark
images and scatter-fire sound.</TE>
<TE>   French posters denounce atrocities by spiked-helmeted German
infantry; Robert Capa shows a falling soldier in the Spanish Civil
War; Winston Churchill, on the BBC, promises blood, sweat and tears;
9-year-old Phan Thi Kim Phuc runs naked from a napalm attack in
Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   The final exhibit is an Associated Press monitor flashing
real-time satellite-delivered images from all corners of the world at
21st century speed.</TE>
<TE>   The show illustrates an "incredible link" of continuity running
through media coverage of war over the past 100 years, according to
Chielens. "War changes technologically, but the real nature of war,
the real face of war, does not differ."</TE>
<TE>   "Dead.lines" shows you a giant poster urging British men to defend
the children of Belgium in 1914 as well as a November 2001 front page
from Britain's News of the World tabloid. Its headline, "Why we're at
war," is placed over a photo of William Larkey cradling an urn of
dust from New York's World Trade Center, where his father died in the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   There can be few more apt settings for any exhibition dedicated to
the story of 20th century warfare than Ieper's Cloth Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Once the largest secular building in medieval Europe, it was
blasted into rubble during one of the most destructive battles of
World War I. At the time, Ieper was better known by its French name,
Ypres. The vast hall was painstakingly restored to its gothic glories
after the war--along with the rest of the devastated city.</TE>
<TE>   All around this westernmost corner of Belgium, the remains of many
hundreds of thousands of young men lay under little white crosses,
gray stone slabs or unmarked graves still undiscovered beneath the
heavy Flemish soil.</TE>
<TE>   World War I provides the starting point for the show with a
display of poster art portraying how the Allies demonized German
troops and their leader, Kaiser Wilhelm II, after the 1914 invasion
of neutral Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   Journalistic self-censorship is illustrated by Philip Gibbs,
correspondent of London's Daily Chronicle, whose 1920 description of
the war's "great carving of human flesh" stood in contrast to his
patriotic wartime reports from the front line.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition links a dominant media to each period of 20th
century history--graphic art with World War I, film in the years
between the wars, radio during World War II, television during the
Cold War and the Internet in the most recent conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Questions about the nature of propaganda are raised by sometimes
brutal juxtaposition.</TE>
<TE>   A mock-up of a 1930s movie theater has two screens simultaneously
showing Charlie Chaplin's spoof of Adolf Hitler in "The Great
Dictator" and footage of the real Hitler receiving the adulation of
Germans during a Nazi rally.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, contrasting images from the Spanish Civil War
flicker onto the screens. Extracts from Ernest Hemingway and Dutch
Director Joris Ivens' anti-Fascist documentary, "The Spanish Earth,"
are shown side-by-side with film from the nationalist camp denouncing
"red atrocities."</TE>
<TE>   The World War II section bombards visitors with snippets of radio
reports within huge cubic tents suspended from the ceiling: Joseph
Stalin exhorts Soviet troops; military choirs bellow Nazi marching
songs; British radio sends encrypted messages to French resistance
fighters; and Vera Lynn croons, "We'll meet again."</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition has its heroes, like veteran American reporter
Martha Gellhorn, or Tim Page, the British combat photographer whose
pictures of the Vietnam War get a wall to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   As it explores the line between propaganda and information,
"Dead.lines" asks questions about the role of governments and those
who report on wars.</TE>
<TE>   President Franklin Roosevelt saw "The Spanish Earth," Ivens' 1937
Hemmingway-narrated documentary, at a White House screening but was
not moved by it enough to lift a U.S. ban on exports to Spain where
Francisco Franco's fascists, backed by Nazi Germany, defeated
republican forces. In fact, the film earned Ivens a reputation in the
U.S. as an anarchist.</TE>
<TE>   Spain's civil war saw Nazi Germany carrying out the first
saturation bombing of a civilian target, destroying the town of
Guernica.</TE>
<TE>   "The Spanish Earth" was screened in Ivens' native Netherlands.
However, a scene showing a downed warplane bearing German
manufacturing markings, was edited out so neighbor Nazi Germany would
not be upset.</TE>
<TE>   A picture of Western photographers crouching around a tiny Somalia
refugee baby brings accusations of "war pornography." New
Zealand-born Life magazine photographer George Silk disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps if people got a good look at how wars are fought, they
might stop future wars," he notes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Dead.lines" is on view at the In Flanders Fields Museum until
Nov. 17.</TE>

<HD>Attention Tourists: Elvis Was Born Here</HD>
<DH>Pop Music: Thousands visit the tiny Tupelo, Miss., shanty
and other local sites of the King's hard-luck childhood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WOODY BAIRD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TUPELO, Miss.</DL>
<LD>The wallpaper is a cheap flower print, and a single, bare lightbulb
hangs from the ceiling in each of the two small rooms.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew he had humble beginnings," said Mark Moody, a tourist from
Dundee, Scotland, on a visit to Elvis Presley's birthplace. "But it's
a lot more humble than I thought it would be."</LD>
<LD>   The house lacked even those small niceties on the morning of
Presley's birth--Jan. 8, 1935.</LD>
<TE>   One of thousands of shotgun shanties that were scattered across
the rural South, it's now a tourist attraction drawing up to 100,000
visitors a year. It's the pride of Tupelo, a town of about 34,000
people two hours south of Memphis, Tenn., where Presley began his
rock 'n' roll career.</TE>
<TE>   Tupelo expects a record number of tourists this year, the 25th
anniversary of Elvis' death, on Aug. 16, 1977, at Graceland, his
Memphis residence.</TE>
<TE>   Graceland draws more than 600,000 visitors a year, and many take
side trips to Tupelo, practically a straight shot down U.S. Highway
78.</TE>
<TE>   For some, such as Moody and his family, it's part of a larger tour
of historic blues and rock 'n' roll sites scattered throughout the
Mississippi River Delta.</TE>
<TE>   Presley's father, Vernon, built the 15-foot-by-30-foot house on a
dairy farm where he worked, borrowing $180 to buy the materials. The
family lived there until 1938, when Vernon went to prison for about a
year for altering a $4 check. Unable to keep up payments on the house
loan, Elvis' mother, Gladys, took him to live with relatives.</TE>
<TE>   The Presleys later lived in several homes in Tupelo before moving
to Memphis when Elvis was 13.</TE>
<TE>   The birthplace house can handle only a few visitors at a time.
Tour guide Nina Holcomb explains to three Japanese tourists that the
sparse furnishings were not original to the house but were common for
a farm laborer's residence in the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   The wallpaper also is representative of the period. "But I
understand the Presleys had newspapers on the walls," Holcomb says.</TE>
<TE>   The farm is now gone, and the house sits in a 15-acre park with a
museum, gift shop and chapel. A walk through the house costs $2.
Admission to the museum, made up mostly of mementos collected by
longtime family friend Janelle McComb, is $5.</TE>
<TE>   The city bought the house and land with money that Elvis provided
from a coming-home concert in Tupelo in 1957. The singer wanted a
park for neighborhood children, museum director Lisa Buse said.</TE>
<TE>   "When he grew up here, this was considered the wrong side of town,
and he knew the children needed something to do," Buse said.</TE>
<TE>   A statue of Elvis as a boy, wearing coveralls and carrying a
guitar, was added to the park in January.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what he looked like when he left Tupelo," Buse said. "What
we try to focus on is Elvis up to the age of 13--because that's
ours."</TE>
<TE>   Concrete markers with copper plaques mark the two schools Elvis
attended, the site of a grocery store where people gathered to play
music and socialize, a drive-in restaurant he liked and the hardware
store where he got his first guitar.</TE>
<TE>   The store has an old-timey feel, with worn wood floors, tight
aisles and shelves packed with kerosene lanterns, screen-door latches
and the like.</TE>
<TE>   It's not much different from many other small-town hardware
stores, except, that is, for one glass-topped counter near the front
door.</TE>
<TE>   That's where the famous guitar purchase went down on Presley's
11th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to keep this end of the counter clear," office manager
Helen Logan said. "We have people coming in all the time looking for
it. Sometimes tour buses stop by."</TE>
<TE>   On the counter is a framed letter written by Forrest Bobo, the
former store owner who made the sale. The guitar, the letter says,
cost $7.75 plus 2% sales tax. Elvis wanted a .22-caliber rifle, Bobo
writes, although other accounts say he wanted a bicycle, before his
mother talked him into accepting the guitar.</TE>
<TE>   "I am proud to have a little part in Elvis' life," Bobo wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "We all wished him a great success, and he sure made a great life
for himself and the rest of the world."</TE>

<HD>Courage and Spirit in the Name of Love</HD>
<DH>Alan Blumenfeld and Katherine James stand out in a revival
of Lanford Wilson's 'Talley's Folly.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"This is a waltz," explains our narrator and protagonist, a
compulsively wisecracking Lithuanian Jewish immigrant named Matt
Friedman, as he prepares us and himself for the giddy, nerve-racking
steps of courtship. With disarming, understated eloquence, Matt risks
everything in "Talley's Folly," Lanford Wilson's sweetly moving
two-character romance set against a backdrop of post-World War II
social upheaval.</LD>
<LD>   Appropriately enough, this captivating revival from Free
Association Theatre is a labor of love on several levels, not just
thematic--the cast teams real-life spouses Alan Blumenfeld and
Katherine James, and the entire run is a benefit for the Will Geer
Theatricum Botanicum, where Blumenfeld is currently appearing as
Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice" and as the president in "The
Madwoman of Chaillot," (on Saturdays, he performs all three shows) as
well as assistant directing the upcoming "A Midsummer Night's Dream."</LD>
<LD>   However, no signs of overload are apparent in Blumenfeld's
meticulously nuanced performance as the love-smitten Matt, a
sharp-tongued ex-New Yorker very much out of his element in the
rustic town of Lebanon, Mo., where he's returned to seek the hand of
Sally Talley, the nurse with whom he'd had a brief affair while
vacationing there the previous year.</LD>
<TE>   Matt's opening monologue rivets his audience with the masterful
timing of a Borscht Belt comic and never relinquishes our sympathy as
he dances that age-old waltz around the formidable opposition of
Sally's prominent family (her father had thrown him out of the house
on his previous visit), not to mention the cool reception he gets
from Sally herself.</TE>
<TE>   To call James' Sally an unwilling dance partner would be a supreme
understatement--aloof, unsmiling and pointedly refusing to let
herself be drawn into an intimate conversation, Sally is well on her
way to lonely, bitter spinsterhood. Yet her nobility of spirit and
unusually tolerant attitudes are also apparent, and she's at least
agreed to slip away from Fourth of July festivities to meet Matt in
the Talley family folly, a dilapidated boathouse built by her uncle
in the days before the clan had fallen on hard times.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the main house, Sally's relations indulge in the
dysfunctional sparring Wilson later chronicled in "Talley and Sons,"
(the trilogy concludes with "The Fifth of July") but here there's at
least a chance of happiness--of moving past their respective haunted
pasts--for two people worth caring about.</TE>
<TE>   It would be hard to imagine a more apropos setting for Wilson's
abandoned folly than the Theatricum's newly opened S. Mark Taper
Youth Pavilion. Like its larger-capacity adjacent space, the 100-seat
outdoor amphitheater is set against a steep, scenic canyon wall--a
perfect backdrop for the treacherous terrain Matt calls "a remote
wood on a remote and capricious river."</TE>
<TE>   Under Stan Roth's assured direction, the two performers employ
unwavering emotional authenticity to establish the high stakes in
this last-chance reunion. There are no missteps here--this dance is
hilarious, heartbreaking, and ultimately heroic.</TE>

<HD>'Buddha' Puts Gangs in New Setting</HD>
<DH>Brian T. Maeda's film observes two wayward Japanese
American brothers, but there are other, richer stories to be told
about the experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brian T. Maeda's "Buddha Heads" is at once a powerful family saga,
and a gangster movie that is way too talky but balanced by its
unusual background. A tale about two generations of gangbangers in
the Japanese American community is certainly not your typical fare.</LD>
<LD>   "Buddha Heads" starts with a collage of newsreel images showing
Little Tokyo's Japanese Americans being evacuated to internment camps
not long after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. The Sugimoto family is no
different from countless others returning from Manzanar to rebuild
their lives from scratch. The father takes odd jobs and works as a
gardener. He and his wife are at last able to open their own grocery
store on 2nd Street in Los Angeles' Little Tokyo in 1968.</LD>
<LD>   Just as things are looking up for the Sugimotos, a jittery drug
addict holds up the grocery, killing 5-year-old Marco's parents
before his very eyes. His considerably older brother Suggzy, a member
of a Japanese American gang, the Buddha Heads, is not present but
catches up with his parents' killer and shoots him dead. For
premeditated murder, Suggzy receives a 25-year sentence. Meanwhile,
Marco grows up in orphanages, developing a reputation for being out
of control.</LD>
<TE>   This is presented in highly condensed fashion, for the story
really begins with Suggzy's release from prison. Suggzy (Calvin Jung)
is a stocky, rugged man of 45 who has served his long term with his
resilience intact. He has had plenty of time to reflect on the folly
of his revenge, because it robbed him of his primary responsibility
in raising his younger brother.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to a drastically changed Little Tokyo, Suggzy eventually
tracks down Marco (Eddie Mui) only to find he is a member of the
multiethnic Savage Boys. They steal cars for a Chinese American
underworld kingpin, Wallace Chin (A.M. Lai), to whom Marco feels a
deep paternal allegiance. Clearly, Suggzy has his work cut out for
him in his determination to rescue his younger brother from his
entrenched life of crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Buddha Heads" plays out reasonably persuasively, much like
similar movies set in Latino or African American communities. Mui and
Jung are solid actors, as are Louise Mita as a bar owner attracted to
Suggzy and Helen Ota as the daughter of one of Suggzy's old pals. A
gang counselor, she makes a deeper impression on Marco than on his
older brother.</TE>
<TE>   "Buddha Heads," which is competently made, defies the stereotype
of Japanese Americans as model citizens, as Maeda, a veteran
cameraman, has pointed out in interviews. Yet how many fictional
sagas, as opposed to documentaries, have been made about the Japanese
American experience and its remarkable collective triumph over racism
and injustice?</TE>
<TE>   How about a drama about a family returning from an internment camp
and successfully persevering over adversity to foster two generations
of richly varied and accomplished citizens? Perhaps that would have
been the more interesting story to tell.</TE>

<HD>Needling a Nation</HD>
<DH>Larry Elder, the L.A. talk show host whose libertarian
views often provoke his listeners, is taking his message to a larger
audience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After his first foray into talk radio a decade ago, Larry Elder said,
"I remember saying to myself what a god-awful waste of time that
was."</LD>
<LD>   Since then, the host, who calls himself "the Sage from
South-Central," has changed his viewpoint, and now wants a portion of
the rest of the country to spend three hours a day with him. He jumps
to national syndication on Monday after eight years at KABC-AM (790),
where he's heard weekdays from 3 to 7 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like I've got a message that will resonate with the rest
of the country," a message whose pillars are personal accountability
and reduced government, he says. Elder revels in his fans,
"Elderados," and rages against "victicrats," those who "blame all
ills, problems, concerns and unhappiness on others."</LD>
<TE>   A self-described social liberal and fiscal conservative, Elder and
his libertarian views can enrage Democrats and Republicans,
alternately.</TE>
<TE>   He favors abortion rights and legalizing drugs. He also wants to
end welfare and abolish the IRS, and calls affirmative action
"morally bankrupt."</TE>
<TE>   "Hard work wins, and I think if you obsess over race, you're doing
a disservice to the country in general and to blacks in particular,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Rep. Maxine
Waters (D-Los Angeles) are frequent targets on his show, which
includes repartee with callers, spoofs of news items, and commentary
from Elder, who has a rapid-fire delivery and a lawyer's facility for
rhetoric and dissecting an argument.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very good at making a case, and being a black conservative
makes him provocative," said Michael Harrison, publisher of Talkers
magazine, the trade publication for talk radio. "He can get away with
saying things that would seem racist in a politically correct society
if said by a white person."</TE>
<TE>   Like, "blacks are more racist than whites," one of the tenets of
Elder's best-selling 2000 book, "The Ten Things You Can't Say in
America." He also asserts that "there is no glass ceiling that stops
hard-working, talented women from realizing their career goals," that
there's "maybe a dime's worth of difference" between Republicans and
Democrats, and that the welfare state is "helping us to death."</TE>
<TE>   "I think I bring a certain kind of credibility and 'inside
baseball' a white person couldn't bring," he said, but "most of the
so-called black leaders would not be happy with my message."</TE>
<TE>   Yet as much as they decried his viewpoints, many civil rights
leaders defended his right to speak in 1997 when a South-Central
pressure group, the Talking Drum Community Forum, advocated a boycott
of Elder's program and its sponsors. The anonymous campaign sent
fliers to advertisers and called Elder's show "the most racist,
anti-black program in America."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Many sponsors pulled out, costing KABC an estimated $3 million in
revenue. Denying that the boycott influenced the decision, the
station cut Elder's show from four hours to two, but reinstated his
program to full length when robust ratings, a counter-protest by fans
and a change in KABC management abated the furor.</TE>
<TE>   Since he weathered that storm, observers don't think he risks
facing another such attack by a group elsewhere, even though he's
stepping onto a national stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what market you could put him in where he'd be more
exposed than he's ever been in Los Angeles," said Al Peterson, news,
talk and sports editor for the trade magazine Radio &amp; Records. "Any
talk host that doesn't cause people to react in some way--positive or
negative--isn't doing his job."</TE>
<TE>   Elder will continue in his regular time slot at KABC, and starting
Monday or soon after, will also be heard courtesy of ABC Radio
Networks in Washington, D.C., Portland, Ore., Wilmington, N.C.,
Tampa, Fla., West Palm Beach, Fla., Port St. Lucie, Fla.,
Hartford/New Haven, Conn., and New London, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from tweaking the opening of his program--"Buenas tardes,
Los Angeles! The Court of Radio Free California is back in
session!"--Elder said he expects to change his show very little for a
national audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the issues in California have national import," he said,
such as bilingual education, Proposition 13, Proposition 187 and
secession. And Hollywood is always good fodder.</TE>
<TE>   Elder, 50, went from Crenshaw High School to Ivy League Brown
University, then got his law degree from the University of Michigan.
After working as a lawyer in Cleveland, he started his own company,
an executive search firm placing attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   He said that gave him the time to pursue an interest in writing,
such as newspaper op-ed pieces, which led to a guest spot on a local
radio show in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   After that "waste of time," a station executive who admired
Elder's passion asked him to fill in for one of his hosts on a week's
vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Then-KABC host Dennis Prager, now on KRLA-AM (870), heard Elder
and persuaded his bosses to give him a shot. In 1994, with a total of
five days' experience, Elder moved to Los Angeles and became a
full-time talk radio host.</TE>
<TE>   Elder said he exhibited his persuasive powers recently after a
federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that the Pledge of
Allegiance was unconstitutional because of the phrase "under God."</TE>
<TE>   "I took the position that the plaintiff was right," Elder said,
although he added that if he was an atheist, "I can't imagine it
would be a big enough deal to me" to sue. But he maintained that the
court's decision was correct on constitutional grounds--a stance that
infuriated many of his conservative listeners.</TE>
<TE>   As he made his arguments, Elder said he was glad to hear some
callers come around to his side.</TE>
<TE>   "Calm down, listen to me, and maybe you'll re-think your
assumptions," he said. "My goal is to provoke, inform, educate and
entertain. And, from time to time, I like to think sometimes I can
accomplish all four."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NPR examines a changing California: The "New California" is the
subject of a four-part series from National Public Radio that debuts
this afternoon and runs through Monday on the newsmagazine "All
Things Considered."</TE>
<TE>   The segments' common theme is the state's changing demographics,
with the first report profiling a Latino entrepreneur in Los Angeles.
Mexican immigrant Pedro Rivera worked his way through an underground
economy to become owner of his own record company, an example that
English is increasingly not a requirement for success in this
majority-minority state.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's installment looks at Asian activism in San Francisco,
which arose when members of the ethnic community making up 30% of the
city's population felt their children were being denied access to the
best public schools.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, reporter Ina Jaffe looks at the convergence of
immigration and organized labor, which in Los Angeles alone has added
120,000 new union members in the past three years.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Monday's segment looks at reverse migration--a trend
shown in the 2000 census of many California residents and newcomers
abandoning the dream of coastal living. Instead, commuters seeking
affordable homes and retirees fleeing city congestion are flocking
inland, to the Central Valley and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "All Things Considered" airs weekdays from 3 to 6:30 p.m. on
KPCC-FM (89.3), and from 4 to 7 p.m. on KCRW-FM (89.9). "Weekend All
Things Considered" is heard Saturdays and Sundays on KPCC and KCRW
from 5 to 6 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Frank Zappa Is the Toast of Small German Town</HD>
<DH>Pop Music: A bust of the late musician has been dedicated
in Bad Doberan, site of a fan club's festival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CONNOLLY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Living in Communist East Germany, Wolfhard Kutz used all kinds of
schemes to smuggle in his beloved Frank Zappa records: secretive
rendezvous with West Germans at highway rest stops. Hidden
compartments in his car doors. Accomplices who sneaked albums across
borders.</LD>
<LD>   After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Kutz could pursue his
passion openly and created a fan club: the Arf Society, a reference
to Zappa's Barking Pumpkin record label.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the group, the little town of Bad Doberan, in an
economically depressed area near the Baltic Sea, has become the
unlikely site of an annual Zappa festival. This week, the town also
dedicated a bronze bust of the late American musician in its central
square.</LD>
<TE>   The image, of Zappa in the 1970s, "represents him as a rebel and
avant-gardist," said Kutz, 47. "That's the way we want to hold him in
memory."</TE>
<TE>   The town council initially was skeptical, Kutz said, but gave in
after some hard lobbying--and an Arf Society pledge to pay about
$10,000 to build and care for the monument. He said the council hopes
Zappa will draw tourists.</TE>
<TE>   The town of 12,000 is already something of a magnet for Zappa
freaks. Last weekend, the 13th annual Zappanale festival included
bands from the United States, Sweden, France and Hungary, and a
German-language play called "All About Frank."</TE>
<TE>   The festival started in 1990 when Kutz threw a party and found a
band that could play a few Zappa songs. This year, he said, some
2,500 people showed up for each of the three days. Eleven former
Zappa band members played, and two of Zappa's siblings attended.</TE>
<TE>   "It was incredible to see that kind of outpouring of love and
respect for Frank," said Candy Zappa, Frank's 51-year-old sister, by
telephone from the San Fernando Valley. She attended the festival
with her brother Bob.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'd have known as a little girl living with him that I would
grow up and come to a foreign city and see posters of my brother
sitting on a toilet, I wouldn't have believed it," she said,
referring to a well-known Zappa image that was used as this year's
festival poster.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Zappa died of cancer in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Kutz, who owns companies that install cable and antenna systems,
saw him perform live once. Kutz had become hooked at age 16 when he
heard Zappa's 1969 album "Burnt Weeny Sandwich."</TE>
<TE>   "It was because we were especially restricted, and Frank Zappa
strove for freedom and democracy," Kutz said.</TE>
<TE>   Zappa--a cult favorite in the United States for his quirky,
irreverent and often off-color lyrics--had a significant following
behind the Iron Curtain. Czech President Vaclav Havel said after his
death: "Frank was a friend of our newly emerging democracy ... a
friend of our country."</TE>

<HD>Dogma Filmmakers Confess They Broke Their Own Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>COPENHAGEN</DL>
<LD>It doesn't sound like a big deal: a towel hung over a window to
adjust the lighting during the shooting of a film.</LD>
<LD>   But for a follower of the "Dogma Vow of Chastity," it's a mortal
sin.</LD>
<LD>   Now the founders of the strict rules for filmmaking that were
introduced in 1995 admit they broke their own credo when they made
the first of the movies that created a new genre.</LD>
<TE>   In a documentary film previewed Thursday, the four Danes admitted
they broke the rules designed to strip away the superficiality of
modern filmmaking by forbidding props, artificial lighting and
directing.</TE>
<TE>   "We must conclude that the genuine Dogma film has not been made,"
said director Lars von Trier, who won the Palme d'Or at the 2000
Cannes Film Festival for "Dancer in the Dark," which did not follow
the concept.</TE>
<TE>   Von Trier drew worldwide attention in 1995 when he launched the
Dogma 95 concept--a set of minimalist rules aimed at bringing back
focus on story and plot in filmmaking. The rules forbid sound editing
and any equipment beyond hand-held cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Von Trier, Thomas Vinterberg, Soeren Kragh-Jacobsen and Kristian
Levring made the first four Dogma films, followed by several other
moviemakers worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary, titled "The Purified," contained
behind-the-scenes footage from the four films as well as interviews
with the filmmakers, who discussed the successes and failures of the
Dogma concept.</TE>
<TE>   "It was liberating for the imagination; it was innovative,"
Vinterberg said. But he admitted he had been forced to adjust the
lighting in one scene of "The Celebration" by hanging a towel over a
window.</TE>
<TE>   The other three also said they had been forced to or had
unconsciously broken some of the rules, according to the documentary.
Kragh-Jacobsen said he directed an actress before a scene in
"Mifune." Von Trier brought in a cable for lighting in a scene in
"The Idiots," while a hairdresser cut the hair of an actor between
two scenes in Levring's "The King Is Alive."</TE>
<TE>   None of the filmmakers has attempted a Dogma movie since, but all
four agreed that they would like to try again--this time without
exceptions.</TE>

<HD>'ER' Nurse Pulls a Shift as a Film Writer-Director</HD>
<DH>Movies: Lily Mariye is pursuing filmmaking after attending
AFI's Directing Workshop for Women.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN ELBER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of playing a nurse on "ER," Lily Mariye diagnosed her own
surprising condition: She'd developed an itch to direct as well as
act.</LD>
<LD>   The desire to go behind the camera hit her in 1998 after Mariye
saw a fellow cast member scrutinizing a director at work on the NBC
medical drama.</LD>
<LD>   "I said, 'I want to do that. Since I'm sitting around anyway, I
might as well be learning something,' " Mariye, who has appeared as
nurse Lily Jarvik since the show's 1994 debut, recalled thinking.</LD>
<TE>   Four years later, she's the proud writer-director of "The
Shangri-la Cafe," a short film based in part on her Japanese American
family's life in Las Vegas in the late 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Mariye made the jump to directing through the American Film
Institute's Directing Workshop for Women, founded in 1974 to bring
more women into the mostly male ranks of film and TV directors.</TE>
<TE>   Alumna include Randa Haines ("Children of a Lesser God"), Victoria
Hochberg ("Sex and the City") and poet Maya Angelou ("Down in the
Delta").</TE>
<TE>   (After nearly 30 years, the workshop has yet to become
superfluous. A recent Directors Guild of America study found that
women directed just 11% of episodes for prime-time TV's top 40
comedies and dramas.)</TE>
<TE>   Mariye had the kind of experience that AFI envisions, said Joe
Petricca, vice dean of the AFI Conservatory, which includes the
women's workshop.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Shangri-la Cafe' has been a very successful film for the
program. It was shown and won awards at many festivals, and was
screened on public television," on KCET in Los Angeles, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome is more than Mariye expected when she told Lesli Linka
Glatter, one of her "ER" director-mentors, about a flier describing
the AFI workshop.</TE>
<TE>   "She looked like I hit her on the head with a mallet. She said she
had done the program and thought I'd be great for it," Mariye
recounted.</TE>
<TE>   With a 20-page script and letters of recommendation in hand, the
actress, who also trained as a singer and dancer, applied for one of
the eight spots AFI intends for women already in "media arts."</TE>
<TE>   That represents a wide range of possibilities, Petricca said,
including producers, choreographers, photographers or even "someone
who runs a nonprofit arts organization in New Hampshire."</TE>
<TE>   Among the seven who were selected with Mariye in 1999 from about
200 applicants was, by coincidence, fellow "ER" nurse Yvette Freeman.
Her script focused on tensions between black Americans who embrace
their African heritage and those who shun it.</TE>
<TE>   For Mariye's group, the AFI program began with a three-week
seminar, traditionally held in spring.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't know anything about filmmaking, it's not enough
training to make a short film," she cautioned. "In my year, we had a
couple of film editors, writers, actors and a script supervisor.
Everybody had different perspectives on the filmmaking process."</TE>
<TE>   Mariye's story was about an Asian American family facing pervasive
racism and compelled, in turn, to discriminate against blacks, still
subject to segregation in Las Vegas in the late 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   The film was well-reviewed and an award-winner at the Brussels
Independent Film Festival and Nashville Independent Film Festival,
among others. Mariye is seeking financing to make a theatrical
version out of an expanded script.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, she's back for the ninth season of "ER." Mariye
good-naturedly acknowledges the work can be cut-and-dried: "
'BP--blood pressure--80 over 60' is a popular line," she said with a
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   But it's all part of the creative process, with her work as an
actress made more enjoyable by her greater understanding of
filmmaking, Mariye said. Besides, she and Freeman don't check their
new skills at the emergency room door.</TE>
<TE>   "We play a game where we stand there and say, 'All right, how do
you think [the director's] going to shoot this?' We figure out how we
would shoot it and then wait and see what the director does to see if
we were right.</TE>
<TE>   "Our directors will catch us and say, 'Oh, great, two more
directors. So, am I doing it right?' "</TE>

<LD>To name or not to name?</LD>
<LD>   That is today's crime-reporting question that applies to accused
sexual predators as well as to victims and alleged victims.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles this week, for example, a teacher at a summer camp
for young children was jailed because of allegations he sexually
abused two 4-year-old boys. He faces arraignment, at which he may be
formally charged. If he is, a preliminary hearing will determine if
there is enough evidence for him to go to trial.</LD>
<TE>   The story was reported on local TV with the man's name and
picture. The boys were not identified. Names of minors, either
victims or suspects, are rarely reported in such cases. Alleged adult
victims of sexual abuse are also not identified unless they give
permission.</TE>
<TE>   I say "alleged" victims, by the way, after earning a PhD in
circumspection from witnessing the suffering McMartins in the 1980s,
learning that sexual abuse allegations are not necessarily true even
when made sincerely by innocent tykes at a Manhattan Beach day-care
center.</TE>
<TE>   Look, child molesters are sick scum who deserve severe punishment.
So if the evidence supports this guy's guilt, he should be tried, and
if convicted, he should be imprisoned for the max. Stringing him up
by his toes and smacking him as if he were a pinata wouldn't be a bad
idea either.</TE>
<TE>   And if he is not guilty? Oh, that. Don't bother us with minutiae.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to media coverage, he'll take a big hit even if he is
innocent. Should the case be thrown out for lack of evidence, for
example, the man still would be stamped indelibly as a fiend and
danger to every kid within range. Naming him publicly--and beaming
his photo to the multitudes--has already ended his career in camp
work and possibly ruined his life forever.</TE>
<TE>   No caring parent would entrust a child to someone who had been
accused of sexual abuse or want him even passing through the
neighborhood. Sending him home a free man would not erase the
lingering scent of guilt.</TE>
<TE>   The naming issue roared to the surface earlier with the recent
abduction of Antelope Valley teenagers Tamara Brooks and Jacqueline
Marris. Before they got lucky--when their armed captor, Roy Ratliff,
was gunned down by Kern County sheriff's deputies--they got famous.</TE>
<TE>   Their photos were run and names bannered on TV and in newspapers
(one exception being The Times) before Kern County's sheriff said
they had been raped. That disclosure brought media hand-wringing:
Should names already made public now be rebottled for the girls'
protection?</TE>
<TE>   That became moot when both, along with their parents, were chatted
up by Katie Couric on NBC's "Today" program. So much for anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   A free-for-all over booking them on TV had kicked in like a
barroom brawl where everyone cracks everyone else over the head with
a chair or whiskey bottle. But it wasn't "Today" that duct-taped and
stole Tamara and Jacqueline, nor were their parents ordered to sign
on for the Couric gig.</TE>
<TE>   And good for all of them, too. Why should these girls hide as if
getting raped were their crime? Although they declined to tell Couric
(who asked gently) how they were treated physically by Ratliff, they
have no cause for shame. Why shouldn't they be as open about their
sexual assaults--if that would be their choice--as about the rest of
their nightmarish ordeal? Why not feel comfortable telling all, as
victims of other crimes usually do?</TE>
<TE>   "What's the difference between rape and being shot and being
stabbed?" asks Karen Pomer, a friend of mine who was raped by a
stranger in Santa Monica in 1995. "During rape a penis is being used
as a weapon of violence. My insides were completely torn up."</TE>
<TE>   The difference looms big in the media's theater of the absurd,
where a female whose breast was fondled by a sexual predator likely
would not be identified, though she would be if her breast were
stabbed by a mugger.</TE>
<TE>   A recent story in The Times said the abduction "may force the
media to reexamine their long-standing policies of withholding the
names of sexual assault victims."</TE>
<TE>   If so, swell plan.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the hoops jumped through to grant anonymity to alleged
victims in the past, the most absurd being an electronic blue dot
hiding the face of accuser Patricia Bowman in the 1991 televised rape
trial of William Kennedy Smith.</TE>
<TE>   How loopy was this? Bowman's face was shielded from viewers. Yet
she wore no blue dot when testifying in the courtroom and was seen by
the public as she entered and left. And after Smith was acquitted,
she went full-face to the planet while making the media rounds.</TE>
<TE>   There's compassionate logic to the argument that coming out about
rape should be entirely the victim's call, not the media's. Also true
is that outing victims may stop others from coming forward with
charges out of fear of publicity.</TE>
<TE>   But that fear exists only because of a stigma still attached to
rape, one that would fade were there more openness.</TE>
<TE>   What of the stated media concern that disclosing these names would
violate the privacy of victims? That's choice when it comes to TV,
given how cavalierly its "caught on tape" crowd invades other privacy
zones in the name of the public's right to know.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, withholding victims' names nourishes the unfair taint of
disgrace that surrounds victims. We're self-appointed Big Daddies
here, patting them on the head and saying, in effect, "We'll hide you
because you've been naughty."</TE>
<TE>   Says Pomer: "If I had a nickel for every time someone asked me
what I was wearing the night I was raped, I'd be retired." She says
she went public with her rape at a police press conference a few
months later, after learning her attacker had struck again just
blocks away, victimizing an 83-year-old woman. "I felt I was doing a
public service by putting a name on rape statistics. Besides, what
did I do? I didn't want society to shame me for something I had no
reason to be ashamed of."</TE>
<TE>   However this Name the Victim conundrum plays out, let's have
fairness.</TE>
<TE>   What about also rethinking, too, the media policy of automatically
reporting the names of adult suspects? In sexual abuse and assault
cases for starters, the possible exceptions could be charges against
priests in a scandal that appears too vast and incestuous to grant
accused churchmen anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   In principle, though, it's unfair to hold back the names of
accusers while shouting out names of the accused. These people are
dragged through the mud without thought about what awaits them if
they are not guilty, never tried or never even officially charged.
Which does happen occasionally, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Take Patrick Gillan, the San Marino High School girls' basketball
coach whose arrest on suspicion of molesting one of his players was
announced by grandstanding cops at a City Hall press conference in
December and reported in this paper and on local TV. The smear had
already thickened when Gillan's case ended less than two months
later, and the district attorney's office cited insufficient evidence
in deciding not to file charges. Gillan later sued San Marino and its
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   His beef should be with the media, too.</TE>
<TE>   Our small-screen culture, in particular, is corroded by such
excess, as suspects in even the tiniest of cases earn high wattage
from the camera, especially when handcuffed and led off by cops.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps they're guilty; perhaps not. It doesn't matter, though, as
long as they're good TV.</TE>

<HD>Classic Clint: 'Blood,' Sweat and Golden Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clint Eastwood is the Last 72-Year-Old Action Hero. His neck has more
wrinkles than a Shar-Pei--even the creases on his face have
creases--but he remains one tough hombre, a man with a nine-mile
stare and the wherewithal to back it up.</LD>
<LD>   Eastwood has also been shrewd about how he uses his age, managing
to find older roles of interest and variety. Though Terry McCaleb is
a mere 46 in the Michael Connelly novel that the film "Blood Work" is
based on, Eastwood saw something in the character that could be made
to work for him.</LD>
<LD>   After a brief prologue that helps establish the plot, we reconnect
with McCaleb, a retired FBI agent, 60 days after he's had a
successful heart transplant. Under the supervision of cardiologist
Dr. Bonnie Fox (Anjelica Huston), he's swallowing 34 pills a day and
monitoring his temperature on his boat in San Pedro. The most arduous
part of his day is trading languid hellos with his slacker neighbor
Buddy Noone (Jeff Daniels).</LD>
<TE>   Onto that boat comes Graciella Rivers (Wanda De Jesus), attracted
to McCaleb's reputation for being a master at investigating crime
scenes, someone who was so good at what he did that perpetrators
would sometimes leave taunting personal messages next to the
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Graciella's sister, Gloria, was recently murdered, apparently a
wrong-place-at-the-wrong-time victim of a convenience store robbery.
The police have gotten nowhere, and Graciella wants McCaleb to
investigate. His health, the still-real threat of his body rejecting
his new heart, makes him say no. But the sister knows something that
makes McCaleb change his mind and agree to gamble with his life.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, a character with a well-defined sense of imminent
mortality is something Eastwood can play handily at this stage of his
career. When McCaleb has trouble catching his breath, we truly fear
for him, and when people tell him he looks like he needs a nap, we
want to yell out a supportive "you betcha!"</TE>
<TE>   As he ages as an actor, Eastwood, like Paul Newman, uses an
economy of means to remain as compelling as he ever was. He
thoroughly knows his core persona, and he has honed his trademark
look of disgust until it's one of the most vivid ever put on screen.</TE>
<TE>   But, as "Blood Work" demonstrates as well, Eastwood's directing
has also been affected by his age. You don't know whether to admire
the film's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by
a noticeable lack of pace. Or both.</TE>
<TE>   Connelly's excellent novel, crisply written and smartly plotted,
is certainly fine thriller material. As adapted by Brian Helgeland,
the film has inevitably compressed (sometimes to the point of
squashing) the original, making at least one key change that is sure
to annoy regular Connelly readers.</TE>
<TE>   As we follow McCaleb through his
there's-more-here-than-meets-the-eye investigation, hissing cops like
Ronaldo Arrango (Paul Rodriguez) who impede him and cheering those
like Jaye Winston (Tina Lifford) who help, the essential squareness
of this adventure becomes increasingly apparent.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, there's a certain pleasure in seeing a thriller
that's almost a relic of a bygone era. There's nothing flashy about
"Blood Work," no in-your-face nihilism, no hot young actors you'd
know from the WB network if you ever watched it.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the way Eastwood has directed the actors he has
chosen makes this film's lack of energy hard to miss. The flip side
of classicism is lethargy, and "Blood Work" can be so complacently
paced you may want to give it a shot of Red Bull.</TE>
<TE>   Eastwood gives the film that shot whenever he can, but it's not
often enough.</TE>
<TE>   Still, to quote actor Daniels, "when you're standing there
watching Clint Eastwood stride down the middle of a California
boulevard with a sawed-off shotgun, blowing away a Ford," that still
means something.</TE>

<DH>'Secret Ballot' is a light 'African Queen'-type tale that
speaks volumes about life and politics in Iran.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Babak Payami's delightful "Secret Ballot" is another fine Iranian
film centering on a character determined to carry out a task against
all odds that reveals much about present-day Iran within the confines
of government censorship. What's more, Payami, inspired by a short
made by renowned director Mohsen Makhmalbaf, manages to make social
commentary amid much humor. Indeed, "Secret Ballot" might be
described as a serious comedy and is a work of effectively minimalist
style.</LD>
<LD>   On the desert island of Kish in the Persian Gulf, a large crate is
dropped by parachute onto a barren stretch of beach where two
soldiers spell each other guarding the coastline against smugglers.
Payami proves a master of the long-held shot right at the start. What
is in this crate, which one soldier laboriously hauls to the side of
a tent serving as a garage for a jeep? Here the long-held shot evokes
absurdist humor; later, it will evoke pathos.</LD>
<LD>   The guard wakes up his comrade (Cyrus Abidi), who is asleep on a
cot in the open air, hands him his rifle and takes his place on the
bed. Abidi's soldier is a big, rangy, granite-jawed guy who speaks
Farsi with a Turkish accent.</LD>
<TE>   He stands by the crate impatiently, and finally a young woman
(Nassim Abdi) in a chador arrives in a small boat propelled by an
outboard motor. Abdi is a government official charged with collecting
votes from the island's few and far-flung inhabitants. Inside the
crate is a cardboard ballot box and a supply of ballots, listing 10
presidential candidates. Each citizen is to vote for two.</TE>
<TE>   Right off, the soldier refuses to cooperate because he cannot
believe an election official could be a woman until she points out
that his orders do not specify the official's gender. She has only
until 5:30 p.m., when the boat returns to pick her up, to do her job
and it's already 8:30 a.m. If she misses the boat, all the ballots
become invalid.</TE>
<TE>   As the two take off in the Jeep, they've already established a
prickly relationship reminiscent of Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey
Bogart in "The African Queen" (1951).</TE>
<TE>   The woman is a dedicated idealist who asserts that nothing is
impossible, while the soldier is a gruff type convinced her arrival
has ruined his day.</TE>
<TE>   As they drive around, the girl gives the soldier a civics lesson,
stressing the importance of voting if society is to change and
improve.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, most of the candidates are unfamiliar to the
island's inhabitants, but she assures them that they all are aware of
the challenges and problems facing the islanders.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, it is more imperative to the girl that everyone possible
must vote to get this democratic process up and running. With the
proper identification, everyone 16 and older has the right to vote in
secret.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, the girl and the soldier come across a wide
cross-section of people of varying ethnicities. It's constantly
uphill for her. People tend to be scared off by the armed soldier; a
nomadic group of women do not feel they should vote without their
permission of their husbands, most likely away fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Another group does not speak Farsi. An old man who has rigged up a
solar energy station insists he could only vote for God. Some women
from another island are upset that one of their number who is married
and already pregnant at the age of 12 is held too young to vote yet
not too young to be married off by her family.</TE>
<TE>   This election day activity, in short, reveals much about Iran,
including the plight of illegal immigrants as well as the
oppressiveness of arranged marriages.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the day, the soldier is a changed man. By humoring
the girl in going to often absurd and sometimes futile lengths to get
every vote possible, he has learned to respect her steadfast endeavor
and understand its importance. He has also become decidedly attracted
to the girl, who is very pretty, but custom dictates that he must
keep his feelings to himself.</TE>
<TE>   Abdi and Abidi are flawless, at once amusing, touching and
attractive.</TE>
<TE>   Like everyone else in the cast they are nonprofessionals who were
not given the script in advance by Payami.</TE>
<TE>   "Secret Ballot," which has a rich, spare score by Michael Galasso
that blends Eastern and Western motifs, is funny, provocative,
well-paced and leaves a memorable bittersweet aftertaste.</TE>

<HD>History, and Remembering It</HD>
<DH>In 'Echoes: A Century Survey,' Arnold Mesches' work
combines the tumult of the past and how it's affected by memory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Arnold Mesches' paintings, vigorous brushwork embodies turmoil. On
the one hand it describes the tumult of what's depicted--the whirling
uproar of a Coney Island carnival ride, for example, or the tangled
patterns of global migration undertaken by Eastern Europeans in the
20th century. On the other hand the chaotic jumble of individual
human memory is denoted. Between the two, our sense of history
accumulates.</LD>
<LD>   At the Ben Maltz Gallery at Otis College of Art and Design,
"Echoes: A Century Survey" brings together 16 large paintings, 59
smaller ones on canvas or paper and eight drawings. It's a pared-down
version of a show organized in 2000 by the Oregon Jewish Museum in
Portland.</LD>
<LD>   The paintings date from the late 1990s, and their tangle of social
history and personal recollection shows the 79-year-old artist
layering the imminent turn of one century onto the one that preceded
it. Born in the Bronx, Mesches was the son of an immigrant to New
York's Lower East Side, who is remembered in a large painting. It
shows a dapper, well-dressed man with his arm around a boy in
knickers, as if protecting him from the darkly aggressive forest in
which they stand. A separate portrait of the artist's mother as an
old woman--painted in layered tonalities of blue--renders her as an
elusive, unknowable yet omnipresent apparition.</LD>
<TE>   Rows of small paintings, mostly black and white and shown in heavy
frames, reproduce family snapshots--weddings, vacations, outings,
etc. The odd practice of recording old photographs in paint in actual
size has a peculiar effect: As labored meditations on an elusive
past, they become reminders of mortality. This is painting as memento
mori.</TE>
<TE>   Several works map the routes of European immigrants, pushed by war
or other hardship. This diaspora is interwoven with Hollywood pinups,
fragments of tenement life and Coney Island scenes. Most of the map
paintings are on un-stretched canvas, hung from grommets. They have
the look of campaign charts salvaged from the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   The show's most compelling picture brings all these elements
together. Shrouded in a sickly, aqueous green light--it looks like an
underwater realm--"Anomie 2001: Coney" (1997) is at once playful and
horrific, a fun-house view of the world. Merry-go-round horses
stampede. A Buck Rogers-style rocket ship is on the launch pad, aimed
at a World War II fighter plane. D-Day parachutes merge with a
raucous carnival ride. And the scene is dominated by a gigantic
carnival Cyclops, whose one-eyed view is both barbarous and obsolete.</TE>

<TE>   Illuminated Manuscripts of Religious, Classic Texts</TE>
<TE>   Illuminated manuscripts have been called medieval comic books, and
not without reason. The narrative interdependence between written
word and painted picture is key.</TE>
<TE>   At Roth Horowitz Ferrini &amp; Biondi, a rare and luxurious exhibition
of medieval and Renaissance manuscript illuminations also shows some
limitations of the analogy. You don't need to read Latin to be moved
by a rendition (tucked inside a fat letter N) of the reunion of
Joachim and Anna at the Golden Gate. Elsewhere, recognizing that
intricately decorated borders honor the experience of reading is
separate from specific details of the religious or classical text
that has been lavishly adorned.</TE>
<TE>   The show includes 26 manuscripts--Bibles, Psalters, books of
hours, epic poetry, etc.--as well as 10 cuttings, decorated initials,
full-page miniatures and other sheets. They range in date from the
12th century to the early 16th century, and most are German, French,
Flemish or Italian.</TE>
<TE>   One that isn't is historically significant: an English-manuscript
Bible (circa 1410) that once belonged to Richard Hunne, a London
merchant famously accused of heresy and mysteriously found dead in
the bishop's prison at St. Paul's Cathedral. (The church alleged the
hanging was a suicide, born of guilt; his friends cried murder.) A
Wycliff Bible, which predates King James, it's the first English
translation of the New Testament from Latin.</TE>
<TE>   Others are of more visual interest. An annunciation in a Northern
European book of hours (circa 1470) gives the angel's visit to the
Virgin Mary all the pomp and circumstance of a courtly
coronation--thus neatly anticipating her future veneration as queen
of heaven. Slightly drawn exotic animals and mythological creatures
give a Psalter (circa 1330) an aura of fantastic whimsy, which makes
the book's sacred songs of praise playful and otherworldly. And in a
charming French miniature, which is the example most reminiscent of a
modern comic book, the gesticulating narrator of a romance by
Boccaccio describes the action in a battle scene going on behind him.</TE>

<TE>   Surface and Color in Abstract Group Show</TE>
<TE>   Surface and color are the dual focus in a group show of new
abstract paintings by 11 artists at Angles Gallery. "Prima Facie," as
the show is titled, offers these structural elements as visual
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   A grid is the signature motif of rational order for Modernist
abstraction, and it turns up in very different works by Simone Adels,
Steven Charles, Alexis Harding and Susanna Maing. Here, though, the
grid appears variously weather-beaten, abraded, shredded, twisted or
otherwise mauled. Purist it's not.</TE>
<TE>   Imagery does crop up on occasion, but mostly in an allusive way.
Crimson hourglass shapes on a jet-black ground by Linda Stark might
be close-ups of black widow spiders. Landscape seems submerged
beneath Graeme Todd's smoggy surface, where wispy lines and winsome
spots of confetti-like paint cavort. A peeping Tom's-eye view of a
suburban patio comes in and out of sight from the vertical black
striations in Sarah Beddington's rather gimmicky work.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Moisan and Kathleen Kucka split the difference between
allusive imagery and the grid in two variations on white paintings.
Moisan's fuzzy picture recalls a crumpled length of fabric, patterned
with tiny clouds or profile heads. Kucka lines up maze-like patterns
that recall cross sections of bone or cranial matter.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Besemer and Robert Greene offer the most complex works, both
using stripe motifs. Besemer's monumental skin of acrylic color,
nearly 10 feet tall, hangs from the wall and lies in folds on the
floor, somewhat like a Robert Morris felt sculpture; their
physicality and weight give them shape. Besemer's stripe painting is
all paint, however, without any structural support like canvas or
board. Color is offered as a startlingly tangible material.</TE>
<TE>   Greene paints on thin, square panels of aluminum, which makes the
painting almost flush with the wall. Less theatrical and more
obsessive than Besemer, the vertical strokes of oil color are broken
up into narrow horizontal bands. (He appears to paint over strips of
masking tape.) The result is a strange visual weave. Greene's
paintings are like sensuous microchips. The warp and weft of color
together claims an ancestry in woven canvas, but here it is
transformed into a subtle but opulent high-tech skin.</TE>

<TE>   Combining Art, Music and Video</TE>
<TE>   "Proposal for 'The Side of the Mountain' " is a kind of
video-sketch for an opera. In the main room at the Santa Monica
Museum of Art, artist Simon Leung and composer Michael Webster have
built a small room where the four-channel video can be watched from
bleacher seats suggestive of an abstract hillside.</TE>
<TE>   One suspended monitor looks east toward the downtown L.A. skyline
at twilight. Another looks west toward the familiar profile of
Griffith Observatory. Through the course of the opera, night falls.</TE>
<TE>   The third (and largest) monitor locates the main action between
the two, inside the park, where an anonymous sexual encounter between
a young man (tenor Rodell Aure Rosel) and a middle-aged man (baritone
Paul Cummings) unfolds in a tentative, awkward dance. On a fourth
monitor tucked over in the corner, a third man (countertenor Jason
Snyder) searches in the park for his lost dog, fearful that coyotes
might have gotten him.</TE>
<TE>   The tension between natural freedoms and cultural boundaries is
structurally described by the libretto--in the setting of an urban
park, in the sexual identity of the central characters, even in the
pairing of tamed and wild canines--and it's a familiar anxiety not
without dramatic possibilities. But that tension is not embodied in
the mostly stilted, sometimes haphazard visual imagery, nor in the
ponderous music and its awkward lyrics. The video installation
explains what the situation is, but we're left without much stake in
the experience.</TE>

<LD>   Leno Overcomes the Springsteen Factor</LD>
<LD>   Bruce Springsteen's heavily promoted two-night stint on CBS' "Late
Show With David Letterman" last week may have helped the singer's new
album top the charts, but it didn't shake up the late-night ratings.</LD>
<TE>   "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" maintained its advantage by
averaging 5.5 million viewers a night for the week, according to
Nielsen estimates released Thursday. That was the NBC show's largest
audience since May and its widest margin of victory over Letterman
(at 3.8 million) in three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's "Nightline," which also featured an hour with Springsteen,
averaged 3.7 million viewers for the week.</TE>

<TE>   'Six Feet Under' Is a Copycat, Suit Claims</TE>
<TE>   A writer has filed suit against Time Warner Entertainment,
claiming that "The Funk Parlor," a script she wrote in 1997, formed
the basis for HBO's Emmy-nominated series "Six Feet Under."</TE>
<TE>   Her project, about a family-run funeral home, was registered with
the Writers Guild of America in 1998 and is being made into an
independent feature film by fellow plaintiff Funky Films, Variety
reports.</TE>
<TE>   In the papers, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles, Gwen O'Donnell claimed that Chris Albrecht, then head of
original programming at the network and now HBO's CEO, had access to
her screenplay in the summer of 1999. Shortly thereafter, HBO
approached writer Alan Ball about creating "Six Feet Under."</TE>
<TE>   Alleging violation of federal copyright laws, the complaint seeks
damages of more than $20 million for Funky Films and $10 million for
O'Donnell.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't seen the lawsuit but 'Six Feet Under' springs from the
imagination of Alan Ball," an HBO spokesman said Thursday. "Anyone
who suggests otherwise doesn't know what they are talking about."</TE>

<TE>   Greece Faults British Museum Security</TE>
<TE>   The Greek government, miffed about the theft of a valuable archaic
marble head from the British Museum last week, has demanded an
apology.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Neil MacGregor, new director of the museum, Greek
Culture Minister Evangelos Venizelos asked that his country be kept
apprised of the progress of the investigation into the theft of the
2,500-year-old sculpture worth at least $40,000 that disappeared from
a museum gallery on MacGregor's first day in office.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly upsetting, Greek authorities say, is the fact
that--because of budget constraints at the financially strapped
museum--no full-time guard had been on duty in the gallery.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand that safeguarding the antiquities is never easy,"
said a Greek government official. "But one would have thought that
when an institution like the British Museum is host to so many
foreign treasures, it would be extra vigilant.... No artwork has ever
been stolen from the National Archaeological Museum in Athens."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of security is particularly touchy in light of the
dispute over Greece's Elgin Marbles on display at the British Museum.
The British have contended that no Greek museum is adequate to house
them.</TE>

<TE>   Police Find Rubens, Stolen in '86 Heist</TE>
<TE>   A Rubens masterpiece, stolen from an Irish collection in a heist
16 years ago, has been recovered in Dublin, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The 1615 painting, "Head of a Man," was one of 18 stolen from
Dublin's Russborough House in a daring 1986 raid that made
international headlines. The culprits: a gang led by the notorious
criminal Martin Cahill ("The General"), who was shot to death in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   The loot, containing works by Goya and Vermeer, was so well-known
that the thieves had a hard time unloading it. Several paintings were
found near the mansion the day after the robbery, and others later
turned up in Istanbul and Belgium. Now that "Head of a Man" has been
found, only a pair of Venetian scenes are still missing.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators feared Cahill had taken the location of the lost
Rubens to his grave. But, acting on a tip, detectives found it in
excellent condition in northern Dublin. They returned the painting to
a foundation started by Russborough House's owner, and it will go on
display at the Irish National Gallery.</TE>

<DH>The old guard and the young punk go head to head this
weekend, pointing up the changes in the film business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This weekend two action stars from different generations will go head
to head with new films that say as much about the current state of
moviegoing as they do about the stars themselves.</LD>
<LD>   The matchup of septuagenarian screen legend Clint Eastwood in
"Blood Work" and thirtysomething New Wave heartthrob Vin Diesel in
"XXX" brings to mind how much Hollywood has changed since the days of
Eastwood's '70s iconic hero Dirty Harry and how the definition of an
action hero has evolved.</LD>
<LD>   At this point in his career, Eastwood's appeal is mainly to an
older audience--the type of crowd that doesn't flock to the megaplex
for a film's opening, which means "Blood Work" is likely to have a
modest ($10-million) opening.</LD>
<TE>   The pumped-up Diesel and "XXX" are aimed straight at the teen and
young adult crowd, the heaviest moviegoers; the film is forecast to
have an opening weekend of $50 million (though a number of summer
blockbusters have done much bigger business than had been forecast by
their studios, such as Disney's "Signs" and New Line's "Austin Powers
in Goldmember").</TE>
<TE>   Eastwood's definitive street cop drama "Dirty Harry" came out on
Dec. 22, 1971. That movie, which ended up taking in $35 million at
the box office, firmly established Eastwood as an action hero; his
reputation had been building from years of "spaghetti westerns" and
other roles. It was "a "huge, huge hit," at the time, said Dan Marks,
head of EDI Nielsen, a box-office tracking firm. Those were the days
when movie tickets cost about $1.50 and no such thing as a megaplex
existed.</TE>
<TE>   Eastwood's Harry Callahan, a smart-talking, criminal-hating cop,
uttered classic lines such as, "Being as this is a .44 Magnum, the
most powerful handgun in the world, [that] would blow your head clean
off, you've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well,
do ya punk?"</TE>
<TE>   Eastwood plays a cop again in Warner Bros.' "Blood Work." Based on
the Michael Connelly detective novel of the same name, the new film
is a straightforward murder mystery sprinkled with romance and jazzy
tunes in the background aimed primarily at the 45-and-older crowd.
Like the 1998 film "Space Cowboys," which dealt squarely with the
issue of getting old, Eastwood's character in "Blood Work" is not
afraid to show his age--he even suffers a heart attack while chasing
a murder suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "Dirty Harry" was so well received that its box-office prowess
spawned sequels, said Marks. There have been five Dirty Harry movies
over the years; "The Enforcer" (1976) brought in $46.2 million and
"Sudden Impact" (1983) earned $67.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   But more money is on the line in today's Hollywood, where opening
at No. 1 for certain movies is crucial--something that Eastwood
griped about in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Who cares who is No. 1?" he told the trade publication the
Hollywood Reporter. "Every horror film is practically No. 1 on its
first weekend. But you have got to play it for the long haul."</TE>
<TE>   "XXX," from Sony's Revolution Studios, meanwhile, is all
adrenaline, in-your-face action with a heavy-metal soundtrack for the
consumption of people under 30. Diesel's Xander Cage is a nihilistic,
tattooed con out for himself. His prowess is such that he
out-snowboards an avalanche. Xander Cage would likely have been one
of the bad guys in the days of Dirty Harry.</TE>
<TE>   Diesel's and Eastwood's films have sharply contrasting cinematic
styles as well. "XXX" is shot much like a music video, filled with
short bursts of action and cartoon-style violence. "Blood Work" is
more leisurely paced, the kind of old-fashioned character-driven
thriller that Hollywood doesn't make much anymore.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure of having a big box-office return is heavy on "XXX."
That expectation has been fueled partly by a high-profile, aggressive
marketing campaign for the film and by the success of Diesel's last
film, "The Fast and the Furious," which ended up grossing more than
$140 million domestically. Basically unknown a little more than a
year ago, the multicultural Diesel has become an engine who can drive
movie franchises, the lifeblood of studios these days.</TE>
<TE>   Now the studio is trying to rein in expectations it helped create.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the true things about what this [industry] is about,"
said Tom Sherak, a partner at Revolution. "You can't stop people from
saying it's going to make trillions of dollars.... The only way you
can control the spin is if you control yourself. You can't put unfair
expectations on movies."</TE>
<TE>   "XXX" cost about $85 million to make and about $40 million to
market, and must compete with M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs," which
opened to a surprising $60 million last weekend. New Line's "Austin
Powers in Goldmember," released three weeks ago, raked in more than
$71 million in its first weekend. (Like "Austin Powers," "XXX" is an
update of sorts of the James Bond spy genre).</TE>
<TE>   "What has changed is the perception of success," rued veteran
publicist Stan Rosenfield. "God forbid you should come in second.
There is so much money involved that the pressure on everyone to
perform is far greater that it was then. It is no longer acceptable
for your company to just make a profit. There are a lot of movies out
there that have made the studio an enormous amount of money and they
are looked at as failures."</TE>
<TE>   In an industry where franchises and sequels dominate the summer
marketplace, Revolution Studios executives had signed Diesel and
director Rob Cohen up for a sequel even before filming began on

<TE>   Competing studios seem to up the ante on one another's films.
Hoping to raise expectations, studios will forecast intentionally
high numbers on one another's movies. When it comes to their own
films however, they low-ball it.</TE>
<TE>   The studios propagate the obsession with being first, often
selling their movies in advertisements as "The No. 1 Film in
America." They understand that in America, everyone loves a winner.</TE>

<HD>The Modern Orchestra Concertmaster: First Among Equals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM PAGE</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The choice of a first violinist is the most important appointment
that any orchestra's music director can make, for the position
requires not only superb playing ability and broad musicianship, but
also grace under pressure, the optimism of a cheerleader and the
finesse of an ambassador.</LD>
<LD>   In the United States, the artist who assumes these duties is known
as the concertmaster. Europeans state it more directly. The first
violinist is called, simply, the leader.</LD>
<LD>   The concertmaster's job comes laden with both glory and gold. A
concertmaster generally makes at least twice union scale (more than
any other player, and up to $300,000 in some cities) and, in musical
circles, he or she will be deferred to as first among equals--as the
proverbial "jewel in the crown" of the modern orchestra.</LD>
<TE>   But along with this remuneration and respect come equally vast
responsibilities. Indeed, it may be truly said that the concertmaster
sets the tone--in more ways than one--for an orchestra. He or she
provides continuity when the music director is away (and most
maestros are in town for only three or four months a year). The very
sound that the concertmaster makes--rich, plaintive, lyrical or
edgy--is often representative of the orchestra at large (the New York
Philharmonic has generally favored a lean, intense sound from the
first violin, for example, while Philadelphia has always opted for a
lush opulence). And, over time, a concertmaster can come to have a
profound effect on the orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   "The concertmaster has to establish with the music director a
consistent method of bowing, phrasing and overall sound, which in
turn is conveyed to the string section, who make up the majority of
the players in an orchestra," said Leonard Slatkin, music director of
the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The principal wind players deal primarily with the three or four
members of their section, whereas the concertmaster has not only the
violins but the whole string choir to contend with," Slatkin
continued. "The strings are the basis of almost the entire orchestral
canon, and though there are pieces--Ravel's 'Bolero,' for
example--where the winds and percussion seem to dominate, it is still
the strings that have the lion's share of the workload."</TE>
<TE>   And so playing violin solos in an immaculate, spirited and soulful
manner can only be a beginning. Much--perhaps most--of the
preparation is done before the orchestra ever takes the stage. As
Samuel Magad, a former concertmaster of the Chicago Symphony, once
put it, "You study and decide according to the dynamics or according
to the music, the interest, whatever it is--you decide what bowings
might be used."</TE>
<TE>   What this means is that the concertmaster will go through any
scores the orchestra decides to take on and mark them up, indicating
not only whether the bows should be going up or down on a certain
passage but many subtleties as well. The concertmaster's markings
will then be copied into the scores of other players. "Each bowing
has its own inherent qualities," Magad said. "A short bow. A long
bow. A bounced bow. A legato-type bow. One drawn nicely, one hit
hard. This is what brings variation and interest to the music, as we
are trying to bring out the composer's wishes."</TE>
<TE>   David Halen, concertmaster of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra
since 1995, acknowledges that a precise job description is difficult.
"What does a concertmaster do? You'll get a very different answer
from everybody you ask. Speaking personally, I see it as my
responsibility to represent the orchestra--the conductor, the
musicians and the management--in the community. And then, within the
organization, I mediate between the board of directors and the
management and the players. It is my duty to cross boundaries, to
travel in all circles."</TE>
<TE>   It seems only fitting that a number of distinguished conductors
have graduated from the rank of concertmaster--most notably the
Philadelphia Orchestra's Eugene Ormandy and the Boston Symphony's
Charles Munch--for the role of the modern maestro grew out of the
idea of a performing leader. Until the early 19th century, all
orchestras were led by a musician in the ensemble, whether from the
keyboard or the violin.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be prepared to lead the orchestra at any time, at
least for a little while," Halen said. "If a visiting conductor is
vague in a place where the orchestra needs clarity, I can help
compensate for that through my gestures--shoulder movements and
exaggerated bowing, for example. Almost all of the players in the
orchestra can see me."</TE>
<TE>   Yet this must be done as subtly as possible, for fear of
embarrassing the hapless soul on the podium. "I wouldn't go so far as
to say I've ever actually rescued a conductor," said the National
Symphony Orchestra's new concertmaster, Nurit Bar-Josef. "But there
are times when you do feel that the performance is riding on your
shoulders a bit, that everybody is looking at you and latching
on--like, Help! ...</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "This is one reason why the concertmaster must know the music
cold," she said. "I have to know the first violin part inside out, of
course, but I also have to know what the clarinet is going to play in
a certain measure, when the brass will come in, and so on."</TE>
<TE>   The concertmaster knows that anything can happen. Rita Shapiro,
the newly appointed executive director of the National Symphony
Orchestra, recalls one occasion in Cleveland, when the orchestra's
concertmaster, William Preucil, stood up in the middle of a
performance and started whacking music director Christoph von
Dohnanyi's back with the tip of his bow. "There was a bee or a wasp
on his back, and Bill didn't want him to get stung," Shapiro said.
"It absolutely broke up the audience--and you should have seen the
look on Dohnanyi's face!"</TE>

<HD>Driven, in the Extreme</HD>
<DH>The Vin Diesel vehicle 'XXX,' built of action- sport
stunts, has adrenaline to spare. But, c'mon. Where is its sense of
fun?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a star named Vin Diesel and a title like "XXX," the last thing
you'd think this James-Bond-for-the-extreme-sports-gener- ation
enterprise would do is take itself too seriously, but that seems to
be what's happened. Impressions created by advertising
notwithstanding, fun is something this film surprisingly lacks.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike outright Bond spoofs like the Austin Powers movies or sharp
satires of the Bond sensibility like last year's "The Tailor of
Panama," "XXX" attempts to exactly duplicate a Bond movie, albeit
with a character who's so not the typical secret agent that when he
confides his occupation to an attractive woman, she laughs in his
face.</LD>
<LD>   The character is Xander Cage (Diesel), a big lug in a
sheepskin-lined coat who looks like a combination of a bulked-up Yul
Brynner and the puzzled comic-book character Henry. With a voice
deeper than a subway tunnel, Xander has his triple-X nickname
tattooed on the back of his neck, so he just has to look in a mirror
in case he forgets it.</LD>
<TE>   Xander is introduced as an extreme sports adept and a guerrilla
fighter for the rights of video games, hardly an endangered species
the last time anyone looked. He's also something of a baby nihilist
who's never too busy to articulate (if that's the right word) his
philosophy. "I like anything fast enough to do something stupid," he
says in a words-to-live-by kind of way. Xander also feels, quite
sensibly, "If you're gonna send someone to save the world, make sure
they like it the way it is."</TE>
<TE>   Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson), a veteran operative for the
National Security Agency with a mutilated face to prove it, thinks
Xander might be his kind of guy. Tired of using trained agents the
bad guys can smell a mile away, he wants the NSA to consider "the
best and the brightest of the bottom of the barrel. Instead of
dropping a mouse in the snake pit, let's send our own snake to crawl
in."</TE>
<TE>   After an elaborate testing process that takes up a good chunk of
screen time, Xander gets the call. He doesn't like Gibbons, whom he
cleverly calls "Scarface." But with a long stretch in Leavenworth as
his only other option, he agrees to fight the good fight.</TE>
<TE>   That means going to Prague and infiltrating a group called Anarchy
99 that may have biochemical mayhem on its mind. It's headed by the
dread Yorgi (Marton Csokas, Celeborn in "The Lord of the Rings"),
with comely Morticia look-alike Yelena (Asia Argento, daughter of
Italian horror maestro Dario Argento) second in command.</TE>
<TE>   All this is fairly standard and, if you're familiar with the Bond
films, so is most of "XXX." As written by Rich Wilkes and directed by
Rob Cohen (responsible for Diesel's breakthrough "The Fast and the
Furious"), "XXX" even has, in the earnest Toby Lee Shavers (Michael
Roof), an updated version of Bond's venerable gadgeteer Q.</TE>
<TE>   Expect to find as well the usual undulating women in skimpy
costumes, the requisite firefights, explosions and car crashes and a
whole lot of elaborate stunts. So many, in fact, that the credits
list two Diesel stunt doubles, three Diesel bike doubles and four
Diesel snowboarding doubles. (Perhaps they all got "I Was a Diesel
Double" T-shirts, but maybe not.) One stunt was so dicey that a
stuntman died during filming, but the occasional use of
computer-generated images to sweeten the presentation has taken some
of the fun out of how they play on screen.</TE>
<TE>   "XXX" was so determined to have a Doomsday plot and villainous bad
guys just like the big boys that no one thought to include the kind
of zest and good-humored energy that made the equally commercial
"Scorpion King" so appealing. "XXX" also lacks the Rock, admittedly a
limited actor but someone with enough charisma and screen presence to
come off like Russell Crowe compared with the phlegmatic Diesel. More
busy than exciting, more frantic than involving, more chaotic than
entertaining, "XXX" is primed to be the latest success story in
Hollywood's "Sensation of the Week" sweepstakes, but that doesn't
make it a happy experience.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for violence, nonstop action sequences,
sensuality, drug content and language. Times guidelines: The action
is of a pounding, relentless nature.</TE>

<HD>Building Heals Landmark Hospital's Growing Pains</HD>
<DH>Architecture: Barcelona's Santa Creu i Sant Pau is a
medical institution and a monument to fine design. A low-profile
addition attempts to preserve both.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BROWN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>It's hard living inside a work of art, especially when living also
means dying, giving birth, having surgery, being treated for
life-threatening infections and having your bone marrow replaced.</LD>
<LD>   For a century, the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau has been
one of this city's architectural showpieces and one of its grittiest
institutions.</LD>
<LD>   It's been a relic worthy of meticulous preservation and a machine
racing to keep up with the present. The tension, however, has proved
too much.</LD>
<TE>   One hundred years after its construction, the place of beauty and
the house of healing are getting an amicable divorce.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital was begun in 1902 during the high tide of art nouveau
that washed over Barcelona with greater force and effect than in any
other part of Europe. By the time it was finished in 1912, Santa Creu
i Sant Pau was perhaps the most unusual infirmary in the world: more
than two dozen art-encrusted buildings arrayed over an idealized
therapeutic landscape.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1992 book, "Barcelona," historian and art critic Robert
Hughes calls the hospital one of the city's "masterpieces of
modernisme," which is the Catalan word for the art nouveau movement
in design, architecture, craft, music, theater, sculpture, painting
and poetry.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital, whose name translates from Catalan as "Holy Cross
and Saint Paul," was designed by architect Lluis Domenech i Montaner.
Although Domenech contemporary Antoni Gaudi is Barcelona's more
famous architect of modernisme, the hospital epitomizes everything
the movement tried to do.</TE>
<TE>   With their spectacular arches, vaults and voids, the buildings
speak the structural vocabulary of the Middle Ages. But with their
thousands of crafted flowers, leaves, vines, birds, amphibians and
other, often whimsical embellishments, they showcase art nouveau's
love of nature, color and curvilinear form. Most of all, the final
product depends on craftsmanship of astonishing virtuosity: ceramics,
mosaic, sculpture, tile work, stained glass, bricklaying,
stonecutting and the forging of iron.</TE>
<TE>   "Access to such a craft base is now irrevocably lost to the
architect," Hughes writes. "This access is what makes Catalan
modernisme look so rich and strange, for mere fantasy is never
enough: Fantasy has to be made concrete."</TE>
<TE>   UNESCO, the United Nations' educational and cultural agency, named
the hospital a World Heritage Site in 1997, urging its continued
preservation. (There are 730 cultural and natural places with such
designation.)</TE>
<TE>   The hospital's antecedent (the "Santa Creu" of its name) was
founded in Barcelona's Gothic Quarter in 1401. The original
structure, not surprisingly, had become inadequate half a millennium
later. In 1896, a Catalan banker and shipping magnate living in
Paris, Pau Gil, died and left much of his fortune to found a new
hospital for Barcelona, provided its name honored his namesake, St.
Paul.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Creu i Sant Pau, the product of merger and bequest, is run
by a board made up of representatives of the Barcelona and Catalonia
governments and the Catholic Church. It is part of Spain's national
health system network, serving about 400,000 people in the
surrounding neighborhoods, and is one of the four teaching hospitals
of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Over the years, it has
notched a number of Iberian firsts, including the peninsula's first
bone marrow transplant (1976) and first heart transplant (1984).</TE>
<TE>   It also has retrofitted and retro-retrofitted its enormous
physical plant to accommodate a century of change in medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "To create a functional hospital, it is much more difficult with
this architecture," said Joaquin Lopez-Contreras, a specialist in
infectious diseases, on a recent walking tour of the facility.</TE>
<TE>   Around him, the broad avenues of the therapeutic city were
bustling with patients, visitors, clinicians and other hospital
workers moving among the various pavilions. An occasional ambulance
ferried patients from one building to another, often a distance of
only a few hundred yards.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital has operating rooms in five buildings: the emergency
room and the trauma, pediatrics, cardiology and main surgery
pavilions. Outpatient clinics are maintained at about 20 sites. In
addition to the medical facilities, there are dozens of
air-conditioning plants to run and maintain. Computerizing the campus
has been a nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes 10 people just to deliver medical records from one place
to another," Lopez-Contreras said, giving just one example of how
labor-intensive things are at Sant Pau. "If you need three, we have
10. If you have 10, we need 20."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, after much thought, the hospital board acknowledged
the venerable institution's collision with modernity. It broke ground
for a new facility, which is going up on part of the 360-acre site
not occupied by Domenech's buildings. It will be finished by 2006,
finally putting under one roof the care that now takes place under
many.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only the student of art history, but all people can discover
a new thing every day," said Josep Sarrio, one of the hospital
administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Domenech was particularly fond of ceramic tile. He used it in
nearly hot pink to clad the vaults in the open-air portico of the
administration building, the entry point onto the grounds. In the
patient pavilions, the colors are only a little less daring.</TE>
<TE>   In what's now the emergency room, oceanic shades of blue and green
arch overhead. The hematology pavilion has a placid milky green. In
the obstetrical pavilion, yellow predominates. These are not the
control-the-inmates shades common to American hospitals (and schools
and prisons). They energize and soothe--up to a point.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad the baby was born here, because the hospital is so
beautiful," said Yolanda Alquezar, a 31-year-old first-time mother,
as she lay next to 3-day-old Gonzalo. She said she noticed the
yellow-tiled dome overhead during delivery.</TE>
<TE>   Did the view make the process less painful?</TE>
<TE>   "No, the epidural did."</TE>
<TE>   A lot will change with the new hospital, but Domenech's buildings
won't. Not a single one will be torn down. They'll be used for
research, for education, for something.</TE>
<TE>   This is no surprise, as Santa Creu i Sant Pau believes in
preserving the past in a way few institutions can match. Its
voluminous archives contain ledgers from the 1400s that record the
names of orphans brought to the hospital to live. Pressed between the
pages are swatches of cloth from dresses, religious medals and beaded
bracelets kept to identify individual children in case, years later,
someone came looking for them.</TE>
<TE>   The new hospital--costing $110 million and holding 610 beds--will
be a low-profile complex with four fingerlike wings extending from a
central structure.</TE>
<TE>   It bears no resemblance to the old buildings and pays the ultimate
tribute to Domenech's vision. When you walk through the master's
100-year-old entrance, you won't be able to see it.</TE>

<HD>They're Not Just Playing Around</HD>
<DH>Television: Bob the Builder has replaced Barney in the
hearts of toddlers, but it's OK, because they are business partners
now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>APRIL CASTRO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CARROLLTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>Bob the Builder has stolen Barney's spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   The popular English construction worker, armed with his signature
tool belt and hardhat, has hammered his way past the singing and
dancing purple dinosaur and into the hearts of children around the
world.</LD>
<LD>   But although Barney's popularity has plummeted since his heyday,
he's not giving up without a fight.</LD>
<TE>   "Bob the Builder's" creator, HIT Entertainment of London, acquired
the company that produces "Barney," Allen, Texas-based Lyrick
Studios, last year for $275 million. The deal gave HIT a marketing
and distribution network that it used to introduce Bob to U.S.
audiences.</TE>
<TE>   "HIT really needed a little bit of a push start in getting
entrenched in the North America market. Lyrick needed the same thing
across the Atlantic," said Denise Perkins-Landry, a Lyrick veteran
and now a spokeswoman for HIT.</TE>
<TE>   Bob, whose computer-animated television show debuted to American
audiences on the Nickelodeon network in January 2001--the month
before the Lyrick deal--has since garnered acclaim among the
preschool and elementary crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Bob has become a sought-after toy and a favorite of
trick-or-treating tykes. He even merited a float in the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day parade.</TE>
<TE>   The computer-animated series is set in a construction yard, where
Bob and gal pal Wendy meet each morning before going out on
assignment for neighborhood characters. In cahoots with talking
construction-yard equipment, Bob and friends spend 30 minutes
illustrating their thematic can-do agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Bob's theme song "Can We Fix It? Yes, We Can!" in 2001 became
Britain's hottest-selling song since Elton John's "Candle in the
Wind."</TE>
<TE>   Distributed in more than 130 countries, "Bob" has sold more than 2
million videos, books and magazines and has a licensing agreement
with Hasbro to market toys based on the show.</TE>
<TE>   The buzz has even surprised "Bob's" managers.</TE>
<TE>   "We had high hopes, but in the economy we're having right now, we
are very fortunate to have the success we've been having," said Holly
Stein, who heads HIT's marketing division.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Lyrick acquisition, video sales of HIT properties have
increased 33%, with Bob the Builder accounting for most of the
increase, Perkins-Landry said. The company is on target to earn $40
million this year on sales of $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   Though Barney's popularity has declined, he's still drawing a 6.6
rating among children ages 2 to 5, or 1,070,000 children, according
to PBS' season-to-date figures. That's down from a peak 13.2 rating,
or 2,080,000 children, in the 1996-97 season.</TE>
<TE>   The falling television ratings might be blamed partly on the fact
that Barney hadn't filmed new episodes or completed a toy-licensing
agreement in about five years.</TE>
<TE>   Now Barney is undergoing a make-over. HIT has been busy producing
new shows at the company's Carrollton Studios slated for fall release
on PBS, Barney's television home since the show first aired in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The familiar playground set has been replaced by a park scene
complete with $40,000 sycamore trees, a pond, gazebo and caboose. The
cast of children is new. And producers have updated Barney's act,
giving him a laptop computer.</TE>
<TE>   "Ratings have declined, but ratings are driven by adults, and this
is about the children," said Randy Dalton, executive producer of
"Barney &amp; Friends." "I fully expect that Barney will be back at No. 1
when we premiere the new series."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the release of a new video and live-action tour, Barney
also has sealed a licensing agreement with toy maker Fisher-Price,
with products to be in stores as the new episodes debut.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a big Barney presence in front of the consumer for
the first time in a long time," Perkins-Landry said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the new set, cast and toys, Barney will find the
television market has changed greatly since his start a decade ago.
The number of children's television productions has exploded,
splitting the audience into more pieces.</TE>
<TE>   And Barney still has his detractors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so nauseatingly sweet; it turned me off right at the
beginning," said Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's
Television, which lobbied Congress for a 1990 law requiring local
stations to serve children's educational needs.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something too white-bread, too do-goody about it,"
Charren said. "The children are too happy. They don't look real. They
look animated even though they're not."</TE>
<TE>   Dalton, Barney's executive producer, says Charren is missing the
point.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not full of jokes and puns, it's just entertaining, and it's
not for adults," he said. "If adults loved it, we would be missing
our target audience."</TE>

<HD>It's Been His Look, No Matter Who's Directing</HD>
<DH>Movies: 'Blood Work' is production designer Henry
Bumstead's latest collaboration with Clint Eastwood, whom he reveres
above Hitchcock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an industry in which people routinely scramble for work, movie
production designer Henry Bumstead has never had to worry about his
next paycheck. In fact, during his 63-year career, Bumstead has never
been laid off. "I have never been fired," he says matter-of-factly.
"I attribute it all to the fact that I have worked with good scripts
and good directors and good actors and actresses. I have been lucky."</LD>
<LD>   "Bummy," as he is known in Hollywood, is still going strong at 87,
thanks in no small part to his ongoing relationship with
actor-director-producer Clint Eastwood. Bumstead first met Eastwood
on the 1972 western "Joe Kidd," directed by John Sturges. It was the
beginning of a beautiful friendship and prolific working
relationship.</LD>
<LD>   They have collaborated on "High Plains Drifter" (1972);
"Unforgiven" (1992), for which he received an Oscar nomination; "A
Perfect World" (1993); "The Stars Fell on Henrietta" (1995), which
Eastwood produced but didn't direct; "Absolute Power" (1997);
"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" (1997); "True Crime"
(1999); "Space Cowboys" (2000); and Eastwood's latest film, "Blood
Work," which opens today.</LD>
<TE>   Eastwood says there was a near 20-year span between "High Plains
Drifter" and "Unforgiven" because Bumstead was tied up working with
directors Alfred Hitchcock and George Roy Hill on various projects.
"Finally, when those guys all retired, I got him back," Eastwood
says. "I love to see a guy his age having so much fun working."</TE>
<TE>   Bumstead returns the compliment--in his own no-frills way.</TE>
<TE>   "I have worked with Hitchcock, George Roy Hill, [Martin] Scorsese
and Billy Wilder, but Clint has taken the bull out of making films,"
says Bumstead, relaxing recently in the living room of his
comfortable home in San Marino. "He could keep doing Dirty Harry and
westerns and just go right along, but he tries everything."</TE>
<TE>   "I tell him how I kind of see things," Eastwood explains. "But I
tell him go ahead and he will show me things along the way. In fact,
he'll want to show me more things than I want to see. But when you
have good people like that, you can trust them to deliver.
'Unforgiven' was fun because he got to build a town from scratch. We
scouted it together from a helicopter and found a place in Alberta
[Canada] that we liked and he just built it."</TE>
<TE>   Considering his stature in the business, Bumstead is remarkably
down-to-earth and unpretentious. A tall bear of a man, he has been
slowed down a bit by having both knees replaced with metal implants,
but he doesn't call attention to it. According to Eastwood, he is
easily embarrassed when any fuss is made about him on the set. "When
I say things like, 'Bumstead, will you just tell me where you want
the camera and I'll just go ahead and do it?' He'll go, 'Aw, all
right.' He gets all bashful and red."</TE>
<TE>   Bumstead has a cameo of sorts in "Blood Work" that will no doubt
make him cringe. It's in the form of a painting of Bumstead that
adorns the wall of a police station. "That wasn't his idea," Eastwood
says. "The art department did it as a joke but I went ahead and used
it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pleased With Ship Set</TE>
<TE>   In "Blood Work," based on the thriller by former Los Angeles Times
reporter Michael Connelly, Eastwood plays an FBI agent forced into
retirement after suffering a heart attack while pursuing a serial
killer. Two months after he gets a heart transplant, though, he's
back on the trail.</TE>
<TE>   "Blood Work" was shot in and around Los Angeles and Long Beach.
Bumstead is especially proud of the elaborate interior he built for
an old ship at Long Beach Harbor that is the setting for the movie's
action-packed finale.</TE>
<TE>   "We built this fantastic interior set of the boat with the engine
room flooded with water," he says enthusiastically. "That was a big
set and I got to do some wonderful aging. I love aging. I am a
stickler for aging--the rust and the dirt. It was just a beautiful
set."</TE>
<TE>   Bumstead's work isn't flashy and never intrudes on a story. But
his designs are such an integral part of a film, they become
characters in and of themselves. For example, would "Unforgiven" have
been as effective without Bumstead's spare but evocative designs of
Eastwood's desolate, claustrophobic house or the rough-and-tumble
frontier town?</TE>
<TE>   Nominated for four Academy Awards, Bumstead has won Oscars for his
haunting depiction of 1930s rural Alabama in "To Kill a Mockingbird"
(1962) and for bringing to vibrant life the colorful underbelly of
Depression-era Chicago in "The Sting" (1973).</TE>
<TE>   Jack De Govia, president of the Art Directors Guild--the terms art
director and production designer are essentially interchangeable and
often the two will work together on a project--praises the "marvelous
ease" of Bumstead's designs.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how splendid and how simple 'Unforgiven' was. It
was not flashy. It was very strong and very real. There wasn't a
thing there that didn't serve the story. Even in richer films like
'The Sting,' there was something that was soaked in about it. It has
real depth. He doesn't put the curlicues on it. He doesn't need to
make a display. He does what is needful, but he does it completely.
There is a wonderful solidity to his images."</TE>
<TE>   In a youth-obsessed industry, De Govia praises Eastwood for using
Bumstead in his films. "Congratulations to Eastwood for seeing what
we know--there is absolutely no reason why a talent as broad and
capable as his should be wasted at his age."</TE>
<TE>   "He has a quick mind," Eastwood says. "When you've got someone who
is classic like that, why let them go to waste?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Best Decision of My Life'</TE>
<TE>   Born in Ontario, Bumstead was a high school football player and
valedictorian who had a choice of a number of colleges. "I made the
best decision of my life. I chose USC because they had an
architecture and fine arts course there, and that is what I really
wanted to do--draw."</TE>
<TE>   He began interning at the RKO art department during the summer
between his sophomore and junior year. He also landed summer work at
Universal with an interior decorator who worked with the studios. The
decorator introduced him to art director Hans Dreier ("Sunset
Boulevard"), who was one of the top designers at Paramount.</TE>
<TE>   "He was absolutely fantastic," Bumstead says of Dreier. "He hired
me and, boy, I learned so much from him. And then his assistant,
Roland Anderson, was Cecil B. DeMille's art director, and he took me
under his wing and I worked for him seven years before I became an
art director. Nowadays, people start out as an art director after two
or three months, but the thing is, after seven years, I knew my job
very well. My first picture was 'Saigon' [1948] with Alan Ladd. He
was a big star, and from there I was off."</TE>
<TE>   At Paramount, Bumstead worked almost exclusively for producer Hal
Wallis, designing the Jerry Lewis-Dean Martin comedies "My Friend
Irma" (1949), "Sailor Beware" (1952) and "Jumping Jacks" (1953) as
well as such acclaimed dramas as "Come Back Little Sheba" (1952),
"The Bridges at Toko-Ri" (1954) and "Run for Cover" (1955), directed
by Nicholas Ray.</TE>
<TE>   Bumstead got his next big break while working on the forgettable
1956 costume drama "The Vagabond King," directed by Michael Curtiz.</TE>
<TE>   "The cameraman on the picture was Bob Burks, who was Hitch's
cameraman," he says. "Hitch said to Bob Burks, 'Do you know any young
art directors?' " And it just so happened he did. "I went up to see
Hitch and he hired me for 'The Man Who Knew Too Much.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bumstead worked with Hitchcock on three more films: "Vertigo"
(1958), for which he received an Oscar nomination; "Topaz" (1969);
and the director's last movie, "Family Plot" (1976).</TE>
<TE>   "I had a great relationship with Hitch," says Bumstead. "Hitch
liked the comfort of the stages and that is why he liked the
rear-projection process. I think a young art director today who
looked at 'Vertigo' would ask me what did I do. Because nowadays they
would shoot all of those actual locations. But everything was a set."</TE>
<TE>   Bumstead recalls picking an actual location off the Universal lot
for "Family Plot."</TE>
<TE>   The script called for a night scene at a house that had an
attached garage. "I looked for two days for that location," he says.
"The set was all lit and there were 120 people standing around. It
was a cool night and Hitchcock's car pulled up--he always rode in the
front seat--and the window went down just so far and he said, 'What
are we doing here? How do you expect me to get a performance out of
my actors on a cold night like this?'</TE>
<TE>   " 'I think we should do it back in the studio.' And the limo
pulled off."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Too Late for Computers</TE>
<TE>   Bumstead isn't thrilled with the extensive use of computers to
create designs and special effects. "I don't have a computer," he
says. "I don't have e-mail. It is too late for me. The first time I
was really involved in that was on 'Space Cowboys.' I worked with ILM
[Industrial Light &amp; Magic] on that, so I was able to get through
that. I did the designing and then they did all the special effects.
Digitally, the things they can do now are unbelievable, but as far as
to my liking, they have gone overboard--but that's just an old man's
opinion."</TE>
<TE>   Bumstead, who's married and the father of four grown children, is
in pre-production on Eastwood's next picture, "Mystic River," a
mystery set in Boston. Filming is set to start at the end of
September. And Eastwood is planning on keeping Bumstead gainfully
employed as long as he wants to work. "I may retire before he does,"
72-year-old Eastwood says with a hearty laugh.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fertile feminist insight enlivens "Parallel Lives," ending this
weekend at the Edison Theatre in Long Beach. This loud *R* mouth
Theatre Company staging of Kathy Najimy and Mo Gaffney's 1989
Obie-winning "The Kathy and Mo Show" is potently entertaining,
textual cellulite notwithstanding.</LD>
<LD>   Originally a virtuoso duologue, the material here is divided among
eight splendid comediennes under Laura Marchant's efficient
direction. The kaleidoscopic sketch comedy trajectory is overseen by
two "Supreme Beings" (Lisa May and Andrea Poma, divinely campy)
perched atop Darla K. Davis' cotton-flocked unit set.</LD>
<LD>   The estrogenic proceedings feature leitmotifs ranging from the
vagaries of relationships to the codification of feminine hygiene
products. What passes for through-line originates with those angels,
their unity at the opening Genesis subtly devolving to altered
stances by the multiple-character finale.</LD>
<TE>   Favorites are tough to call, but Meredith Bronner and Hillary
Calvert's devastating Sapphic performance artists and Emily Duval and
Jessica Variz's graphically endowed mock Shakespeareans are
contenders. Geri Logan's deadpan drollery tickles throughout, and
breakout star Ellen Williams' breakneck mime of ablutions to Bizet's
Symphony in C is shriekingly funny, alone worth admission.</TE>
<TE>   The one glaring liability is overload of content, the ballast
creating repetitions of point, erratic tempos and unnecessary length.</TE>

<TE>   'Communicating Doors' Plays With Time Travel</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps only Einstein played around with time and space more than
Alan Ayckbourn has.</TE>
<TE>   In his more than 60 plays, the British playwright has made a habit
of mucking about with reality by, for instance, superimposing the
action in two households onto the same performing area ("How the
Other Half Loves").</TE>
<TE>   For "Communicating Doors," Ayckbourn mingled elements of science
fiction, murder mystery and sex farce to come up with a complex
time-travel tale. First produced in 1994, the comedy has been finding
its way into America's regional theaters and is being given its Los
Angeles premiere by the Odyssey Theatre Ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Although the premise seems like a lot of fun, the action is rarely
as funny as it could be, and the storytelling flags in the second
act. Still, a lively staging and engaging performances make the
Odyssey presentation worth the brain ache of trying to follow the
plot.</TE>
<TE>   Events unfold in a high-end London hotel suite that has been given
a look of timeless elegance by designer Andrew Deppen.</TE>
<TE>   The action begins in 2022 as a call girl, Poopay (Amy Chaffee),
arrives for an appointment with an elderly businessman, Reece (Alan
Brooks), arranged by his business partner, Julian (Michael Carr).
Before Poopay quite understands what is happening, sensitive
information has been entrusted to her, and she must flee for her
life. She rushes through a connecting door into what she thinks is
the next suite.</TE>
<TE>   But the door works like a time-travel device. When she emerges,
she is in the same room, in 2002. The suite is occupied by Reece's
second wife, Ruella (Lisa Pelikan), who is about to be killed.
Together, Poopay and Ruella try to save Reece's first wife, Jessica
(Rachael Lyerla), from the same fate in 1982, while outfoxing a
blustery but well-meaning security officer (Ron Bottitta).</TE>
<TE>   Director Barry Philips emphasizes the physical humor where he can,
coming up with some especially funny business involving a dead body.
But the greatest enjoyment comes from watching Chaffee's Poopay bloom
from empty-headed sex object to strong, selfless woman under the
guidance of Pelikan's sisterly, shrewd Ruella.</TE>

<TE>   Raunchy 'Veronica!' Zings TV Talk Shows</TE>
<TE>   For sheer parody, it's hard to outdo the sleaze-mongering antics
of daytime TV talk shows in their native habitats. Yet playwright
Tony Jerris' New York cult hit, "Tell Veronica!," managed to give the
broadcast burlesques a run for their money with a raucous send-up of
Oprah, Sally Jesse and Ricki rolled into one hot pink hot flash of a
show.</TE>
<TE>   Making its West Coast premiere at the Hudson Mainstage Theatre,
this newly revised version sports Charlene Tilton as the titular
hostess of humiliation who, abetted by Brad (Brian Kimmet), her
smarmy production assistant and audience fluffer, gleefully pours
salt on the psychic wounds of her witless guests as she gets them to
confess their tawdriest secrets.</TE>
<TE>   Not that this takes much coaxing, as the exhibitionistic ensemble
flings itself at a corny cornucopia of combatants from the shallow
end of the gene pool.</TE>
<TE>   The role of raunchy ringmaster Veronica affords a fine opportunity
for Tilton to extend her range beyond her "Dallas" days persona. Her
characterization is frighteningly convincing as she eggs her guests
on with lewd innuendos to new heights of embarrassment, only to drop
them when fresh meat beckons ("You've had your 15 minutes!" she
sneers).</TE>
<TE>   The first "segment" reunites a trailer-trash mother (Kathlyn
Miles, substituting for Lin Shaye) with the trio of daughters she had
abandoned in their infancy--nun-turned-stripper April (Tilton's
daughter Cherish Lee), gargantuan May (Shannon K. Dunn) and
mustachioed lesbian June (Shea Alexander)--with predictable
fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   The more inventive follow-up pits a gum-chomping,
crotch-scratching Jewish princess (hilarious Donna Cherry), formerly
"married to the mob" and now a police informant, against her
murderous ex-husband (Bruno Amato) and his acerbic mother (spot-on
Lynda Lenet). In between segments, Tilton fearlessly accosts audience
members with male-bashing "Guess that Goon" quizzes and hands out
tacky prizes.</TE>
<TE>   Playwright Jerris clearly doesn't lavish enormous amounts of
energy polishing the dialogue to sophisticated
luster--understandable, because the show's evolving script introduces
new characters and stories every three weeks. Instead, the show
relies on the cast's edgy, semi-improv energy to spray gags like
buckshot. More than enough of them hit their mark.</TE>

<TE>   In Millay's Poems, the Drama of a Life</TE>
<TE>   Edna St. Vincent Millay could wax poetic about most anything, from
the vegetables in her garden to the tortured emotions accompanying an
impossible romance. She saw the world with eyes wide open, and each
of her poems provided a little lesson in how her readers might do the
same.</TE>
<TE>   These lessons illuminate "A Lovely Light," the one-woman overview
of Millay's life that Marion Ross is performing at the Falcon
Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Ross--best known for her long run as Mrs. Cunningham on the sitcom
"Happy Days"--has been performing this piece for years, honing her
characterization of Millay (1892-1950; Pulitzer Prize, 1923) and
teasing out the nuances in the poetry. Eyes flashing with mischief,
Ross renders Millay as a woman of fierce intelligence, quick wit and
ever-playful spirit--a woman who, at just 19, could write a phrase
like: "And all at once the heavy night / Fell from my eyes and I
could see."</TE>
<TE>   Such complexity helps to compensate for the hands-off hagiography
of the play itself. Even after nearly two hours of poems, letters and
snippets of biographical information, it's hard to get a feel for the
real Millay--the outspokenly political, bravely feminist, openly
bisexual woman whose ideas seized the minds of her readers.</TE>
<TE>   As written by the late actress Dorothy Stickney, "A Lovely Light"
feels narrowly focused on how two loves seemed to shape Millay's
life: a complicated one with the already-married poet Arthur Davison
Ficke and a happier one with the importer Eugen Boissevain.</TE>
<TE>   But Millay's writing tells us much of what we need to know. Under
Norman Cohen's direction, Ross treats each poem as a mini-play,
churning with emotion and bursting with life.</TE>

Sundays, 7:30 p.m. Ends Aug. 25. $25. (818) 955-8101. Running time: 1

<HD>Signs of a Slump on 'Mohr Sports'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You needn't know the infield fly rule to realize that ESPN's
talk-variety show "Mohr Sports" is having a rough outing.</LD>
<LD>   It's a bad sign when the studio audience politely applauds rather
than laughs at Jay Mohr's monologue. It's a bad sign when the musical
act is Foreigner, the formerly hot-blooded jukebox heroes who've gone
as cold as ice. And it's a bad sign when ESPN has repeatedly moved
the show since its prime-time premiere in April.</LD>
<LD>   "Mohr Sports" now occupies the coveted 2 p.m. Tuesday slot. In
case you missed it, it repeats at 8:30 tonight on ESPN2. Or, if you
were like me, you could have set your VCR only to find that the
latest episode had been hacked down because coverage of the Fred
Meyer Golf Challenge was running late.</LD>
<TE>   In any event, you didn't miss much. After procuring a tape of the
full show, I found a few amusing moments, including an Anna Nicole
Smith skit and a "Baseball Divas" spoof. But most of comedian-actor
Mohr's sports-related jokes aren't any better than what you might
hear from some drunkard at the National or Dublin's: forced,
unoriginal and at times borderline offensive. Maybe a lot of French
people don't use soap and maybe a lot of figure-skating fans are gay,
but those topics don't make for fresh, caustic comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Mohr's main guest is the Chicago Bulls' Jalen Rose, and the host
proves as adept an interviewer as monologist when he asks about
Rose's days at Michigan: "Do you guys still hang out? More
importantly, were you the greatest college basketball team ever?"
Never mind that Mohr could have inquired about Rose's admission that
he had taken an undisclosed but apparently small amount of money from
a Michigan booster. The same booster pleaded guilty in May to a
federal conspiracy charge after being accused of having lent $600,000
to four other Wolverines.</TE>
<TE>   One can only wait to see what Mohr will ask next week's guests:
Wesley Snipes and Nelly.</TE>

<HD>Creating a Party Atmosphere for HBO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO AND LOUISE ROUG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Emmys are about six weeks away, and that puts party designer
Billy Butchkavitz just two clicks from full throttle. He's spinning a
fantasy for HBO's Emmy after-party at Spago: an Art Nouveau dream in
reds and golds, everything in homage to the turn-of-the-century
Spanish architect Antonio Gaudi. "We're doing this whole party gold,"
he says. It's the most photogenic color for a night that will be
dominated by photographs. "Right now, I'm in love with this whole
gold thing."</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the Beverly Hills restaurant was awash in pink. But,
alas, party-goers never made it to his rosy paradise because the
Emmys were postponed. All the more reason for Butchkavitz to wow his
fans this year with an elaborate affair modeled after Gaudi's
spectacularly tiled Park Guell in Barcelona, Spain, built in the
early 20th century. Butchkavitz started drawing up plans in April.
There are roses and fountains and shrubbery. The walls will be
covered in gold velvet. Tables will be decorated with sheer
embroidered fabrics that Butchkavitz bought during a spring trip to
India, and guests will sit on serpentine couches covered in gold
ultra-suede. Everything, Butchkavitz says, must reflect the
"craziness of [Gaudi's] mind" and that "bizarre madness of his."</LD>
<TE>   As the designer walks through his 2,000-square-foot workshop on
the outskirts of downtown Los Angeles, his hands fly around his head
until his halo of ultra-gold curls seem to vibrate. He's off-subject
for a moment, distracted by the movie history of his building. He
points to a bare room with windows, a space with concrete floors and
unfinished ceilings. "So this was Demi Moore's loft in 'St. Elmo's
Fire,' " he says. "And upstairs, here, was in 'Pacific Heights.' It
was Matthew Modine's architecture office. The Backstreet Boys did
their first video upstairs."</TE>
<TE>   Then it's on to his party decoration stash, packed inside a huge
closet. Here, he stores tassels from India, lace from Paris, hanging
spheres made from grapevines and table linens stacked to the ceiling.
Those Indonesian umbrellas he used for HBO's Golden Globes party are
somewhere too. "Now, they're all the rage," he notes. Butchkavitz
rarely uses anything twice. "Most of the parties are one-of-a-kind,"
he says. "Once it's shown in a magazine, it's documented--and that's
it. We don't want to use it again."</TE>
<TE>   Osbourne Brawl</TE>
<TE>   In the latest Osbourne news, an Internet entertainment company
filed a lawsuit this week in Los Angeles Superior Court, claiming it
is owed a share of the profits from the successful MTV series "The
Osbournes." Meanwhile, Ozzy's on the road, and wife Sharon has
undergone chemotherapy for colon cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The popular series, the complaint alleges, was derived from a Web
site the company created for the Osbournes. According to the
complaint filed by Threshold.tv, the deal between the Osbournes and
MTV breaches an intellectual property rights agreement the company
had made with Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne's company in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The deal gave Threshold rights to exploit the family name and
images in online and digital media, as well as rights to "additional
exploitations" of the material in other media, the complaint says. In
January, the suit alleges, the company had suggested putting cameras
in the family's home.</TE>
<TE>   MTV declined to comment on the suit, which seeks unspecified
damages and a court declaration that Threshold is owner of the
series.</TE>
<TE>   Threshold isn't the first in line to claim a connection to the
Osbourne hit series. Late last month, producer Gary Binkow filed suit
against Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, claiming that they stole the idea
for a "real-life docu-sitcom" from him. In the suit, Binkow claimed
he met several times with the couple and representatives of Miramax
TV between 1999 and 2000 to discuss the idea for the show.</TE>
<TE>   Smith Zeros In</TE>
<TE>   Even as he awarded Anna Nicole Smith $88 million in the fight over
the estate of her late oil tycoon husband, J. Howard Marshall, U.S.
District Court Judge David Carter had some less-than-flattering
observations about the TV personality's ability to actually write
checks.</TE>
<TE>   "Her illiteracy is striking. Examples are too numerous to
chronicle but include writing '25.00' meaning $2,500 and '4500,00'
meaning $4,500--she testified she has trouble with zeros. In fact,
she has only recently started learning to pay her own bills after
years of managers and relatives managing her money," Carter wrote in
the decision, according to the Web site The Smoking Gun,
www.thesmokinggun.com, this week.</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote:</TE>
<TE>   "The only way you can fully embrace life is to embrace what it's
all about. This [life] isn't like some religious sect--it's bawdy,
it's flirty and weird."--Dustin Hoffman in the September/October
issue of My Generation magazine.</TE>

<LD>IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THIS</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   by Fred G. Leebron</LD>
<TE>   Harcourt</TE>
<TE>   272 pages, $24</TE>
<TE>   A novel written by a man, about a man and his inner world, offers
hope to the rest of us. If all goes well with the storytelling, we
come away with a new appreciation for the curious behaviors and
strange priorities of an entire species. Why do men act like that?
Fred G. Leebron's "In the Middle of All This" provides some
worthwhile pointers.</TE>
<TE>   Leebron has a talent for revealing his characters, men and women,
with the sure hand of a builder hammering nails. Martin Kreutzel is a
keyed-up anthropology professor and a dedicated family man who can't
bring himself to tell his wife, Lauren, that he loves her. She keeps
the pressure off him, attending to the burst water pipes and broken
garage doors of life on her own. They share the work of raising Max,
the toddler Martin carries around like a favorite teddy bear, and
6-year-old Sarah, who lately avoids holding her father's hand in
public.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Martin also takes care of his sister, Elizabeth,
deathly ill in London and married to the wrong man, if you ask anyone
in her family. She diets on wheat grass and vitamin pills and resists
complaining about each new pain so that Richard, her New Age husband,
can go to his Epiphany seminars and meditation hour without feeling
guilty. She never used to be so passive when she lived at home in
Maryland, right?</TE>
<TE>   At first, this foursome seems wrapped tight, but gradually each
one expands like an onion unfurling its layers in heat. Martin's
tendency to drink, preferably 30-year-old scotch or dark beer, gets
particularized when he admits his favorite room in the house is the
dark bar in the basement.</TE>
<TE>   As Elizabeth grows physically frail she turns emotionally
stronger, abruptly cutting ties with her family for fear they won't
let her change. Her steady decline and sudden disappearance send
Martin into frequent riffs on the meaning of life. They all run along
the same lines. Illness isn't fair, there's nobody to blame,
everybody gets a turn, no need to feel humiliated. Why do we run from
it?</TE>
<TE>   It is Lauren who delivers the closest thing to an answer. Caught
up in a family illness, a falling-down house, faculty members on pain
pills and suicidal students, she steps outside it just long enough to
comment, "I love the idea of life in the middle of all this." Words
that sound like a sigh of relief.</TE>
<TE>   Leebron's skill at chiseling personalities in careful stages can
lull us into false security. Before long Martin and company start
opening up, and we are reminded what a mistake it is to judge too
quickly even someone as familiar as a wife, sister or brother-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   Quiet little Lauren offers to be a surrogate mother for Elizabeth
and Richard. Elizabeth goes from denying her mortality to taking
charge of how and where she will die. Richard stuns Martin when they
have it out over what a poor excuse for a husband he has been. Or,
maybe not. The Epiphany seminars and ashram weekends, the meditations
and guru chasings were all for Elizabeth, he says. "All along I've
been doing what she told me to do. No more. No less. Just exactly
what she wants." Mothers and wives in particular might find
themselves reading those lines more than once.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years Leebron, a creative-writing teacher who has
published short stories, novels and nonfiction on the craft of
writing, has been compared most often to Richard Ford, who writes
about men from the inside out. But Martin Kreutzel is a man you'd be
more likely to find in a Nick Hornby novel. He is frantic, frazzled,
but not an angry depressive, not one of the lost boys at midlife that
Ford knows so well.</TE>
<TE>   For all his whining and resisting, Martin is kindhearted and
willing to accept limits. He, after all, accompanies Elizabeth to the
worst of her doctor's visits when Richard says he can't face them.
When Martin's mother calls, he lets her vent about the messes of life
and reminds himself to ask after his father. He can't tell his wife
he loves her, but at least he can admit to himself that he does.</TE>
<TE>   For a young man, Martin (who's 38) spends a lot of time thinking
about death. What makes this manageable, even appealing, is the way
he does it in the middle of so much living. Rushing back and forth to
his sister's house in London, spending money he doesn't have, missing
classes he should be teaching at home, taking his kids shopping, he
forms a few conclusions. One in particular seems likely to stay with
him: "These were years that death was everywhere. He had never wanted
them to end."</TE>

to years of history on a wearer's back. It's opening day at American
Eagle Outfitters' clothing customization station, and Tova
Dershowitz, a 69-year-old grandmother, is looking on, trying to grasp
why anyone would want to take a new piece of clothing and rip it to
pieces. "I don't understand why they take perfectly good things and
destroy them. Why pay money for something brand new that has to look
old?" she wonders.</LD>
<LD>   Many a teen has taken bleach, scissors or needle and thread to
clothing while an older generation struggles to comprehend. But
customization isn't just for kids anymore. It's a trend reverberating
from mall stores such as American Eagle to luxury labels such as
Gucci and Tod's.</LD>
<LD>   Personalized clothing may be fashion's antidote to the sameness
spawned by globalization. In the 1990s, apparel companies began
blanketing the world with stores, so that a trendoid in Tokyo could
have the same Louis Vuitton monogram pouch as a society maven in
Costa Mesa. But now that Gucci logos and Gap jeans pop up worldwide
almost as often as McDonald's golden arches, uniqueness and
exclusivity are short-lived. And many shoppers are tired of dressing
like clones (even high-priced ones in Helmut Lang jean jackets and
Balenciaga cargo pants).</LD>
<TE>   "When a woman pays $12,000 for a handbag and she sees three of
them within her social circle, that demeans its value. There's an
incentive to have something that's truly original," says David Wolfe,
creative director of the Doneger Group, a New York-based fashion
trend consulting and forecasting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Customization has always been popular in Hollywood, where rockers
and starlets pride themselves on getting designers to entertain their
whims. But now, pieces that can be personalized are becoming more
widely available as luxury companies look for ways to remain
exclusive. For brands such as Hermes, Bottega Veneta, Louis Vuitton
and Prada, customization means allowing customers to choose a unique
color or material for purses, shoes and clothing, to make something
personal while keeping the basic design.</TE>
<TE>   At Tod's stores in Beverly Hills and New York, the leather and
details on handbags and shoes can be altered. Earlier this year,
Gucci began offering its made-to-order menswear service in the
Beverly Hills and New York stores. Customers can choose from three
basic suit silhouettes, then customize them with a choice of buttons
and fabrics. Gucci creative director Tom Ford says this is not a time
for one look; "now is the moment when the right look is individual
style."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, mass retailers are also embracing the trend, which
would seem by definition to be too individualized to be widely
salable. Customization stations at the Westside Pavilion's American
Eagle store and in nine others around the country debuted in August
and will be open Friday and weekend afternoons through the end of the
month.</TE>
<TE>   The Westside Pavilion station offers far more than just denim
distressing--the store's staff, many of whom are fashion design
students, is armed with scissors, stencils, patches and colorful
paints. The staff will attempt to create the customer's vision, for
free, on new or used American Eagle merchandise. It could be as
simple as an eagle stencil on a rear jeans pocket or as complex as a
T-shirt that's cut into pieces and reattached with ribbons.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Borenstein, a stylish 49-year-old who owns a dancewear store
in Thousand Oaks, is having the sleeves of a navy blue T-shirt
slashed into strips that will wrap around her upper arm like a
Slinky. "I always look for unique things," says Borenstein, who
appreciates the customized look but has never taken scissors to her
clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Levi Strauss &amp; Co. has had a customization station in its flagship
San Francisco store for three years. "People appreciate things that
are unique. They don't want anyone else to have the same pair of
jeans. They might not be creative hands-on, but they have a vision.
They can say, this is what I want. Because there's so much stuff out
there, there's a need to be able to say, this is unique, it's mine
and there's nothing else like it," says Karen Vurbano, a
customization merchandiser at Levi's.</TE>
<TE>   Nike has offered a custom design feature called Nike iD on its Web
site since fall 1999, and sales have steadily increased, according to
Beth Hegde, communications manager for Nike's running division. For
an extra $10, customers can choose the color and trim of a shoe or a
baseball glove as well as have their names sewn onto the items. In
April, features were added for building sneakers according to
specifications such as the running surface and the shape and width of
the foot.</TE>
<TE>   Even custom-looking garments can be enough for today's consumers.
Stores such as Rampage, Urban Outfitters and JCPenney offer clothing
that is patched, distressed or slashed for that do-it-yourself vibe.
"It's the human touch we're after. In the onslaught of modern life,
anything that looks like it's been touched by the human hand and
human heart is appealing," says Wolfe of the Doneger Group.</TE>
<TE>   Customizing clothing took off in the late 1960s as young Americans
moved away from tradition--symbolized in fashion by Jacqueline
Kennedy's clean-cut look--and into the realm of self-expression. In
the hippie era, customization was about hand-sewn peace sign patches
and embroidered daisies; in the 1980s, Madonna and Cyndi Lauper,
along with punk rock icons, sported tattered clothing held in place
by rows of safety pins.</TE>
<TE>   Then a few years ago, designers such as Gucci's Ford, Dolce &amp;
Gabbana, Marc Jacobs and Stella McCartney began incorporating
embroidery, paint splatters, fringe and lace as trim on jeans, and
intentionally ripping sleeves and hemlines for a homemade look.</TE>
<TE>   In the prosperous, high-flying 1990s, designer labels were in. But
now style is more about the person wearing the clothes than the label
sewn on the back pocket, says Susannah Cahn, fashion editor at
ELLEgirl magazine. "When somebody asks you, 'Where did you get that?'
you can say, 'I made it.' It's much cooler than saying, 'I bought it
at Barneys.' "</TE>
<TE>   Glamour magazine was inspired by the customization trend to
instruct its readers on how to knock off high-priced designer
clothing. In its August issue, the monthly presents readers with two
cheaper alternatives to the $1,840 embroidered-waistband jeans from
Ro- berto Cavalli modeled on the magazine's cover. A $99 version can
be ordered from the Levi's customization station, and a $40 version
can be made at home with beaded trim and bargain jeans from Wal-Mart.
"We came up with a master plan to make these jeans available to
anyone at any price. It was very satisfying because the difference
between the three wasn't all that obvious," said Sasha Iglehart, who
edited the Glamour spread.</TE>
<TE>   Whether at high-end or low-end stores, with teens or adults, the
popularity of customization may speak to the absence of any pervasive
trends in fashion right now. People have found that they can be their
own designers by tweaking simple pieces. And with the economy on
shaky ground and fall shopping not an option for everyone, putting a
new spin on an old standby could be just the thing.</TE>

<HD>It's Still Kicking Around</HD>
<DH>Footbagging--via the Hacky Sack--gains a toehold with the
ESPN generation</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN HUBLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The 23rd Annual World Footbag Championships opened here this week
with good vibes and scant fanfare, despite the fact that they
coincide with the 30th anniversary of the Hacky Sack this year. Yes,
there is a world championship featuring that little beanbag kicking
game that Deadheads used to play in circles. "Hunh," a middle-aged
bureaucrat marveled outside one of the heats at the UC San Francisco
student union. "People actually still do that?"</LD>
<LD>   "Actually, the way it's done now has a kind of X-games feel,"
offered a 29-year-old software tester named Tuan Vu, to whom the
question was repeated. Vu, a local known in footbag circles as "the
Disco Ninja," was bare-chested and sweat-soaked from the tip of his
soul patch to his Adidas Rod Lavers. Around him, the gymnasium was a
hive of hopping, spinning, flitting, perspiring footbaggers, kicking
their plum-sized beanbags to the beat of rap and heavy metal. Some
moved like acrobats, some like ponies, some like marionettes, their
spines, arms and legs as curved as commas. One kid, romping to AC/DC,
was punctuating his footwork with air guitar windmills. In a far
corner, a circle of white-haired teens from the Czech Republic had
been bouncing nonstop for more than two hours. The scene was
somewhere between Burning Man and Big Top. "I've spent over $1,000 on
physical therapy, just rehabbing my ankles," the Disco Ninja said.</LD>
<TE>   The road from backyard hobby to international athletic phenomenon
has become a well-traveled thoroughfare in the past couple of
decades. From skateboards to ice dancing, one generation's kid stuff
is another's segment on ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Few aspiring sports, however, have had as much difficulty selling
themselves as footbagging. (The colloquial name, Hacky Sack, is
actually a brand name, like Frisbee.) The pursuit has players'
organizations, training videos, Web sites and subspecialties, such as
footbag golf and "net" footbag, a kind of high-flying volleyball
played with no hands. Its most ambitious supporters have Olympic
aspirations. A footbag demonstration is scheduled for the X Games in
Philadelphia next week. But the public, it seems, can see neither the
celebrity wattage nor the smackdown potential of a hobby it
associates with old hippies. ("Stars?" the producer of this year's
23rd annual games shrugged when asked about big names. "You never
heard of 'em. I never heard of 'em either.") Even the most
accomplished players must support themselves Clark Kent-like with day
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   And the subculture doesn't help much: Trash talk is nonexistent,
rivals high-five each other, and, at one point during the
preliminaries, several contestants burst into tears at the buoyant
grace of one of the Czech kids. One of the entrants, a bike messenger
from Chicago, kept offering sports massages to his rivals. ("That's
Constantine the Energy Guy--major bliss," one contestant confided.)
Another, a tattooed Canadian, appeared to be compulsively juggling
other people's footbags. So much peace and love, promoters say, make
footbagging that much harder to pitch as a "real" competition, with
real backing and--more to the point--real endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a silly game," stressed Steve Goldberg, executive
director of the International Footbag Players' Assn. "This is a
serious athletic discipline. We just got our [nonprofit] designation
and we want to be recognized by the International Olympic Committee.
But we keep coming up against this whole hippie thing."</TE>
<TE>   Footbagging, as its players know it, dates to 1972, when an
injured soccer player in Oregon named John Stalberger met a local
character named Mike Marshall. Stalberger had just had knee surgery
and was trying to regain his flexibility when he encountered Marshall
kicking around a handmade beanbag. Stalberger joined in for the
exercise, the two became friends and went on to create a game called
Hack the Sack that they eventually decided to market. They named
their product--a small, ball-shaped beanbag--the Hacky Sack.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall, the hippie, died three years later of a heart attack at
the age of 28. But Stalberger, the athlete, went on to promote their
product and game. Eventually, he sold the rights to the Hacky Sack to
the then-owners of Wham-O Inc., which also made the Frisbee, among
other products. Though a few "hackers," as players are called, saw
the novelty's competitive potential almost from the beginning, it
mainly caught on as a communal game. The idea was to keep the Hacky
Sack aloft for as long as possible by lobbing it from one foot to
another. "Your responsibility was to the circle," explained one early
player.</TE>
<TE>   Friendly, peaceful and free of winners or losers, it was--and in
most places, still is-- known mainly as a resolutely anti-competitive
endeavor. Some groups even had rules against having to say you were
sorry if you let the footbag hit dirt, and positive reinforcement was
encouraged. "I used to go to Dead concerts and play around and the
people there would be like, 'I am not worthy!' " laughed Sam Conlon,
a women's freestyle champion who makes and sells art in Missouri and
who wasn't competing this year because she "needed to get home for a
big street fair."</TE>
<TE>   But it also takes a certain sort of personality to spend hours
every day mastering the art of foot-flipping a 2-inch beanbag, and
that sort of drive usually comes with a non-communal will to win. As
time has passed, fans say, that take on the sport has slowly gained
momentum. And spectators are beginning to appreciate the effort that
goes into mastering it. "People just don't understand the discipline
and artistry until I take them to tournaments and shove it in their
faces, and they go, 'Oh my goodness,' " said Goldberg, a laid-off
tech executive who, when he was flush, poured tens of thousands of
dollars into the promotion of footbagging. Even this year--despite
the fact that he had to take out a second mortgage to pay his
taxes--he helped underwrite the Czech team's airfare and is putting
the four members up in the guest room of his house in Redwood City.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past few years, with the availability of video on the
Internet, this freestyle stuff has just exploded," observed Kenny
Shults, a former footbag child prodigy who was also watching from the
sidelines. Shults, 35, is a marketer for a health care company in
Pennsylvania, but among footbaggers, he is known as the creator of
hundreds of now-standard freestyle tricks. "I just wanted to liven
things up when I started doing tricks," he recalled as the Czech kids
bobbed and weaved around him, eavesdropping and translating the great
man's wisdom. "But now, for better or worse, a lot of these younger
athletes have followed. And now kids are coming out of nowhere, doing
just amazing stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Some of it was, in fact, amazing--Montreal gymnasts leaping and
kicking to Cirque du Soleil-style music; hackers executing "shooting
mirages" and the "blurry whirling swirls"; the blond, ponytailed
Conlon offering a short demonstration that was part ballet and part
hippie jig.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's Ryan Mulroney, the reigning freestyle world
champion, was greeted with cheers and whistles even when he fumbled
his footbag. Vasek Klouda, who, at 15, was the youngest and smallest
member of the Czech team, seemed to be juggling with his feet as he
leaped and floated. The performance was so flawless--and the boy's
otherwise taciturn face so momentarily joyful--that it left most of
the audience and several of the judges weeping. If there were
rivalries, it was hard to detect them amid all the hugging and
high-fiving. More apparent were the competitors who were especially
close.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at those legs--40 years old, and after a baby!" enthused the
shirtless Scott Davidson, a Chicago-area champion, ogling his wife,
Valeria, who was competing in the women's division. Davidson, who
runs a family print business in his off-hours, pointed out another
couple who--he swears--he saw fall in love as she carried a pair of
sneakers across a gym floor.</TE>
<TE>   "I met my wife through these people, and we have a beautiful son
now," said Vu. "I even got my job because of a footbagger who turned
me on to the opening."</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that, in a "real" sport, the room full of hopping
friends would be otherwise known as "the competition."</TE>
<TE>   "This," the Disco Ninja said smiling, "is my community."</TE>

<LD>Every night from 1855 to 1891, a Point Loma lighthouse keeper would
climb the dim, winding stairs of the 40-foot tower and light the
wicks of an oil lamp. That light, magnified by a 5-foot-high,
barrel-shaped lens around it, sent a message to ships passing by in
the night, warning of the dangerous rocks near the coastline. The
beam kept the ships safe and saved the lives of those who sailed the
nearby seas.</LD>
<LD>   Today the Old Point Loma Lighthouse is part of Cabrillo National
Monument in San Diego. You can walk through the living quarters of
the lighthouse keeper and his family, restored to look as they did in
1887. On special occasions, you can climb that same winding staircase
and see the Fresnel lens that guided countless sailors.</LD>
<LD>   The park also tells the story of Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez
Cabrillo, who in 1542 led the first European expedition to the West
Coast of what later became the United States. You and your family can
enjoy the park's hiking trails through sage scrub forests filled with
wildlife, and examine what remains of the military equipment used to
defend the California coast during World Wars I and II.</LD>
<TE>   On a ranger-led tour of the rocky tide pools on the western side
of the park, you can explore mysterious ocean habitat. In the winter
you can take binoculars to the park's Whale Overlook and catch a
glimpse of Pacific gray whales on their annual migration from the icy
waters of the Arctic to the balmy bays of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Did You Know?</TE>
<TE>   * The Old Point Loma Lighthouse was built 422 feet above sea
level. Fog or low clouds often kept its light from reaching ships, so
the U.S. Coastal Survey built a new lighthouse down the hill, closer
to sea level.</TE>
<TE>   * The California legless lizard, Anniella pulchra, lives in the
Point Loma scrub forests and is often mistaken for a snake. How do
scientists know the reptile is a lizard? (It has eyelids.)</TE>

<LD>For persons with disabilities, finding stylish, comfortable and
durable clothing can be a frustrating challenge. Many settle for
whatever clothes they can rig to fit. Childhood friends Kurt Rieback
and Tom Pirruccello met up as adults and started a business,
Professional Fit, to help improve clothing options for the disabled.</LD>
<LD>   Following up after a chance sighting of each other on the freeway
15 years ago, the Studio City natives combined their expertise to
create Professional Fit, a Burbank-based company that fills the
special clothing needs of residents of nursing homes, developmental
centers and other care facilities in nearly 30 states. They recently
expanded to www.professional fit.com. Rieback, a former swimwear
salesman at the California Mart, and Pirruccello, a former
administrative assistant at a nursing home, manufacture most of their
customized men's and women's casual attire and adapt some ready-made
clothing to meet the special sizes and needs of clients. Their
extensive lineup includes $50 wheelchair capes, $27 elastic-waist
cargo pants, $19 Henley shirts and oversized socks that fit over leg
casts. The company recently created $15 to $20 bib-like clothing
protectors that look like a vest, button-down shirt, or T-shirt, but
slip on easily to prevent food stains.</LD>
<TE>   Professional Fit offers a range of personalized services,
including custom alterations, such as replacing buttons with
easy-to-fasten Velcro, or for people in group settings, free name
labels and individual receipts to make accounting easier.</TE>
<TE>   Rieback said that a number of facilities are teaching computer
skills by having residents choose their own clothing via the Internet
site. "It's meeting the needs of people who didn't know this was out
there," said Rieback. Call (800) 422-2348, or e-mail
sales@professionalfit.com.</TE>
<TE>   Sumptuous Scents</TE>
<TE>   When Vogue is running pieces on the delights of butter, and spas
are serving dessert, perhaps it's no wonder that some of the most
interesting fragrance collections read more like recipes than the
usual inflated perfume puffery.</TE>
<TE>   Though food fragrances are nothing new (remember the crazes for
eau de vanilla and grapefruit?), Lynette Reed, creator of Illume
candles, has set up her expanding Izzy Sayan body scent collection to
function like a perfume cookbook--mix lotions and potions, each
crafted to complement the key perfume notes--and create your own
fragrance, or one of her tasty formulas. Our fave? The "Hot Mama"
recipe: Start with one layer of kumquat body creme ($23), add a
generous coat of spicy Lola fragrance enhancer lotion ($17), and coat
with three spritzes of kumquat eau de parfum ($48). Other flavors of
parfums or colognes include cucumber melon, ginger grapefruit, pear
clove, pumpkin spice, Mexican hot cocoa, lemon nectarine or even
spiked rhubarb.</TE>
<TE>   Healthy--and Hip</TE>
<TE>   This fashionable food thing can go too far. New Yorkers are
carrying the new Glaceau Vitamin Water sports drinks as if they're a
fashion accessory! With medicinal labels and a dozen formulas for
"energy," "rescue," "focus," and more, the Vitamin Waters are trying,
hard, to bottle prestige and designer hypochondria cures into a
20-ounce plastic bottle. Note to the misguided citizens of Gotham: If
you want energy, try coffee. It works.</TE>
<TE>   If the Shoe Fits</TE>
<TE>   Italy's Sergio Rossi shoes are continuing their march across the
globe. The footwear maker opened a boutique at 366 N. Rodeo Drive
last month, one of 35 Rossi boutiques expected to open worldwide by
year's end. The Beverly Hills store has what others will
not--Hollywood stars placing orders in the VIP room.</TE>

<LD>Dear Fashion Police: On a recent episode of HBO's "Sex and the City,"
Charlotte was wearing a pink suede coat. It was beautiful. I would
like to purchase one just like it. Do you know where it might be
available?</LD>
<LD>   --A FAN</LD>
<LD>   Dear Fan: "Sex and the City" has developed quite a following of
clothesaholics who can't get enough of the classy, sexy, provocative,
trendy fashions worn by Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha
(a.k.a. Sarah Jessica Parker, Kristin Davis, Cynthia Nixon and Kim
Cattrall). Credit Patricia Field, the show's costume designer, for
making the show a hit with fashionistas. In addition to working on
this show and other TV and movie projects, she owns two Manhattan
boutiques and heads up a clothing line called House of Field, which
is designed by her longtime associate David Dalrymple.</LD>
<TE>   According to a spokesman for the show, that pink suede coat is by
French designer Christian Lacroix. Unfortunately that's all we were
told. We're sure of one thing--it's going to be a high-ticket item,
since the designer's clothes routinely go into the four figures.</TE>
<TE>   However, if you're jonesing for other outfits and accessories you
may find them on the show's weekly EBay auction. Warning! These items
can get pretty pricey, often zooming into the hundreds of dollars,
sometimes well over their original retail cost. But the proceeds go
to good causes--four charities chosen by the show's stars. All the
info and links to the EBay auctions can be found at www.hbo.com.</TE>
<TE>   You can visit Patricia Field's online boutique at
www.patriciafield .com. Lots of fun, wacky and funky clothes and
accessories are for sale, including handbags, jewelry, lingerie and
hats.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I have a couple of pairs of black cotton
pants and some tops that, after a few washings, start to fade and
lose their true black color. Do you know of any tips to set the color
so it won't fade after a few washings? Will dry-cleaning cut down on
fading? I've also heard that soaking the garments in vinegar and
water, or a tea bath, will set the color. Do those work?</TE>
<TE>   --IN THE BLACK</TE>
<TE>   Dear In: We have good news and bad news. The bad news is that,
like death and taxes, having dark clothes fade after repeated
washings is pretty much inevitable. It happens to light-colored
clothes too, we just don't notice it that much.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that there are many things you can do to help
lessen the fading, including a new product just on the market.</TE>
<TE>   Let's start with that. Woolite's new Dark Laundry Fabric Wash is
formulated to minimize fading and can be used in washing machines. It
was first introduced in France (where dark clothes are de rigueur,
oui?) and is just now arriving on store shelves in the U.S.,
retailing for about $5.25 for 32 ounces. We haven't had a chance to
road test it yet, but we'd like to hear from anyone who has.</TE>
<TE>   We spoke with Jane Rising, manager of training and instruction at
the International Fabricare Institute, a trade association of dry
cleaners, wet cleaners and launderers, based in Silver Spring, Md.</TE>
<TE>   She offered a plethora of tips, starting with following the care
label instructions for washing, an important step that many people
ignore. If machine washing is recommended, turn the garment inside
out so it won't come in contact with other clothes, and use a shorter
wash cycle. Also, add the amount of detergent suggested and don't
overload the machine. "Things rub up against each other, and the
agitation can cause the dyes to rub off," she explained.</TE>
<TE>   Clothes may fade less or more at the dry cleaner, Rising said,
depending on how the garments were dyed, the types of dye used and
how the clothes are cleaned. As for the vinegar dip, she said that
may not work with many of the synthetic dyes used commonly today.</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Giarde, executive director of the California Cleaners
Assn., said that color loss may be attributed to improper dye setting
when the fabric is first colored. She also suggested following care
label instructions and, if the colors do run, fade or change
dramatically, taking the item back to the store.</TE>
<TE>   To test a garment for colorfastness, Giarde suggests wetting a
cotton swab, dabbing it in a little detergent and rubbing it on an
inconspicuous area, such as an inside seam. Press some white tissue
paper into the wet area and see if any color appears on the paper. If
it does, there's a good chance the colors will run when washed.</TE>
<TE>   We've never heard of tea bathing black pants to maintain their
color, and neither had any of our experts. We think it might add too
much of a brown cast to your clothes, but if anyone has had success
with this, let us know.</TE>

<HD>What, No Gold-Plated Rubber Ducky?</HD>
<DH>The former Tyco CEO is in hot water for his $6,000 shower
curtain</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With all the mud that's been sticking to corporate America lately,
you could imagine that any self-respecting CEO might want to hit the
showers. But even there, former Tyco tycoon L. Dennis Kozlowski
evidently couldn't stay out of hot water.</LD>
<LD>   Many words have already been published about allegations that the
55-year-old executive raided millions in Tyco funds to underwrite a
lavish lifestyle. But none are likely to have more staying power than
these: $6,000 shower curtain.</LD>
<LD>   According to reports published this week in the Wall Street
Journal and elsewhere, Kozlowski is under investigation for finagling
more than $135 million in Tyco funds to pay for such perks as
antiques, art and furnishings for his Manhattan duplex and half the
$2.1-million cost of a junket to the Mediterranean island of Sardinia
for his wife's 40th birthday.</LD>
<TE>   But a $6,000 shower curtain? Even if cleanliness is next to
godliness, isn't that kinda steep?</TE>
<TE>   "Either he really got ripped off, which I doubt, or I'm sure it
had to have some type of precious metal in it," said Ellen Seay,
licensing director for Paul Brant Design Company, a Panama City,
Fla., outfit that sells printed shower curtains, bedding, wallpaper
and other domestic furnishings. "I think the most one of ours has
ever retailed for is 40 bucks."</TE>
<TE>   But others suggested that paying the equivalent of a year's
state-college tuition for a shower curtain might not be quite as
outlandish as it sounds. "It could easily happen. With the price of
labor in New York and fabric, things add up," said an associate at A.
Michael Krieger Inc., a New York interior design and decorating firm,
who asked that his name not be used.</TE>
<TE>   If you picked out "some really, really expensive fabric," the
associate said, plus an expensive inner lining, plus some nice fringe
work, you could be talking in the thousands. However, he said, "I
think you'd have to work hard at it."</TE>
<TE>   A saleswoman at ABC Home and Carpet in lower Manhattan said the
upscale store's most expensive shower curtain costs $195. That's for
a handmade floral design printed on off-white linen.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very good price, with all the work that's on it," said the
saleswoman, who would identify herself only as Benita. "Six thousand
dollars, that's crazy. We have tourists coming in here, actors,
actresses coming in here, and they don't expect to pay that much. You
could do a complete [bedroom] for that."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps spending big bucks for a shower curtain was merely Koz-
lowski's way of supporting the widespread call for more
"transparency" in corporate America? Alas, that theory doesn't hold
water: The curtain in question was described as a gold-and-burgundy
floral-patterned model.</TE>
<TE>   Seay speculated that the curtain "couldn't have been functional,
it must have been for looks or prestige or whatever. I'm sure it
wasn't in a bathroom that was used." If she owned a $6,000 shower
curtain, she said, "nobody would ever be taking a bath in the
bathtub."</TE>

<LD>"It's a rattlesnake!" said Devin.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a coyote," said Jack. "It's moving toward us."</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's a bear," said Jane. "We better get out of here."</LD>
<TE>   Several of the kids turned and ran toward their cabins, which
weren't very far.</TE>
<TE>   "Hold up!" shouted Wolfman. "It's not a rattlesnake. It's not a
coyote, and it's not a bear. It's a hungry possum."</TE>
<TE>   He took several giant steps toward it to shoo it away. "It's
looking for food, that's all. Now help me put out the campfire, and
I'll show you why my name is Wolfman."</TE>
<TE>   Jack's eyes widened. He looked at Devin.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not going to turn into a wolf, is he?" he whispered.</TE>
<TE>   Devin laughed. "No way!" she said, but she wasn't so sure. She
imagined seeing Wolfman with big bushy hair and sharp, shiny teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Devin and Jack sprinkled water over the hot coals of the fire
until it was completely out. They threw dirt on it to be sure.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfman asked the campers to stand and face the same direction
into the dark night sky. Devin and Jack joined the line. He motioned
everyone to be quiet. Wolfman stood with his back facing them and
threw back his head.</TE>
<TE>   "Ooo-oooo-ooo-ooowww!" A long and low howl came from deep inside
his chest.</TE>
<TE>   Within seconds the howl echoed back to them, bouncing off the
distant boulders. The campers stood silently, waiting for a response.</TE>
<TE>   "Ooo-oooo-ooo-ooowww!" Wolfman howled again.</TE>
<TE>   He turned around. "Everyone add a howl until I say stop," he
whispered.</TE>
<TE>   The campers threw back their heads and howled, their voices
overlapping each other.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfman motioned them to stop. For a minute, they stood shifting
on their feet. Then they heard it.</TE>
<TE>   "Ow-ow ow-owww!" A wild howl of a real wolf.</TE>
<TE>   Devin's heart raced with excitement. At that moment she decided
that she wanted to stay at camp all summer long.</TE>
<TE>   Author Maura Walsh's summer adventure is exploring Prague, the
capital of the Czech Republic. This story will be on The Times' Web

<HD>S&amp;P Gives DWP a Higher Credit Rating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the largest
municipally owned power utility in the U.S., received a higher credit
rating from Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., reflecting progress in cutting
debt and spending.</LD>
<LD>   The credit-rating company raised the department's bonds one notch
to AA-minus from A-plus, affecting about $3.1 billion of power system
revenue bonds. The utility plans to sell $400 million of
adjustable-rate debt next week to refinance commercial paper.</LD>
<LD>   The utility's "progress in reducing debt and operating expenses in
recent years" and wherewithal to pay for power plant improvements and
other upgrades with cash spurred the higher rating, S&amp;P said.</LD>
<TE>   A higher credit rating often helps cut the cost of a borrower's
bond sales because investors are willing to accept lower interest
rates on higher-rated securities.</TE>
<TE>   Most municipal utilities in California, including Los Angeles',
avoided a fiscal crunch during an energy crisis last year that drove
the state's two largest investor-owned utilities to insolvency and
lowered their bonds to "junk" status.</TE>
<TE>   The municipal agencies were able to pass higher power costs on to
customers, an option the privately owned utilities didn't have under
a flawed state deregulation plan, analysts have noted.</TE>
<TE>   Municipal agencies also benefited from owning more power plants,
shielding them from soaring costs for outside power purchases.</TE>
<TE>   "When we looked at our financial situation over the last couple
years, we always thought that we should be upgraded" because of the
utility's improved financial standing, Robert Rozanski, the
department's assistant chief financial officer and treasurer, said.
The crisis last year "created a lot of uncertainty" that made an
upgrade a tougher sell.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service, which rates the Los Angeles utility's
bonds Aa3, said in a report last week that the department had cut its
debt tied to generating plants to about $1 billion from $4.1 billion
in 1997.</TE>

<HD>Wholesale Prices Fall Unexpectedly in July</HD>
<DH>Economy: The decrease gives the Fed room to cut interest
rates. Initial jobless claims also drop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Wholesale prices of food, cars and computers unexpectedly fell in
July, the Labor Department reported Thursday, giving the Federal
Reserve room to cut interest rates to bolster the faltering U.S.
economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   The 0.2% drop in the government's producer price index of what
factories, farms and other producers receive for their goods followed
a 0.1% increase in June. The index is a closely watched gauge of
inflation at the wholesale level.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called core index, which excludes food and energy, fell
0.3%, the biggest decline since October. Economists had expected a
0.1% increase.</LD>
<TE>   The Labor Department also said the number of U.S. workers filing
new claims for state jobless benefits was down more than expected
last week.</TE>
<TE>   Fed policymakers meet next week, and economists say they probably
will declare that slowing growth poses a greater risk than inflation
to the fledgling recovery. Adding to evidence the economy is
flagging, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and other retailers
reported Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year rose less
than expected.</TE>
<TE>   As for the jobless claims, states last week received 376,000
initial applications for unemployment benefits, a decrease of 15,000.
Analysts had expected claims to fall to 385,000 from a previously
reported 387,000, based on the median of 30 forecasts in a Bloomberg
News survey. The four-week moving average of claims dropped to
379,000, the lowest since March 2001, when U.S. employment peaked and
the recession was starting.</TE>
<TE>   Although new applications fell, the number of people continuing to
collect benefits rose by 51,000 to 3.53 million in the week that
ended July 27. The insured unemployment rate rose to 2.8%. That
measure of the number of people receiving benefits as a share of
those employed tends to move with the overall jobless rate.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers indicate "sluggish growth in payrolls and a relatively
steady or slightly higher unemployment rate," said Stephen Stanley,
an economist at Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. in Greenwich, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing and services stalled in July; unemployment stayed
near an eight-year high; and from April to June the economy grew
one-fifth as much as in the first three months of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Passenger car prices fell 1.5% after rising 0.4%. Light-truck
prices fell 1.6% last month after rising 0.5%.</TE>

<HD>Baby Bells Seek Upfront Payments</HD>
<DH>Telecom: The FCC is considering the firms' requests to
demand millions of dollars from financially troubled carriers that
use their local networks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's three biggest regional telephone companies are seeking
government approval to demand millions of dollars in upfront payments
from financially troubled carriers that use their networks.</LD>
<LD>   The requests from SBC Communications Inc., Verizon Communications
Inc. and BellSouth Corp. are receiving serious consideration from the
Federal Communications Commission, which already allows long-distance
carriers such as AT&amp;T Corp., WorldCom Inc. and Sprint Corp. to demand
upfront payments from users of their long-distance networks.</LD>
<LD>   The payments would accelerate the collection of an estimated $8.5
billion that the so-called Baby Bells and other local phone companies
receive annually for connecting long-distance calls to the local
phone network.</LD>
<TE>   But industry groups and some financial analysts warn that granting
such payments could push strapped carriers over the financial brink
and exacerbate the woes of companies such as WorldCom, which last
month filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   "What the Bells are requesting is commercially unreasonable," said
H. Russell Frisby Jr., president of CompTel, a Washington trade group
that represents long-distance companies and local phone competitors
of the Baby Bells. "It will potentially wreak financial havoc on our
members."</TE>
<TE>   Verizon, which filed comments with the FCC on Wednesday in support
of its request, said uncollectable debt from other carriers that use
its network has more than doubled to $110 million in 2001 from $38
million in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Carrier debt has been increasing," said Edward D. Young III, a
senior vice president at Verizon. "We don't want the average
ratepayer to suffer when these carriers encounter financial
difficulty."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, SBC said WorldCom owed it more than $300 million before
the long-distance carrier filed for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's crisis is attributable not only to the behavior and
failed business models of companies like WorldCom, but also to the
well-intentioned but failed regulatory policies these companies have
so cynically exploited for the past six years," SBC President William
Daley said last week in announcing that SBC would seek upfront
payments.</TE>
<TE>   To ward off deadbeats, the Bells have proposed that users of their
networks with the lowest investment-grade credit rating, among other
criteria, pay upfront for service. Verizon is seeking two months of
advance payments; SBC has asked for one month upfront.</TE>
<TE>   Because virtually all telecom competitors of the Baby Bells
carriers are saddled with junk-bond credit status, the effect of
upfront payments would be widespread.</TE>
<TE>   If granted, the Bells' proposals could trigger retaliation from
long-distance carriers that already have the authority to require
upfront payments. Moody's Investors Service, for instance, announced
Thursday that the finances of BellSouth, Verizon and SBC
Communications are under close study and that the companies may have
their credit ratings cut as a result.</TE>
<TE>   Rivals of the Baby Bells were initially heartened last month when
the FCC suspended a request from BellSouth to impose upfront
payments. FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell later told a Senate panel
July 30 that he would not be "easily rolled over" by other Bell
requests for upfront payments.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, there has been a shift in FCC sentiment, although
agency officials caution that the issue remains under discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Still, FCC and industry sources say the agency probably will act
quickly to allow upfront payments, although it is unlikely that the
amounts will be as large as the Bells are requesting.</TE>
<TE>   One FCC official said the agency is wrestling with striking a
balance that "doesn't put carriers like WorldCom out of business but
protects [the Bells] from very huge credit exposure."</TE>
<TE>   The Bells still "are healthy companies" after all, said the
official, hinting at the criticism Powell has received from some
members of Congress that the FCC isn't doing enough to police the
industry and protect consumers from service disruptions.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. bonds plunged, raising concern that the second-biggest
U.S. debt issuer may have its credit ratings cut amid slowing
economic growth and greater competition.</LD>
<LD>   Ford's 7.25% coupon notes maturing in 2011 dropped as low as $916
per $1,000 of face value from $944, pushing up the yield to 8.59%
from 8.13%.</LD>
<LD>   Ford is rated Baa1 at Moody's Investors Service and BBB-plus at
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.</LD>
<TE>   Both ratings firms have a negative outlook on the credit, meaning
they are more likely to cut the ratings than raise them. The current
ratings are three levels above junk.</TE>

<LD>El Paso Corp., the largest U.S. owner of natural-gas pipelines,
slashed its profit forecast for the second time since May and said
the business has enough cash to avoid a dividend cut during an
energy-trading slump.</LD>
<LD>   The Houston company said its second-quarter loss narrowed to $45
million, or 8 cents a share, from $93 million, or 18 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue fell 20%, to $2.99 billion from $3.76 billion. El
Paso shares rose 14 cents to $14.89 on the NYSE.</LD>

<LD>Ford Motor Co. said it hasn't been able to get fuel bladders needed
for safety tests after the deaths of three Arizona Highway Patrol
officers in crashes involving the auto maker's Crown Victoria sedans.</LD>
<LD>   The auto maker said it wants five fuel-tank bladders, which are
supposed to prevent gasoline from leaking in crashes, for testing.</LD>
<LD>   The supplier, Aircraft Rubber Manufacturing Inc.'s Fuel Safe,
sells the bladders to government agencies and has told Ford it
doesn't have extras for the auto maker.</LD>
<TE>   The Arizona officers died in fires after the fuel tanks on their
Crown Victorias ruptured when the cars were rear-ended at high speed,
state officials have said.</TE>
<TE>   The state suspended Crown Victoria purchases and asked for a
safety review.</TE>
<TE>   Ford maintains the cars meet safety standards and don't need to be
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Ford shares fell 36 cents to $11.92 on the NYSE. They have
declined 23% this year.</TE>

<LD>Delta Air Lines Inc. and Northwest Airlines Corp. may sell tickets on
each other's flights to counter a similar plan by UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines and US Airways Group Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Northwest, the fourth-largest U.S. airline, told pilots it's
talking with No. 3 Delta about the partnership, an Air Line Pilots
Assn. spokesman said. The airline needs the union's approval for such
a partnership.</LD>
<LD>   Northwest has a similar agreement with Continental Airlines Inc.
and probably would include that partnership in an accord with Delta,
letting the airlines extend route systems at less cost than an
expansion or merger.</LD>
<TE>   A Delta-Northwest partnership would require approval from the
Transportation Department.</TE>
<TE>   Delta shares fell 16 cents to $14.59 on the NYSE, while Northwest
rose 48 cents to $8.48 on Nasdaq. Continental rose 30 cents to $9.10
on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Judge Lets Unocal Ask State Dept. to Intervene in Myanmar
Lawsuit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONNI EFRON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles judge Thursday granted a request by Unocal to ask the
State Department to intervene in a lawsuit by Myanmar villagers who
allege that the Myanmar military protecting a Unocal pipeline project
dragooned villagers into slave labor, attorneys said.</LD>
<LD>   The Unocal request comes on the heels of a State Department letter
urging dismissal of a similar lawsuit involving an Exxon Mobil
project in Indonesia.</LD>
<LD>   The government said letting that case go to trial would harm the
national interest, including the war on terrorism, and efforts to
improve the Indonesian military's record of human rights abuses.</LD>
<TE>   The suit against Exxon Mobil is on behalf of 11 Indonesian
villagers who claim that Indonesian government troops protecting an
Exxon plant conducted torture, rape, kidnappings and murder.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights advocates blasted the State Department's letter as a
sellout of human rights in the name of the global war on terrorism
and warned that it would set a dangerous precedent in other
litigation. The California decision suggests that such a precedent
has been set, and opens the possibility that other companies being
sued for alleged overseas abuses also may seek support from the State
Department.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, Unocal argued that the cases are similar in their
efforts to hold U.S. corporations accountable for misdeeds of foreign
militaries in foreign lands.</TE>
<TE>   "As in Exxon Mobil, the litigation seeks to penalize an American
company for investing in a country with a record of human rights
abuses," Unocal said. "It could have a chilling effect on investment
and efforts to induce the host country to improve human rights."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, when Unocal was being sued in federal court over the same
issues, the company also requested a State Department opinion. Noting
that evidence was limited because the case had just begun, the
government issued a letter, saying, "The adjudication of the claims
based on allegations of torture and slavery would not prejudice or
impede the conduct of U.S. foreign relations with the current
government" of Myanmar.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be very surprised if the State Department would take a
position contrary to what it did" in the 1997 Unocal case, said Paul
Hoffman, a Los Angeles lawyer representing some of the Myanmar
plaintiffs in the Unocal case.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just no basis for the State Department to say that a
judgment against Unocal in this case would undermine U.S. foreign
policy in any way," Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal succeeded in having that case dismissed in 2000, after
Judge Ronald Lew found no evidence that Unocal sought to employ
forced or slave labor and that it had expressed concern about the
practice.</TE>
<TE>   Unocal now is being sued in state court, with the issues revolving
around whether a California corporation can be sued over acts of a
foreign government.</TE>
<TE>   Like Exxon Mobil, Unocal does not confirm or deny that violations
took place at the hands of foreign militaries, but says the company
did nothing wrong. "Unocal was simply an investor along with three
others in the project," spokesman Barry Lane said.</TE>
<TE>   Once it receives the court's request, the State Department has 30
days to issue a letter. As in the Exxon case, the court is not bound
to follow the government's position.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Victoria Gerrard Chaney also moved the Unocal trial from
Sept. 26 to Feb. 4.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Subscribers Notified of Rate Hike</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER and EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when Adelphia Communications Corp. needs all the friends it
can get in its fight to survive, the cable operator has made a bunch
of new enemies by raising its rates nearly 6%.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, angry subscribers of the company, which has filed for
bankruptcy protection, put down their remote controls and picked up
the phones.</LD>
<LD>   "My office has been deluged with calls from outraged subscribers,
and I have to say I share their sentiments," said Los Angeles City
Attorney Rocky Delgadillo. He said he has asked the city's
second-largest cable provider to rescind the increase.</LD>
<TE>   In its letter that begins "Dear Valued Customer," Adelphia put
subscribers on notice that basic cable service will go from $41.08 to
$43.45 beginning with the September bill.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to emphasize that the increase did not have anything to do
with the current financial situation of the company," Adelphia
spokesman Eric Andrus said. "We adjusted the rate for the enhanced
program choices we are giving our customers as well as advanced
services that they very much expect, such as high-speed Internet
access and digital cable."</TE>
<TE>   Andrus said he didn't know which enhancements had been added to
the basic service but cited movie and sports offerings.</TE>
<TE>   "We agree that the timing could be better," he said. "But it's a
necessary part of our ability to provide valuable service to our
customers. No one is happy about a rate increase, but it's necessary
because of costs in the cable business."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at competitor EchoStar Communications Corp., which owns
the DISH satellite network, barely could hide their glee over the
Adelphia hike.</TE>
<TE>   "It's playing right into our strategy," said John Scarborough,
head of marketing at EchoStar. "Our customers are concerned about
what is going on in corporate America today. What a great opportunity
for them to not only get a great service, but also from a stable
provider."</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia's requested increase comes just weeks after the founder
of the troubled Pennsylvania company and his two sons were arrested
on charges of bilking shareholders and looting billions from the
company coffers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so mad," said longtime Adelphia subscriber Harriet Werner,
76, who lives in Westwood and received her rate increase letter
Wednesday. She said she has filed numerous complaints about the
technical quality of her service.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe they have done this, now after we found out what
has been going on with the money we have been paying the company all
these years," Werner said.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia founder John Rigas, 77, and two of his sons, Timothy and
Michael, were accused of hiding $2.3 billion in personal loans
guaranteed by the company and artificially boosting their firm's
financials by inflating corporate earnings and the number of cable
subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   The firm serves about 250,000 cable customers in Los Angeles and
an additional 1 million in Southern California. The city has been
monitoring Adelphia closely since the bankruptcy filing and has
threatened to remake the company's five cable franchises if service
deteriorates.</TE>
<TE>   In its letter, Adelphia said the rate hike was due to increases in
"operational expenses such as wages, specialized training for our
employees, utilities, fuel, insurance." No mention was made of legal
fees.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia was probably within its rights to increase rates, City
Attorney Delgadillo said.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission "gives every cable company
the right to raise their rates once a year based on a standardized
formula," he said. "They filed a notice well before all these
troubles came to light, back in March. But given all the anger from
when their founder was taken off to jail in handcuffs, I perchance
thought they would act like a normal business."</TE>
<TE>   Werner is retired from writing advertising copy. She said she
could not imagine what ad would soothe the feelings of Adelphia
subscribers at this point.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way to make people feel OK about this," she said. "If
the company had any feeling, they would have not sent out that letter
to begin with. It certainly didn't make me feel like a 'valued
customer.' "</TE>

<HD>Brazil Bailout Buoys U.S. Bank Stocks</HD>
<DH>Financial services: Aid reassures investors worried about
Latin America's debt problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stocks of big U.S. banks moved sharply higher Thursday, a day
after Brazil obtained an emergency loan package from the
International Monetary Fund that eased concerns about defaults on
loans and bonds in Latin America.</LD>
<LD>   An index of 24 major bank stocks surged 5.4%. Citigroup Inc.
shares climbed $2.38 to $33.90, and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. was up
$2.34 at $26.38. FleetBoston Financial Corp., which has more than $7
billion of exposure in Brazil and has lost billions of dollars in
Argentina, gained $1.71 to $23.62. Bank of America Corp. rose $3.14
to $68.39, and Wachovia Corp. was up $1.36 at $36.01; both are major
lenders to Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   The emergency aid for Brazil, the largest bailout in the IMF's
history, was accompanied by the announcement of $1.5 billion in
bailout funding for Uruguay and a pledge by U.S. Treasury Secretary
Paul H. O'Neill to help Argentina. That signaled to investors that
the Bush administration, in a change of policy, will come to the aid
of troubled Latin American economies, said David Hendler, financial
services analyst at CreditSight Inc. in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Hendler said investors fear the troubles that have devastated
Argentina could spread beyond Uruguay and Brazil to the rest of South
America and then to emerging-market economies in the Far East and
perhaps to additional countries.</TE>
<TE>   "The worry underneath it all is that Mexico might be
susceptible--and that's right on our doorstep," Hendler said. "Why
was the Treasury secretary so intent on taking a stand? He's worried
about the effect" of problems in Mexico on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   He said 35% of Citigroup's assets are in emerging markets,
including Mexico. Other U.S. banks also have significant exposure to
those economies.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts expressed surprise that bank stocks responded so
robustly to the IMF bailout, given the severity of Latin America's
debt problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can wave a wand over this and make it go away,"
Lehman Bros. analyst Brock Vandervliet said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite record bank earnings, the stocks of big banks have slumped
this summer, in part because of fears lenders would be implicated in
the accounting scandals that have battered corporate America.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said investors were reassured by an announcement
Wednesday by Citigroup, the nation's largest financial services
company, that it would require clients to disclose the implications
of off-balance-sheet partnerships. J.P. Morgan, Citigroup's chief
rival, said it also would require more such disclosure from clients.</TE>
<TE>   The two banks were criticized by Congress for involvement in
partnerships allegedly designed to help Enron Corp. conceal the huge
debts that toppled the energy trader into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Bank stocks also were buoyed Thursday by word that the Labor
Department's wholesale inflation index fell 0.2% in July. Economists
had expected a slight gain, and analysts said the decline confirms
that the near-term risk of inflation is almost nil, allowing the
Federal Reserve to keep interest rates at 40-year lows or even push
them down further.</TE>
<TE>   The stocks got an extra boost when short sellers--speculators who
sell borrowed stock in hopes of buying it back cheaply--bought bank
shares when the stock prices moved higher, Vandervliet said.</TE>

<HD>Northrop-TRW Deal Viable, Pentagon Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp.'s $11.8-billion takeover of TRW Inc. has no
"showstopper" antitrust issues, even as other military contractors
worry they might lose access to products the two companies produce,
the Pentagon's top acquisition official says.</LD>
<LD>   This concern was raised by Lockheed Martin Corp., the Air Force,
Navy, Army and the National Reconnaissance Office that buys spy
satellites, said Edward "Pete" Aldridge, the Pentagon's
undersecretary for acquisition.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not finding any showstoppers," Aldridge said. "If we saw a
problem that we thought was insurmountable, we would try to convey
that to the people early."</LD>

<LD>Housing affordability dropped statewide in June as rising home prices
negated falling mortgage rates, according to a report by the
California Assn. of Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   The percentage of those able to buy a median-priced home was only
27% in June, down from 32% a year earlier. The median, which means
half cost less and half cost more, rose by 20% in June to a record
$324,370.</LD>
<LD>   A similar pattern was found in Los Angeles County, where the rate
slid to 31% in June, down from 35% a year ago. In Orange County, the
index fell to 22% from 29% a year earlier and was unchanged from
June.</LD>
<TE>   California remained significantly lower than the U.S. overall,
where the rate was 55% in June, compared with 54% from a year
earlier.</TE>

<HD>FCC Says New TVs Must Be Digital by '07</HD>
<DH>Technology: Some manufacturers, vowing to fight the order
in court, argue that the required tuners could raise prices by $200.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators on Thursday accelerated the nation's conversion to
digital television when it gave manufacturers a 2007 deadline to
equip most new sets with tuners that will offer viewers
better-quality pictures and enhanced sound.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission's vote may raise the price
of new TVs, possibly by as much as $200, even for those consumers who
don't want digital TV. Although the move was hailed as a victory for
television broadcasters and other Hollywood interests who hope to
captivate audiences with digitized images, it was immediately
denounced by consumer advocates and many in the electronics industry
who vowed to fight the order in court.</LD>
<LD>   "We want the free market to determine what we sell," said Gary
Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Assn. "We happen to
agree that digital television is a great product. But we don't think
the government should tell people that they have to buy it."</LD>
<TE>   The FCC insisted it was acting in the best interest of consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has set a 2006 target date to convert analog television,
the current standard, to digital, which will allow for
high-definition pictures, clearer sound, more channels and
interactivity. That congressional decision could render many of the
nation's television sets obsolete without the purchase of specialized
hardware to convert them for digital broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's government intervention was needed, advocates said,
because electronics makers have been slow to introduce digital TV
sets, and progress has stalled. As a result, consumers are purchasing
television sets that soon will be outdated.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a market-oriented policy," said FCC Chairman Michael
K. Powell. "We are halfway out in the stream in the canoe. Talk of
going back is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Since digital televisions first became available at the end of
1998, Americans have purchased only about 3 million sets, largely
because there is a dearth of high-quality digital programming and
because the more sophisticated sets can cost thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   But that sluggish demand has created a stalemate of sorts. When
broadcasters begin sending more compelling content, TV makers say,
consumer demand will increase and manufacturers will respond by
making more digital sets. Broadcasters argue that they will produce
more digital programs once the audience is larger.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to jump-start the roll-out of digital television, federal
regulators on Thursday ordered TV makers to phase in digital tuners,
beginning in July 2004 for TV sets with screens 36 inches or bigger
and ending in 2007 for sets as small as 13 inches. The FCC believes
the price of digital tuners will drop dramatically as they become
more commonplace.</TE>
<TE>   The conversion will allow the government to reclaim the old analog
spectrum and use it for other purposes or auction it off for billions
of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   But like most issues surrounding the nation's controversial and
slow-moving transition to digital television, the ruling raised
questions about whether the move will speed progress or spur
time-consuming litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC order did not address another key technological hurdle for
digital television: cable-box compatibility. Currently 70% of
television viewers rely on cable rather than over-the-air
transmissions. But there are no standards to ensure that cable boxes
are compatible with digital televisions.</TE>
<TE>   For those consumers who get their television from cable or
satellite, the new FCC order will have little effect because it
applies only to over-the-air broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   W. Kenneth Ferree, the FCC's media chief, said the commission is
working on the cable-box issue, but he could not predict when it
might take action.</TE>
<TE>   Republican Commissioner Kevin Martin, who increasingly finds
himself at odds with Powell, was the sole vote against Thursday's
order. He said he would have preferred to address the
cable-compatibility issue rather than single out the electronics
industry.</TE>
<TE>   But for Powell, the order was a powerful message about what can
happen when an industry refuses to cooperate with his agenda.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring, Powell unveiled a voluntary plan for digital
television, setting deadlines for cable, broadcast and electronics
industries to speed up the transition.</TE>
<TE>   Though the cable and broadcast industries endorsed the plan,
consumer electronics makers--with the exception of Zenith and
Thomson--did not, and now they face a government mandate.</TE>
<TE>   In a related matter, the FCC voted to jump into the controversy
over copyright protection for digital television. The commission,
with the blessing of several lawmakers, said it would consider
whether to require TV manufacturers and other electronics makers to
ensure that their devices recognize broadcast flag, a copy protection
technology.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC is seeking comment by the end of the year on whether it
should mandate the technology.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bertelsmann is scrapping a plan to challenge AOL Time Warner Inc. as
new Chief Executive Gunter Thielen shelves acquisition plans,
analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   The media company, controlled by the billionaire Mohn family, said
board member Klaus Eierhoff quit, less than 10 days after Thomas
Middelhoff, who championed an online expansion, resigned as CEO
because of a spat with the Mohns.</LD>
<LD>   The departure of Eierhoff, whose DirectGroup unit lost $151
million last year because of online investments, will give Thielen
more power to shut unprofitable Internet businesses, analysts said.
Middelhoff spent $5.5 billion as he tried to turn the 167-year-old
publisher into Europe's version of AOL Time Warner.</LD>

<HD>Intel Says 'No' to Expensing Options</HD>
<DH>Accounting: The tech firm says there is no good model to
accurately determine their fair value.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Intel Corp. said Thursday that it planned to buck a Wall Street trend
by not counting stock options as an expense, as the world's largest
semiconductor maker said there was no accurate way to account for
them.</LD>
<LD>   Intel, following in the footsteps of Cisco Systems Inc. and
Microsoft Corp., insisted the current debate is "misdirected."</LD>
<LD>   "There is no good valuation model to determine the fair value of
unexercised employee stock options," Intel Chief Financial Officer
Andy Bryant said.</LD>
<TE>   Technology companies, unlike those in other industries, issue
stock options as a major source of compensation for their employees,
from executives to rank-and-file workers.</TE>
<TE>   How to account for the options has divided Wall Street, with
companies such as Intel in one camp, and corporate giants such as
Coca-Cola Co., General Electric Co. and General Motors Corp., which
will count options as an expense, in the other.</TE>
<TE>   Even advocates of the practice said accounting for them accurately
would be difficult because the value of stock options varies so much.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you value options and how do you then determine what the
economic impact is?" asked Mark Edelstone, an analyst at Morgan
Stanley. "This is an incredibly complicated issue."</TE>
<TE>   Intel in the mid-1990s made options available to all full-time
employees.</TE>
<TE>   As of June 2, Intel's five most highly paid executives held 2% of
outstanding options, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost of stock options is already reflected in earnings per
share" on a fully diluted basis, Bryant said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, companies began reporting earnings per share on
a fully diluted basis, which assumes that all stock options granted
have been exercised.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant also said Intel wants to separate the issue of granting
options from executive compensation, and encourage investors and
companies to focus on the latter.</TE>
<TE>   In Intel's case, the total outstanding options held by the five
highest-paid executives amounted to 2.3% of the outstanding 750
million options, according to Intel's quarterly filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Intel said Chief Executive Craig Barrett and Bryant would certify
Intel's financial results, in keeping with an SEC directive.</TE>
<TE>   In a surprise move this week, U.S. accounting officials agreed to
explore the effect of requiring companies to disclose stock option
expenses on their income statements, in a bid to pull that data and
place it before investors.</TE>
<TE>   The Financial Accounting Standards Board's move came as it agreed
to amend rules so companies that opt to expense options can choose
among a few alternative accounting treatments, which could further
muddy the water for investors.</TE>
<TE>   Intel shares rose 66 cents Thursday, closing at $18.38 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Indexes Soar, Cap 3 Big Days</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Dow and S&amp;P post their best stretch of gains
since 1987, lifting hopes that the market has seen its lows for now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Another strong rally in stocks Thursday boosted hopes that the
market's latest crisis has passed, as key indexes capped their best
three-day performance since 1987.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average soared 255.87 points, or 3%, to
8,712.02, extending its gain since Monday to 8.3%.</LD>
<LD>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 jumped 28.69 points, or 3.3%, to
905.46 and has risen 8.5% in three days.</LD>
<TE>   For both indexes, those are the biggest three-day advances since
the rally that quickly followed the October 1987 crash, according to
data from Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts remain hesitant to declare the end of the
29-month-long bear market, but this week's surge has bolstered hopes
that recent market lows may hold, at least for the near term.</TE>
<TE>   Renewed strength in the dollar versus the euro and the yen over
the last two weeks suggests that foreign selling of U.S. securities
has abated, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's investment policy committee in New York gave the
market a vote of confidence Thursday, recommending that clients raise
the equity weighting in their portfolios to 60% from 55%.</TE>
<TE>   "The markets have been demonstrating increased resilience, holding
above the lows of last month," said Sam Stovall, senior investment
strategist at S&amp;P. "Even though an extended period of 'base-building'
is likely, we believe a bottom has been established and that the
markets now have greater upside potential than downside risk."</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 is up 13.5% from its five-year low reached July 23.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many investment pros caution against exuberance.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't get too comfortable, but it sure feels great to have
three up days," said Reg Gipson, president of Alpha Analytics
Investment Group, a Los Angeles money management firm. He warned that
geopolitical uncertainty--particularly the risk of war between the
U.S. and Iraq--may limit the market's upside.</TE>
<TE>   Several sharp rallies have been nothing more than one- or two-day
wonders as the bear market has dragged on over the last year. But now
the Dow has notched its first three-day winning streak since early
May, and its first three-day string of triple-digit gains in 17
months.</TE>
<TE>   The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index also has rebounded
for three sessions, rising 35.62 points, or 2.8%, to 1,316.52
Thursday. It has jumped 9.2% since hitting a five-year low Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Trading volume picked up Thursday, and winners outnumbered losers
by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 3 to 2 on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   In another encouraging sign, the rally gained strength late in the
day as professional traders made bullish bets, Gipson said. Major
indexes closed at or near their highs for the session.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. bank stocks got a big lift as the International Monetary
Fund's bailout of Brazil doused worries about an economic meltdown in
South America.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, analysts said concerns may be fading about a rash of
corporate earnings restatements ahead of Wednesday's deadline for the
largest companies to certify their results. If the deadline passes
without major surprises, the market could get another shot of
confidence, Gipson said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Federal Reserve policy makers aren't expected to trim
interest rates at Tuesday's meeting, there remains a strong sense on
Wall Street that the Fed will do so in the fall if economic growth
continues to slow.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, data showing weak retail sales in July provided a
reminder that the recovery could be running out of steam. But more
investors appear to be betting that the worst of the news this summer
is over, and that many stocks have become too cheap to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, technical factors could help stoke a rally. For
example, a record number of shares have been sold "short" by bearish
traders. They could rush to close out those bets as prices rise. That
would add more fuel to a rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Gipson, however, cautioned that tensions between the U.S. and
Iraq, as well as continuing fears involving terrorism and the Middle
East, will keep uncertainty high.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we get more clarity on the political front, that's going to
put a lid on what the market does," he said. "The steady drumbeat
that something is going to happen is particularly unsettling."</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * European markets were up sharply, following Wall Street's lead.
Key indexes rose 6.2% in Germany and 3.6% in both France and Britain.</TE>
<TE>   In Brazil, the main stock index leaped 4.5% to 10,315, and the
nation's currency, the real, strengthened to 2.92 per dollar from
3.02 on Wednesday and 3.5 a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   * The dollar rallied with stocks, while bond yields rose. The
dollar rose to 121.03 yen from 120.17 on Wednesday. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year T-note jumped to 4.39% from 4.31%.</TE>
<TE>   * Blue-chip winners included Pfizer, up $1.49 to $33.16; Johnson &amp;
Johnson, up $2.06 to $54.57; Honeywell, up $2.13 to $33.87; and AT&amp;T,
up 49 cents to $9.80.</TE>
<TE>   * In the tech sector, Microsoft gained $1.82 to $48.91, IBM surged
$2.44 to $71.61, and Nokia was up $1.23 to $12.48.</TE>

<HD>Stewart May Be Subpoenaed in ImClone Probe</HD>
<DH>Securities: House panel member says she should be forced to
appear if she does not provide the data sought by Aug. 20.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARCY GORDON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A lawmaker said Thursday that a House panel may need to subpoena
Martha Stewart in the ImClone Systems Inc. investigation, and a
former Securities and Exchange Commission official suggested that her
legal prospects appear unfavorable.</LD>
<LD>   "The line on her in Las Vegas obviously isn't too good right now,"
said Irving Einhorn, a former regional administrator for the SEC, now
an attorney in private practice. "You've got to know that she's in
serious trouble."</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors probably are not seeking Stewart's help in making
their cases against others in the ImClone stock scandal and may want
to go after her with the full force of the law to show that "even the
high and mighty can be brought down," Einhorn said.</LD>
<TE>   Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich.) said Stewart, Chief Executive of Martha
Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., should be subpoenaed to answer
questions about her December sale of ImClone shares if she does not
provide information by Aug. 20.</TE>
<TE>   An indictment Wednesday brought new charges against Stewart's
friend, former ImClone CEO Samuel D. Waksal, who was accused of
obstruction of justice in addition to previous securities fraud and
perjury charges.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is
investigating ImClone stock sales, are discussing the possibility of
issuing a subpoena to Stewart to compel her testimony, committee
spokesman Ken Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal was arrested in June on charges that he secretly advised
family members to sell their ImClone stock on Dec. 27 after learning
that his biotech company's highly touted cancer drug had been
rejected by the Food and Drug Administration. The stock subsequently
plunged.</TE>
<TE>   Stupak, a member of the House panel probing ImClone stock sales,
said of Stewart: "Bring her in, and if she wants to take the 5th,
that's her right."</TE>
<TE>   A Stewart spokeswoman in New York declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The House committee requested some of Stewart's e-mails and
records from her business manager.</TE>
<TE>   Committee investigators are trying to resolve discrepancies
between her account of the sale of nearly 4,000 shares of ImClone a
day before the stock plunged and those of her Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
broker and his assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has declined to meet with investigators, saying it would
be premature.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Stewart's company have been battered since June 6, when
they were trading around $19. Omnimedia shares dropped 72 cents, or
9.6%, on Thursday to close at $6.78, a record low.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart says she had a standing order to dump her ImClone stock if
it went below $60, and that the order was triggered on Dec. 27.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson has said that a June 12 letter from Stewart's lawyer said
she had no inside knowledge about any action the FDA was taking
regarding ImClone. The letter did not address whether Stewart knew
that Waksal was trying to sell shares, Johnson said.</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Settles Net Privacy Claim</HD>
<DH>Web: FTC orders firm to improve security of its Passport
identity service and submit to audits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. agreed to a landmark 20-year settlement with the
Federal Trade Commission on Thursday, resolving a sweeping claim that
the software giant falsely promised 200 million consumers that their
personal information was secure and private when stored in its
Passport online identity service.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft agreed to improve Passport's security, test the new
measures' effectiveness, fix any breaches and submit to regular
audits by an independent firm. Any misleading statements could bring
fines or other punishment to the Redmond, Wash.-based company.</LD>
<LD>   "Privacy and security promises must be kept," FTC Chairman Timothy
Muris said. "Microsoft made a number of misrepresentations."</LD>
<TE>   Passport stores information about the identity of computer users
and sometimes their credit card numbers and e-mail addresses, so
consumers don't have to reenter the data as they move from one site
to another.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft requires Passport for use of its Hotmail e-mail system
and some other services. The company abandoned plans last year to
require Passport registration for other functions, but it still touts
it as a gateway to enhanced services in development.</TE>
<TE>   After a year's investigation, the agency accused the world's most
powerful software company of:</TE>
<TE>   * Asserting that credit card and other sensitive information
assembled by Passport would be guarded by "powerful online security
technology," when it didn't have high security.</TE>
<TE>   * Boasting that Passport enabled faster and safer online
purchases, when most purchases would have been just as safe without
it.</TE>
<TE>   * Telling parents that a children's version of Passport would stop
Web sites from harvesting such personal information as full names,
when it didn't.</TE>
<TE>   * Failing to disclose in the service's privacy policy that
Microsoft was logging and storing data about which Web sites Passport
users visited.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC reached no conclusion on whether Microsoft intended to
deceive its customers, and it said it found no security breaches. An
independent researcher last fall showed that Passport was vulnerable
to a hack through Hotmail, and Microsoft fixed the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft said its missteps were unintentional and that it had
kept information about user habits on hand only in case Passport
subscribers called with a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "The FTC is setting a high bar not only for Microsoft, but for our
entire industry," Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith said. "We
believe consumers will benefit."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said that Microsoft looked forward to more constructive
dialogue with government representatives. Since a January declaration
by Chairman Bill Gates, security has been a top concern at the
company, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft also hopes to reach an agreement to end the European
Union's investigation of Passport, Smith said. The FTC action is by
far the most aggressive to enforce the terms of privacy policies and
other claims on business Web sites, even when those policies are read
infrequently by Web surfers.</TE>
<TE>   "The FTC is sending a signal to the entire online services
industry that every single [business] is going to be held to a strict
standard," Prudential Securities legal analyst James Lucier said.
Microsoft has changed the claims in its privacy policy for Passport
and sends fewer automatic suggestions that computer users log in.
Otherwise, consumers will see little immediate difference in their
experience, Microsoft and FTC officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation began as Microsoft was readying the Windows XP
operating system for release last year. The nonprofit Electronic
Privacy Information Center and a dozen other groups complained to the
FTC that Microsoft was implying that PC owners needed Passport to use
Windows XP.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Passport was an optional service that Microsoft could tap
to monitor user behavior. The software company could then charge
merchants and consumers for services based on what it learned about
its users. And Passport-affiliated Web sites had varying privacy
policies, so users couldn't be sure what each one would do with the
Passport data.</TE>
<TE>   Although the FTC's findings were less serious than the original
accusations, consumer advocates exulted over the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "The FTC over the years has been a bit skittish," EPIC Executive
Director Marc Rotenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have laws for video rental records and banking records, but
the United States really doesn't have a typical privacy law for
Internet activities. This indicates that the FTC is prepared to use
its authority in unfair and deceptive practices to protect privacy on
the Internet."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares rose $1.82 to $48.91 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Union Seeks Telemundo Contract</HD>
<DH>Labor: AFTRA is asking NBC to extend the same wages and
benefits to journalists who work at the Spanish-language television
network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Union leaders pressuring NBC to extend contract coverage to TV
anchors and reporters who work for Telemundo, NBC's recently acquired
Spanish-language network, will take their campaign to Los Angeles
City Hall today.</LD>
<LD>   The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has
demanded the right to organize 36 on-air employees of the two
Telemundo stations in Los Angeles, KVEA-TV Channel 52 and KWHY-TV
Channel 22, since NBC completed its $2.7-billion acquisition of
Telemundo in April.</LD>
<LD>   The union alleges that NBC, which is owned by General Electric
Co., has rebuffed its efforts.</LD>
<TE>   The network instead has endorsed a two-tiered system of
discrimination, the union charges, in which on-air Telemundo
reporters and anchors receive substantially lower salaries and
benefits than their counterparts at KNBC-TV Channel 4.</TE>
<TE>   AFTRA represents all of KNBC's nearly 30 on-air employees, and the
union is asking that its contract with NBC automatically be extended
to include Telemundo journalists.</TE>
<TE>   "NBC should do the right thing," said Leslie Simon, director of
AFTRA's Spanish-language media project to organize workers at
Spanish-language TV and radio stations. "NBC has said the Latino
community is very important, so they should lead by example and
increase the standards in the Latino labor market. This is a
hypocritical stance that NBC is taking."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Council members are expected to vote today on a
resolution calling on NBC to provide "its Spanish-language employees
with the same quality of benefits, working conditions and
representation as its English-language employees."</TE>
<TE>   NBC executives deny that the network is discriminating. Not all
on-air workers at NBC-owned stations belong to the union, a network
official said Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   "NBC respects the right of all of its employees to make their own
decisions about union representation, and we do not interfere in that
process," an NBC statement said. Network officials said AFTRA has
failed to follow the normal process of petitioning the National Labor
Relations Board for an election to see whether employees want to be
represented by the union.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe employee rights are best protected when such decisions
are made under the auspices of the National Labor Relations Board,
the federal agency charged with overseeing union representation
matters," the NBC statement said.</TE>
<TE>   AFTRA's Simon said NBC should automatically extend union coverage
and union-scale wages to Telemundo workers without federal oversight.</TE>
<TE>   Although the union hasn't performed any comparison studies, Simon
said anecdotal evidence suggests that KNBC personalities'
compensation is "significantly more than 30%" higher than that of
their counterparts at KVEA and KWHY.</TE>
<TE>   AFTRA has refused to petition the federal labor board because of
the union's contentious history with Telemundo executives, Simon
said. She alleged that after AFTRA tried to organize KVEA in 1995 and
1996, six Telemundo workers interested in joining the union were
fired.</TE>
<TE>   Telemundo Chief Executive James McNamara could not be reached
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   AFTRA also has enlisted the support of Chicago-area political

<HD>Qwest 2nd-Quarter Loss at $1.1 Billion</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The firm seeks to avoid cash crunch by selling
its directory business and renegotiating credit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Local phone company Qwest Communications International Inc. posted a
$1.1-billion quarterly loss Thursday, but said it would soon announce
a buyer for its phone directory business as it races to avoid running
out of cash.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a narrower loss from a year earlier, analysts said they
were still leery about prospects for the Denver company, which has
reported nine consecutive quarters of net losses. Qwest is also the
target of accounting and criminal probes after acknowledging it
improperly booked $1.16 billion in sales and other items from 1999 to
2001.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest said it is in talks with bankers to renegotiate its credit
facility, but analysts said the company's inability to close the sale
of its $9-billion QwestDex directory business and weak results leave
it a step closer to bankruptcy.</LD>
<TE>   "Qwest is clearly at the mercy of its banks," said Davenport &amp; Co.
analyst Drake Johnstone. "If the bankers decide not to play ball,
Qwest could be in bankruptcy later this year."</TE>
<TE>   Slack demand hurt sales of Qwest's data services in the second
quarter. Its net loss, including $926 million in charges, totaled
$1.14 billion, or 68 cents a share, compared with a loss last year of
$3.31 billion, or $1.99.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest's second-quarter charges included a write-down of $740
million for the rest of its investment in KPNQwest, its bankrupt
joint venture with Dutch firm Royal KPN, and increased bad-debt
reserves of $119 million related to the WorldCom Inc. bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue in the quarter fell about 17%, to $4.32 billion. Excluding
one-time charges, Qwest reported a loss of 13 cents a share. Wall
Street analysts expected a loss of 7 cents, according to Thomson
First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest repeated that it expects a charge--as much as $30
billion--for the impairment of goodwill at a later date.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a company that's teetering on the brink of being a going
concern or filing for bankruptcy," said Tim Ghriskey of
Connecticut-based investment management firm Ghriskey Capital
Partners, which does not own Qwest shares.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Notebaert took issue with
analysts' sour view, pointing to Qwest's second-quarter positive cash
flow and a new proposed $500-million credit facility for QwestDex. He
said Qwest has sufficient resources to fund operations for at least
the next 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone's not going to give you $500 million if they're worried
about bankruptcy," Notebaert said. "We read it and have no idea where
it's coming from because I can tell you there's no discussion like
that taking place in my office."</TE>
<TE>   The company expects next week to begin getting approvals from its
lenders on its new terms, and said it is in talks with Bank of
America Corp. about restructuring its credit.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest's stock remained unchanged Thursday, closing at $1.20 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Best Buy's Warning Dims Retailers' Hopes</HD>
<DH>Economy: Shares of the electronics giant plunge 36%.
Overall sales are sluggish in July.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM and ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Consumer electronics retail giant Best Buy Co. warned Thursday that
profit in the current quarter would be more than a third less than
originally projected, triggering a 36% drop in its shares and a slide
in the stock of other electronics and video game retailers.</LD>
<LD>   The warning from the nation's largest consumer electronics
retailer, which came amid tepid retail sales reports for July, fueled
fears that consumers, who helped lift the economy during the holiday
season with an electronics shopping spree, finally are curtailing
their spending to match the stock market slump.</LD>
<LD>   "Investors are increasingly concerned about the direction of the
consumer," said David Schick, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson
Humphreys. "The consumer has been a huge pillar of this economy
through thick and thin. Now it seems they're sick of it."</LD>
<TE>   Best Buy, which has 1,800 stores, attributed weak sales to a drop
in consumer confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all been asking when Wall Street was going to hit Main
Street," said Shannon Burns, Best Buy's senior manager for investor
relations. "That happened in July, and consumers are now realizing
that the declines in their investment portfolios are affecting their
wealth."</TE>
<TE>   Best Buy, the worst performer on the New York Stock Exchange on
Thursday, touched a 52-week low before settling at $19.55, down
$11.25. Shares of other electronics retailers also fell, including
Circuit City Stores, which slid $1.24, or 8.3%, to $13.76, and
Ultimate Electronics Inc., which fell .$4.16, or 32%, to $9.</TE>
<TE>   Retail sales fell 2.6% in July compared with a year earlier,
according to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi's retail sales index. Sales
were down from a 5.1% gain in June and a 4.2% average monthly
year-over-year increases from February to July.</TE>
<TE>   But Best Buy's announcement startled investors. The company, which
does not usually give monthly guidance, said earnings in the three
months ending Aug. 31 probably would be 17 to 21 cents a share
because of flat sales in July. Analysts had estimated that it would
earn 32 cents. A year earlier, the Eden Prairie, Minn., retailer
posted per-share earnings of 26 cents.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw weakness across the board, across all store brands, all
products lines and all geographies," Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   The news comes on the heels of robust spending last year on home
entertainment and consumer electronics such as DVD players, digital
music players, digital cameras, wide-screen televisions and video
game consoles. Much of the spending occurred after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, which dampened travel and caused U.S. consumers to
focus more on their homes. In addition, federal tax rebates last
summer helped spur spending. Those factors, however, have run their
course, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "People are now looking for value," said Susan Kevorkian, consumer
devices analyst for research firm IDC. "This year, if it costs more
than $200, it's going to be a lot harder to sell."</TE>
<TE>   Not all categories will do poorly.</TE>
<TE>   "Small-ticket items should benefit this season, but large-ticket
items, particularly [personal computers] will suffer," said Rob
Enderle, technology analyst with Giga Information Group Inc. "The
strongest segment remains games."</TE>
<TE>   Despite forecasts of double-digit growth for the game market this
year, shares in major game publishers and retailers slipped Thursday.
Electronic Arts Inc. fell 31 cents to $59.60, THQ Inc. lost 70 cents
to $22.95, and Activision Inc. shed 55 cents to $27.43. Electronics
Boutique Holdings Corp., a retailer that specializes in games, fell
$2.01 to $22.21 even amid expectations that same-store sales will
increase 10% to 15% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, overall retail sales were sluggish in July, a
traditionally slow month lodged between beginning-of-summer purchases
and back-to-school shopping. But in comparison with last year, when
tax rebate checks buoyed the sector, sales looked particularly slack.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs' retail index put July sales in stores open at least
a year as 1.4% ahead of last year, mostly on the strength of discount
stores, which saw sales rise 4.3% ahead of last year.</TE>
<TE>   Department stores and specialty apparel sellers suffered, with
sales at stores open at least a year--a key measure of growth--down
3.4% and 3%, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw a 4.5% bump in same-store sales in July.
The rise, however, was below its projections for the month, and
analysts expressed concern that sluggish retail sales would drag into
the crucial holiday season. Wal-Mart's shares rose 81 cents to $49.19
on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Federated Department Stores Inc. saw same-store sales drop 5.2%,
and clothing retailer Gap Inc. saw an 8% drop. Federated shares
gained 48 cents to $34.50, and Gap rose a penny to $11.16.</TE>

<HD>Maker of ReplayTV Recorders Fires CEO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sonicblue Inc. said Thursday that it fired its chairman, chief
executive and president, Ken Potashner, and named as interim CEO its
marketing vice president, L. Gregory Ballard.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Clara, Calif.-based Sonicblue, manufacturer of ReplayTV
digital video recorders and Rio digital music players, among other
devices, did not say why it had fired Potashner.</LD>
<LD>   Sonicblue representatives did not return calls and e-mails seeking
comment.</LD>
<TE>   The company said in a statement that it would address the changes
in an early-morning conference call today.</TE>
<TE>   Ballard is the former chief executive of 3dfx, a graphics company,
and he previously ran Internet and music businesses.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, Potashner steered the company aggressively and
took on media conglomerates that, among other things, tried to force
Sonicblue to track the television viewing habits of people who used
its ReplayTV recorder to skip commercials, and to report its findings
back to them.</TE>
<TE>   The top ranks at the company have been in turmoil for some time.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the chief operating officer left the company just one
day after it named its third chief financial officer in a year.</TE>
<TE>   It also said Anthony Wood, founder of ReplayTV and a member of the
team since Sonicblue's acquisition, left to pursue other projects.</TE>
<TE>   On July 31, Sonicblue reported a net loss of $23.5 million on
revenue of $61.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Sonicblue shares closed down 6.4% at 44 cents Thursday on Nasdaq
before trading was halted.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sprint PCS Group joined the race to provide speedier wireless access
to e-mail and the Internet--one of the last major players to launch a
so-called next-generation service, but the first to roll out the
service nationally.</LD>
<LD>   The PCS Vision service, which works with one of several new mobile
phones or two laptop modems, transmits at least as fast as a typical
phone line and several times faster than Sprint's existing Wireless
Web service allows.</LD>
<LD>   The data speeds are similar to those offered by Verizon Wireless,
and slightly faster than the next-generation services launched over
the last year by rivals Cingular Wireless, AT&amp;T Wireless and
VoiceStream Wireless.</LD>

<LD>A unit of Motorola Inc. is recalling about a million digital cable
set-top boxes because they could pose an electric shock hazard to

<LD>   Motorola's Broadband Communications Sector will recall the DCT2000
model set-top boxes that were distributed to cable TV subscribers
across the U.S. between March and June, the Consumer Product Safety

<HD>Corporate Reform: a Ship Sailing Nowhere</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Excerpted from Arianna Huffington's syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Watching President Bush smile for the cameras as he signed the
Sarbanes-Oxley corporate responsibility bill made me think of the
time a friend took a trip on a cruise ship.</LD>
<LD>   Her 10-year-old son kept pestering every crew member he
encountered, begging for a chance to steer the massive ocean liner.
The captain finally invited the family up to the bridge, whereupon
the boy grabbed the wheel and began vigorously turning it. My friend
panicked--until the captain leaned over and told her not to worry,
that the ship was on autopilot and that her son's maneuvers would
have no effect.</LD>
<LD>   It's the same with our leaders. They stand on the bridge making
theatrical gestures they claim will steer us in a new direction,
while down in the control room, the autopilot, programmed by
politicians in the pocket of special interests, continues to guide
the ship of state along its predetermined course.</LD>
<TE>   Take the aforementioned and much-ballyhooed corporate reform law.
Although it's being presented as a big win for the public interest,
corporate lobbyists actually succeeded in fighting off a whole slew
of reforms: Stock options still don't have to be treated as a
business expense, offshore tax havens are still allowed, there's been
no pension fund reform and no restitution to the victims of corporate
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, industry lobbyists were able to water down many of
the provisions that actually made it into the bill, including those
limiting--but not banning--accounting firms' ability to consult for
the companies they audit. Even those limits can be overridden by the
new accounting oversight board. A few more "victories" like this and
we're going to lose the war.</TE>
<TE>   It's really pretty astounding when you think of it: With all the
public outrage and media focus on corporate wrongdoing, moneyed
interests are still able to undermine the public interest as our
political leaders shamelessly continue dancing to their tune.</TE>
<TE>   How else to explain the brazen hypocrisy exhibited by the
president after last week's ceremonial signing of the bill? Less than
eight hours after warning corporate crooks, "you will be exposed," he
quietly issued an interpretation of the law undercutting a provision
designed to make it easier for employees to--you got it--expose
corporate crooks.</TE>
<TE>   If these guys are this audacious now, I shudder to think what will
be going on a few months down the line, when the media's notoriously
short attention has moved on to Iraq or Ben and J.Lo or both.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, you can bet that corporate America--with its
Energizer Bunny lobbyists and wide-open checkbooks--will still be
working overtime to ensure continuation of the status quo. Over the
last 10 years, corporations have doled out more than $1 billion in
campaign contributions. And this down payment on public policy has
extended across party lines, with $636 million going to Republicans
and $449 million to Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Al Gore, in his New York Times j'accuse, still had the gall to
lay the blame for the current threat to "the future of democratic
capitalism" squarely at the feet of Republicans "bankrolled by a new
generation of special interests." What utter claptrap.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the ongoing corporate crime wave not just a business
scandal but a political one is precisely the fact that there is
simply no consistent institutional opposition to the corporate
takeover of our politics--certainly not the Democratic Party. It was,
after all, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle who blocked the stock
option amendment proposed by Sen. John McCain. And all but two
Democratic senators have accepted campaign contributions from
WorldCom, Enron or Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   No group is able to match the relentless lobbying and manipulation
by corporate America. And until we have such a countervailing
force--one that will storm the control room on the SS America and
shut off the autopilot--we are doomed to live in a less and less
democratic society.</TE>

<HD>Belated Attention to Beleaguered Region</HD>
<DH>Latin America needs help, not bromides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABRAHAM F. LOWENTHAL</AU>
<BD>Abraham F. Lowenthal, a professor of international
relations at USC, is the founding president of the Pacific Council on
International Policy.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An important change in U.S. policy toward Latin America may be taking
place, but it will be too little and too late if it is not followed
by a much sharper focus in Washington on the nature and depth of
Latin America's profound crisis.</LD>
<LD>   The signs of a possible policy transformation abound. Treasury
Secretary Paul H. O'Neill's trip this week to Brazil, Argentina and
Uruguay suggests that the secretary is finally focusing on averting
immediate catastrophe in our neighborhood. The administration is
making awkward efforts to backtrack from O'Neill's earlier,
ill-considered remarks, which suggested that international financial
assistance to emerging-market countries in crisis carried the risk
that the funds would be diverted by corrupt officials.</LD>
<LD>   The administration's announcement that it is making available $1.5
billion in short-term loans to help overcome Uruguay's banking crisis
and the International Monetary Fund agreement to provide a
$30-billion emergency loan to Brazil suggest that Washington now
understands the dangers of an accelerating contagion in our
hemisphere. And potentially most important, congressional approval of
trade promotion authority (previously called "fast track") gives the
administration a needed tool to craft policies for Western Hemisphere
economic integration.</LD>
<TE>   But these positive signals come after growing problems in Latin
America went unaddressed during the Bush administration's first 18
months--first because of ideological complacency and then because of
the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In his first months in office, President Bush lavished welcome
rhetorical attention on Latin America, the one major region where the
newly elected president, devoid of significant international
experience, apparently felt comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   But the administration seemed largely content to express its
satisfaction with the region's turns toward market economies and
democratic politics and to express a long-term commitment to free
trade throughout the Americas.</TE>
<TE>   Lacking was a recognition that democratic governments in Latin
America were crumbling, market economies were failing and promising
free trade in the future did not respond to today's deep anxieties.
The administration voiced its solidarity with Latin America but did
not heed its distress. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the
region virtually disappeared from the administration's radar screen.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America today is in critical condition. Economically, the
region as a whole is expected to register negative growth of almost
1% this year; the collapse in Argentina is far worse. Millions of
Latin Americans are dropping from the middle class into painful
poverty. Unemployment rates are rising, crime is exploding,
desperation and resentment are growing.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, the stability ushered in by Latin America's historic
transition toward democratic governance is at grave risk. Argentina
has run through five presidents in a year. Venezuela's president,
strongman Hugo Chavez, has survived an attempted coup, but the
country's power structure and much of its population are aligned
against him. Peru's Alejandro Toledo has seen his approval ratings
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Bolivia's Congress has just installed a president who won only
one-fifth of the popular vote, and his leading rival opposes U.S.
policies. Colombia's presidential inauguration this week was marred
by a massive bombing that killed 19. In Brazil, the heir apparent to
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the champion of U.S.-endorsed market
reforms, has slipped to third place in the opinion polls, behind two
candidates who reject Washington's approaches.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is not mainly responsible for Latin America's problems,
and U.S. policies alone will not reverse the vicious cycle of
poverty, crime, drugs, injustice and oppression.</TE>
<TE>   But our mantra of free markets and democracy is not an adequate
response. The resources, leadership and influence of the United
States will be needed to help refocus attention on the issues Latin
America has to face: how to correct for the market's effect on income
distribution; how to improve productivity and competitiveness; how to
develop human resources; and how to rebuild trust in political
institutions and the rule of law.</TE>

<HD>Colombia's Fight Is Ours Too</HD>
<DH>For sake of stability and democracy, the U.S. should step
in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM RATLIFF</AU>
<BD>William Ratliff, a research fellow at Stanford
University's Hoover Institution, is coauthor of recent books on
terrorism in Colombia and legal reform in the developing world.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colombian terrorists sent a clear message to Alvaro Uribe on
Wednesday just as he was being inaugurated as president of Colombia.
Guerrillas with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
lobbed rockets at the presidential palace and in downtown areas that
killed 19 civilians. The unmistakable message: "Here we are. Come and
get us."</LD>
<LD>   Immediately after his landslide electoral victory, Uribe sought
United Nations support in negotiating a peaceful resolution to
Colombia's seemingly interminable violence, despite evidence that
former President Andres Pastrana's three-year "peace offensive" had
accomplished nothing.</LD>
<LD>   But Uribe clearly stated that he would meet violence with violence
if serious negotiations were rejected by the guerrillas. With the
bombs of Bogota, the battle is openly joined.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. policy toward Latin America during the Bush administration is
likely to be thought of as before and after Uribe's inauguration.
Despite the American president's pledge to take Latin America more
seriously than his predecessor, he has not done so. But just as Sept.
11 quickly focused his mind, so Aug. 7 will do the same for this
hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   Why should the United States become involved in Colombia's civil
war? Because Colombia is a large country strategically located
between Central America and the rest of South America. Chaos there
affects the region as a whole. Some 90% of the cocaine that reaches
the U.S. comes from or through Colombia. Above all, we are already
involved up to our armpits. As they say, follow the money.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Americans have had a serious drug habit. Washington
has made that habit illegal, and thus for those who service our
demand the profits are enormous. Some Colombians, from cartel chiefs
to peasants in the fields growing coca, have benefited in differing
degrees from this trade. But almost all Colombians have suffered the
consequences: widespread murder, kidnapping, displaced people,
unemployment, massive corruption and the destruction of already shaky
democratic institutions.</TE>
<TE>   The only real, long-overdue response to this situation is some
form of drug legalization to remove the massive profits. But since
Washington politicians don't seem to have the wisdom or courage to do
that, and doing so would require substantial readjustments worldwide,
we must now settle for confronting the symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Polls indicate that a majority of Colombians would like U.S.
troops to come in and take care of the guerrillas. These frustrated
and desperate Colombians seriously underestimate the problem. But the
vast majority of U.S. leaders are equally simplistic or dishonest in
their appraisals. They have heretofore refused to see that the drug
war and the civil war in Colombia are hopelessly intertwined and that
we cannot dump more than $1 billion of military aid in two years
exclusively into fighting drugs, as we have tried to do. That is
futile and counterproductive.</TE>
<TE>   Washington must support Uribe in his plan to double the size of
the Colombian army to deal decisively with guerrillas. And a greater
emphasis must be placed on infiltrating their forces and killing
their leaders.</TE>
<TE>   But that is the relatively easy part. We must also support Uribe
in carrying out a far more comprehensive, integrated plan that will
deal with a wide range of political and social issues, from
strengthening the justice system to weeding out pervasive corruption.
This aspect must be taken very seriously and funded--unlike the
broad, unfunded proposals in former President Pastrana's Plan
Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has taken a few steps in the right direction. Some
military aid can now be used against guerrillas or right-wing
paramilitaries. The instability in Colombia is increasingly seen as
part of a regional problem. There is some support for economic
policies that will benefit Andean countries, from the Andean Trade
Preference Act to restructuring foreign debt. There is some hope that
recent FARC terrorism will get the even more naive or dishonest
European Union to face realities in Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist bombs were a message to Americans as much as
Colombians. Washington politicians and democratic leaders worldwide
must finally face the realities of the terrorist challenge to
Colombia's democratic government and institutions.</TE>
<TE>   The problem will assuredly get worse, in Colombia and the entire
region, if we do not respond seriously and maintain our support.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Hard Line Trips Up the Reformers in Iran</HD>
<DH>Tough talk aids reactionaries and stymies change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY TAKEYH</AU>
<BD>Ray Takeyh is a fellow in international security
studies at Yale University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a reversal of a long-standing U.S. approach, President Bush has
essentially given up on Iran's reform movement and on the prospects
for gradual moderation of Iran's Islamic system. The administration
is appealing directly to the Iranian people to actively change their
government. Borrowing a page from President Reagan's "evil empire"
strategy, the Bush team hopes to subvert the "axis of evil" by
supporting dissidents against the regime.</LD>
<LD>   The only problem with this approach is that it is likely to
further undermine Iran's already halting democratic transition and
further strengthen reactionary forces.</LD>
<LD>   Evidence of this policy shift was contained in a July 12 statement
released by Bush, offering unsolicited support to student protesters.
The president castigated the "members of the ruling regime and their
families" for obstructing "reform while reaping unfair benefits."</LD>
<TE>   In more explicit language, Zalmay Khalilzad, senior national
security official, similarly noted, "U.S. policy is to support the
Iranian people in their quest to decide their own destiny."</TE>
<TE>   Although both of these statements seem innocuous--even
inspirational--they display a dangerous naivete about Iran's
political scene. The statements were released only days after
thousands of students defied a government ban and marched to
commemorate the July 1999 incidents in which student protests were
ended by an unprecedented crackdown. Even more provocative was the
resignation of a prominent reformist cleric, who quit his post on the
eve of this anniversary with a blistering critique of Iran's
political situation.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of assertiveness from Iran's streets and its seminaries
is rare and potentially powerful, and the confluence briefly put
Iranian politics in flux.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, Bush's well-intentioned words quickly swung the momentum
back to the hard-liners and made the plight of the student protesters
much more precarious. The hard-liners were quick to take advantage of
Bush's denunciation, calling for national unity against foreign
intervention in Iran's internal affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Under the pretext of apprehending the "fifth column," they quickly
shuttered one of the last remaining reform newspapers, Nowruz, and
banned one of Iran's most venerable liberal parties, the Freedom
Movement.</TE>
<TE>   The frustrated reformers whom the president is seeking to appeal
to were united in their disapproval of his stratagem.</TE>
<TE>   The reformers Bush hoped to liberate from the clutches of the
theocracy were only further repressed by his ill-advised conduct.
Even if it hadn't prompted a backlash, it is unclear that the new
policy offers quite the rewards that its proponents seem to believe.</TE>
<TE>   Iranians remain intensely suspicious of external influence, and
while the disproportionately young population may not remember the
1979 revolution, they all revere the memory of Prime Minister
Mohammed Mossadegh, toppled by a U.S.-sponsored coup in 1953. As a
result, Iranians are far less likely to be guided by U.S. direction
on how to fix their current political predicament than their
generally pro-American, liberal and globalized attitudes may suggest.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, they may well resent the deleterious effect of U.S.
sanctions and the stigma of Bush's branding their country part of an
"axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   The Islamic Republic of Iran is not the Soviet Union, where there
existed a clear demarcation between dissidents and the regime. In
Iran, the reformers have penetrated key governing institutions and
are struggling to assert control over others.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to aid the cause of reform in Iran is for Washington
to temper its rhetoric and relax its economic sanctions. By gradually
integrating Iran into the global economy, the U.S. can assist the
reformers in rehabilitating the economy and consolidating their power
base.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, such a policy can best marginalize the
hard-liners who require international tension and conflict with the
"Great Satan" to deflect attention from their poor record of
governance.</TE>
<TE>   Iran today is a state undergoing its most acute crisis since the
Islamic revolution. Despite chaos and the looming shadow of violence,
the old order will change; coercion or cosmetic reforms cannot stop
the transformation. Given its failure to understand the complexities
and nuances of Iran's politics, the best thing for the Bush
administration is to do nothing. At least that policy has the benefit
of doing no harm.</TE>

<LD>If there was anything to take comfort in after the kidnapping and
murder of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion, it was the public's eagerness
to help find the killer. A wealth of tips poured in, including some
that led to a quick arrest.</LD>
<LD>   But what if the public had been able to produce a happier ending
to the story? What if a person alerted by immediate television or
radio coverage had seen the car, the suspect and the child in that
frantic window of time between the kidnapping and the murder?</LD>
<LD>   That's the thinking behind alert systems sprinkled throughout the
nation. Law enforcement sends out an alert about a youngster believed
to be in immediate danger. The broadcast media breaks into regular
programming to put out the word.</LD>
<TE>   California has a few local child alert systems, including a pilot
program in Orange County. Gov. Gray Davis, stung by accusations that
he had dragged his heels, started up an interim statewide system in
which Caltrans flashes freeway-sign messages to alert motorists. He
also is pushing for quick implementation of AB 415, which would
create a long-term alert program.</TE>
<TE>   Kidnapping alerts are a noble idea. Proponents credit them with
saving 17 children nationwide since the mid-1990s. But the systems
must be carefully set up, and that hasn't always been the case.
Too-frequent alerts lead to public apathy. In some states, little was
done to bring broadcast stations on board, police were poorly trained
or alerts went out over too small an area. Without thorough planning,
the results can be disappointing. Orange County found that out the
hard way in Samantha's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff's office sent out the alert to a media wire service
less than half an hour after the 6:45 p.m. kidnapping. But only a few
stations broadcast the news. Some had missed the wire-service
advisory. Staff members at one station didn't realize they were being
asked to break into programming. At another they had never heard of
the alert system.</TE>
<TE>   The state's new interim system, credited with helping find two
teenage girls abducted last week in the Antelope Valley, actually
lagged TV and radio stations that began broadcasting news of the
kidnapping hours before the state put out its alert.</TE>
<TE>   The state Office of Emergency Services, which would run the
program, must design its system carefully to avoid these mistakes.
That means better training for police agencies and clearer
communication with the media. To avoid false alarms, alerts must meet
a strict criterion--a clear and immediate danger to a child. Because
alerts will (everyone hopes) be rare, drills are needed to keep
police agencies and the media up to speed.</TE>
<TE>   A horrified and sympathetic public is clearly ready to help save
children. It just needs to get the word.</TE>

<LD>Two and a half million corpses testify to the four bloody years of
war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which might finally end
with a South Africa-brokered peace agreement. It was a lot like other
wars in Africa, only bigger, involving many ethnic groups,
complicated geopolitical maneuvering and gun-toting vigilantes.</LD>
<LD>   Few Americans know much about the vast Central African nation.
There was little public outcry over the millions of deaths. The
United States did, however, facilitate dialogue between the bitter
enemies and pressure all sides for peace.</LD>
<LD>   In a sense, the United States is finally starting to make up for
some of its Cold War misdeeds.</LD>
<TE>   In a recent article in the Washington Post, Stephen Weissman,
staff director of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Africa from 1986 to
1991, asserts persuasively that the United States was directly
complicit in the overthrow of Patrice Lumumba, the only
democratically elected leader ever in the Congo, during the
Eisenhower administration. In the name of its battle against
communism, the CIA installed a friendly military dictator, Mobutu
Sese Seko, who went on to rape the country's rich mineral endowments
in a notorious kleptocracy.</TE>
<TE>   But with Mobutu gone and a young Joseph Kabila in charge, Congo
may have a chance to begin recovering, with foreign help.</TE>
<TE>   Sending large sums of aid to a shaky and as yet undemocratic
government is not an ideal option. Rather, the United States and
other Western nations (like former colonial power Belgium) should
expand contributions to nongovernmental organizations operating in
Africa's war-battered Great Lakes region to provide food, medical
care and other basic necessities.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also should help the United Nations bolster its funds to
the peacekeeping force in the region, and the U.N. should consider
granting its peacekeepers Chapter 7 status, allowing them to actively
disarm marauding gunmen in the east of the country and protect the
noncombatant population, although this would entail some risk to the
U.N. forces.</TE>
<TE>   The developed world has the best opportunity in decades to advance
the ideals of democracy and civil society in some of Africa's most
volatile areas, as historic peace negotiations conclude in Sudan,
Congo, Burundi and Angola and the New Partnership for Africa's
Development, passed by the nascent African Union last month, promotes
peace, democracy and human rights in exchange for foreign aid.</TE>
<TE>   Britain's director of international aid already is asking other
nations for more foreign assistance for the region. Other Western
nations, especially France, Belgium, Germany and other colonial
powers that looted parts of Africa, should participate in whatever
way they can in rebuilding what decades of imperialism, dictatorship
and war destroyed.</TE>

<LD>A county commission's brave vote Thursday to work toward free
preschool for every child whose parents desire that is like one of
those you-finish-the-story fairy tales. We know the beginning, but
the ending is up for grabs. Will the knight slay the dragon or be
eaten? Will the lost children find their way home through the woods
or end up in the witch's oven?</LD>
<LD>   So it is with the decision by Los Angeles County's Proposition 10
Commission--created after voters approved a 50-cent-per-pack hike in
the tobacco tax in 1998--to commit $100 million to expanding existing
preschools and child-care centers for 3- and 4-year-olds and helping
underwrite new ones. A solid preschool education gives children a leg
up on learning to read and makes them more likely to graduate from
high school and go to college. For the estimated 100,000 local
children whose families are too poor to afford preschool, a happy
ending will depend on the commission's smart planning and insistence
that every penny be accounted for--and used wisely.</LD>
<TE>   During the next six months, as the commission decides exactly how
to spend this money, it should build on the knowledge and long
experience of the leading institutions. Crystal Stairs and Children's
Institute International are two that have helped design and expand
preschool programs locally. On a far broader scale, the U.S.
military, with a push from Congress, runs a worldwide network of
first-rate preschools and care centers for children whose parents are
in uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Planners also must hold local groups and institutions accountable
for the Prop. 10 money they may ultimately receive. If they don't,
the commissioners may find themselves boiled in the caldron of public
opinion. And they must be creative, leveraging available state and
federal dollars for Headstart and welfare-to-work training to prepare
more teachers and serve more children.</TE>
<TE>   Voters earmarked the tobacco tax for activities that would improve
the health and development of children through age 5. It generates
$700 million a year--although revenue will decline as the number of
smokers falls off--that is distributed among California's 58 counties
based on birthrates.</TE>
<TE>   The universal preschool initiative represents the second major
initiative from the local Proposition 10 Commission. Last month, the
group voted to put aside $100 million to provide health insurance for
babies and preschoolers from low-income families over the next five
years.</TE>
<TE>   The commission is smart to focus on getting young children ready
to learn and keeping them healthy. Think of this tobacco money as
fairy dust that could make poor parents' dreams for their children
come true.</TE>

<HD>Protestant Militant's Son Hurt in Shooting Attack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELFAST, Northern Ireland</DL>
<LD>The teenage son of Northern Ireland's most notorious Protestant
extremist was shot in both legs in a punishment-style attack, police
said Thursday, in a sign of growing tensions within the Belfast
paramilitary underworld.</LD>
<LD>   Jonathan Adair, 17, was attacked late Wednesday in West Belfast's
Lower Shankill district, the stronghold of his father, Johnny "Mad
Dog" Adair, who commands the Lower Shankill unit of the outlawed
Ulster Defense Assn., which has long attacked nearby Roman Catholic
districts and runs illegal rackets.</LD>
<LD>   Police trying to reach the wounded youth were initially blocked by
a mob. He was later treated at a hospital and released.</LD>
<TE>   The motive for the attack was unclear. Police said it was carried
out by either Adair's UDA or the smaller, rival Ulster Volunteer
Force. Both groups mete out potentially crippling shootings and
beatings in the toughest Protestant districts to enforce control of
competing criminal enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   John White, a UDA veteran and friend of the Adair family, said he
thought the UDA was probably responsible, given the site of the
shooting--an area of Lower Shankill dominated by UDA murals.</TE>
<TE>   He said he didn't know why the teenager would be targeted by his
own side, nor whether the elder Adair knew that any punishment was
planned.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Adair is a divisive figure, even within the UDA. Some
UDA members consider him dangerously bellicose and outspoken.</TE>

<HD>13 Slain Had Fled Prison, Afghans Say</HD>
<DH>Asia: The jailbreak and a foiled July attack fuel concerns
about Al Qaeda stepping up operations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Thirteen gunmen killed in a shootout on the southern edge of this
capital were Al Qaeda members who had just broken out of prison,
apparently with the help of associates, the Afghan government said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The jailbreak Wednesday, coupled with intelligence officials'
renewed insistence that an attempted car bombing foiled last month
was an Al Qaeda operation targeting Afghan President Hamid Karzai,
raised concerns that the terrorist organization might be stepping up
operations in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   With skirmishes increasingly rare in recent months, U.S. officials
had been saying privately that it had become more difficult to engage
Al Qaeda forces.</LD>
<TE>   Initial reports on Wednesday's shootout were sketchy, with the
Afghan government taking a day to identify the escapees as members of
Osama bin Laden's terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   The prisoners--12 Pakistanis and a Kyrgyz--broke through a jail
window and were given weapons, either inside or outside the jail.
Foreign Minister Abdullah, who like many Afghans goes by one name,
said the escapees were quickly surrounded by militia and security
forces and slain after refusing to surrender. Three killed themselves
with hand grenades, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were all armed, some with grenades," Abdullah said, adding
that how and when the escapees received the weapons were unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The minister said "hundreds" of Al Qaeda operatives remain in
Afghan jails.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Ministry spokesman Omar Samad said the escape shows that
"we are dealing with the most dangerous kinds of humans on Earth who
have no qualms about killing or being killed."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, the Afghan government showed reporters the
late-model Toyota station wagon that it said was packed with about
900 pounds of explosives hidden in seat cushions, side panels and the
chassis.</TE>
<TE>   The driver was arrested July 29 about a mile from the presidential
palace in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   The driver confessed to the suicide plot, said National Security
Directorate official Amrullah Saleh. The police refused to give the
suspect's name or nationality. He was briefly put on display
Thursday, although reporters were not allowed to question him.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the suspect had confessed to being a member of Al
Qaeda, Saleh answered: "Who else could he be? He believes he was on a
holy mission, that by doing it he would have gone directly into
heaven."</TE>
<TE>   Typical of the suspicions that ripple through this tense and
war-ravaged city, the belief was expressed in some circles that the
bombing plot was merely a ruse manufactured by the government to
demonstrate an ability to protect the interim president and other
officials. That ability was left in doubt with the July 6
assassination of Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir and the subsequent
decision by Karzai to replace his presidential bodyguards with U.S.
troops.</TE>
<TE>   If it was a ruse, the alleged crime vehicle displayed at a
National Security Directorate compound was a convincing one. The
plotters appeared to have gone to great lengths to avoid detection,
with plastic explosives resembling cables embedded in the doors and
beneath the seating.</TE>
<TE>   Government technical advisor Fayd Mohammed said the car bomb had
enough explosives to damage buildings more than 500 yards away. The
bomb, wired to batteries, had no timer or remote control and thus
"the plot was suicidal," said Saleh, the directorate official.</TE>
<TE>   Suspicion about the veracity of the car-bomb plot has been fueled
by a lack of details surrounding the suspect's capture. In addition,
officials from foreign governments have not examined the car. U.S.
Embassy officials here refused to comment on the case.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan government's weak control over areas outside Kabul and
the lack of any apparent successor to Karzai make keeping him
protected that much more important in assuring a stable future for
Afghanistan, observers have said.</TE>

<LD>Police in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, said they had found the body
of a Russian colonel who had been missing since late July.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Igor Zaitsev, an officer with Russia's general staff
in the Caucasus, was identified by relatives after it was found on
the outskirts of Tbilisi, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   A forensic expert said Zaitsev was hit on the head with a heavy
object. Shortly after the 52-year-old officer disappeared July 27,
Russian media reported that he could have been kidnapped by Chechen
rebels hoping to exchange him for prisoners taken by Russian troops
during operations in the guerrillas' separatist republic.</LD>

Japan's House of Representatives in a surprise announcement two weeks
after she gave testimony resulting from allegations of misuse of
public money. The leader of the House, the lower chamber of
parliament, must approve the decision before Tanaka's resignation
becomes formal.</LD>
<LD>   She went before parliament last month and denied wrongdoing, and
she has not been charged.</LD>

<HD>Excerpts From Iraqi President's Address</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Excerpts from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's speech Thursday, the
anniversary of the end of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, as provided by
the official Iraqi News Agency:</LD>
<LD>   One of the lessons of recent and distant history is that all
empires and bearers of the coffin of evil, whenever they mobilized
their evil against the Arab nation, or against the Muslim world, they
were themselves buried in their own coffin, with their sick dreams
and their arrogance and greed, under Arab and Islamic soil; or they
returned to die on the land from which they had proceeded to
perpetrate aggression.</LD>
<LD>   This has been the case with all empires preceding our present
time. If this is what history tells us about its judgment on all
times and eras of the past without exception, can we then describe
those who are trying to ignore history now except in the words which
no wise or prudent person would wish to be described with? This is
the inevitable outcome awaiting all those who try to aggress against
Arabs and Muslims. If anyone wants to learn from history, anyone with
greed and arrogance combined in himself, he ought to remember this
fact and think again.</LD>
<TE>   Otherwise, he will end up in the dustbin of history, as 20th
century politicians say. We always stood, and continue to stand, to
learn from all such lessons, whenever the horns of aggression loomed
large against us.</TE>
<TE>   We never faced, nor will face, any aggression relying basically on
our force of arms, or our muscles and the muscles of our people, but
rather on the strength of our faith, in the belief that Allah always
helps the faithful and their just cause to prevail over injustice....</TE>
<TE>   The forces of evil will carry their coffins on their backs, to die
in disgraceful failure, taking their schemes back with them, or to
dig their own graves, after they bring death to themselves on every
Arab or Muslim soil against which they perpetrate aggression,
including Iraq, the land of jihad and the banner.</TE>
<TE>   We say this to refute the grumbling and sibilation of those
bragging their power, governed by the devil, their master in every
evil act and crime which they perpetrate ... But if they wanted peace
and security for themselves and their people, then this is not the
course to take.</TE>
<TE>   ... The right course is of respect to the security and rights of
others, through dealing with others in peace and establishing the
obligations required by way of equitable dialogue and on the basis of
international law and international covenants. The right way is that
the Security Council should reply to the questions raised by Iraq,
and should honor its obligations under its own resolutions.</TE>

<HD>In Fiery Speech, Hussein Warns Against Attack</HD>
<DH>Iraq: The Bush administration dismisses the national
address as 'bluster from a dictator,' while analysts say its tone
hints at a new fear of U.S. aggression.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a defiant speech to his nation, President Saddam Hussein warned
Thursday that the United States and any other nations that attempted
to attack Iraq would face "disgraceful" military failure and a
massive loss of life that would force them to "carry their coffins on
their backs."</LD>
<LD>   The Iraqi leader's televised address--an appeal to audiences both
at home and abroad--was his first public response to the recent
growing threat of military confrontation with the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "All empires and bearers of the coffin of evil, whenever they
mobilized their evil against the Arab world or against the Muslim
world, they were themselves buried in their own coffin, with their
sick dreams and their arrogance and greed," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration dismissed the speech as insignificant,
with State Department spokesman Philip T. Reeker calling it "bluster
from an internationally isolated dictator, demonstrative yet again
that his regime shows no intention to live up to its obligations
under U.N. Security Council resolutions."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's words offered insight into the current mood in Baghdad.
Despite the tough talk, analysts said, the speech hinted at a new
fear within Iraq's leadership about U.S. plans to oust the regime, as
the war of nerves between the two nations heats up.</TE>
<TE>   The speech, delivered on the anniversary marking the end of the
1980-88 war between Iraq and Iran, resonated at three levels,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   It sought first to evoke what is viewed in Baghdad as an Iraqi
victory during the grueling 1980s war, playing particularly to the
Iraqi military--arguably the most important element of society in
determining whether Hussein can survive a foreign onslaught.</TE>
<TE>   Clad in a suit instead of his usual general's uniform, Hussein
stressed the survival of his regime through assorted challenges. He
boasted that the call to stand up to any aggressor was backed "by
everyone confronting the enemies with a gun, a cannon, on a tank, in
a plane, or on a naval boat, by millions of men among our troops."</TE>
<TE>   But, in fact, the military is the big question mark, and his
concern about its loyalty is now evident.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam has been briefed on the content of plans leaked to the
press, many of which say explicitly that the military and the tribes
will defect and come over to support the United States," said Judith
Yaphe, a former intelligence analyst who is now a senior fellow at
the National Defense University in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The speech played to fierce Iraqi nationalism, with Hussein noting
that Iraqis always stood together whenever "the horns of aggression
loomed large against us."</TE>
<TE>   His remarks were directed to the heart of U.S. strategy in the
run-up to a confrontation, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "American strategy is to separate Saddam from the Iraqi people, to
show the people that they can support Iraq without supporting Saddam.
Saddam knows that's his weakness, so to the extent he can wrap
himself in the Iraqi flag and say, 'An attack on me is an attack on
all of you,' that is now his defense," said Charles A. Duelfer,
former U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq and a current visiting scholar
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington
public policy center.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the speech was aimed at the Arab and Muslim
worlds--reflecting their historical encounters with the West--in an
attempt to prevent them from succumbing to U.S. pressure to provide
assistance in confronting Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Ignominious defeat "is the inevitable outcome awaiting all those
who try to aggress against Arabs and Muslims," Hussein said. "If
anyone wants to learn from history, he ought to remember this fact
and think again. Otherwise he will end up in the dustbin."</TE>
<TE>   Frequently invoking the Muslim faith, the Iraqi leader said that
belief in God always helped the faithful "to prevail over injustice."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein did not give this speech on Aug. 2, the anniversary of his
1990 invasion of Kuwait, though he has chosen that date for remarks
in the past. That war deeply divided the Arab world, with countries
such as Egypt and Syria dispatching troops to force an Iraqi
withdrawal. Instead, he picked the anniversary of a war against Iran,
a non-Arab country that many Arab nations fear.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to avoid the ugly issue of Kuwait, which might remind
everyone that's what started it all," Yaphe said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Hussein attempted in his speech to divide the U.S. from
the rest of the world. While he never specifically mentioned the
United States, he made obvious references to "the enemy" and "the
forces of evil," the latter a play on President Bush's description of
Iraq as a member of an "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein called on all Iraqis, Arabs and the Islamic faithful
worldwide to confront "the enemy who wants to harm Iraq, with total
disregard for God and man, despite all the resilience and resolve
with which the Iraqi people have faced this enemy." And he described
the "right course" as "dealing with others in peace--and equitable
dialogue."</TE>
<TE>   The White House reacted to Hussein's speech by calling for greater
compliance with the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   "The Iraqi government needs to comply with the responsibilities it
agreed to at the end of the Gulf War" in 1991, spokesman Scott
McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   Those include allowing international inspectors to determine
whether Iraq is creating chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.
Iraq has barred the inspectors since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein's speech came on the eve of talks between the Bush
administration and several Iraqi opposition groups to discuss the
possible ouster of the Iraqi leader and the steps that would be
required to build a new, democratic government.</TE>

<HD>Attackers Kill 3 at Pakistan Christian Church</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Three assailants hurled grenades today at people leaving a church
inside a Christian hospital near Islamabad, killing three nurses in
the second attack against Christian or Western interests in Pakistan
in less than a week.</LD>
<LD>   One of the attackers also died in the assault at the hospital in
Taxila, about 25 miles west of Islamabad, the capital, said Taxila
police inspector Fatha Khan.</LD>
<LD>   Khan did not identify the attackers.</LD>
<TE>   Hospital officials said three nurses, all Pakistani, died in the
attack and that 15 others were injured. They did not describe the
nature or seriousness of the injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Clement Bakhshi, an accounts officer at the hospital, said, "Three
of our nurses have expired."</TE>
<TE>   Details about the attack were not entirely, clear, however.</TE>
<TE>   A police source in Taxila said of the attackers, "One was killed
and two fled, and the explosives were tied to the body of the one who
died."</TE>
<TE>   It was the latest in a series of assaults targeting Christian
institutions or foreigners in Pakistan since the military government
of President Pervez Musharraf incensed militant Muslim groups by
siding with the U.S.-led war on terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The incident came just four days after six Pakistanis were shot
dead in an attack on the Murree Christian School for foreign students
in the town of Jhika Gali.</TE>
<TE>   Three men suspected in that attack blew themselves up Tuesday
after they were challenged at a checkpoint, a police official said.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani officials said the raid on the school appeared to be
aimed at the foreign community rather than at a minority faith in
Muslim-majority Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The school has been closed until at least Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In March, five people, including the wife and daughter of an
American diplomat, died in a grenade attack on a church in Islamabad.</TE>

<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>Torrential rains in Europe inundated Austrian villages Thursday,
swept away campers on Russia's Black Sea coast, flooded London's
subway system and battered vineyards and olive groves in northern
Italy. At least five people were killed in some of the continent's
worst flooding in decades.</LD>
<LD>   On the shores of the Black Sea, two bodies of flood victims were
found in the Russian village of Abrau-Dyurso, said Viktor Beltsov, a
spokesman for Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry. At least 100
people were missing, but there were no details on their situation.</LD>
<LD>   Rising waters submerged camps and resorts near the port of
Novorossiysk, sweeping away seaside campers, Beltsov said. He did not
know how many people were missing, but he said 10 were picked out of
the water alive.</LD>
<TE>   Seven villages in the area were flooded, forcing evacuation of at

<HD>Elections Give Opposition Control of South Korea Assembly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>South Korea's conservative opposition party won control of the
National Assembly on Thursday in elections that are expected to
paralyze President Kim Dae Jung in his last months in office and
undermine the chances of the candidate he favors in the upcoming
presidential vote.</LD>
<LD>   In an effort to salvage his flagging presidency, Kim appointed
Chang Dae Hwan, the U.S.-educated publisher of South Korea's largest
economic daily, to the largely ceremonial post of prime minister. His
previous nominee, Chang Sang, who would have been the country's first
female prime minister, was rejected after the assembly raised
questions about misleading claims on her resume and about her
business dealings.</LD>
<LD>   The elections for 13 vacant assembly seats were a minor event on
the busy political calendar in South Korea this year and attracted
scant voter interest, but the results could weigh heavily on the
country. By winning 11 of the 13 races, the opposition Grand National
Party now controls 139 out of 273 seats in the assembly.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the first time the opposition has controlled a stable
majority of the parliament. They can do what they want. They can even
impeach the new president," said political scientist Hahm Sung Deuk
of Korea University. "This will be in effect a co-presidency."</TE>
<TE>   The election results were widely seen as a slap in the face to
Kim. The 77-year-old president, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his
diplomacy with North Korea, has been tarnished by political
corruption scandals involving his family and by the disappointing
results of his negotiations with the North.</TE>
<TE>   The results could also trigger a revolt in the ruling Millennium
Democratic Party, which Kim founded. Some party members believe that
presidential candidate Roh Mu Hyun is not strong enough to carry the
party out of its slump and should be replaced before the Dec. 19
presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   There also has been talk about the creation of a new party.</TE>
<TE>   One possible candidate, either in the ruling party or a new one,
is Chung Mong Jun, an independent lawmaker who heads the Korean
soccer association and whose popularity has soared.</TE>
<TE>   Polls released Thursday night for the first time showed Chung
emerging as the front-runner in a three-way race with Roh and
opposition leader Lee Hoi Chang. The poll by South Korea's SBS
television also showed Chung beating Lee by a narrow margin in a
two-way race. Chung's father founded the Hyundai conglomerate.</TE>
<TE>   But political pundits cautioned that the South Korean electorate
has a tendency to become quickly infatuated with fresh, new faces and
then sour on them with equal alacrity. Indeed, ruling party candidate
Roh, a human rights lawyer with a reputation for integrity, took the
political scene by storm earlier this year when he emerged from
relative obscurity to win primary elections for the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting this morning with party members, Roh said he would
agree to a new convention to choose a presidential candidate or even
to the creation of a new party if his colleagues decided to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Turnout in Thursday's elections was among the lowest, with only
29.6% of eligible voters going to the polls. The low turnout was
blamed on the summer vacation season, torrential rains that made it
impossible for some to reach polling places--and disenchantment with
the political process.</TE>
<TE>   Nam Kyung Pil, a spokesman for the Grand National Party, said,
"The current administration resorted to political maneuvering to hide
its mismanagement. But the wise people were not deceived."</TE>

<LD>An American soldier who hit a bound Afghan detainee in the head with
a rifle has received the maximum punishment for the assault,
including a rank reduction, a military spokesman said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The soldier, from the 82nd Airborne Division, was reduced two
grades in rank from private first class to private E1, the lowest
rank in the Army, said Maj. Gary Tallman at the Bagram air base, the
U.S. military headquarters in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   He also must forfeit half a month's salary for two months, perform
extra duty and face restrictions for two months, Tallman said. The
soldier involved in the June 22 incident was not identified, under

<HD>Stem Cell Implants Boost Circulation, Study Finds</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Injecting patients' own stem cells into their leg muscles could
create new blood vessels, eliminating pain from poor circulation and
helping to prevent gangrene or amputations, new research indicates.</LD>
<LD>   The study, described in the medical journal the Lancet, is the
first demonstration that implanting stem cells into humans can result
in new blood vessel networks, a process called angiogenesis.</LD>
<LD>   Experts say the findings offer hope to millions of people who
suffer pain in their limbs because of clogged arteries but can't
undergo surgery for the condition.</LD>
<TE>   Controlling blood vessel growth is an emerging field of medicine.
In the case of cancer, which spreads by sprouting its own blood
vessel network, scientists are testing drugs to thwart angiogenesis.</TE>
<TE>   But when parts of the body are starved of oxygen because blood
vessels supplying them are blocked, doctors want to boost blood
vessel growth.</TE>
<TE>   The main focus of research is on the heart and limbs, and study of
the brain is being planned. Heart attacks, limb amputations and
strokes can result from severe circulation problems, as can sores
that fail to heal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is truly a landmark paper because of its use of stem cells
to induce angiogenesis," said Dr. William W. Li, president and
medical director of the Boston-based Angiogenesis Foundation, who was
not involved in the research.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a brand-new approach to treating limbs starved of blood
supply," Li said.</TE>
<TE>   One question that remains is whether the stem cells actually
became blood vessel cells or whether they released growth factors
that prompted other cells to construct new vessels.</TE>
<TE>   The study was done by scientists at three Japanese universities:
Kansai Medical University in Osaka, Kurume University School of
Medicine in Kurume and Jichi Medical School in Tochigi.</TE>
<TE>   It involved 45 people with severe blood circulation problems in
their legs. About half had already had a bypass operation in their
legs, nearly half had gangrene, and 69% had diabetes. Many had sores
that wouldn't heal, suffered pain in their legs even when sitting and
were not candidates for surgery or other artery-widening techniques.</TE>
<TE>   The legs that received the stem cells had more improvement than
the others on a test comparing blood pressure. Similar results were
seen in a second circulation test that measured differences in oxygen
inside and outside tissues.</TE>
<TE>   After their legs were injected with stem cells, 16 of the 20
people in the main study no longer experienced pain while sitting
down.</TE>
<TE>   X-rays before and after the implantation showed increased blood
vessel networks in 27 of the 45 stem cell recipients.</TE>

<HD>Colombia Launches Informant Plan</HD>
<DH>Latin America: New president rushes to implement citizen
watchdog program, which is expected to face a stern test from rebels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>A day after guerrillas attacked in the vicinity of his inauguration,
President Alvaro Uribe responded Thursday by speeding up the rollout
of a controversial program designed to turn 1 million people into
government informants.</LD>
<LD>   But there were worrisome signs that the Colombian leader's plan
for using citizens to plug holes in the state intelligence network
would face challenges from an increasingly sophisticated rebel force
that is gaining expertise in urban warfare.</LD>
<LD>   Showing the resolve that has often marked his political career,
Uribe made no mention of the mortar barrage that fell on this capital
Wednesday, killing 19 people and wounding 60.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, he showed up as planned Thursday morning in Valledupar, a
provincial capital, to inaugurate the citizen police program. He then
made a surprise announcement that he would meet with Bogota's mayor
to plan the enrollment of about 2,000 more members to help safeguard
this city.</TE>
<TE>   The exact nature of the citizen watchdog program, which Uribe
calls Plan Meteor, remained unclear Thursday. Some of the watchdogs
would provide "army support" or "police support" and, he suggested,
could be armed. Others would simply be citizens who provide
information to local authorities. All would be given money for their
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups have sharply criticized the plan, fearing that
the informants would become targets for guerrilla attacks and that
armed civilians could quickly spin out of control and form
paramilitary groups, as they have in the past.</TE>
<TE>   One Colombian analyst noted that similar problems arose with
private armed groups in the 1940s and 1950s, contributing to a period
called La Violencia, a bloody civil uprising in which about 200,000
people were killed. "Colombian history, it would seem, doesn't move
in a progressive line but a vicious circle: We always return to our
past mistakes, not to correct them but to perfect them," wrote Oscar
Collazos, a leading columnist.</TE>
<TE>   But Uribe dismissed such concerns while divulging few details
about the program or its participants.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to talk about problems," he told reporters. "We
have to move forward."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick, leading a delegation
that attended Uribe's inauguration, did not specifically address the
citizen police groups. But he said Thursday that he had been
impressed by Uribe's plan to convince Colombians that the guerrillas
must be defeated.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has held out the promise of more aid but has asked that
Colombians first do more themselves, such as raising taxes to support
more troops.</TE>
<TE>   "What he's trying to do is get everybody in Colombia to recognize
that they have a stake in beating these people," Zoellick said. The
rebels "are murderers. They're undermining the economy."</TE>
<TE>   But if Wednesday's attacks are any measure, Uribe's program will
be difficult to implement as well as uncertain of success.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said that urban guerrillas belonging to the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia launched mortar attacks from
two sites Wednesday, apparently using technology gained from the
Irish Republican Army.</TE>
<TE>   Three alleged IRA members were captured last year upon leaving a
rebel enclave in southern Colombia. They were charged with teaching
explosive techniques to the rebels. The men deny the charge. The
trial is scheduled this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Both launch sites Wednesday were private homes in middle- to
upper-class neighborhoods, places with no inclination toward the
guerrillas' class struggle rhetoric. In both cases, the attacks
apparently were planned for months without anyone noticing or caring
what was going on.</TE>
<TE>   The first round of mortar fire came about 11 a.m., launched from a
home in wealthy northern Bogota. Neighbors told police that two women
lived at the site. At least 11 shells were fired, apparently aimed at
a military school. Two hit a golf course. The rest fell on homes and
in streets, wounding 13.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood from which the mortar shells were fired toward
the presidential palace later in the day is firmly middle class.
Three-story brick row houses stretch down a potholed street. Small
restaurants and fix-it shops line a commercial district. Retirees,
office workers and students hurry across the sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   The elderly man, woman and young man who lived in the home
attracted little notice when they moved in about two months ago. They
kept regular hours, parked their car in the garage and said little
more than hello to other neighbors. Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus said
the threesome had paid six months' rent in advance.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing that attracted suspicion was that shortly after
moving in, they replaced the apartment's curtains with dark ones that
allowed no glimpse inside.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors occasionally heard tapping on the walls but thought
nothing of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured they were putting up paintings or something," said a
next-door neighbor who did not want her name used for fear of
reprisals. "They seemed normal."</TE>
<TE>   The tapping, however, was apparently a sign of deadly work behind
the dark curtains. In a covered patio behind the house, the rebels
installed at least 16 homemade firing tubes that police said were
made from pipes used in oil exploration. They then wired the tubes,
which were packed with gunpowder, to be detonated by remote control
with a car battery and a radio signal.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Administrative Security Department, the
Colombian version of the FBI, said the three fled before the shells
were fired just before 3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   At least four of the shells fired, with two striking the
presidential palace, located only a hundred yards from the
congressional building where Uribe was taking the oath of office.
Four presidential guards were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The other two shells went astray, with one striking near a
homeless shelter in one of Bogota's poorest neighborhoods and killing
15. Three girls, ages 5, 3 and 1, as well as the mother of the
5-year-old, were killed when the second misfired round hit an
apartment near the palace.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear why the other mortars did not go off.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the home once occupied by the threesome was a
shattered shell. The shockwaves from the blasts had blown all the
windows out, as well as windows in most of the surrounding homes. A
deep hole could be seen in the back patio, where the mortars had
blasted through the ceramic roof, leaving behind only shards.</TE>
<TE>   Several neighbors said that there had been no suspicious signs
from the group living in the home. And they expressed doubt that they
could have done a better job of being informants.</TE>
<TE>   "What am I going to do, be nosy and look into my neighbor's yard?"
asked one man who lived nearby. "That's just going to get me in
trouble."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration held high-level talks with Palestinian
leaders Thursday to try to end the impasse in the Mideast peace
process, with the primary focus on security issues.</LD>
<LD>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell described the talks as "a good
exchange" and said President Bush intended to prod both the
Palestinians and the Israelis toward renewed negotiations, despite
recent setbacks and escalating violence.</LD>
<LD>   "I reaffirmed to the ministers that the president is committed to
doing everything possible to find a way forward, recognizing the
difficulties that exist and condemning the violence that afflicts the
region and occasionally thwarts our ability to move forward," Powell
said after meeting with the three-man delegation.</LD>
<TE>   "But we will not be deterred. We will continue to move forward."</TE>
<TE>   The discussions at the White House and the State Department
centered on the Palestinians' "new thinking" on restructuring
security forces and on ending the cycle of violence, according to
Palestinian Authority Interior Minister Abdel Razak Yehiyeh.</TE>
<TE>   Yehiyeh outlined plans to streamline the maze of Palestinian
security organizations, including personnel changes in the highest
positions, at a meeting at the Brookings Institution, a centrist
public policy center here.</TE>
<TE>   Yehiyeh said he and others were also trying to reach out to
Palestinian youths, particularly in refugee camps in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip, to prevent them from being lured by the religious
ideology or extremist tactics of the militant groups Hamas and
Islamic Jihad.</TE>
<TE>   But any prospect of building "a new state of mind" would depend on
a decision by Israel to begin withdrawal from occupied lands, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Yehiyeh, a former head of the Palestine Liberation Army, warned
that Israel's current tactics--which he said were based on "reaction
and revenge"--would not stop the suicide bombings and other attacks,
and could backfire.</TE>
<TE>   "The cycle of violence will continue. Using force alone will never
stop violence," the new security chief said.</TE>
<TE>   Yehiyeh called for at least a partial Israeli withdrawal to lift
the siege on the West Bank and give Palestinians room to take steps.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Israelis begin to withdraw, many things will change, and
what now is thought to be difficult will be easy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The delegation, which also includes chief Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat and Economy and Trade Minister Maher Masri, is scheduled
to meet Saturday with CIA Director George J. Tenet to discuss details
of a new security plan.</TE>
<TE>   Both Yehiyeh and Masri have been praised by the State Department
for their efforts to provide new direction and institute needed
reforms.</TE>
<TE>   The focus of talks today will be on the humanitarian plight of
Palestinians after months of living under siege and curfew. Erekat
warned that the situation in the areas controlled by the Palestinian
Authority is nearing catastrophic proportions.</TE>
<TE>   The 3.3 million Palestinians "live in the biggest prison in the
world" and "are on the brink of starvation," he said. Roughly half of
Palestinian children under age 5 face malnutrition, while many women
are anemic, Erekat said at a joint news conference with Powell. A
third of Palestinians live on handouts, Erekat said.</TE>
<TE>   One issue not on the agenda during talks Thursday at the White
House with National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice was Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat, according to U.S. officials. In
his June 24 speech, Bush called for new leadership and major reforms
as preconditions to the creation of a Palestinian state in three
years.</TE>
<TE>   After the first of three days of talks, however, Erekat said the
team had been "fully mandated" by Arafat. "We are not a delegation of
freelancers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a tweak at the Bush administration, Erekat also told reporters
that the Palestinians' new reform efforts were not being undertaken
simply to meet Bush's demands.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to say to the secretary that the Palestinian reform
is Palestinian reform. It's done for Palestinian interests by
Palestinian will, and it's not being dictated by anybody," Erekat
said.</TE>

<HD>Court Rejects Bid to Try 4 in Anti-Chavez Coup; 9 Hurt in
Clashes</HD>

<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Nine people were shot and wounded in violent disturbances in
Venezuela on Thursday after the Supreme Court rejected a proposal to
put on trial four military officers accused in April's uprising
against President Hugo Chavez.</LD>
<LD>   After police clashed with supporters of the populist leader
clamoring against the ruling, at least eight civilians were wounded
by gunfire and a police officer was shot in the leg, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   "They have taken eight people wounded by gunfire to Lidice
Hospital," police commissioner Leobaldo Navas told local radio. Navas
said police defended themselves after coming under gunfire.
Eyewitnesses interviewed by local media said at least seven civilians
were wounded, two seriously, when police opened fire on
demonstrators.</LD>
<TE>   With National Guard troops ringing the building, Supreme Court
magistrates earlier voted for a second time against a trial on
rebellion charges in a case that last week triggered three days of
street clashes.</TE>
<TE>   "They have rejected the proposal ... and once again defeated the
attorney general, who has tried by all means to prove a crime of
rebellion that doesn't exist," Rene Buroz, an attorney for the
accused officers, told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The four high-ranking officers and others accused in the April
11-14 coup remain under investigation and still face possible trial
on other charges. One of the Supreme Court magistrates who rejected
the rebellion trial proposal will make another ruling on the case
within a few days, Buroz said.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Isaias Rodriguez, a close ally of Chavez, wanted to put
the officers on trial, alleging that they had committed military
rebellion by taking part in the short-lived coup.</TE>
<TE>   In central Caracas, thick black smoke from burning tires rose from
streets near the court building as pro-Chavez groups protested
against the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's violence was among the worst since loyal troops
returned Chavez to office. Police fired tear gas and riot pellets to
control pro-Chavez demonstrators after the Supreme Court postponed
the ruling until this week.</TE>

<HD>Emigrants Send a Lifeline to Salvadoran Hometown</HD>
<DH>Americas: Offering more than money, Los Angeles residents
decide to open a factory in the tiny village. The goal is to create
jobs and wealth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARAISO DE OSORIO, El Salvador</DL>
<LD>Latino immigrants in the U.S. have long sent money home to build
health clinics and schools, sewer systems and roads, even cemeteries.</LD>
<LD>   But a group of Los Angeles residents who once lived in this tiny
village perched on a mountain high above the Pacific are launching a
bold new project: They want to build a factory.</LD>
<LD>   The plan is part of a growing trend in how Latino community groups
in the U.S. put to use the money they send home, known as
remittances. Once content to build infrastructure, they now are
seeking to build wealth, creating jobs and industry in
long-impoverished towns.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no work here. No banks. No factories. We know we're
poor," said Antonio Martinez, the energetic local mayor. "We
appreciate all the help we can get."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated $23 billion in remittances flowed into Latin America
and the Caribbean from abroad in 2001, according to an Inter-American
Development Bank study released this year.</TE>
<TE>   The impact of that money--the hard-earned dollars of immigrant
Latinos--cannot be underestimated. It far exceeds total U.S.
development aid for the region.</TE>
<TE>   In El Salvador, the remittances amount to 14% of gross domestic
product. In Colombia, they equal half the value of coffee exports. In
Mexico, they exceed tourist revenues.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the money goes directly to family members. Nearly 70% of
adult Latinos in the U.S.--about 10 million people--send money back
home, according to the study.</TE>
<TE>   But a growing amount of money is sent back as charity via hometown
associations--cultural groups in the U.S. made up of immigrants from
a certain community or region in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   More than a fifth of U.S. Latinos contribute money to such
associations, which sponsor beauty pageants and street fairs to raise
money. Estimates vary widely, but the total raised could be more than
$200 million a year. Some groups have grown so established that they
have their own Web pages and corporate sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, the groups have grown increasingly
sophisticated, becoming players in economic development efforts along
with government and nonprofit groups.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a reorientation," said Manuel Orozco, one of the
foremost U.S. experts on remittances. "The hometown associations have
learned that the more they work to generate wealth, the greater the
impact in their hometowns."</TE>
<TE>   Paraiso de Osorio is one of the least likely places to be at the
forefront of an economic development movement.</TE>
<TE>   The village of about 6,000 people sits half a mile off a winding
mountain road about an hour from San Salvador, the capital. Thick
jungle presses in on all sides. Cows and horses roam the unpaved
roads. Many of the people are indigenous, long ignored by the central
government.</TE>
<TE>   Earthquakes last year nearly flattened the place, damaging or
destroying about 90% of the homes. The Salvadoran government did not
have the money to rebuild. A year and a half later, black plastic
tents still sit among the rows of low, whitewashed homes, like
missing teeth in a smile.</TE>
<TE>   The town had long sent many of its men and women to work in Los
Angeles and other U.S. cities. By one estimate, about 2,000 villagers
now live in the States, both legally and illegally. And those men and
women decided to give something back.</TE>
<TE>   The Committee of Paraiso de Osorio Residents in Los Angeles, with
about 20 members, has existed since 1992, helping out in small ways
here and there, building a retaining wall, sending computers to the
local school.</TE>
<TE>   But the earthquakes were like an alarm bell for the diaspora.</TE>
<TE>   "The earthquakes strengthened us tremendously," said Edwin
Cardona, a glass installer who is the group's president and a
resident of Hollywood. "We saw the need for our community and decided
we had to do bigger things."</TE>
<TE>   Working with villagers, the group hatched a plan: They would start
up a brick factory.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the bricks would be provided for free or at low cost to
poor families who still needed to rebuild.</TE>
<TE>   But later, the factory would generate cash for the local economy.
There would be jobs in the factory, jobs for truck drivers to
transport the bricks and jobs for laborers to build more homes.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to not only support public works, but to help our town,
and our people, develop," Cardona said.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the association began holding dances, selling food
in local parks and knocking on doors. Later this month, it will hold
a beauty contest for girls from the community who now live in
California.</TE>
<TE>   The locals responded in kind. They planned their own fund-raising
events, including a softball tournament held this month.</TE>
<TE>   The town government also joined in, setting up a local hotline. A
single telephone sits in a room just outside the mayor's office,
exclusively for consultation calls to Los Angeles. The association
received technical assistance from the Salvadoran government, as well
as funds from other nonprofits in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the association raised $34,500, then won $34,500 more
in matching grants from the government.</TE>
<TE>   The town had enough not only for the factory, but also to build a
new community center and spiff up a soccer field.</TE>
<TE>   Those involved are still seeking to raise funds to buy land for 15
of the town's poorest families.</TE>
<TE>   "We are doing what we can with what we have," said Rosa Maria
Morales de Diaz, a villager who serves as the link to the association
in faraway Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the town's hopes for the future can be found in three
wooden crates stashed under a plastic tarp. They are the brick-making
machines, purchased with the first sums of money raised by the Los
Angeles group.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, El Salvador's vice president, Carlos
Quintanilla, traveled to Los Angeles for a ceremonial signing of the
final paperwork for the plan and two others created by local
associations.</TE>
<TE>   The event freed up the government funds so that construction could
begin on the brick factory--and Paraiso de Osorio's future.</TE>
<TE>   "This money has helped us so much," said Martinez, the mayor.
"It's the same money in the U.S. as here, but here it goes a lot
farther."</TE>

<LD>In response to "Detour Sought for Roadblock Over Budget," Aug. 5: Why
has the state budget not passed? Hmm--maybe it's because Republicans
are more worried about the "deprived" members of the upper class who
will have to pay vehicle license fees on their multiple
Mercedes-Benzes than about the quality of life for all Californians.
In better times, the vehicle license fee was cut by half. If it were
raised this year, the fee would still be lower than it was two years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, California is the "car capital" of the world. But how do
Republicans think we pay for road repairs, the Highway Patrol and air
pollution control? Do your job and pass the budget already.</LD>
<LD>   Sumiko Braun</LD>
<TE>   Carson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The reason California has "budget woes" is because this state is
overloaded with a never-ending supply of liberal social programs and
a never-ending supply of people taking full advantage of them. Well,
there is no free lunch. Someone is paying for this, and we're tired
of it. I am sick of the liberal thinking that "you have extra, I need
more, so hand it over."</TE>

<LD>Wow! I just finished reading "Legislator Votes Her Passion, Not Her
Party Line" (Aug. 5), the story on Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg. The
California Assn. of Realtors is more important than the welfare of
the people of California? Amazing! The Realtors lobbied against
saving lives--or a life--because a bill would have required a home
seller to have a safety device installed around a pool prior to sale.
Just how much is a life worth? We need to ban all lobbyists.</LD>

<TE>   Goldberg's torrent of tears is an insult to rational, thoughtful
and mature women who argue issues on their merits. Goldberg pushes
her agenda with irrational outbursts. Her falsely named "progressive
social agenda" is a throwback to the Stalinist command and control
society that destroyed the economy of the former USSR and Eastern
Europe.</TE>

<LD>Reading about the two kidnapped teenagers who chose to be interviewed
on the "Today" show about their harrowing ordeal (Aug. 8) made me
recall my own similar experience in 1968. While delivering newspapers
in a small town, I was kidnapped and raped. It was still dark on the
early morning when he dragged me into his car, drove me to a remote
spot and threatened me into submission. He let me go afterward, and
eventually he was convicted on both charges and sent to prison for
"life" (in that state at that time, he would have been eligible for
parole in 15 years).</LD>
<LD>   I never felt any shame or guilt. I had done nothing wrong. I was
doing a job to help support my family when this lowlife took
advantage of my physical weakness as a woman.</LD>
<LD>   I would have done anything to save my own life for my children.
Likewise, these girls were innocent victims. They have nothing to be
ashamed of. The fun of temporary celebrity is the least of what they
deserve after what they've been through.</LD>

<TE>   Steve Lopez is half right (Aug. 6). However, he missed a very
important point again. On the one hand, the "Today" show did exploit
the situation. But the real point here is the fact that the girls and
their parents made a conscious and courageous decision to go public
and tell their story. In my opinion, going public will greatly assist
them with the healing process and help others who may find themselves
in a similar position.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, we must and should continue to protect victims of rape and
other violent crimes. However, this situation is unique because their
names, faces and ordeal are known nationally. Why hide? I support
their decision to go public. They endured a horrific situation and
survived. Let's not judge them, but support them. And may God bless
them both.</TE>

applauds Kern County Sheriff Carl Sparks' comment, "We don't have to
rehabilitate the son of a bitch. This man right here is not going to
appeal his case to the Supreme Court": I, for one, was disturbed by
the sheriff's comments. His stated contempt for the judicial process
he is sworn to uphold sends the wrong message to the cops on the
beat: that the people they apprehend (no matter how despicable) are
not deserving of a fair trial.</TE>

<LD>Re "Alabaster Gleams in Cathedral," Aug. 6: It is comforting to know
that the L.A. Archdiocese has spent so much money, time and labor to
install the alabaster panels in the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels, and to provide them with such a protective environment that
would ensure that they last 300 years. So how long will a poor,
homeless, hungry and abused soul survive unprotected in the shadow of
the cathedral?</LD>

<TE>   For all the stories about the new cathedral and its "inner
beauty," let's get real and mention that to the majority of Angelenos
who will see it only from the outside, it looks like a prison. It
must be one of the most unattractive structures ever constructed in
Los Angeles. It is a totally uninviting fortress that looms over an
entire city block. Shame on the church for such a monstrosity.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re " 'Mass Exodus' of Agents Leaves INS Scrambling," Aug. 5: It is
apparent that the mass defection of Border Patrol agents is leaving
our already porous borders largely undefended. With so many people
leaving, it would seem that the obvious answer would be to augment
the overwhelmed agents with Army personnel. These troops could
maintain the fixed positions that are now occupied by Border Patrol
agents. The trained agents could then proceed to track incoming
illegal crossers and perform arrests, while the troops in fixed
positions could simply detain any other crossers until Border Patrol
agents could respond.</LD>
<LD>   If Mexican army units are currently operating on the border, why
is there any hesitancy for us to place our troops on the border? If
they are defending the borders of countries around the world, why not
our own, especially in this time of need?</LD>

<LD>Re "Facing a Real Emergency," Aug. 7: The closure of Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center will have a deep and far-reaching fiscal impact that
will be felt countywide. Where do the county supervisors expect the
patients to go? These patients are not going to get on a bus and ride
20 miles to the next county facility. They will show up at the
nearest emergency department where, by federal law, they must have a
screening evaluation, passing the financial strain on to private
profit and nonprofit organizations. The financially weaker
institutions will be forced to close.</LD>
<LD>   We already have a shrinking number of hospital beds in L.A.,
Orange, Ventura and Riverside counties and have a growing population.
Before the supervisors close any more of the county's facilities they
need to think hard about the fiscal effect this will have on the
county and the businesses that have chosen to call Southern
California home.</LD>

haphazard layout and labyrinthine interiors have been a daily
reminder of the folly of throwing together a solution based on panic
and penny wisdom in order to serve the public. With major edifices by
Frank Gehry and Jose Rafael Moneo soon to open here, Los Angeles is a
world-class metropolis; we should put our present-day
down-at-the-heels messenger to the sword and try again at a later
date, when better funding is available to assure the creation of a
well-appointed design that answers our need for effective medical
care.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Sword Over Health Funds," editorial, Aug. 5: We disagree with
your conclusion that California and L.A. County must prepare to
dramatically trim health-care coverage for the working poor, children
and the disabled. Here in L.A., cutbacks in state and federal funding
may force the county to close dozens of clinics, trauma centers and
mental health clinics, as well as shutter two major hospitals. Such
draconian steps will threaten the health and safety of all the people
of L.A.</TE>
<TE>   We physicians are already doing our part by supporting meager
Medi-Cal fees, so the savings can be funneled to hospitals serving a
higher-than-average share of the medically indigent. But look
carefully at the root of the problem. Our county has 2 million
uninsured, and the state and federal governments must accept
responsibility here. The county cannot afford to do so; nor can the
private sector--hospitals and doctors--take up this slack. The impact
of triaging care for the poor, and forcing on them an even lower
standard of care, will affect the welfare of us all. Caring for the
least of us is our mutual responsibility.</TE>

<HD>Avila Is Accused in More Incidents</HD>
<DH>Crime: The Lake Elsinore man, who will be arraigned today
in Samantha Runnion's slaying, is named by a child from previous
case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of two young girls whom Alejandro Avila was acquitted of
molesting has come forward with additional allegations in the wake of
his arrest in the kidnapping and slaying of 5-year-old Samantha
Runnion, authorities said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department are
interviewing the girl and other potential witnesses to determine if
there is enough evidence to bring a new case against the Lake
Elsinore factory worker.</LD>
<LD>   "She's making another statement about some things that happened to
her," said Michael Soccio, a chief deputy district attorney in
Riverside County.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to take a look at what she has to say and determine
if there is sufficient evidence to prosecute Avila."</TE>
<TE>   Avila was being held without bail at Central Men's Jail in Santa
Ana pending his arraignment today on charges that he sexually
assaulted and killed Samantha after kidnapping her from her Stanton
condominium complex July 15.</TE>
<TE>   Avila has professed his innocence in Samantha's death, but Orange
County investigators say they have DNA and other evidence linking him
to the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas announced this week that his office
will seek the death penalty for Avila.</TE>
<TE>   Avila, 27, was acquitted last year by a Riverside County jury of
molesting two 9-year-old cousins. One of the girls is the daughter of
his former girlfriend Beth Veglahn and, until recently, lived in the
same Stanton complex as Samantha.</TE>
<TE>   Soccio would not identify the girl who lodged the new accusations.
He said she came forward just days after Avila was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   The new charges, if proved, could be used against Avila in either
the guilt or penalty phases of the Orange County trial, depending on
the discretion of the judge, Soccio said.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County authorities are not looking at any other cases,
Soccio said.</TE>

<HD>Boy, 15, Charged in Armed Bank Robbery in Lancaster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 15-year-old boy was charged on Thursday for his alleged role in a
takeover-style armed robbery of a Lancaster bank and faces a possible
life sentence, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office charged the boy
with 10 counts of kidnapping for purposes of robbery and 10 counts of
robbery in the July 18 incident, in which three robbers forced
employees and a customer of Sun Country Bank into a vault and made
off with $39,000 in cash.</LD>
<LD>   Because two of the three robbers were wielding pistols, the
charges all carry a special circumstance of armed robbery,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. James Bozajian said he is seeking to have the
boy tried as an adult. If he is found guilty in such a trial, he
could be sentenced to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The boy, whose name was not released, is being held without bail
at a juvenile detention facility and is to be arraigned today in
Sylmar Juvenile Court.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Brian Dorsey said the boy is a
member of the Bloods street gang and was "a very willing and active
participant [in the robbery] who was trying to move up in the gang
hierarchy."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are still searching for the other two suspects, both
of whom are members of the Bloods, Dorsey said. One was identified as
19-year-old Vernon Jackson, who is thought to be in Los Angeles. The
identity of the third suspect was not released.</TE>
<TE>   According to deputies and witnesses, the three robbers burst into
the Sun Country Bank and ordered nine employees and the one customer
into the bank vault and forced tellers to stuff cash into two
backpacks.</TE>
<TE>   The boy was arrested on Wednesday after deputies served a warrant
at his Lancaster home.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey said he wasn't surprised by the boy's age. "A lot of gangs
use juveniles for major crimes because they don't get as harsh
treatment as adults when it comes to court proceedings," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although bank robbery is usually prosecuted as a federal crime,
juveniles are often charged under the robbery laws of the state,
which is better equipped to handle cases involving minors, said Thom
Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call the Lancaster sheriff's
station at (661) 940-3835.</TE>

<LD>The final resting place of Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and other
cinematic greats could soon become Los Angeles' next
historical-cultural monument.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission has recommended that
Westwood Village Memorial Park join more than 700 monuments
designated citywide over the last 40 years. They include churches,
homes, the Hollywood sign and a few other cemeteries.</LD>
<LD>   The recommendation is going to the City Council for approval.</LD>
<TE>   Even as a bustling city has sprawled around it, the site that
began as a village burial ground has maintained its reputation as a
serene oasis. Lately, however, the Houston-based owner's plan to
expand crypt space has drawn objections from residents on Wellworth
Avenue, just south of the site. Los Angeles planning commissioners
approved that proposal last month.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Abshez, a lawyer for Service Corp. International, which
bought the cemetery in 1996, contended that opponents are using the
monument designation as a delaying tactic.</TE>
<TE>   "The application was ... for the purpose of frustrating and
delaying the construction," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, one result of a designation would be that any effort to
secure a building permit would trigger a review taking at least six
months by the Cultural Heritage Commission. However, Jay M. Oren, an
architect on the commission's staff, said commissioners had indicated
that they would not object to a building permit for Service Corp.'s
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss, who represents Westwood, said the City
Council's arts, health and humanities committee, which he heads,
"will take a very close look at the recommendation."</TE>
<TE>   He said that the cemetery is "a unique property with unique
characteristics," but that it is rare for a cemetery to be
recommended as a historic site "because, indeed, there is something
special about every cemetery."</TE>
<TE>   Records show burials at what is now Westwood Village Memorial Park
beginning in the 1880s, although local lore suggests that ranch hands
and Indians had been interred there as early as the 1820s.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the history involving the cemetery, which is just south of
Wilshire Boulevard and east of Glendon Avenue in Westwood, is murky.
But this much is known: The cemetery was originally part of the
Rancho San Jose de Buenos Ayres and now is sandwiched between
high-rises and homes. In 1905, the state officially established the
Sunset Cemetery on several acres surrounded by grasslands and hills.
In 1926, the name was changed to Westwood Memorial Park.</TE>
<TE>   Spartan monuments to veterans of the Civil War, the Spanish
American War and World War I are plentiful. The first mausoleum was
built at the northeast corner of the site in 1952; 10 years later,
Monroe was buried in the building's west wing.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, many notables have been buried there, including film
director Billy Wilder and actors Walter Matthau, Natalie Wood, Dean
Martin and Burt Lancaster.</TE>

<CX>   Westwood cemetery--A story in Friday's California section about
Westwood Village Memorial Park stated incorrectly that a building
permit application for a property designated as a historic-cultural
monument would trigger a review by the Cultural Heritage Commission
lasting at least six months. In fact, the commission or its staff
architect would have 15 days to approve or object to the permit. If
the commission objects, the application would be withheld for 30 to
180 days. At the end of the 180 days, the commission could petition
the City Council for another 180 days, during which time preservation
proponents would be required to report on progress, if any, toward
preservation of the property.</CX>

<HD>Bacteria Fear Leads to Recall of Cheese</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Paramount-based cheese manufacturing company has voluntarily
recalled about 10,000 packages of one of its products after a unit in
New York tested positive for a potentially fatal bacterium.</LD>
<LD>   Ariza Cheese Co. began recalling Queso Fresco Cheese from about
250 stores in California and New York after the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration notified the company that one package was found to be
contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, said Blake Johnson, Ariza's
general manager.</LD>
<LD>   "Based on that information, we wanted to do the most responsible
thing we could," said Johnson, adding that there have been no reports
of people sickened by the cheese.</LD>
<TE>   The bacterium can cause listeriosis, a flu-like illness that is
most dangerous to babies, fetuses, the elderly and those with weak
immune systems. Symptoms include fever, nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea.</TE>
<TE>   The recall started July 31, the day that federal officials
notified Ariza about the cheese in New York, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The contaminated cheese was manufactured June 11 and had a
"must-sell" date of Aug. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the company decided to pull back everything up to
Sept. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Latin-style cheese is a thriving industry in the United States
that rebounded after a massive food poisoning outbreak in the
mid-1980s that left 40 people dead and the industry weakened.</TE>
<TE>   Ariza is a family-owned company with about 30 employees that
distributes to mostly independent stores, 35 of them in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The firm hires an independent testing company, Johnson said. The
contamination found by the FDA was not revealed during Ariza's
routine tests.</TE>
<TE>   Ariza has suspended production of Queso Fresco until the company
figures out why its test results and those of the FDA did not match,
Johnson said.</TE>

<HD>Chickens Serve as Virus Sentinels</HD>
<DH>Disease: Officials hope testing special flocks across the
state will reveal when West Nile virus has arrived, so warnings can
be issued.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They're not just chickens, they're sentinel Chickens.</LD>
<LD>   As West Nile virus creeps westward across the country, California
state and local officials are hoping that a flock of 2,000 hens will
sound an alarm when infected mosquitoes reach the West Coast.</LD>
<LD>   The 23-year-old sentinel surveillance program, founded by the
California Department of Health Services, has been the state's first
line of defense in the fight against St. Louis and Western equine
encephalitis, diseases that affect both people and animals. It is
operated statewide by districts for controlling vectors--animals,
especially insects, that transmit diseases.</LD>
<TE>   Now officials are hoping they'll be able to use the domestic
leghorn hens to detect West Nile virus when it enters the state, and
warn the public to take needed precautions before people are
infected. It's up to folks like Susanne Kluh to check up on the
birds.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting on a metal folding chair Wednesday morning behind an
overflowing recycling bin and construction machinery, she held a
plump red hen down by its wings and pricked its comb.</TE>
<TE>   Each time she poked the chicken with the small lance, it kicked
its small legs and clucked.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always too wimpy," said Kluh, 35, a soft-spoken ecologist
with the Greater Los Angeles County Vector Control District.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how they feel. I hate to hurt them," she said, stroking
the chicken to calm it down.</TE>
<TE>   The chickens are placed in outdoor coops, mounted five feet off
the ground so hungry mosquitoes can gain access easily. Officials say
mosquito species that carry harmful viruses like to feed on birds.</TE>
<TE>   Chickens are ideal candidates to stand "sentinel" because they
"don't get sick and they don't serve as a source of the virus for
mosquitoes to pick up and spread it to other animals," said Vicki
Kramer, chief of the vector-borne disease section of the state health
department.</TE>
<TE>   Their bodies create antibodies to fight off the viruses. Officials
can tell that infected mosquitoes are in an area if the chickens'
blood tests positive for certain antibodies.</TE>
<TE>   Since earlier this year, officials have been testing for West Nile
virus, which has infected 113 people in the United States this year,
leading to five deaths.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the virus hasn't been detected in any Western states, but
its arrival appears guaranteed. Jack Hazelrigg, district manager for
the Greater L.A. vector control agency, said the virus could show up
in California as early as the start of next year.</TE>
<TE>   When it does, the first creatures to be infected will most likely
be birds, including the sentinel chickens.</TE>
<TE>   "The mosquitoes here are pretty nasty." The chickens "get bitten
up really good," said Kluh, who collected samples from the flock
caged near the Harbor Park Municipal Golf Course in Wilmington.</TE>
<TE>   "The tule mosquitoes are fierce biters," she said of Culex
erythrothorax, a mosquito species that most commonly carries viruses.</TE>
<TE>   In general, this flock is cooperative. Most of the birds shifted
only slightly in Kluh's lap when the needle pricked their flesh. Even
so, the chickens never get used it, she said.</TE>
<TE>   As Kluh dabbed drops of blood onto a strip of filter paper, she
whispered calmingly to the chickens. All, she said, have different
personalities.</TE>
<TE>   "What's wrong with you, girl?" she asked softly. "You act like
you've never done this before."</TE>
<TE>   There are 200 sentinel chicken flocks in cages throughout
California.</TE>
<TE>   While the state oversees the program, 50 of California's 70 local
vector control districts--independent government agencies that
operate much like water or sewer districts--maintain the flocks and
draw small samples of blood from the chickens every other week.</TE>
<TE>   There are five vector control districts in the Los Angeles
metropolitan area. The largest is the Greater Los Angeles County
district, based in Santa Fe Springs. It has four flocks, each with 10
chickens.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, blood samples are shipped to the Bay Area city of
Richmond to be tested in labs run by the state health department.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Toppin, a spokesman for the Mosquito and Vector Control Assn.
of California, said more than $200,000 is spent each year to purchase
and test the chickens. That amount does not include staffing and
other related costs.</TE>
<TE>   West Nile virus is a so-called flavivirus commonly found in
Africa, West Asia and the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   It travels via migrating birds and the mosquitoes that prick them
for warm blood. The mosquitoes transmit the virus to other birds,
people, horses and some other animals.</TE>
<TE>   Most people infected with West Nile have only mild symptoms, such
as fever, headache and body aches. But for the elderly and people
with compromised immune systems, the virus can be severe, causing
encephalitis, a potentially fatal brain inflammation.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1969, California state officials have been testing
mosquitoes to detect viruses, Kramer said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, state officials began placing flocks of chickens in
"strategic locales in California to monitor virus activity," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to testing caged chickens, Kramer said, the state also
examines dead birds, which can be early indicators of viruses like
the West Nile.</TE>

<HD>Mother, Daughter Discuss Assault in Police Videotape</HD>
<DH>Courts: The jury hears the Simi Valley pair, accused of
trying to kill the teen's stepfather, talk about details of the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The jury hearing the case of a Simi Valley mother and daughter
accused of trying to kill the teen's stepfather watched a videotape
of the pair recorded at the Simi Valley police station shortly after
the alleged attack.</LD>
<LD>   The grainy black and white video shows Jennifer Childs, 19, and
Eileen Childs, 37, discussing the early-morning altercation that led
to them later being charged with attempted murder, arson and the use
of deadly weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Also on the video, Jennifer Childs--an aspiring pop
singer--appears to tell her mother for the first time about alleged
sexual advances made by stepfather Larry Childs when she was 14.</LD>
<TE>   The women are accused of setting fire to Larry Childs' bed March
25 and then hitting him repeatedly with baseball bats after he ran
from the room. The prosecution contends the pair were motivated by
greed and hoped to kill the 57-year-old man to collect $1.4 million
in life insurance.</TE>
<TE>   However, the defense maintains that Eileen, Jennifer and her two
younger brothers were victims of an abusive man and that the women
acted in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   In the hourlong video, Jennifer Childs wears pajamas and is
speaking softly. When her mother asks her what she told police, she
responds:</TE>
<TE>   "I told them everything. But there's one thing about Dad I never
told you." The teen went on to mention alleged attempts by Larry
Childs to molest her five years earlier when the two of them took a
family trip to Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   It was difficult for jurors to gauge the extent of Eileen Childs'
reaction, because her back was facing the camera.</TE>
<TE>   "Why didn't you tell me?" Eileen Childs asked, without sounding or
appearing surprised or upset. She later tried to press her daughter
for details, but the teenager declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Childs also was heard expressing relief to her mother
after learning that her stepfather would not require surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't trying to beat his skull in, I was just trying to make
him stop," the teen said. Thinking her parents were struggling after
the fire, Jennifer Childs said she went for a bat to stop Larry
Childs.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Jenny Scovis, who represents Eileen Childs, said
the women were unaware that they were being taped but that the video,
although part of the prosecution's case, ultimately will help the
defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever they said, they thought they were saying in private,"
Scovis said. But, "the tape goes right in line with our defense."</TE>
<TE>   In other testimony Thursday, the prosecution called emergency room
doctor Gunter Wiedemann to testify about the severity of Larry
Childs' wounds that day.</TE>
<TE>   His testimony seemed to contradict earlier prosecution assertions
that the injuries were severe to life threatening.</TE>
<TE>   He described the man's condition as "stable with a couple of nasty
lacerations."</TE>

<HD>Infant Among 2 Killed in Compton Shootings; 5 Hurt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 2-month-old girl and a man were killed, and five other people,
including a pregnant teenager, were injured in separate shootings
Wednesday night in and around Compton.</LD>
<LD>   Three separate attacks occurred between 9:55 and 10:30, all on
neighborhood side streets within four miles of each other.
Investigators collected ballistics evidence from the sites to
determine whether the same guns had been used, sheriff's spokesman
David Cervantes said.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities gave this version of events in the first shooting:</LD>
<TE>   A man driving alone was fired upon as he entered the intersection
of Caswell Avenue and West Claude Street. Hit in the chest, he
crashed into a house. The name of the victim, who died at a hospital,
hadn't been released pending notification of relatives.</TE>
<TE>   The second shooting occurred 20 minutes later on Parmelee Avenue,
also in Compton, officials said. Meichelle Isrel of Hesperia and
Brandon English of Lakewood had just arrived with their infant
daughter at the home of the baby's great-grandmother when assailants
fired several shots into their car, deputies said.</TE>
<TE>   Isrel said she had left the car to talk on a cordless phone "when
I heard shots. By the time I turned to the car, my baby was all
bloody and my boyfriend was shot in the head. All I heard him say was
'Help!' "</TE>
<TE>   The baby, Teiana English, was killed. Her father was in critical
condition Thursday at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   The third shooting occurred four miles away on Essey Avenue, just
outside Compton. A pregnant 15-year-old was struck by gunfire and
taken to St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood, where she gave birth by
caesarian section. A spokesperson there said Thursday that both were
in good condition.</TE>
<TE>   Three other young people shot in the same attack also were in good
condition, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Judge Delays Cyber Cafe Restrictions</HD>
<DH>Courts: A restraining order prevents Garden Grove
ordinance, which limits hours for minors and requires guards, from
taking effect today. Owners hail the action.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's toughest cyber cafe ordinance won't take effect today
as planned, because of a temporary restraining order by a judge who
expressed concerns about free speech and potential irreparable
financial damage to cafe owners.</LD>
<LD>   Five Garden Grove Internet cafe owners had sought the order,
arguing that they were being unfairly blamed for gang-related crimes
in the city and that they would be bankrupted by the rules, which
would limit hours and require on-site security.</LD>
<LD>   "We're really happy," said Mike Glover, 18, manager of G.G.
Cybertown on Valley View Street. "I live right around the block ...
and this is a really good neighborhood."</LD>
<TE>   The rules would require minors to leave by 8 p.m. and the
businesses to close at 10 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays, allowing
them to stay open until midnight on Fridays and Saturdays.</TE>
<TE>   Security guards and logs of customers would be required, and
"boisterous conduct" banned.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we're open until midnight [every night]. Those extra
two hours are when everybody comes," Glover said.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Dennis S. Choate issued the stay Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   He asked both sides to try to reach a compromise before returning
to court Aug. 29.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they would be happy to tweak their ordinance,
but they have no intention of backing down completely.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we can continue to have murders," Garden Grove
Mayor Bruce Broadwater said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we need to fine-tune it, fine, but we need an ordinance."</TE>
<TE>   There were two homicides and numerous assaults in the last year
that city officials contend were connected to the cafes. On June 8,
14-year-old Edward Fernandez was followed from a cyber cafe and shot
to death. In December, a 20-year-old was stabbed to death after
leaving another. The ordinance was enacted unanimously by the council
July 9.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Marcot of Kring &amp; Chung, an attorney for the cafe owners,
said, "Our clients share the same concerns about crime. But the
problem is more to do with gangs than cyber cafes."</TE>
<TE>   Marcot said his clients would be open to discussing stricter
rules--at cafes where there had been problems, for instance--as
opposed to applying blanket rules to all of them.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor and council will discuss the case in closed session
Tuesday. The business owners and their attorneys met with Broadwater
on Monday to try to discuss changes, then served him with notice of
their intent to sue and to request the temporary stay.</TE>
<TE>   Broadwater said that he wasn't surprised, and that he had expected
legal action sooner. He said the ordinance allows cafe owners to seek
conditional-use permits that would exempt them from certain
provisions. He said he wondered why none of the city's 23 cyber cafe
permit holders had applied.</TE>
<TE>   Marcot said he understood from his clients that seeking the
conditional permits is a lengthy, potentially costly process. He
added that his clients are small-business people who have put their
life savings into the cafes.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're forced to incur these fees, they'll be out of business
in a fairly short period of time," he said. "All we want is to have
an open discourse about some of the problems with the ordinance."</TE>
<TE>   At least four other Orange County cities are considering tougher
regulations on Internet cafes, and several other cities around the
state have limited hours at such businesses. The outcome of the
Garden Grove case could affect some of those regulations.</TE>

<HD>Drug Ring Bust Nets 56 Arrests</HD>
<DH>Sting: Authorities say methamphetamine operation laundered
money through Orange County exotic car dealership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities announced the breakup of an international methamphetamine
and money-laundering ring, saying the action should put a significant
crimp on the flow of methamphetamine throughout the country.</LD>
<LD>   Dubbed "Operation Living Large," the two-year, multi-agency sting
targeted a scheme that shrouded alleged drug profits through an
exotic car dealership in Costa Mesa. In all, 56 people have been
arrested, authorities said, including ring leader Carlos Molina, 31,
at his Rowland Heights home Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities seized as many as 80 luxury cars earlier this week
from the Orange County car dealer, including Porsches, Lamborghinis
and Ferraris. Investigators acknowledge, however, that some of the
cars--estimated at $200,000 to $500,000 each--may belong to
legitimate customers, including an XJ220 Jaguar owned by Mike Tyson
and a Ford Excursion owned by Dennis Rodman.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a big day for law enforcement," said Riverside County
Sheriff Bob Doyle, who led a news conference Thursday detailing the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not every day you get to take down an international drug
organization.... This will have a major impact on the distribution of
methamphetamine."</TE>
<TE>   Doyle said investigators got their break in the case about two
years ago, after a drug bust in the Riverside County community of
Rubidoux.</TE>
<TE>   Information from that case led detectives to the ring, which had
major labs set up in Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange and Los
Angeles counties.</TE>
<TE>   Drug ring members typically smuggled the ingredients to make
methamphetamine from Mexico and Canada, where the sale of
pseudoephedrine, the main ingredient in methamphetamine, is legal.</TE>
<TE>   Several "super labs," as detectives called them, were then
established in rural areas of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.
Labs also were set up in a South Gate industrial park and a
residential community in San Bernardino County called Muscoy.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the biggest labs I've personally ever seen was set up here
in Riverside County," said Riverside Sheriff's Department Sgt. Dave
Stroh.</TE>
<TE>   Stroh, who acknowledged that Riverside and San Bernardino counties
have aptly been dubbed the methamphetamine capital of the state, said
most of the drugs were sold locally through street gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Some, however, were driven across the country for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Molina's ring also produced the drug ecstasy and smuggled it to
buyers in the Midwest, said Special Agent Jose Martinez, spokesman
for the Los Angeles Drug Enforcement Agency.</TE>
<TE>   "By plane, by train, by boat, they were moving these drugs any way
they could think of," Doyle said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators used wiretaps and video surveillance to track the
drug ring's operations, said San Bernardino County Deputy Dist. Atty.
Marie Fournier.</TE>
<TE>   Profits from the drug sales, which totaled in the millions, were
regularly laundered through Auto Market, owned by Nader Amirvand,
authorities said. Amirvand allowed Molina and his associates to buy
the high-end cars, but kept very little paperwork on the sales. He
also allowed the buyers to register the cars to Auto Market, instead
of using their real names.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of a drug bust, Stroh said, the cars would then be
protected because authorities were supposed to be unable to trace
them back to Molina's men. Investigators, however, were tipped to the
plan and arrested Amirvand on Wednesday on suspicion of aiding and
abetting the drug ring.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said it was unclear how long Molina's group had been in
operation before the investigation began two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez added that the group was considered very dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the residences we searched had guns at every corner of the
house," Martinez said. "There was a gun by the desk, a gun where they
hung their ties, shotguns in the garage, underneath the couches,
everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the cars, investigators also seized $400,000 in
cash, numerous gold and diamond watches and rings, guns, and 980,000
pseudoephedrine tablets.</TE>

<HD>Farm Labor Bill Gets Legislature's OK</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Davis has 'concerns' about giving workers
binding arbitration in impasses. He attends fund-raiser with farmers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A day after California's agricultural industry saluted Gov. Gray
Davis at a fund-raiser, the Legislature gave final approval Thursday
to a bill that, over the bitter objections of farmers, would impose
binding arbitration when unions and growers hit impasses in contract
negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   Without debate, the Senate sent the labor-sponsored bill by Senate
leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) to the desk of Davis, whose
spokesman warned this week of the governor's "concerns" about how it
might hurt the California economy.</LD>
<LD>   The term "concerns" often is used as Capitol code to signal that
the governor does not like a bill or may veto it.</LD>
<TE>   Davis attended the fund-raiser Wednesday night at the private
Sutter Club, a block from the Capitol. While there was no immediate
report of the evening's receipts, Davis routinely raises more than
$100,000 at such events. About 40 people attended, including lobbyist
George Soares, who represents an array of farm and dairy interests
opposed to the binding-arbitration legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The bill (SB 1736), sponsored by the United Farm Workers Union of
America, AFL-CIO, would grant agricultural employees binding
arbitration, something that the union founded by the late Cesar
Chavez has long sought.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing is kind of unseemly," fellow Democrat Burton said of
Davis' decision to attend the fund-raiser the night before the Senate
approved the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Cunha Jr., president of the Nisei Farmers League, called
the plan "a horrible bill, a terrible bill," and said it would cause
"economic disaster" among California farmers. Other grower
representatives have denounced the bill in similar terms.</TE>
<TE>   Cunha attended the fund-raiser but said he had not broached the
topic of the bill with Davis, although he had written a letter to the
governor and spoken to administration aides about it.</TE>
<TE>   "If everyone brought up all their issues, the governor would still
be there," Cunha said.</TE>
<TE>   The fund-raiser was scheduled more than a month ago, before the
timing of the bill's passage could be known, Davis' aides said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Press Secretary Steven Maviglio said that the governor's
biggest backers are labor unions and that the legislation is labor's
"top priority." Davis has received calls from top labor leaders,
including John Sweeney, head of the AFL-CIO, urging that he sign the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   "All the governor's supporters know he signs based on their merit,
not based on who is supporting them," Maviglio said, adding that
"virtually all the governor's supporters" have had measures vetoed
that they hoped would be signed.</TE>
<TE>   As Davis was attending the fund-raiser, the UFW was organizing a
vigil outside the Capitol to underscore the importance it puts on the
bill. Mark Grossman, spokesman for the UFW, noted that Davis was
chief of staff to Gov. Jerry Brown when Brown championed passage of
the Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope and pray he is going to sign the bill," Grossman said.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to comment on Davis' decision to attend the farm
industry fund-raiser, saying: "All we care about is his signature on
the bill."</TE>
<TE>   Davis continued to insist Thursday that he had taken no position
on the bill. When pressed further by reporters on whether he intended
to sign or veto it, the governor cut off questions. "I don't think
it's worth going down this road," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Burton warned that it would be a "mistake" for Davis to veto
the bill. He said Davis and his aides "never once expressed any
opposition to the bill" as it wound through the Legislature. "They
never talked to me at all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   During a campaign stop in Ventura, the Republican nominee for
governor, Bill Simon Jr., called on Davis to veto the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not right for the government to dictate when and how private
parties resolve their disputes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he said Davis probably wouldn't take his advice. "We all know
that Davis is predisposed to pay back his big labor contributors and
sign this bill."</TE>
<TE>   The measure would be the first change in the landmark Agricultural
Labor Relations Act since it became law and brought an end to strikes
and labor violence in the fields. It is the UFW's biggest legislative
initiative in years.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsors said binding arbitration is necessary because growers
have stonewalled and routinely refused to sign contracts and bargain
in good faith for years.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW asserted that for more than 25 years, farm workers voted
in secret ballot elections for the UFW to represent them at 428
ranches.</TE>
<TE>   But during the same period, the union said, only 185 growers
signed contracts. Currently, the UFW has 50 contracts,
representatives said.</TE>
<TE>   Growers fiercely fought the bill. Among other things, they charged
that a third-party arbitrator effectively would remove their ability
to bargain collectively.</TE>

<HD>GOP Launches Final Drive to Block Freeman as Power Czar
Choice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As time runs short on S. David Freeman as chief of the new state
public power authority, Senate Republicans on Thursday launched a
final campaign to derail his confirmation to the $220,000-a-year
position.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans have suggested that under Freeman, the Los Angeles
Department of Power and Water last year charged excessive prices and
may have manipulated the market when it sold surplus electricity to
the state during the energy crisis.</LD>
<LD>   In a legislative deposition last week, Freeman, who volunteered to
testify and insisted that the session be public, said that if traders
in the Los Angeles department engaged in improper sales practices,
they occurred without his knowledge and against his orders.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis appointed Freeman chairman of the California
Consumer Power and Conservation Authority one year ago after he had
served as an advisor to the governor during the electricity crisis.
Unless Freeman is confirmed by the Senate on Monday, he will be
turned out of the post Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But minority Senate Republicans indicated Thursday that Freeman's
answers did not satisfy them.</TE>
<TE>   Senior GOP Sen. Ross Johnson of Irvine said Republicans still have
questions about Freeman's record.</TE>
<TE>   He urged senators to read the transcript of Freeman's eight-hour
deposition during the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   He did not indicate what the transcript would reveal but warned
his colleagues against "putting yourself in the position of casting a
vote potentially ... in ignorance of the background and problems of
this nominee."</TE>
<TE>   In a brief interview, Freeman later said he told all during the
deposition taken by Sen. William Morrow (R-Oceanside), a member of a
special Senate committee investigating alleged price gouging by
generators during the energy crunch.</TE>
<TE>   "We went at it for eight hours. I answered every question not only
under oath but fully. There aren't any questions left," Freeman said.</TE>
<TE>   Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said he
believed that Freeman will receive enough votes from majority
Democrats to win confirmation Monday.</TE>
<TE>   To do so, Freeman needs 21 votes in the 40-member Senate.</TE>
<TE>   But one potentially pivotal member, Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Garden
Grove), the Senate's expert on energy price gouging by generators,
said he had not decided how he will vote.</TE>
<TE>   Other Democrats said Dunn's vote would help influence their
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn, chairman of the energy crisis investigating committee, said
he intended to read the transcript during the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate action, the Senate voted unanimously to confirm
Davis' appointment of financier Haim Saban of Los Angeles and
business magnate Richard Blum, both generous Democratic campaign
contributors, as regents of the University of California.</TE>
<TE>   Blum is the husband of U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).</TE>
<TE>   In February, Saban donated a record $7 million to the Democratic
National Committee.</TE>

<HD>Trial Aggravates Parents' Suffering</HD>
<DH>Court: As the case against murder suspect David Westerfield
goes to the jury, friends deplore the treatment of Danielle van Dam's
mother and father by the media.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The trial of David Westerfield in the kidnapping and murder of
7-year-old Danielle van Dam went to the jury Thursday amid another
sign of the torment suffered by her parents.</LD>
<LD>   Brenda van Dam fled the courtroom in tears after suddenly seeing
an enlarged picture of her daughter's nude, mummified body, which had
been taken during the autopsy. The picture was shown to the jury by
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek during his closing argument.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, Damon van Dam sought out the mother of defense
attorney Steven Feldman during a recess and asked her sarcastically
if she was proud of her son.</LD>
<TE>   Several weeks ago Damon van Dam was temporarily banned from the
courtroom after making threatening gestures toward Westerfield.</TE>
<TE>   "Brenda and Damon are living in a pressure cooker that is
unimaginable," said Susan Wintersteen, a neighbor who has accompanied
them to court.</TE>
<TE>   "They go home every night and cry and try to find the strength to
come back to court to represent Danielle."</TE>
<TE>   It is one of the oddities of this high-profile homicide case that
the parents of the murder victim have been widely vilified and
ridiculed.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Danielle's disappearance on Feb. 2, the local media
began to report on a tantalizing angle to the story: adulterous sex
in upscale suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   One radio talk-show host has turned his show for six months into
an open forum for callers to offer theories about the couple's
parental skills, permissive sex lives, drug use and possible
culpability in the murder of their daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The current edition of San Diego Magazine--known for stories about
local politics and the La Jolla social scene--has a story using the
Van Dam case to discuss swapping of partners by married couples. "Van
Dam and Beyond: San Diego's Surprising Swinger Scene," reads the
tease on the cover.</TE>
<TE>   A victim advocate, Marc Klaas, who has befriended the Van Dams,
said he had never seen anything to match the treatment of Danielle's
parents by the media and the defense attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "These people have been so vilified, so demonized, it's horrible,"
said Klaas, who was pushed into activism when his daughter, Polly,
was abducted and murdered in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "The centerpiece of the defense case has been to vilify the
grieving parents."</TE>
<TE>   Klaas and other friends of the Van Dams have particular contempt
for talk-show host Rick Roberts and his "Court of Public Opinion" on
KFMB-AM (760). Roberts was the first person in the local media to
report on the couple's sex lives.</TE>
<TE>   He provides a daily commentary on the trial and invites callers.</TE>
<TE>   "It infuriates me that these people call in and pass judgment on
this poor family when they can't fathom the pain of losing a child
like this," said Roger Tso, a neighbor of the Van Dams and principal
of a local elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts makes no apologies. He believes that the Van Dams'
lifestyle left them vulnerable to disreputable people who gained
access to their home--a theme that Feldman has stressed.</TE>
<TE>   The talk-show host notes that prosecutors argue that Westerfield
was able to enter the home through a door left open to air out
marijuana smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything you do in your life has a cost and in this case, the
cost was unimaginable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Except during testimony by entomologists about the flies and other
bugs found on Danielle's body, one or both of her parents have
attended each day of the trial. A gag order imposed on all witnesses
by Superior Court Judge William Mudd keeps them from talking to
reporters, many of whom they know from the monthlong search for
Danielle's body, during which they made daily pleas to the kidnapper.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been very hard for them not to be able to tell their own
stories to counteract all the rumors," Wintersteen said. At one
point, a friend issued a news release on their behalf, denying that
the family had purchased a new home and a new car.</TE>
<TE>   Damon van Dam, 36, a software engineer who works for a firm under
contract to telecommunications giant Qualcomm, has tried to get back
to work but found it difficult. Brenda, 39, has put her job as a
free-lance bookseller on hold.</TE>
<TE>   Tso, whose daughter was Danielle's best friend said that whenever
he has seen Brenda and Damon van Dam recently "they seem very angry
but they're also in a state of disbelief."</TE>
<TE>   The van Dams went with their sons--Dylan, 5, and Derrick, 10--to a
cabin in Big Bear in hopes of finding some relief. During the later
stages of the trial, Brenda's parents have come to San Diego, and a
loyal coterie of neighbors has rallied.</TE>
<TE>   As the couple left the courthouse one day, photographers jostled
for position and Damon van Dam showed his annoyance.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love not to be harassed," he snapped.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all right, we'll make it," said his wife as she grasped his
arm.</TE>

<HD>Teacher Admits Abducting and Seducing 15-Year-Old</HD>
<DH>Crime: She strikes a plea bargain to avoid life term in
Nevada but still faces San Bernardino charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD and TINA DIRMANN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tanya Joan Hadden, the former San Bernardino teacher who fell in love
with a student less than half her age, then embarked on an ill-fated
road trip with him to Las Vegas, pleaded guilty to three felonies
Thursday to eliminate the threat of a life prison sentence.</LD>
<LD>   Hadden, 33, had faced 19 criminal charges in Nevada; she pleaded
guilty to having sex with a student, statutory sexual seduction and
second-degree kidnapping. She still faces up to 25 years in prison,
but plans to appeal for a suspended sentence and probation when she
is sentenced in September before Clark County Superior Court Judge
Joseph Bonaventure.</LD>
<LD>   Hadden also faces a second round of charges back home in San
Bernardino, and could be sentenced to more than nine years in prison
if convicted on those allegations.</LD>
<TE>   Both sides said they had their reasons for entering into the plea
arrangement in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors were wary of forcing the student, 15-year-old Richard
Pena, to recount his affections and his affair in what surely would
have been a lurid trial, said Clark County Deputy Dist. Atty Lisa
Luzaich. The prosecutor added that authorities were pleased Hadden
was forced to sign a plea agreement acknowledging wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad the family won't have to go through a trial," Luzaich
said. "I'm glad she admitted what she did and that she will be
punished for what she did to that family."</TE>
<TE>   Hadden's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Jordan Savage, said the
former teacher was forced to plead guilty by overzealous prosecutors.
Caught in the spotlight of a case that has generated nationwide
attention, Savage said, the prosecutors brought heavy-handed charges
and threatened to send the former teacher to prison for life.</TE>
<TE>   "This has always been a case of proportionality. It's not that
she's innocent of everything," Savage said. "She has always
understood the impropriety of having a relationship with her student
and of having sex with her student."</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, where does this belong on the scale of justice?
... This is the same kidnapping charge that is used to prosecute the
most violent people in our society. We're not happy with this. But
the alternative could have been a whole lot worse."</TE>
<TE>   Hadden, who was in her second year as a teacher, first met Pena
last year while he was earning an "A" in her science class at Cajon
High School in San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, she has said in interviews, nothing untoward happened.
But they soon discovered an uncommon bond, she has said, forged over
shared interests--in punk rock music and good conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Hadden said, she fell in love with her student.</TE>
<TE>   And, her attorney conceded Thursday, she had sexual relations with
him.</TE>
<TE>   In April, police began investigating reports that Hadden may have
purchased alcohol for Pena and another student at a party. In a Times
interview Hadden has said Pena, afraid that his parents would find
out, panicked and asked her to take him for a drive. They wound up in
Las Vegas, at Pena's suggestion, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities finally tracked them down in a hotel on the Strip
several nights later. They were wearing the same clothes they had
left in and were running low on cash.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden was fired from her teaching job. She has told friends that
she would like to go back to graduate school to earn a degree in
science and, potentially, work in research. She has no interest in
teaching again, her attorney has said.</TE>
<TE>   Luzaich said the case clearly warrants punishment more severe than
probation.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see her go to prison," the Nevada prosecutor said.
"It's over and above just having sex with a 15-year-old, which, in
and of itself, is horrible. But to take a 15-year-old to Las
Vegas.... His parents didn't even know if he was alive or dead for
four days."</TE>
<TE>   In San Bernardino County, Hadden does not have a trial date yet.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor there, Deputy Dist. Atty. Verna Carey, said she
would not accept probation for Hadden either, even if a second plea
bargain was reached.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden is accused in San Bernardino County of nine criminal
charges, including four counts of statutory rape, which is a felony.</TE>
<TE>   "My office believes this is a state prison case," Carey said. "Her
conduct was egregious in taking a child across state lines. She had a
position of trust, and violated that trust in the worst way."</TE>

<HD>Hahn Memo States Goals for Budget</HD>
<DH>City Hall: Mayor wants to boost ranks of the LAPD and
enhance neighborhood councils. Secessionists say report skirts tough
questions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn on Thursday released a memo outlining
his budget priorities for next year, instructing city department
heads to begin planning for ways to boost the ranks of the Police
Department and to expand neighborhood councils, among other things.
In an unusually early memo to the general managers of most Los
Angeles departments, the mayor said every request for money in the
2003-04 budget should be made with those and other mayoral priorities
in mind. The city only recently completed its budget for this year.</LD>
<LD>   While acknowledging the secession efforts underway in Hollywood
and the San Fernando Valley, the mayor said he believes the city must
rededicate itself to the efficient delivery of services to residents.
He did not indicate the amounts of money that should be allocated to
his priorities because he wants the general managers to return with
their own budget proposals, mayoral aides said.</LD>
<LD>   But secession supporters accused the mayor of using his budget
memo as a campaign brochure against breakaway efforts. They said Hahn
purposefully is skirting the more difficult questions--how to pay for
new officers, for instance--in favor of merely stating his goals.</LD>
<TE>   "This is what City Hall does best," said Richard Katz, the former
state assemblyman who is a leader in the Valley secession campaign.
"They give the press-release version of reform.... There's no
substance here."</TE>
<TE>   But Deputy Mayor Carmel Sella said the purpose of the mayor's
budget memo was to give general managers a guidepost by which they
can develop their own department budgets. "The more they know what
the mayor's goals are, it helps them put their budgets together,"
Sella said.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, who met with general managers earlier this week,
outlined several budget goals; among them:</TE>
<TE>   * Reversing the depletion of officers within the LAPD by stepping
up police hiring and moving to stem attrition.</TE>
<TE>   * Enhancing neighborhood councils by allocating more money to the
panels, which are advisory bodies charged with assisting the city
government in areas such as planning and developing community
projects.</TE>
<TE>   * Improving and increasing the level of neighborhood services,
including street and sidewalk repair, traffic improvements and
graffiti removal, among other things.</TE>
<TE>   * Continuing to increase the number of programs aimed at
strengthening the business community of Los Angeles, including
business tax reform and affordable housing programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I am confident that Los Angeles will remain unified and that our
economic stability and building momentum will not be hindered," Hahn
wrote in his memo. "Yet we must continually rededicate ourselves to
the efficient delivery of services, and move toward our goal of
making Los Angeles the safest, most efficient neighborhood-driven
city in the nation."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has made several attempts to retain and hire officers
for the Los Angeles Police Department, but he so far has not included
money in his budget to hire officers faster than others are leaving.
The mayor has said, however, that he will allocate those funds if the
hiring climate for new officers improves.</TE>
<TE>   He also has attempted to boost the popularity and reach of
neighborhood councils, panels of residents who work on solving local
problems. In speeches across Los Angeles, Hahn argues that
neighborhood councils serve as a bulwark against the breakup of the
city by giving residents a way to influence the government.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said last week that he wants to have 70 councils up and
running by the end of the year. At present, there are 39 such panels.</TE>
<TE>   Secession supporters counter that the panels, because they are
merely advisory, have no real authority.</TE>

<HD>'Honors' School Plan Falters in Inglewood</HD>
<DH>Education: Some parents and students are disappointed that
the program will be moved from West L.A. College to Morningside High.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was supposed to be where Inglewood's best and brightest would
prepare for college, but a year after its creation, the future of the
city's first "honors" high school is already in question.</LD>
<LD>   The problem began late in the school year when West Los Angeles
College--where the high school students took their courses--announced
that it no longer had the space to accommodate City Honors High
School.</LD>
<LD>   The Inglewood Unified School District scrambled to find an
alternative and decided City Honors could continue as a special
academy within Morningside High School, one of the city's two high
schools.</LD>
<TE>   The students would still take college preparatory classes and be
able to take college courses on the high school campus.</TE>
<TE>   But some parents scoffed at the idea, complaining that their
children would end up at one of the very schools they were trying to
avoid.</TE>
<TE>   For the past two years, both Inglewood high schools have received
the lowest possible ranking--one out of 10--on the state's Academic
Performance Index. City Honors was supposed to be an alternative to
those schools, but parents say it is becoming a watered-down version
of the program they were promised.</TE>
<TE>   "These are some of the brightest kids. How come they're splitting
them up and putting them in this environment and sending them to a
school that scores so poorly?" said Pat Black, whose 15-year-old son,
Fred, attended City Honors last year. "Why do I have to go outside
the district so that my son can attend a blue-ribbon school?"</TE>
<TE>   School board officials are considering other possible sites for
City Honors but, with summer drawing to a close, they know they don't
have much time.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, how fast can we possibly move?" said interim
Supt. Paul Possemato. "We've just got to put everything else aside
and hopefully we can salvage a good program."</TE>
<TE>   About 150 students who accepted admittance to City Honors will be
affected. About 25 have asked the district for waivers to attend
other districts.</TE>
<TE>   If Cynthia Ace's daughter, Brittany, 15, is accepted into another
program, she will leave the district, she said. "Fail me once, shame
on you," Ace said. "Fail me twice, shame on me."</TE>
<TE>   Asmait Haile, 15, who attended City Honors last year, said she was
not sure what she would do.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel like we got stepped on," Asmait said. "I did my part
and they didn't do theirs. But I'll go to an Inglewood high school if
I have to. Some people went there and went to good colleges."</TE>
<TE>   The City Honors students' reluctance to attend Inglewood high
schools disturbs senior Adriana Zuniga, who has taken several honors
and advanced placement courses at Morningside.</TE>
<TE>   "The courses I've taken are nowhere near easy, but they wouldn't
know that because they've never even been on this campus," Zuniga
said. "They haven't taken the time to know anything about it. Our
parents wouldn't let us come here if it was a bad school."</TE>
<TE>   Other parents who attended an open house at Morningside agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "From what I understand, they're going to have the same teachers
and same classes, so we're trying to convince her to come here," said
Ramiro Delgado of his 15-year-old daughter, Renee, who has applied
for a waiver to attend El Segundo High School.</TE>
<TE>   The creation of City Honors High School came less than six months
after the district rejected a proposal for a charter high school in
town. The district said it wanted time to implement its own changes
and City Honors was born.</TE>
<TE>   Students were selected on the basis of grades, scores on
standardized tests and an interview. Once they graduated, parents
were told, City Honors students would have fulfilled entrance
requirements for the University of California and each would have
enough college credits to earn an associate's degree.</TE>
<TE>   But throwing children barely out of the eighth grade onto a
college campus proved to be a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Some students were not ready for the college math and withdrew or
failed, said Principal Evangeline Lewis. There were also tensions
between the students and some college staff members, who were not
comfortable with so many teenagers on campus.</TE>
<TE>   "If we could do it all over, there'd probably be fewer kinks and
more of a support staff, but hindsight is always 20/20," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   Parents complain that the school was put together in a rush and
wasn't planned properly. They fear the same thing is happening again.
But school district officials said the West Los Angeles situation was
just a case of luck.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the victims of bad circumstances and got the rug pulled
out from under us," Possemato said. The district never had a written
contract with the college that guaranteed use of the campus for a set
number of years. And there are still no official contracts with local
colleges to offer classes at City Honors High.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time we are doing nothing with the honors program, but we
did mention that we'd be interested in continuing to offer courses at
their site," said Joe Mendez, a spokesman for West L.A. College.
"It's merely a discussion."</TE>
<TE>   Parents attending the recent open house at Morningside were
repeatedly assured that the students would still attend college
courses at the new school site. But when school board members asked
for specifics during a board meeting last month, district officials
had none to offer.</TE>
<TE>   "We're messing with kids' lives," said board President Cresia
Green-Davis at the meeting. "We're putting a carrot out there but the
carrot is rotten. I haven't seen any plans of how the classes are
going to be offered. We need to have contracts. If you're going to
put an honors high school out there, we need to do it so well that
parents wouldn't have a problem wherever it is--because it's so great
they'd be clamoring to get in."</TE>
<TE>   June Allen, whose daughter, Dakota, 14, attended City Honors last
year, couldn't agree more.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, we were looking at putting her in private schools, but
then I heard that my own neighborhood was doing something worthwhile
and I wanted to be a part of it," Allen said. "But now we come to
find out that it was just a half-baked plan."</TE>

<HD>Inglewood to Act on Citizen Complaints</HD>
<DH>Police: Officials want to clear more than 100 reports filed
against officers. Agency has been moving to resolve case of taped
beating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG and ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City officials in Inglewood have ordered the Police Department to
begin investigating a backlog of more than 100 complaints filed by
citizens against its officers, two of whom face criminal charges for
their roles in the beating of a 16-year-old boy.</LD>
<LD>   City Administrator Joseph Rouzan Jr. said Thursday that he had
ordered Police Chief Ronald Banks to begin investigating the cases
immediately and to file a report on how he intends to clear the
backlog. The Inglewood Police Department is made up of roughly 190
officers; it was not clear how many of those are the subjects of the
backlogged complaints.</LD>
<LD>   Banks had been moving speedily to clear the one case that has
brought his department unwanted nationwide attention, the beating of
16-year-old Donovan Jackson, which was captured on videotape.
Officers Jeremy J. Morse and Bijan Darvish were indicted by a grand
jury in connection with that incident, and Banks has moved to fire
Morse.</LD>
<TE>   But a Superior Court judge halted those proceedings this week when
she temporarily blocked the department from dismissing Morse, who is
criminally charged with assault.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear how long the other cases have languished, but the
Police Department said it had received 58 complaints against officers
from January through mid-July of this year, and has completed many of
those investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The department received 78 complaints last year, and 46 the year
before, according to a police spokeswoman, Lt. Eve Irvine. "A lot of
them have 30-day turnaround times," she said. Seventy-six complaints
filed since the beginning of 1999 have been from people who claim to
be victims of excessive force by officers. The other complaints
include charges of abusive language, civil rights violations and
other alleged misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Allowing complaints to go for long periods without investigation
can seriously compromise the ability of police officials to
discipline officers found guilty of misconduct. In most cases, after
one year, even the most serious offenses can be administratively
handled only with reprimands; state law usually prohibits officials
from suspending or firing officers for complaints that have
languished for more than 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   Although the department did not provide figures from before 1999,
City Atty. Charles Dickerson provided a list of 170 cases since 1990
in which lawsuits were filed against Inglewood police officers for
civil rights violations, shootings and alleged use of excessive
force. The city has paid out $1.8 million in claims for those cases,
but hasn't had to pay more than $100,000 in a case since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine said the department could not say how many complaint
investigations are still open. Asked if the department could check
its files, she said, "We just don't have the staffing to do that."</TE>
<TE>   She also would not say how many complaints have been sustained, or
how many officers have faced discipline or firing as a result of
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Banks, who declined to comment on the backlog, has been under
intense pressure to defuse tension following the videotaped
altercation between police and Jackson at a gas station July 6. The
nationally televised tape shows Morse slamming Jackson onto a car,
then punching him in the face.</TE>
<TE>   His effort to quickly fire Morse came to a halt Wednesday when
Judge Jean E. Matusinka issued a temporary restraining order against
Banks and the city, ordering them to present their case in court Aug.
28.</TE>
<TE>   Morse's attorney in the administrative action, Richard Levine, had
asked for the restraining order, alleging that the department
violated state law by not reading Morse his constitutional rights
before he was initially questioned and not allowing him to have his
preferred attorney present at a later interrogation. Levine also
alleged that Morse was not provided with notes, reports and other
documents.</TE>
<TE>   Morse also submitted a declaration to the court saying that he was
interrogated during his off-duty hours, which his attorney said in
court papers is another violation of the police officers' bill of
rights, a state code that spells out protections given to police.</TE>
<TE>   Rouzan said that the allegations are not valid and that the city
plans to appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just flabbergasted that the court did not allow us to
continue our administrative process," Rouzan said. "To stop it in the
middle is highly unusual."</TE>
<TE>   Rouzan said that Morse had not exhausted his remedies within the
city.</TE>
<TE>   Banks recommended Aug. 1 that Morse be terminated, and he gave the
officer written notification of his decision.</TE>
<TE>   Banks had scheduled a meeting with Morse for Monday, when the
officer would have had an opportunity to try to change the chief's
mind. That meeting has been postponed. Morse also can request an
arbitration hearing, Rouzan said.</TE>
<TE>   Matusinka ruled that Morse would suffer "irreparable injury" if
the department took punitive action against him before the court
hearing. The city and the Police Department now have to give the
judge reasons that she should not issue a preliminary injunction
preventing the termination.</TE>
<TE>   In his recommendations issued Aug. 1, Banks also indicated that he
believes Darvish, Morse's partner, deserves a short suspension for
his role in the incident. Darvish has been charged criminally with
filing a false police report. In his report, Darvish described the
blow to Jackson's face but did not mention that Morse had slammed the
boy onto the car.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Darvish wrote that Morse "assisted Jackson to his feet
and had him stand facing the police vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   The department's swift action against Morse and Darvish contrasts
with the department's usual practice, which is to wait until criminal
proceedings against either the officer or the complaining citizen are
completed before conducting an internal investigation, according to
Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Rouzan, who served as police chief in both Inglewood and Compton
before becoming city administrator, said it's not uncommon for police
departments to wait for the completion of criminal cases before
undertaking internal investigations, in part because attorneys for
complainants often advise them not to talk to investigators until the
criminal proceedings are through.</TE>
<TE>   Rouzan also revealed Thursday that Morse has been the subject of
"more than half a dozen" complaints in the past year.</TE>
<TE>   That many complaints, he said, "certainly should ring an alarm
bell.... If you start seeing the same guy or gal's name on a
complaint three or four times a year, you want to take a look at that
and say, 'What's going on here?' "</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>STOCKTON--A state panel has found that a San Joaquin County judge
fixed parking tickets for friends and tried to influence a fellow
jurist.</LD>
<LD>   This week the Commission on Judicial Performance ordered Judge
Michael Platt, 53, removed from the bench.</LD>
<LD>   The commission found that Platt dismissed the tickets--for a
bailiff's son, Minnesota Twins pitcher Eddie Guardado, his wife and
his niece--which involved matters not being argued before him.</LD>
<TE>   The panel also said that Platt tried to get another judge to grant
a conditional release to a friend, then lied about it.</TE>
<TE>   Platt's attorney, Albert Ellis, said that he did not agree with
the findings and that Platt plans to ask the state Supreme Court to
review his case. The commission cleared Platt of charges of improper
issue of a stay, influencing a judge in a family court hearing and
trying to dismiss a ticket for his godfather.</TE>

<HD>Westminster's Lam to Retire From Politics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Lam, the first Vietnamese American elected to public office in
the United States, announced Thursday that he is retiring from
politics and will not seek a fourth term on the Westminster City
Council.</LD>
<LD>   Lam, 75, said he wants to spend more time with his wife, Hop,
their six children and nine grandchildren. He also plans to work as
the general manager of his nephew's tofu plant in Westminster.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to enjoy other interests, so I have made the bittersweet
decision not to run for reelection," Lam said at a news conference as
he choked back tears.</LD>
<TE>   Lam was hailed as a political trailblazer when he won a seat on
the Westminster council in 1992. Many in the city praised him for
helping unite the city's huge Vietnamese population with the rest of
the city.</TE>
<TE>   But Lam has faced his share of criticism.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, he was faulted by some in Little Saigon for not being
more outspoken after a video merchant displayed a picture of the late
North Vietnamese communist leader Ho Chi Minh in his store. A group
of activists protested in front of Lam's restaurant that year. He
also was frequently attacked in the Vietnamese-language media for not
being sufficiently anti-communist.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in the arena and indeed my face has been marred with
dust, sweat and blood," Lam said, reflecting on his years in office.
"Despite the hardships, I have loved every minute of it."</TE>
<TE>   In Vietnam, Lam worked for the United States Agency for
International Development, and later became an industrialist and
owner of construction and processing plants.</TE>
<TE>   After fleeing his homeland at the end of the Vietnam War, he began
a new life in the United States in 1975 as an insurance agent. Later
he became co-owner and operator of three restaurants in Little
Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   He served on the board of trustees of Humana Hospital and the
Orange County Community Council and was president of the Orange
County Vietnamese-American Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Lam billed himself as a "crime fighter, tax fighter" when he won
office in 1992. He worked to help Vietnamese immigrants get business
licenses and pushed for construction of a senior center.</TE>
<TE>   He is also credited with helping convince the state to place
"Little Saigon" freeway markers.</TE>
<TE>   "My effort was to bring the Vietnamese into mainstream America,"
Lam said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have hailed Lam for overcoming barriers between the two
cultures. "He's always tried to meld the two traditions and cultures
together," said Reginald Crozier, a member of Westminster's Cultural
Arts Commission who has known Lam for six years. "He's offered a
richness that we didn't have before."</TE>
<TE>   Said Lam: "To friends and foes, the torch has been passed to a new
generation. I've paid my dues."</TE>

<HD>$2-Million Malibu Real Estate Looks, Well, Just Average</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carol Bird makes up cute little names for all the houses she sells in
Malibu. She hands me the brochure for the house we are about to view,
and this one's called Sculpture by the Sea.</LD>
<LD>   I'm not exactly in the market for a house. Especially not a
$2,295,000 house. I'm here because of a story I saw in the Malibu
Times.</LD>
<LD>   "It wasn't supposed to be this good of a year," real estate agent
Rick Wallace's article began.</LD>
<TE>   Wallace figured the fallout from Sept. 11, followed by the
economic belly-flop, would have kept high-end prices from taking
flight. But when he ran the numbers on single-family home sales in
Malibu's 90265 ZIP Code for the first six months of 2002, he came up
with two all-time highs.</TE>
<TE>   The average sale price was $2 million, and the median price hit
$1.375 million, meaning half the 152 houses sold for more and half
for less.</TE>
<TE>   So much for troubled times.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate continues to appreciate across the country, and agents
who work in Beverly Hills, Holmby Hills and Bel-Air tell me their
averages are in the same ballpark as Malibu's, though probably a
little lower. The combination of low interest rates, short supply and
prestige is making Malibu one of the hottest markets in the country.</TE>
<TE>   But what exactly does average mean? Does $2 million buy you a
mansion or a shack? Does it put you on the beach, or up the hill and
behind a rock?</TE>
<TE>   Rick Wallace didn't have much on the market right now, so he
referred me to Bird, a Coldwell Banker colleague. And now I am about
to experience Sculpture by the Sea.</TE>
<TE>   The first thing I notice is that there isn't any visible sculpture
and it isn't by the sea. It's a modern four-bedroom white structure
far enough up Big Rock Road to give you a nosebleed. But when you
walk in the front door, the 180-degree ocean view through the back
window is stunning.</TE>
<TE>   "There's the queen's necklace," Bird tells me, pointing to the
distant Santa Monica shoreline, which apparently looks like a
necklace when the lights go on at night.</TE>
<TE>   I'm still a little confused about the name Sculpture by the Sea.</TE>
<TE>   "The house is like sculpture," Bird explains. "The interior walls
are curved and every room has an ocean view except for the gym. It's
very emotional."</TE>
<TE>   For some people, maybe. But the main room, with white shag, curved
glass barriers and chrome handrails, looks less like a home than a
penthouse suite in Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, I'd like to have a house on the water, so I can invite
riffraff over all the time and let them annoy the moguls who try to
block access to the beach. But Bird tells me the beach bungalows tend
to go for $6 million and up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's gone bananas," says June Scott, a Coldwell agent who works
Beverly Hills and Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Scott said she recently sold Malibu beach houses for $10 million
and $11.75 million to the owner of the Cheesecake Factory (doesn't
this mean we're paying too much for a slice of cheesecake?) and the
CEO of Oracle (which won a controversial state contract and then
pushed a $25,000 donation to Gov. Gray Davis in a deal that became a
political debacle).</TE>
<TE>   Maybe there's already enough riffraff on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I sold David Geffen the house he's in for $450,000 in about
1972," says Scott, who believes that with the upgrades he's made, he
could sell it for $50 million today. "He's the one who got this whole
thing started," she said of getting the high and mighty to move to
Malibu. "This way they can walk down the beach and meet each other
and do business right there."</TE>
<TE>   The second house Carol Bird showed me is called Having It All!
Beach not included. This $2,250,000 number is farther up the coast
and much larger than Sculpture by the Sea, but it has even less
character and overlooks busy Kanan Dume Road.</TE>
<TE>   "It's your own little Hawaii," Bird said out back, where she noted
that the fountains draining into the swimming pool have been designed
to gurgle at the perfect decibel level to block out street noise.</TE>
<TE>   Well, fine, but what if the fountains are turned off? At $2
million-plus, I don't want street racket or any other compromise. I
want to, well, Have It All!</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the plight of the Malibu ne'er-do-well who can only afford
a $1-million house.</TE>
<TE>   "One million dollars buys you a fixer-upper in a fair location, or
a fair house in a less desirable location," says Bird, who is
pleasant and direct.</TE>
<TE>   She then took me even farther up the coast. We passed Point Dume
and Zuma Beach, turned up into the hills, and came to a property
selling for exactly $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "This is four acres," Bird said, parking her Jeep at the perfect
angle. "It's a white-water view, not just open ocean. The white-water
view is primo."</TE>
<TE>   "And it's $2 million?"</TE>
<TE>   Yes, she said. And the adjacent, 5.3-acre property is also $2
million.</TE>
<TE>   Just one problem. You'd have to pitch a tent, because there's no
house here. Not even a stick. It's $2 million for just the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   Bird's brochure calls it:</TE>
<TE>   "Amazing Views 1 and 2!"</TE>

<HD>Neighbor Takes a Dim View of New School Building</HD>
<DH>Ojai: Where there was once a mountain panorama, the
homeowner's backyard vista is now filled by a classroom structure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anne Woolsey's Grandview Avenue home has always been an ideal spot to
watch the setting sun bathe the Topatopa Mountains in a rosy glow,
providing her a panorama of Ojai's celebrated "pink moment."</LD>
<LD>   But that changed last month when a construction crew at nearby
Topa Topa Elementary School in Ojai began assembling a new classroom
building in the lot next to Woolsey's backyard. This came as a
surprise to Woolsey, who said she never received notification the
project was even being considered.</LD>
<LD>   "It kind of dwarfs my house," she said of the row of white,
one-story, modular units on the other side of the fence lining her
property.</LD>
<TE>   Now, instead of seeing the beautiful vista for which her street
was named, Woolsey has a view of the building rising over her hedges.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lost all my privacy--it looks in my living room, dining room
and kitchen," she said of the building.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to losing her view, Woolsey worries that
air-conditioner units attached to the rear of the school building
will create unnecessary noise. Those concerns prompted her to file a
complaint with the school superintendent's office last month and
write letters to each member of the Ojai school board.</TE>
<TE>   In the letters, Woolsey cited her fear that loss of the mountain
view could affect the value of her property. She found an advocate in
school board member Bob Unruhe, who recently visited her property to
see how construction had affected her view.</TE>
<TE>   Unruhe said he was surprised the Ojai Unified School District
decided to build the structure at this location.</TE>
<TE>   "The building could have been put in a different location, so this
wouldn't have happened," he said. "It wasn't very good planning. I
feel we're not being good neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   But school district officials defended their decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not doubting we've obstructed her view," Assistant Supt. Tim
Baird said. "But we really need to do what's best for students."</TE>
<TE>   Safety was the primary reason the kindergarten classroom building
was relocated, Baird said. Kindergarten classes had been held in an
annex away from the main school building.</TE>
<TE>   The new structure was built on a site that allows the school to
create an enclosed play area nearby, within sight of the main office,
Baird said. Placing the classrooms in front of the school offers
parents an easy drop-off point, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Baird acknowledged that residents were not notified of the pending
construction. "That was a mistake," he said. "We're not obligated by
law to do that, but we usually do. We dropped the ball."</TE>
<TE>   But he said the school district tried to consider the needs of
neighbors. The classrooms were positioned 40 feet from neighbors'
property lines and are separated by a drainage ditch.</TE>
<TE>   Also, he said, the district purchased high-end, quiet
air-conditioners to minimize noise. Baird said he has yet to hear
complaints from any other residents.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Arellanes, who owns the corner lot across from Woolsey's
house, can see the new classrooms from her home.</TE>
<TE>   While glad the district is building a permanent structure for
students, Arellanes sympathized with her neighbor's plight. "The fact
that a woman has lost her view is a bogus deal," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Arellanes said she also understands the school's need for more
classroom space. She finds the new building more aesthetically
pleasing than the portable classrooms it replaced.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a definite improvement," she said. "It's kind of a shame
that it's blocked a view like that, but you can't satisfy all the
people all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Woolsey plans to attend the school board's Aug. 20 meeting to
plead her case. But she doesn't hold out much hope she will be able
to persuade officials to relocate the classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Kathi Smith, president of the school board, agreed that such a
move was unlikely</TE>
<TE>   "I can't predict what the board would do," she said. "I'm open to
listening to her complaint. But I feel that she would have to
convince me that it's pretty serious."</TE>
<TE>   Woolsey is pondering other options. She has considered mediation
or legal action and has spoken with an attorney. But she shies away
from discussing whether she will actually file a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather they be nice about it, but I don't know that they're
willing to negotiate in any way," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "They've just flat out said they're not going to move it."</TE>

<HD>Sizing Up Gigante's Problem</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I wouldn't know a chimichanga from a chile relleno, a frijole from a
flauta. I'm as likely to enter a Carmelite nunnery as a Mexican
supermarket. If you send me to the store for a jar of salsa, repeat
the instructions very, very carefully.</LD>
<LD>   In short, Mexican grocery stores are not on a list of things I
need. But as my therapist constantly reminds me, the world doesn't
revolve around me.</LD>
<LD>   And in some Orange County cities--Anaheim comes to mind--a Mexican
supermarket makes perfect sense.</LD>
<TE>   That's what the owners of Gigante USA thought. Gigante is a
Mexican supermarket chain that has stores in Southern California but
none in Orange County, where Latinos make up 30% of the population.
In Anaheim, the figure is pushing 50%.</TE>
<TE>   So far, City Hall has nudged Gigante away from either of two sites
the chain had in mind--the latest being the Anaheim Plaza in north
Anaheim that the city has worked to revitalize. For the record, the
city says it welcomes Gigante, but not in the places the chain
wanted. Problem is, the city considered both sites suitable for more
well-known Southern California supermarket chains.</TE>
<TE>   We've been down this aisle before, haven't we? One side says
ethnicity has nothing to do with it. The other side says ethnicity
has everything to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not in the business of divining people's innermost thoughts.
Maybe Anaheim city officials have some rock-ribbed, ledger-driven
analysis that tells them a Mexican supermarket won't generate the
business traffic it wants in the mall where the chain hoped to build.</TE>
<TE>   It could be as simple as that, but I doubt it. I doubt it because
it isn't likely that Gigante would want to open a store where it
couldn't draw customers. Unless they're run by the dumbest
businesspeople around, they've done market research that tells them
they have a customer base.</TE>
<TE>   If Anaheim believed a Ralphs or Albertsons made sense in the
renewed plaza, why not a Gigante?</TE>
<TE>   You're almost forced to conclude that the city, knowing that
Gigante trumpets its Mexican-ness with music and signs in Spanish,
would send out the wrong signals. Those signals emanate from the
long-running Anglo-Latino cultural battle that seems to be going on,
even if many around here live their lives unconcerned about it.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim has been a particular hotbed of that battle. It is but one
of many Orange County cities whose largely white populations have
been transformed in the last quarter-century by immigrants from all
over. To the extent that people with different cultural habits
displace what existed before, it's naive to say that many Anaheim
residents don't feel they've lost some of their culture.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair to the city, I doubt many others in Orange County have
as diverse a restaurant row as it does. American, Mexican, Arab,
Persian, German ... you name it, Anaheim probably has it.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the perceived Latino "threat" often seems to bubble up there.
From bilingualism in schools to deportation centers in its jail,
Anaheim has been a flashpoint for the county's changing demographics.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Gigante. For all those Anaheim residents convinced Latino
immigrants want to take over rather than assimilate, a Mexican
grocery store probably represents a frightening step in the
evolution.</TE>
<TE>   Today a grocery store, tomorrow a ... what?</TE>
<TE>   I'm as white-bread as they come, and I've never understood that
fear. Why is a society that embraces Chinatown and Little Saigon
somehow convinced that Mexicans and Guatemalans and Hondurans are
going to join forces and reconstitute American life?</TE>
<TE>   People fear this despite overwhelming evidence of the Americanism
that many Spanish-speaking immigrants ultimately absorb and the fact
that Anglos and Latinos work together, play together and marry.</TE>
<TE>   A Gigante problem facing Anaheim?</TE>
<TE>   Nah, more like chiquito.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Vu Ngoc Nha, 74, a former friend and advisor to two South Vietnam
presidents who worked as a spy for North Vietnam during the war, died
Wednesday after a long illness at his home in Ho Chi Minh City.</LD>
<LD>   Born to a Catholic family in North Vietnam, Nha became a member of
the Communist Party in 1949 and was ordered to infiltrate South
Vietnam in 1955 to set up a spy network.</LD>
<LD>   Posing as a pious Catholic, he became an insider in the
governments of presidents Ngo Dinh Diem and Nguyen Van Thieu.</LD>
<TE>   Exposed by the CIA in 1969, Nha was sentenced to hard labor for
life for giving the communists minutes of the Midway meeting between
Presidents Richard Nixon and Thieu, details of American troop
withdrawals and other strategic information.</TE>
<TE>   Nha also persuaded Thieu to allow South Vietnamese soldiers to
take a few days off for the Tet (lunar) new year in late January
1968, thus lowering defenses in the cities for the major communist
offensive.</TE>
<TE>   "History will turn the page," Nha said with a wave of his hand
after being sentenced in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   After the North's victory in 1975, he became a high-ranking
officer in the communist army's intelligence branch.</TE>

<LD>Daniel Kelly, 71, patriarch of the Irish American folk, rock and pop
group the Kelly Family, died Monday in Germany after a long illness.</LD>
<LD>   The Kelly Family--four sons and two daughters--is a phenomenon in
Europe, where they have sold more than 15 million albums and perform
at sold-out concerts. Their 1994 album "Over the Hump" sold 4.5
million copies.</LD>
<LD>   Kelly and his wife, Barbara Ann, and their children left the
United States in 1966 and settled in Spain, where the children began
singing and dancing to folk music with their parents.</LD>
<TE>   Family members made their Spanish television debut in 1975 and
then began touring. By the late 1970s, they had their first recording
contract. They had their first hit in Holland and Belgium in 1980
with "Who'll Come with Me."</TE>
<TE>   The family, which for years lived on a houseboat in Cologne's
harbor, bought a castle in western Germany in 1998 for $7.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Ann Kelly died in 1982. Kelly had a major stroke in 1990.</TE>

<KH>THE INGLEWOOD BEATING</KH>
<HD>Police Must Undergo Cultural Training</HD>
<DH>Reforms: After beating incident, City Council votes to put
taping devices in cars and require exams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reacting to the videotaped police beating of a 16-year-old boy, the
Inglewood City Council has voted to install video cameras and
recording devices in all police cars and to make all officers undergo
cultural sensitivity training and regular psychological examinations.</LD>
<LD>   Another council recommendation, which would create a citizens
review panel appointed by the mayor, probably will be voted on next
week.</LD>
<LD>   The resolutions, passed at Tuesday's City Council meeting, have
been opposed by representatives of the Inglewood Police Assn., who
say the new rules violate the terms of their contract.</LD>
<TE>   In reply, Mayor Roosevelt Dorn said the council's actions would
greatly improve the embattled police force.</TE>
<TE>   "None of these changes are made because I think we have a bad
Police Department," Dorn said. "We have one of the finest police
departments in the country, but that does not mean that we cannot
continue to improve."</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the police group, a union with 147 members, said they
had never been included in any plans to change department policy.
They are awaiting a final draft of the resolutions before they take
legal action, said a spokesman, Neil Murray.</TE>
<TE>   "We will drag the city into court," Murray said. "We're not going
to sit around while they try to impose this on us. Whenever you make
changes in working conditions, you have to sit down with that group
of people who these changes will affect, and that never happened
here."</TE>
<TE>   But Lt. Eve Irvine, the Police Department's spokeswoman, gave no
indication that the department would challenge the council's actions.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just waiting to find out what will be required," Irvine
said.</TE>
<TE>   After the resolutions are implemented, all officers will have to
complete an unspecified amount of cultural sensitivity training, in
addition to the basic cultural awareness courses they take before
they join the force.</TE>
<TE>   They will also have to submit to psychological evaluations every
three years. Currently, those tests are given only during the
application process.</TE>
<TE>   Murray said that cameras in police vehicles and a citizens review
board are acceptable, but that the association is most concerned with
the new training and psychological testing requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "When our people came on board, that was never a condition of hire
and now they're going to have to [undergo psychological testing]
because the city is bowing to media hysteria," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   The 193-officer department has been under a microscope since July
6, when Officer Jeremy J. Morse was caught on tape slamming a
handcuffed Donovan Jackson onto the trunk of a patrol car. Seconds
later, Morse was seen punching the youth in the face.</TE>
<TE>   The tape, which reminded many of the Rodney G. King beating in Los
Angeles, set off angry protests and calls for an overhaul of the
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Dorn, who introduced the resolutions, said the new policies are
reasonable, necessary and in no way a public relations move. These
were plans he had had for a long time, but he had been waiting for
the appropriate political climate to introduce them, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sure I could get the votes at this time," Dorn said. "When
an opportunity presents itself, you take advantage of that
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Dorn said the new policies, for which he could not estimate a
cost, would take effect as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Another change, which would require video and audio taping of
police interviews involving criminal matters or interrogations, was
being researched by city officials, Dorn said.</TE>
<TE>   Morse and his partner, Bijan Darvish, have been indicted by the
Los Angeles County Grand Jury.</TE>
<TE>   Each could serve three years in prison if convicted.</TE>

<HD>Preschools to Receive $100 Million</HD>
<DH>Revenue: County panel will use tobacco taxes to create a
system, enroll 100,000 children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A commission voted Thursday to spend $100 million in tobacco tax
money on a broad-based system of all-day preschools that would be
free for all Los Angeles County toddlers.</LD>
<LD>   The five-year initiative, one of the largest of its kind
nationally, could begin enrolling participants within six months to a
year.</LD>
<LD>   It would initially benefit as many as 100,000 children now on the
waiting list for subsidized preschool slots, and eventually could
enroll another 100,000 or more.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a revolutionary and extraordinary undertaking," said Rob
Reiner, the filmmaker and advocate for children who spearheaded the
state tobacco tax. "We are not only giving children a better chance
to succeed in school but in life. We are going to be able to cut
crime and create a stronger economy as a result of what we give these
children early on."</TE>
<TE>   The initiative initially will target 3- and 4-year-olds and seek
to dramatically expand existing services, including Head Start
programs, child-care centers and home-based family child care. Later,
younger children will be included and new facilities built.</TE>
<TE>   The plan represents one of the biggest initiatives to date for the
Los Angeles County Children and Families First Commission, which was
established in 1998 to oversee Proposition 10 tobacco tax revenues.</TE>
<TE>   The nine-member panel acknowledged the tremendous challenge posed
by the preschool plan, but it said the dramatic effort to improve the
readiness of children entering school is exactly what Proposition 10
was designed for.</TE>
<TE>   This system "has been lacking not only in Los Angeles County but
in the rest of the country," said Commissioner Marvin Southard, who
is director of the county Department of Mental Health.</TE>
<TE>   The preschool plan was praised by child care advocates as a bold
move that could make the county a national model in early childhood
education.</TE>
<TE>   Caprice Young, president of the Los Angeles Unified Board of
Education, told the commissioners that local educators would do
everything they could to make the plan work.</TE>
<TE>   The school board has already voted to place an $80-million bond
measure on the November ballot to be used to build early childhood
education programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt it was so important for us to get ahead of the curve and
... provide the facilities so that all of this can happen," Young
said.</TE>
<TE>   At first the preschool initiative will target low-income children
eligible for subsidized care, and will expand half-day programs to a
full day. The commission also will seek to improve the quality of all
programs, stressing reading and math skills.</TE>
<TE>   In time, the initiative will open slots to middle-income families
who otherwise might not be able to afford them and will establish a
credentialing program for preschool teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners stressed that in the long run, the plan is intended
to provide enhanced child care for infants too, regardless of family
income.</TE>
<TE>   Tanya Lopez, a mother of two whose son was on a waiting list for a
year before he landed a spot, hopes the initiative means her 1-
year-old daughter won't have to wait as long.</TE>
<TE>   "If parents don't have to worry about finding someplace for their
children, or the quality of the centers, it's a great thing," said
Lopez, who is on a parents committee at her son's preschool,
Children's Institute International.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative is the second major commitment of money approved by
the commission. Last month, the panel approved a five-year,
$100-million plan to provide health-care coverage for low-income
children who are not covered by other subsidized programs.</TE>
<TE>   The states of Georgia and Oklahoma are the only other
jurisdictions to fund broad-based access to preschool, according to
education experts. Georgia's lottery-financed program is free to any
family and has enrolled about 70% of the state's preschoolers.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners hope to enroll about the same percentage of Los
Angeles County's nearly 300,000 3- and 4-year-olds.</TE>
<TE>   The vote capped an intensive campaign to enlist the support of
child-care and preschool providers, community leaders, educators and
public officials. Reiner had broached the idea of universal preschool
in Los Angeles County only within the last few months.</TE>
<TE>   He was motivated by a sense of urgency, knowing that as smoking
decreases, revenues generated by the tobacco tax will decline as
well. He argued that the concept of providing an enriching
environment for young children and relief for working parents was
something the public could readily grasp and would support even when
tobacco funds ran out.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 10, also known as the California Children and Families
First Act, was approved by voters in 1998. It levies a 50-cent per
pack tax on cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   The proposition established a statewide commission and 58 local
county commissions to oversee the tax revenues. Los Angeles County,
which has sole discretion over how to spend its portion, received
about $164 million this year. Statewide, about $700 million is
generated each year.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty percent of the overall revenue goes to the state commission
for technical assistance to counties and for research into the best
ways to aid child development.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of Proposition 10 funds--80%--go to the county
commissions, which must develop strategies on providing services for
young children. Members of each commission are appointed by the
county Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Counties have discretion to use funds to meet local needs, as long
as they meet the overall aim of fostering early childhood
development. Santa Clara, San Francisco and a few other counties have
used the taxes to fund health measures similar to that recently
adopted in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Since the money started flowing in late 2000, Los Angeles County
has received about $550 million from the state commission. With the
preschool and health-care initiatives, most of that money has been
allocated.</TE>

<HD>Judge Again Rejects State Radioactive Waste Plan</HD>
<DH>Court: Material cannot be shipped to ordinary landfills,
even though U.S. standard allows it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time in three months, a judge has rebuffed efforts by
the administration of Gov. Gray Davis to allow waste from
decommissioned nuclear facilities that may contain radioactive
material to be shipped to ordinary landfills.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling Thursday by Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Gail
D. Ohanesian requires the state to forsake a recently adopted federal
radiation standard. That standard was at least 10 times more
permissive than one that would have governed waste slated for the
Ward Valley low-level nuclear waste facility near Needles, Calif. The
Ward Valley site was abandoned because of opposition from, among
others, Davis before he was governor.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling Thursday came in response to a lawsuit by anti-nuclear
activists who argued that the state's policy would allow dangerous
radioactive waste to be dumped in community landfills that lack
appropriate safeguards.</LD>
<TE>   Ohanesian's order also requires the state to submit all recent or
pending decommissioning actions for review by the judge, in part to
determine whether any such waste already is in municipal landfills.</TE>
<TE>   The decision leaves the state in a bind over how to define a
"clean" former nuclear site. What is certain is that the state
Department of Health Services cannot formally adopt the federal
government's standard without public hearings or an environmental
study that weighs other alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   The judge's decision essentially restates a writ issued in May,
when she ordered the state to vacate its new regulation.</TE>
<TE>   The state continued to operate under its new rule, arguing that
California was required by federal law to enforce at least the
federal standard until a new regulation could be written.</TE>
<TE>   The judge rejected that position Thursday. Though not ordering the
state to stop decommissioning sites, Ohanesian reserved the right to
review current or pending decommissionings.</TE>
<TE>   "This is sending shock waves through the administration," said Dan
Hirsch, president of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, one of two
anti-nuclear groups that sued the state over the regulations. "They
thought they could keep doing it."</TE>
<TE>   The state's top radiologic health official said Thursday that his
agency would continue decommissioning nuclear facilities on a
case-by-case basis, opting to keep radiation "as low as reasonably
achievable."</TE>
<TE>   Whether any radioactive material from former nuclear sites wound
up in landfills since the state adopted the new rule in November is
uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any knowledge as to what happens to material once a
site is decommissioned," said David M. Souleles, chief deputy
director of programs at the Department of Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch said he believes that several thousand tons of radioactive
waste were shipped to the Bradley Landfill in the San Fernando Valley
over the last few years, and several hundred tons of metals from the
former Santa Susana Rocketdyne nuclear reactor site were sent to a
recycler in the same period.</TE>
<TE>   State regulations do not prescribe any specific radiation level
for landfills, said state Deputy Atty. Gen. Barbara Sheldon, who
defended the state against the suit.</TE>
<TE>   However, rules in place before the federal standard was adopted in
November say that all radioactive contamination should be eliminated,
and do not allow disposal in anything but a licensed radioactive
waste site, Hirsch said.</TE>
<TE>   To set a specific standard, the Davis administration would have to
begin an environmental impact process that considers more stringent
benchmarks than the federal ones.</TE>
<TE>   Alternatively, the Legislature could adopt its own standards. Two
bills setting stricter radiation levels are pending.</TE>
<TE>   Activists like Hirsch are concerned that under the current federal
standard, a "hot" item could be unearthed and sent to a landfill
unequipped to contain it.</TE>

<HD>OCTA Raises Rail Issues With Irvine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Top Orange County transportation officials warned Irvine city leaders
Thursday that a host of critical issues must be resolved before they
will agree to eliminate another leg of the county's long-stalled
CenterLine rail project.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Larry Agran and Councilman Mike Ward want to lop off six
miles of the proposed 18-mile CenterLine rail project and end the
first phase at Irvine City Hall. The change means the proposed
commuter train would not reach the Irvine Spectrum commercial complex
or the Irvine Transportation Center.</LD>
<LD>   Agran, who faces reelection in November, contends that shortening
the line would help defuse opposition in several politically powerful
Irvine neighborhoods and improve the project's chances for federal
funding.</LD>
<TE>   The city's proposal prompted Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who serves
as the Orange County Transportation Authority board chairman, to call
a special meeting of the agency's planning and operations committee
Thursday to review the proposal to trim the line. "We need to tell
Irvine what our concerns are. I have questions about a terminus at
City Hall," Spitzer said. Only a "political junkie," he quipped,
would take a train to City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Ending the rail line at the Irvine Business Complex, John Wayne
Airport or UC Irvine would make more sense, one committee member
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA is the main agency behind CenterLine, a light-rail system
that, as now drawn, would run from the Irvine train station and pass
through Costa Mesa before turning north to the Santa Ana
Transportation Center. Preliminary engineering studies are underway.</TE>
<TE>   Higher Costs Feared</TE>
<TE>   Committee members said a cutback would prevent the line from
reaching Irvine's rail station and might drive up costs by forcing
OCTA to provide more bus service and other transit improvements at
Irvine City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The panel also wondered how Irvine would handle the potential
growth in traffic caused by locating the last stop in the government
complex.</TE>
<TE>   Because the line would not go to the transit center, the proposal
would eliminate a CenterLine maintenance yard planned at the retired
El Toro Marine base. Board members said that would force OCTA to
consider building a facility near the Santa Ana station, where it
would probably face political opposition.</TE>
<TE>   At the committee meeting, Marty Bryant, Irvine's deputy director
of public works, said Agran and Ward did not consider the proposed
route to the Irvine Transportation Center as the "best place to move
forward."</TE>
<TE>   Petition Drive Planned</TE>
<TE>   The path crosses through or near Woodbridge and Oak Creek, two
neighborhoods where there has been strong political opposition to
CenterLine. Some residents are planning a citywide initiative drive
against the project.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of going through those communities, Bryant said, the city
would like to use another route to connect the line to the transit
hub at a later date. That path would go north to the Tustin train
station and travel along the Metrolink right of way to the
transportation center.</TE>
<TE>   But Spitzer cautioned that if OCTA and the city agree to reduce
the project by six miles, there might not be any guarantee that funds
would be available in the future to restore the transit center link.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine City Council plans to take up the matter Tuesday.</TE>

<LD>The Police Department announced Thursday that it is closing its
investigation into the death of an inline skater earlier this year,
concurring with the coroner that the man did not appear to have died
as the result of a paint-ball attack.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Michael Holdren, 54, of Newport Beach died after spending two
weeks in a coma following a skating accident March 24 in the Upper
Newport Bay Ecological Reserve. Because of evidence found at the
scene and on his body, police initially speculated that he had been
hit by paint balls.</LD>
<LD>   On the basis of an autopsy, however, the coroner's office
attributed the death to "blunt head trauma" and classified it as an
accident. Police officials agreed and said their inquiry had
uncovered no evidence that paint balls had caused Holdren to fall.</LD>

<HD>Boxer Pushing for Stricter Cleanup</HD>
<DH>Environment: During Chatsworth visit, U.S. senator says she
will continue to urge Boeing and federal agencies to adopt tougher
standards at Santa Susana lab.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer paid a visit on Thursday to a Chatsworth
couple's home, where she fielded questions and discussed concerns
among neighbors of Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field Laboratory, the
site of an ongoing cleanup of radioactive and chemical waste.</LD>
<LD>   The Democratic legislator used the informal meeting at the home of
George and Eleanore Rembaum to assure residents that she would
continue pushing Boeing, Rocketdyne's parent company, the Department
of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency to strengthen
cleanup standards at the lab.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to be all over this and continue to be a thorn in their
sides," said Boxer.</LD>
<TE>   Through the years, Boxer has urged federal regulators to impose
stringent EPA standards for cleanup of the hilltop lab, a former
nuclear power development facility that is still used for Department
of Defense-sponsored rocket engine and missile testing.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, Boxer asked then Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to
prepare a comprehensive environmental review of the site. The
department decided on an environmental assessment of past and ongoing
cleanup operations that would be conducted by a panel of government
experts.</TE>
<TE>   But Boxer has maintained that the scale of the cleanup and the
severity of the contamination warrant a full environmental impact
statement, which would include analysis of methodology and standards
and would allow for public involvement in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Residents and community leaders are concerned that too much
contamination remains in the lab's soil, posing a long-term threat to
Rocketdyne workers and neighbors. A decision on what type of
environmental review will be undertaken is expected later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer has also asked EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman to
ensure that the Rocketdyne cleanup is consistent with her agency's
own standards, which are more rigorous than those established by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Whitman informed Boxer in a letter in
May 2001 that the EPA was prepared to provide a thorough survey of
the site.</TE>
<TE>   But residents of the area told Boxer they worry because these
issues remain unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't understand why they would be so reluctant to go by EPA
standards," said Barbara Johnson, a resident of Susana Knolls and
member of the Rocketdyne Clean Up Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer listened as other residents and former Rocketdyne workers
talked about how they believed the cancers they had contracted
through the years may be directly related to their proximity to the
lab.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't need a degree to see that people are getting sick near
the site," Boxer said.</TE>
<TE>   But officials at Rocketdyne said that the lab does not pose a
safety or health threat to its neighbors. They said the cleanup
should be completed by 2007 or 2008. All but three of the 28
facilities formerly used for nuclear testing have been removed, said
Steve Lafflam, Rocketdyne's director for safety, health and
environmental affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Lafflam said he believes current cleanup standards "are protective
of public health." But he said Boeing would abide by stricter
standards if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   He said the company's main goal is to finish the cleanup as soon
as possible. Lafflam said to do the kind of environmental review that
Boxer is advocating would delay operations by three or four years.</TE>
<TE>   Those attending Thursday's meeting said they would join with Boxer
in continuing to push for stricter cleanup standards at the lab.
Jeanne Londe, an 81-year-old Reseda resident, told the senator that
for the first time in the 13 years that she's been active in the
contamination issue, "I feel some hope."</TE>

<LD>   "I'm going to be all over this and continue to be a thorn in their
sides," said Boxer.</LD>
<TE>   Through the years, Boxer has urged federal regulators to impose
stringent EPA standards for cleanup of the hilltop lab, a former
nuclear power development facility that is still used for Department
of Defense-sponsored rocket engine and missile testing.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, Boxer asked then Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to
prepare a comprehensive environmental review of the site. The
department decided on an environmental assessment of past and ongoing
cleanup operations that would be conducted by a panel of government
experts.</TE>
<TE>   But Boxer has maintained that the scale of the cleanup and the
severity of the contamination warrant a full environmental impact
statement, which would include analysis of methodology and standards
and would allow for public involvement in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Residents and community leaders are concerned that too much
contamination remains in the lab's soil, posing a long-term threat to
Rocketdyne workers and neighbors. A decision on what type of review
will be undertaken is expected later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer has also asked EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman to
ensure that the Rocketdyne cleanup is consistent with her agency's
own standards, which are more rigorous than those established by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Whitman informed Boxer in a letter in
May 2001 that the EPA was prepared to provide a thorough survey of
the site.</TE>
<TE>   But residents of the area told Boxer they worry because these
issues remain unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't understand why they would be so reluctant to go by EPA
standards," said Barbara Johnson, a resident of Susana Knolls and
member of the Rocketdyne Clean Up Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer listened as other residents and former Rocketdyne workers
talked about how they believed the cancers they had contracted
through the years may be directly related to their proximity to the
lab.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't need a degree to see that people are getting sick near
the site," Boxer said.</TE>
<TE>   But officials at Rocketdyne said that the lab does not pose a
safety or health threat to its neighbors. They said the cleanup
should be completed by 2007 or 2008. All but three of the 28
facilities formerly used for nuclear testing have been removed, said
Steve Lafflam, Rocketdyne's director for safety, health and
environmental affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Lafflam said he believes current cleanup standards "are protective
of public health."</TE>
<TE>   He said the company's main goal is to finish the cleanup as soon
as possible. Lafflam said to do the kind of environmental review that
Boxer is advocating would delay operations by three or four years.</TE>
<TE>   Those attending Thursday's meeting said they would join with Boxer
in continuing to push for stricter cleanup standards at the lab.
Jeanne Londe, an 81-year-old Reseda resident, told the senator that
for the first time in the 13 years that she's been active in the
contamination issue, "I feel some hope."</TE>

<HD>Junius Scales, 82; Communist Party Spokesman Jailed, Then
Freed in '62</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Junius Scales, the only American Communist Party member to serve
prison time after being convicted of violating a 1940 law that made
it illegal to belong to any organization that advocated the violent
overthrow of the U.S. government, has died. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Scales, whose sentence was commuted by President Kennedy in 1962,
died of heart failure and the effects of a stroke Monday in a New
York City hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Scales, who joined the Communist Party in 1939 while a student at
the University of North Carolina, later became a prominent party
spokesman and a target of the FBI as he organized workers in the
South for the Communist Party.</LD>
<TE>   Arrested by the FBI in 1954, he was convicted under the membership
clause of the Smith Act after two trials in federal court and a
lengthy appeals process that twice reached the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Scales, who publicly left the Communist Party in 1957, was
sentenced in 1961 to six years in federal prison.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court later declared the law unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The Scales case became a cause celebre. His imprisonment spurred a
flurry of letters to President Kennedy demanding clemency. Among the
prominent Americans who came to Scales' defense were the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.; former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt; writers Norman
Mailer, James Baldwin and Saul Bellow; and labor leaders Walter
Reuther and George Meany. An editorial in the New York Times, calling
Scales a "misguided idealist," stated, "There is something
un-American in having even one political prisoner in the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   On Christmas Eve 1962, over the objections of FBI chief J. Edgar
Hoover, Kennedy commuted Scales' sentence to 15 months served.</TE>
<TE>   Scales was born in Greensboro, N.C., on March 26, 1920, into a
socially and politically prominent family. His father was a lawyer
and developer, whose side of the family included the first chief
justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court and a governor of the
state.</TE>
<TE>   The bookish Scales grew up in a 36-room mansion, and the only
blacks he knew were the family's servants. His arrival at the
University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill was a life-altering
experience.</TE>
<TE>   He was astonished, he wrote in his 1987 memoir "Cause At Heart: A
Former Communist Remembers," to discover "immeasurable suffering,
exploitation and poverty had existed among thousands of people right
under my nose all my life, and I'd been totally unaware of it."</TE>
<TE>   At the university, he joined the Karl Marx Study Club and became
its head, arranging for campus speakers such as John Gages, editor of
The Daily Worker, the American Communist Party newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   He became a communist, Scales said in an interview with
Contemporary Authors, because "The Communist Party opposed fascism,
organized workers, projected a Socialist future and, alone, stood for
the full economic, political and social equality of blacks."</TE>
<TE>   Scales' absorption into social and political questions of the day
led him to leave college and become a union organizer. He also began
rising in the ranks of the party's North Carolina state committee,
but his political activity was curtailed when he joined the Army
after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Scales returned to Chapel Hill and resumed his
Communist Party activities. He also generated headlines when he was
elected vice president of the Southern Negro Youth Congress, becoming
the first white officer of the mostly middle-class, Communist-led
group, which was seeking racial equality.</TE>
<TE>   When the Communist Party came under attack from the Justice
Department for violation of the Smith Act, Scales was forced by the
party to go underground. He was arrested three years later, on Nov.
18, 1954, in Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   In 1957, months before his second trial, Scales left the Communist
Party.</TE>
<TE>   In his interview with Contemporary Authors, he said he was "still
proud of its pioneering struggle for civil rights, its opposition to
war and McCarthyism, and its support of the workers. However, I was
profoundly disgusted with its subservience to the Soviet Union, its
sectarianism, its grandiosity, its ambivalence on democratic issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The revelations of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev about his
predecessor Josef Stalin and the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian
Revolution completed my disillusionment."</TE>
<TE>   American Communists, Scales once told the Associated Press, "were
duped. We'd been unwitting apologists for one of the worst regimes of
the century."</TE>
<TE>   After his release from prison in 1962, Scales said he had a wife
and daughter to support and was no longer interested in activism.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have anything when I got out of prison," he later told
the Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   "My family had suffered enough from my doings, so I decided to
head to a high-paying job."</TE>
<TE>   Scales landed a job as an overnight proofreader at the New York
Times. His wife, Gladys, who had spearheaded the writing campaign to
free him from prison, became a teacher. She died in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring from the newspaper in 1983, Scales lived a quiet
life in a hilltop cottage in Pine Bush, N.Y. He is survived by his
daughter Barbara of Montreal and one grandchild.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Won't Help Valley City Candidates</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Democratic Party of the San Fernando Valley stepped up its
campaign against secession on Thursday with a warning to members that
it will not endorse them if they run for office in the proposed
Valley city.</LD>
<LD>   Jeffrey Daar, president of the Valley organization, said members
should not even seek the offices on the Nov. 5 secession ballot. The
deadline for entering the races for Valley mayor and 14 city council
seats is today.</LD>
<LD>   "People should put their ambitions on the back burner and should
not run," said Daar, who is co-chairman of the anti-secession group
One Los Angeles. "Anybody who runs, no matter what they say, is
promoting secession. How can we endorse candidates ... if we oppose
secession?"</LD>
<TE>   The party has said secession could result in a Valley government
that would reject laws favored by Democrats, including rent control
and the living wage.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican Party has not taken a position on secession.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists denounced the Democratic Party's stance on
candidacies as "undemocratic."</TE>
<TE>   "It's shortsighted and stupid," said Richard Katz, a Democrat who
is co-chairman of the Valley Independence Committee. "It's contrary
to everything the Democratic Party stands for to try to persuade
people not to run for office."</TE>
<TE>   Katz, a former assemblyman, said the party should help elect
candidates who share its principles.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats outnumber Republicans in the Valley 51.4% to 28.7%.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley candidates will only take office if secession wins. The
same is true for those seeking five city council seats in the
Hollywood secession election, which is also on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Democratic Party is opposed to the
Hollywood and Valley secession measures, but has not taken a position
on candidacies.</TE>
<TE>   As of Thursday, 43 candidates for the Valley offices had filed
their nominating petitions with the county registrar-recorder. In
Hollywood, 11 candidates had filed, including Gene La Pietra, head of
the Hollywood Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 100 others have taken out petitions for the Valley and
Hollywood offices. They have until 5 p.m. today to return them.</TE>
<TE>   The offices are nonpartisan, but Mel Wilson said he decided to run
for Valley mayor when it became clear no other prominent Democrat
would.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt very discouraged that none of the folks from my party, the
Democratic Party, were willing to get into the race," Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Other well-known Democratic candidates are Scott Svonkin and
Richard Leyner, who are running for the Valley council.</TE>

commissioners from campaigning.</TE>

<HD>LAX Security on Track, Chief Says</HD>
<DH>Airports: Officials from Sacramento, San Diego and San
Francisco say they will have trouble trying to meet Dec. 31
bag-screening deadline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials of three of California's biggest airports told a U.S.
Senate committee Thursday that they are having serious difficulties
with at least one of the looming federal mandates for improved
screening and other security measures.</LD>
<LD>   They were especially critical of a mandate to require explosives
screening of all checked baggage.</LD>
<LD>   Some of those representing airports in Sacramento, San Francisco
and San Diego even suggested that the new procedures might hinder
safety and would exacerbate the drop in passengers that most airports
have experienced since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   By contrast, leaders of Los Angeles International Airport said
they expect to meet the deadlines--if enough new employees and
baggage screening machines are available.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who convened the hearing of the
Senate Commerce Committee at Los Angeles International Airport to
assess progress toward compliance with the Aviation and
Transportation Security Act, urged officials to focus on getting the
job done quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Now is not the time to slow down," Boxer said at the start of the
hearing. "We need to make this work."</TE>
<TE>   But some airport officials said Thursday that they would like more
time before they begin screening every piece of luggage for
explosives, as required by the act.</TE>
<TE>   To meet the Dec. 31 deadline would require the costly installation
of cumbersome devices that will cause long lines, crowding and
confusion, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Many airports have complained that they have no space for the
bulky, expensive machines currently available for the task.</TE>
<TE>   And while the machines are good at finding explosives, they also
have unacceptably high false-alarm rates, some airport officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "For airport security, many in the industry consider the time
given ... to make the necessary changes to be adequate for some
airports but inadequate for others," said G. Hardy Acree, director of
the Sacramento County Airport System.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento International, one of the few airports around the
nation that is experiencing record increases in passengers, got its
federal security overseer a week ago and does not yet have a plan for
implementing the baggage-screening requirement, Acree said.</TE>
<TE>   He described his "sense of frustration with how the process is
working, and in some cases, not working" and urged security planners
to take passenger convenience into consideration or risk losing their
business.</TE>
<TE>   Thelma F. Bowens, senior director for aviation at San Diego
International Airport, said the facility is on track to meet a Nov.
19 deadline to replace privately employed passenger screeners with
federal employees.</TE>
<TE>   But having a system in place by Dec. 31 for checking all baggage
for explosives "is another matter altogether," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Given the shortage of the preferred detection devices and the
complexity of installing the equipment, she called the task "truly
overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   San Diego is being forced to proceed using devices called
explosive trace detectors, which Bowens said are less effective and
more disruptive and must be installed in the crowded lobby areas of
the terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Waiting until an integrated and automated system of detecting
explosives becomes available "will not result in a diminished level
of protection," Bowens said.</TE>
<TE>   "We will still be using the same means as today--canine detection
teams, positive bag matching, hand searches and other methods,"
Bowens said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials said they are ready, however, thanks to
their planning work with consultants since spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I am confident that we have sound plans in place to meet the Nov.
19 passenger screening deadline and the Dec. 31 deadline to screen
100% of checked baggage," said Paul Green, chief operating officer of
Los Angeles World Airports, which runs Los Angeles International
Airport and three smaller city-owned airports.</TE>
<TE>   But the crucial caveat, Green added, is whether the security
administration will be able to hire enough people to screen
passengers and deliver the equipment on time.</TE>
<TE>   David M. Stone, the recently arrived federal security director at
LAX, said funding issues have required the administration to
undertake a "reassessment of its rollout strategy," complicating an
already extraordinary challenge posed by the two deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer reiterated her long-standing opposition to bending the
deadlines but found common ground with those testifying Thursday in
her interest in developing so-called trusted traveler programs and
other high-tech innovations that could help solve security problems.</TE>
<TE>   Sophisticated identification cards could be issued to pilots,
flight attendants and frequent fliers who agree to background checks
that would exempt them from flight-by-flight screening procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Airport officials estimate such a program could reduce screening
lines by about 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer invited four private firms to display their high-tech
aviation security wares outside the hearing room, including an
identification card by LaserCard Systems.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other displays was a baggage container by TelAir
International.</TE>
<TE>   The device is designed to absorb the force of a suitcase that
explodes inside.</TE>

<HD>Man Is Fatally Shot by Off-Duty Officer</HD>
<DH>Violence: One arrest is made in shooting outside Sierra

<LD>An off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer shot and killed a
man outside a Sierra Madre sports bar Thursday after an altercation
involving several customers, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The victim, a 34-year-old South Pasadena man, died at Arcadia
Methodist Hospital, authorities said. The name of the victim has not
been released.</LD>
<LD>   No action has been taken against the officer, Isaac Lowe, 27, a
five-year department veteran, pending an investigation by the L.A.
County Sheriff's Department, an LAPD spokesman said.</LD>
<TE>   Lowe and three other men had been arguing inside the Tailgators
bar at 322 W. Sierra Madre Blvd. about 1:30 a.m., and had continued
the argument outside when the shooting occurred, Sheriff's Deputy
David Cervantes said.</TE>
<TE>   A second man was arrested at the scene, officials said. The
Sheriff's Department would not release his name or say what charge he
was booked on. The third man involved in the dispute fled and was
being sought by police.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby residents reported hearing four to eight gunshots.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Madre Police Chief Wayne Bailey said he had heard "many
different stories" about the chain of events but declined to
elaborate. "All I know is that there was an altercation and that both
parties had guns."</TE>
<TE>   Lowe could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The foothill city, with a population of 10,000, had not had a
shooting since 1996, and had not had a fatal shooting since 1988,
according to the Sierra Madre Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   FBI statistics indicate the city has been one of the three safest
in Southern California in recent years, Mayor Doug Hayes said.</TE>
<TE>   "To go 14 years without a fatal shooting is probably some kind of
miracle," he said. Tailgators is owned by a former L.A. police
officer and is frequented by off-duty and former officers, Hayes
said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Delgatto, owner of a dry-cleaning business two doors from the
bar, said he was "surprised that this would happen here, because I
thought everyone knew that the owner is a former LAPD officer."</TE>

<HD>Simon Tries to Shift Focus</HD>
<DH>Politics: Challenger keeps criticism coming in Southland
stops, saying that donors guide the governor's policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CORONA</DL>
<LD>In a campaign swing through Southern California on Thursday,
Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. sought to turn
attention back to his rival by charging that Gov. Gray Davis allows
political donations to dictate his public policy.</LD>
<LD>   As he pitched a proposal to increase California's stock of
affordable housing, Simon said the Davis administration had made new
homes more expensive by outlawing the use of plastic piping, which
costs less than traditional copper pipes. He said the state Building
Standards Commission made California one of few states to prohibit
plastic piping after Davis received a $1.4-million contribution from
the pipe trades union.</LD>
<LD>   "It's decisions like these that make me call Gray Davis
California's first coin-operated governor," Simon told about two
dozen supporters gathered outside the Corona Civic Center in the
Inland Empire.</LD>
<TE>   Aides to Davis vehemently denied any connection.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as he'd like to believe it, one has nothing to do with
another," said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. "When the governor
makes his policy decisions, they are based on what's in the best
interest of the state of California and nothing else."</TE>
<TE>   Questions about last week's $78-million verdict against the Simon
family's investment firm continued to follow the candidate as he
campaigned throughout the state. But he attempted to shift focus to
Davis by capitalizing on the incumbent's reputation as an insatiable
fund-raiser. He repeatedly accused the governor of having a "pay to
play" administration.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar said he did not believe such a line of attack would
resonate with voters. "When you have a successful fund-raising
operation, that kind of criticism comes with the territory," he said.
Davis has raised more than $50 million to defeat his challenger, the
most ever for a U.S. gubernatorial race. He has already spent a large
portion of that money on television commercials accusing Simon of
being an unsuccessful businessman.</TE>
<TE>   During a stop in Ventura on Thursday morning, Simon said he
believes Davis will sign a bill that would make farmers enter into
binding arbitration to resolve labor disputes, a measure that the GOP
candidate said he opposes. "As everybody knows, Davis is influenced
by contributions from labor unions, all the while holding farmers and
ranchers hostage to his pen," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar said the governor did not yet have a position on the
arbitration bill. "The difference between Mr. Simon and the governor
is that the governor tries to strike a balance and make sure that the
interests of business and workers are both served in any policy
decision," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As he toured Southern California, Simon said that nine of the
nation's 10 least-affordable cities are in the California. He said he
would loosen land-use restrictions and roll back prevailing wage
laws, which he said drive up labor costs. In addition, he proposed
giving local governments incentives to encourage the construction of
more housing instead of retail developments.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura, where growth and suburban sprawl dominate the local
political agenda, Simon said he believes new homes could be built
without cutting into the region's green space. He did not explain
how.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a way to do it that's environmentally sensitive, that
respects agricultural land," he said. "We need a balance."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Newport Beach Police Department announced Thursday it is closing
its investigation into the death earlier this year of an inline
skater, concurring with the coroner that the man does not appear to
have died as the result of a paint-ball attack.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Michael Holdren, 54, of Newport Beach died after spending two
weeks in a coma following a skating accident in Upper Newport Bay
Ecological Reserve on March 24. Because of evidence found at the
scene and on his body, police initially speculated that he had been
hit by paint balls.</LD>
<LD>   Based on an autopsy, the coroner's office attributed the death to
"blunt head trauma" and classified it as an accident. Police
officials announced they agreed and that the department uncovered no
evidence that paint balls caused Holdren to fall.</LD>
<TE>   "If some new and relevant evidence were to come forward, the
investigation would be reopened," department spokesman Sgt. Steve
Shulman said.</TE>

<LD>A man accused of murder told detectives he persuaded a brutally
beaten Washington state woman to let him kill her to stop her
suffering.</LD>
<LD>   "She didn't want to die. I had to convince her," Paul Smith said
on a videotape played for jurors this week.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, 24, of Redding, is charged in the April 1998 killing of
20-year-old Lora Sinner of Hoquiam, Wash. She was camping near Ono
with Smith when three others in their party allegedly beat and
tortured her, authorities have said.</LD>
<TE>   On the tape, Smith tried to take full responsibility for the
killing.</TE>
<TE>   He denied that others harmed Sinner, saying they wouldn't be able
to handle serving time in prison. One woman has already been

<LD>A Silicon Valley lawmaker withdrew a bill Wednesday that would have
limited the state's ability to offer free electronic tax filing.</LD>
<LD>   Assemblywoman Rebecca Cohn (D-Saratoga) withdrew AB 2781, which
would have banned the Franchise Tax Board from offering a free
electronic tax filing service that performs math calculations and
searches tax tables for taxpayers.</LD>
<LD>   The computer software industry, led by Mountain View, Calif.-based
Intuit, supported Cohn's bill. The industry argued that free
government tax filing competes with private electronic services that
typically charge fees of $10 to $30.</LD>
<TE>   Cohn withdrew her bill rather than accept amendments that she said
would compromise privacy.</TE>

<LD>In an effort to save water, the Cambria Community Services District
board has decided to pay $58,420 to a family trust not to grow crops
on 14 acres.</LD>
<LD>   The board declared an official water shortage eight months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Chevron has agreed to repay the district for the water-saving
measure as part of remediation for MTBE contamination from a Chevron
gas station near two district drinking water wells.</LD>
<TE>   The Willis C. Warren Trust operates ranchland irrigated with water
drawn just upstream from the district's wells on a creek. Because the
ranchers won't be irrigating crops, the agreement frees water for

<HD>Giant Cargo Terminal Debuts</HD>
<DH>Shipping: Officials at the Port of Los Angeles say the pier
will pump $3.4 billion into the regional economy and eventually
create thousands of jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA L. ESPARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using material dredged from the bottom of the harbor and 11 million
tons of rock shipped from Catalina Island, Port of Los Angeles
engineers have built what they say is the largest container terminal
in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Pier 400 was mostly constructed over the last eight years and can
hold as many as 23,900 containers.</LD>
<LD>   When completed, the 484-acre terminal will be the size of 366
football fields and could hold the entire UCLA campus.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, officials from the Port of Los Angeles, Maersk
Sealand shipping company and APM Terminals gave the media a tour of
the complex as workers put the finishing touches on the behemoth pier
before the arrival of its first shipment on Aug. 17.</TE>
<TE>   Port officials expect the pier to pump $3.4 billion into the
regional economy and create 58,000 jobs during the next 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   Pier 400 "truly sets the international standard" for container
terminals, said Larry Keller, the Port of Los Angeles executive
director.</TE>
<TE>   Engineers dredged 54 million cubic yards of material from the
harbor floor to create the terminal. By stacking it with enough rock
to build 25 Mount Rushmores, engineers created "weir boxes," which
allowed the water from the material to run back into the ocean, and
the sand to dry and harden, said Stacey Jones, the terminal's chief
engineer.</TE>
<TE>   Pier 400 is being built in two phases. Phase I, which officials
touted Thursday, covers 343 acres and cost $340 million. It includes
10 huge cranes, 12 sets of train tracks and room for 222 train cars.</TE>
<TE>   The tracks at Pier 400 connect to the new Alameda Corridor, a
20-mile rail expressway that opened in April and links rail yards
south of downtown Los Angeles to the Los Angeles-Long Beach harbor
complex.</TE>
<TE>   Phase II is expected to be completed by 2004 and will cost $140
million. That phase will expand the pier's container yard and berth
area by 141 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Money to build Pier 400 came from a federal grant and by selling
bonds, said Theresa Adams Lopez, spokeswoman for the Port of Los
Angeles. APM Terminals, the company leasing Pier 400, will pay the
port a fee for each container imported.</TE>
<TE>   The Port of Los Angeles opened Pier J, a 100-acre terminal, in
1993 near the adjacent Port of Long Beach, said Alan McCorkle, the
managing director of Pier 400.</TE>
<TE>   "One hundred acres at that time was a mega-facility," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But an increase in shipping prompted officials to seek more
acreage. "It's a challenge, it's scary, but that's what you
need--more acres," McCorkle said.</TE>

<HD>Stars' Attorneys Try to Keep Clients Shining</HD>
<DH>Lawyers warn them of fame's pitfalls but, if scandals
break, work to limit damage and pick up the pieces.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lawyer Gerry Margolis believes that his clients will get into trouble
eventually because, well, that's the nature of being famous.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not if; it's when," he tells his clients, celebrities who
include Robin Williams and singer R. Kelly.</LD>
<LD>   It's Margolis' job to make sure that when it happens, he's there
to pick up the pieces and make sure that reputations, families and
careers are salvaged.</LD>
<TE>   "Crisis management" is what his firm, Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips,
labels the type of work 12 of its entertainment lawyers engage in.
Cleaning up the messes of those who are worshiped--and whose lives
are scrutinized--may not be new to legal circles, but the firm has
sought to carve out a niche by marketing itself as the expert in
handling high-profile litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy follows fame, said Margolis, who deals mainly with
civil cases. Although not all of his clients are embroiled in
scandal, he aims to give them a dose of prevention, warning them of
the pitfalls that come with stardom and how to prevent such problems.</TE>
<TE>   But no matter what Margolis says to keep his clients free from
legal woes, things happen.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly is proof. The R&amp;B singer faces child pornography charges in
Chicago. "He's in the middle of the firestorm right now," Margolis
said of Kelly, whom he has represented since 1994. "You don't have
the luxury of quiet, thoughtful deliberation. You have to do
everything at warp speed."</TE>
<TE>   Margolis has to be more than just a lawyer; he needs to possess a
great deal of media savvy to better serve his famous clients. His
first rule: Don't ignore the media.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you need to tell your client's story, or someone else
will," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, it got back to Margolis that the Chicago Sun-Times had
found out about a lawsuit alleging that Kelly had had sex with a
minor. The attorney knew the story would get huge play in the
newspaper. "So I decided it needed to be announced by us," Margolis
said.</TE>
<TE>   He believes that police and prosecutors are more vigorous when
famous people get entangled in legal crises. "While people think
celebrities catch a huge break in the criminal justice system, I
think it's the opposite," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, Margolis cited a 1997 incident involving Kelly. The
recording artist had been in a brawl while playing basketball at a
Lafayette, La., health club. The fight was between five black men and
five white men, the attorney said. One of the white men brought a
civil action, which Margolis eventually settled. Criminal charges
against Kelly were reduced, and he was given probation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure he wouldn't have been convicted," Margolis said. "He
didn't start [the fight] or inflict injury, but because he was R.
Kelly ... he was the only one charged."</TE>
<TE>   On the East Coast, Abbe Lowell, another partner in Margolis' firm,
manages high-profile cases. Lowell's clients don't sing, act or dance
for a living. Based in Washington, Lowell deals with those who
legislate, govern and head corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Although the public may find Margolis' clients more fascinating,
controversies involving politicians and corporations are gaining
interest, Lowell says.</TE>
<TE>   That became evident when he rep- presented Rep. Gary Condit
(D-Ceres). Lowell was hired to help the congressman in June 2001,
just as questions about whether the politician may have had something
to do with the disappearance of intern Chandra Levy grew louder.</TE>
<TE>   Lowell, who handles mostly criminal matters, accompanied Condit to
police interviews and advised him to take a polygraph test and
provide DNA samples. The lawyer did these things while juggling them
with spokesman responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I was very effective, but I'm not sure anybody
could have been," Lowell said of those frenzied months. He would have
preferred to be working for Condit the minute the crisis began.</TE>
<TE>   But because the firm markets itself as a specialist in damage
control, Lowell often finds himself flung into situations as crises
gain momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "People come to decide they need advice ... at various times," he
said. "Some people do it only when they're forced to."</TE>
<TE>   Lowell said seeking help in the midst of a scandal is like putting
off seeking medical attention. "Unfortunately, people don't get help
until they get to the emergency room," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Christopher Murray, chairman of entertainment and media
practice at the prominent Los Angeles firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers,
agreed with Lowell on the difficulties of being a spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   He said that to effectively help the famous steer clear of legal
mishaps, one must be a lawyer first.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the most effective lawyers are the ones who are the
most invisible to the outside world," Murray said. His clients have
included Warner Bros., MGM and Carol Burnett.</TE>
<TE>   Murray said he tries to separate his job from the public relations
segment of crisis management. "Most of our clients in that realm are
generally disinclined to have us as their spokespeople," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's part of the reason that Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips usually
employs a public relations firm in high-profile cases. A public
relations expert is a crucial part of a scandal-fighting team, said
Laurie Soriano, head of Manatt's entertainment practice. "You're not
just thinking about the legal ramifications; you have to think of
career ramifications," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano advises clients to bring in a publicist from the
start--one who specifically deals with crisis management--even if
there is no trouble brewing.</TE>
<TE>   Margolis doesn't see his job as making the world safe for
villainy. "I prefer to deal with people who have significant problems
but have a sense of decency," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, he handled a controversy involving the heavy metal band
Slayer. The members were terrified about a lawsuit against them filed
by the parents of a girl killed in San Luis Obispo, Margolis said.</TE>
<TE>   Three teenage boys pleaded guilty to murdering the girl and said
Slayer's lyrics inspired them to commit the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time I got the case, people's tempers were white-hot over
the lyrics," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Margolis filed a motion to dismiss the case on free-speech
grounds. In October 2001, a judge agreed to throw it out.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm quite confident that if a jury had to be picked, this would
have gone badly," Margolis said.</TE>
<TE>   He knows that a crisis can creep out from just about anything, so
he has learned not to be complacent. "I have not seen it all," he
said. "Every day there's something new and something challenging."</TE>

<HD>Fire Scorches Gym Floor at Buena High</HD>
<DH>Ventura: The small blaze, likely started by a construction
crew, causes an estimated $25,000 in damage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Construction work at Buena High School was temporarily halted
Thursday morning when a fire broke out in the school's gymnasium.</LD>
<LD>   No one was seriously injured in what began as a two-alarm fire in
Ventura, though two construction workers were treated at the scene
for smoke inhalation. Fire officials said no students were present.
The blaze, which began about 11:20 a.m., caused an estimated $25,000
in damage to the gymnasium's wooden floor.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities believe the fire started when hot metal debris from a
welding torch ignited combustible construction materials being stored
in the gym.</LD>
<TE>   One of the construction workers who was treated for smoke
inhalation had attempted to extinguish the fire himself, officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters arriving at the scene saw smoke coming from the
gymnasium's vents and doors, according to fire officials. Because the
gym is a large structure, firefighters upgraded the fire response to
two alarms. Five fire engines, one fire truck and four support
vehicles were dispatched to the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside, fire crews discovered the blaze was concentrated in a
small area. They were able to contain the fire in less than 15
minutes, and the second alarm was canceled, said Deputy Fire Marshal
Brian Clark, with the Ventura Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   After the fire was extinguished, firefighters began ventilating
the gym to clear out the smoke.</TE>
<TE>   District Assistant Supt. Joe Richards said construction crews
resumed work later in the afternoon. Workers were placing a new roof
on the gym and removing solar panels from the existing roof Thursday,
he said. The work was part of a $9-million renovation and
modernization of the school.</TE>
<TE>   Richards said the total extent of the damage was not yet known,
but that the contractor had assumed responsibility for the fire and
would pay for any cleanup and repairs. "We're going to do our best to
keep the project on schedule," Richards said.</TE>

<LD>During a campaign swing through Ventura County, Republican
gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon on Thursday unveiled proposals to
increase the availability of affordable housing in California,
focusing on reforming regulations governing land use, wages and local
government financing.</LD>
<LD>   "Home ownership strengthens our communities, it encourages civic
responsibility and it provides a solid foundation from which
Californians can work to support their families," Simon said while
speaking at the Ventura County Government Center.</LD>
<LD>   He said the median home price in Ventura County, about $350,000,
is out of reach for many. "Right now California is drifting, and we
are drowning in a sea of red ink."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura man died after being struck by a vehicle at the
intersection of Johnson Drive and Telephone Road. It was the second
fatal accident at that intersection in the last two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Dwight Spargur, 53, was bicycling along Johnson Drive
with his wife and started to turn east onto Telephone Road when he
was struck by a northbound vehicle driven by Jessie Moline, 19, of
Ventura about 7:30 p.m. Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses told police the traffic light had turned yellow and
Moline accelerated to get through the intersection but ran a red
light. Police are investigating.</LD>
<TE>   Spargur was taken to the Ventura County Medical Center, where he
died about 8:30 p.m. from multiple blunt-force injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Spargur was executive director of the Sunrise Assisted Living
senior complex in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's collision was the second fatal accident at Johnson and
Telephone in recent weeks. Yisha Xie, 36, and her daughter, Shan
"Susan" Su, 7, were killed July 25 after they darted into traffic at
the intersection and were hit by a truck.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the high volume of traffic and the number of speeding
vehicles make the intersection dangerous.</TE>

<HD>Official's Dual Role in Land Talks Questioned</HD>
<DH>Law: He represents the O.C. Water District in dealings with
Chino, which hired his firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The president of the Orange County Water District has represented the
agency in talks with a city that wants to annex district land even
though his consulting firm is being paid by the city to help push
through the project.</LD>
<LD>   Some water board members said this week that Jerry King's dealings
with the city of Chino's proposed annexation might be a conflict of
interest and asked attorneys for the agency to look into the matter.</LD>
<LD>   King, however, said he's done nothing wrong and that an attorney
for the agency cleared him to get involved with the annexation issue.
He is vice president of Psomas &amp; Associates in Costa Mesa, one of
three firms the city hired to work on the annexation.</LD>
<TE>   "Our attorney has said [the relationship] was no problem," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   State law bars elected officials from voting on or influencing
decisions that would materially affect their assets and income.
Officials are also barred from voting or influencing decisions that
directly affect a source of income of $500 or more received within
the previous 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the state Fair Political Practices Commission
confirmed Thursday that it received a complaint alleging a conflict
of interest by King. The Orange County district attorney's office is
also reviewing the allegations, spokeswoman Tori Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   Chino wants to annex 5,400 acres in San Bernardino County,
including 57 acres owned by the Orange County Water District. The
water district's land would remain as open space, but a developer
wants to build 9,779 homes on another portion of the land Chino wants
to annex. Overall, the district owns about 2,500 acres behind the
Prado Dam.</TE>
<TE>   The district opposes the annexation because it would prohibit
development on the 57 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Chino planners said King represented the water district in at
least two annexation meetings with city officials and also sent
several official district letters.</TE>
<TE>   The city's environmental review for the project includes numerous
documents bearing Psomas' name, including technical reports on water
issues. Water-quality concerns raised by King and the district
resulted in an $80,000 revision to the city review, Chino planner Bob
Prasse said.</TE>
<TE>   King said he believes his company's role in the matter is limited
to producing aerial photos.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Water District board member Phil Anthony said he was
surprised to learn about Psomas' work for Chino and that King was
representing the water district on the annexation matter.</TE>
<TE>   "With these [conflict of interest] accusations flying around, we
can't ignore them," he said. "If [King] has a financial interest,
that's defined in state law as a conflict and he's not to vote on
things and he has to declare what the conflict is."</TE>
<TE>   Board member Denis Bilodeau said he discovered three weeks ago
that Psomas was involved in the annexation bid. He said he and three
other board members asked King and district General Manager Virginia
Grebbien last week for a special board meeting to discuss it but were
rebuffed.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry has been the guy controlling the issue for the last year
and a half," Bilodeau said Thursday. "That's what really bothers me.
I think he needs to justify to the board why he's playing both
sides."</TE>
<TE>   Grebbien said an attorney for the agency recalls talking with King
about the possible conflict and "is reviewing his notes to determine
what was said."</TE>

<HD>2 Arrested in Drug Seizures at 3 Homes</HD>
<DH>Crime: Camarillo man and woman are suspected in a
methamphetamine ring. Value of confiscated items is set at $2
million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Camarillo couple have been arrested on suspicion of participating
in a methamphetamine ring after deputies seized more than 30 pounds
of the drug at three houses in Ventura County, authorities said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Rafael Escobar Marron, 35, remained in Ventura County Jail without
bail Thursday night. His girlfriend, Sandra Mares Garcia, 31, was
released Wednesday after posting bail.</LD>
<LD>   "The focus of the investigation involved the distribution of large
quantities of methamphetamine in Ventura County and Southern
California," Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Fred Bustillos said in a
statement.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities valued the confiscated drugs and a clandestine lab
also seized at nearly $2 million. More arrests in the case are
expected.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies began investigating the drug operation several months ago
and on Tuesday arrested Marron in Camarillo. Authorities said
deputies found more than 12 ounces of methamphetamine inside his
pants.</TE>
<TE>   Because Marron is on parole, sheriff's deputies were legally
allowed to search his Camarillo home on Calle de la Rosa, according
to Bustillos.</TE>
<TE>   At the residence, inside a safe encased in concrete and hidden
under wooden floorboards in an outbuilding, deputies found 8 pounds
of methamphetamine divided into half-pound packages, authorities
said. About $5,000 in suspected drug proceeds and a loaded
semiautomatic handgun were also seized, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said evidence inside the safe led them to arrest
Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, deputies searched two houses in Oxnard also believed
to be part of the operation.</TE>
<TE>   They found 22 pounds of methamphetamine at residences in the 1300
block of Spruce Street and the 2100 block of Saviers Road,
authorities said. They said the clandestine lab and 15 gallons of
so-called methamphetamine oil were seized at one of the Oxnard homes.</TE>
<TE>   The lab, authorities said, was capable of producing 45 pounds of
the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Marron was being held on suspicion of transporting and possessing
methamphetamine for sale and conspiracy. Garcia had been booked on
suspicion of possessing the drugs for sales and conspiracy.</TE>

<HD>War Exercise Adds a Digital Front</HD>
<DH>Military: Computerized gear, other advanced technology are
being used in maneuvers of unmatched complexity centered in
Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FT. IRWIN, Calif.</DL>
<LD>In the largest and most complex military exercise of its kind,
thousands of U.S. troops, some armed with hand-held computer devices,
are fighting mock battles across the country, attempting to mimic
what a major military operation could look like in the near future.</LD>
<LD>   Under the specter of a possible invasion of Iraq, about 13,500
soldiers and 70,000 more computer-generated enemy and U.S. troops are
waging a simulated war, testing some of the most advanced
technologies in development and providing a rare glimpse at the
Pentagon's efforts to push the lumbering military into the digital
age.</LD>
<LD>   "This is clearly the largest joint experiment we've ever conducted
... and in my belief the most profound as well," Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman Gen. Richard B. Myers said. The results could affect
future military operations "like nothing else we've ever done."</LD>
<TE>   For the first time, all of the military services--Army, Navy and
Air Force, as well the Marines and Special Operations Forces--are
being linked in real time to fight coordinated battles at multiple
locations. The services typically like to train and plan operations
on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, in an unprecedented move, hundreds of officials with the
State Department, the CIA and the FBI are taking part in the
exercise, providing for the first time a coordinated effort to gather
and share intelligence data with the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The training exercise, dubbed Millennium Challenge 2002, was
planned months before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, but military
action in Afghanistan and the possibility of another one in Iraq have
heightened the importance of the operation.</TE>
<TE>   All of the "live" mock battles using real troops, for instance,
are set in the Southern California desert, which provides climate and
terrain similar to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials insisted that the three-week exercise--which
ends Aug. 15 and is expected to cost $250 million--was not in
preparation for any specific conflict, including Iraq. But they
acknowledged that the results could provide commanders and
strategists invaluable experience and insight into using information
technology to overwhelm enemy forces.</TE>
<TE>   The exercise reflects post-Cold War realities in which U.S. troops
are expected to fight swift regional skirmishes against
nontraditional foes such as rebel forces or terrorist groups, rather
than set battles with well-defined enemies, defense analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The exercise includes Marines attacking a mock chemical weapons
laboratory at the former George Air Force Base in Victorville. The
exercise is also taking place at the Navy's China Lake weapons
station, the Marines' Camp Pendleton and at various Western sea
ranges from Point Mugu to San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   Teams of computer hackers at undisclosed locations have also been
attempting to crack into U.S. defense computer networks, hoping to
disrupt the exercise and simulate the kind of cyber warfare military
analysts expect in future battles.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials said that in the end, the exercise will test
new technologies and procedures that they hope will eventually allow
generals to plan and initiate a major military operation within a
week of a crisis erupting. It took three weeks to plan and implement
Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, finding the right mix of technology and organizational
changes will mean saving money, time and even lives, Pentagon
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In a preview of what a future operation may look like, Lt. Gen.
B.B. Bell coordinated the mock battles this week via laptops, first
aboard a C-17 aircraft and then a Navy ship off the San Diego coast.
The laptops were linked to other regional commanders at 26 different
locations via a secret satellite-based Internet protocol network and
provided a "common picture" of the military operation. It gave Bell,
the commanding general, an unprecedented view of the battles while he
was still moving from location to location.</TE>
<TE>   The technology, which consists of about a dozen laptop computers,
was first used by Central Command Chief Army Gen. Tommy Franks aboard
a C-17 during Operation Enduring Freedom, but Pentagon planners hope
to eventually field the system to regional commanders.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the command center would have used "stickies" and
grease pencils to map out battles based on verbal communications over
a radio system, which were often inaccurate and prone to
miscommunication and failure.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, paratroopers with the 82nd Airborne Division dropping
into a nighttime raid at Ft. Irwin last week were equipped with
hand-held devices, dubbed "digital op pods," that not only told them
exactly where they were but relayed that information to the
commanding general hundreds of miles away.</TE>
<TE>   It marked the first time that infantry tested the technology,
which Pentagon officials hope will improve the soldiers' "situational
awareness," as well as helping battle commanders better coordinate
operations. The devices, which resemble hand-held computers, have a
global positioning system linked to a satellite.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, during the air drop to seize a desert airfield, the
750 paratroopers were able to quickly move into their predetermined
battle positions using the hand-held devices despite darkness and
lack of any defined landmarks on the flat desert terrain.</TE>
<TE>   At a "digital operations center," a mobile trailer outfitted with
large monitors, computers and communications equipment, the
commanding officer was able to view the troops' precise locations as
well as the position of potential enemy troops and targets.</TE>
<TE>   A video monitor also showed real-time, infrared images from an
unmanned spy plane hovering above the battlefield. At the same time,
the commanding general in San Diego was able to view the same images
and information on his laptop.</TE>
<TE>   "Commanders at all levels are going to have a much higher level of
understanding of what's taking place on the ground with their
soldiers--where they're located, where friendly units are, where the
enemy is located--than we've ever had in the past," said Brig. Gen.
John M. Brown III, deputy commanding general for transformation.</TE>
<TE>   Even though 80% of the exercise involves computer-generated troops
and simulated battles, the exercise hasn't been free of accidents
typical of massive training operations. Last week, a vehicle rolled
over, killing a soldier and injuring two others, all of them with the
82nd Airborne unit that had successfully seized the airfield a few
days earlier.</TE>
<TE>   In an unusual twist, the exercise is generating more attention
elsewhere, particularly by governments that are seen as potential
U.S. adversaries. In a radio report last week, North Korean officials
decried the exercise, saying it "shows the recklessness of the U.S."
and that the exercise was "heating up aggression and war fever."</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Gen. John R. Vines, the commander for the 82nd Airborne
Division who parachuted into a battle with his troops last week, said
the new technologies tested in the exercise are helping his soldiers
make quicker decisions but cautioned against relying on technology
too heavily.</TE>
<TE>   "Technology is an enabler, but not the solution," he said as his
troops dropped from the sky around him. "It still requires people
with a will to confront the enemy. They're the secret weapon of
America."</TE>

<LD>Perdue Farms has agreed to pay $10 million in back wages to about
60,000 chicken plant workers in 10 states for time spent putting on
and taking off required gear.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, which has received preliminary court approval in
Wilmington, stems from a class-action lawsuit filed by workers in
1999. It covers people who worked for the company from 1993 to 1999
at 18 plants in Delaware, Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, North
Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement is in addition to $10 million in payments provided
for 25,000 workers in a May consent decree. That agreement covered
employees from 2000 to 2002.</LD>
<TE>   Perdue said its employees spend an average of eight minutes a day
putting on and taking off the protective gear.</TE>

<HD>Doctor Is Suspended Over Errand</HD>
<DH>Health: Boston surgeon left patient in operating room
midway through procedure to go to the bank to deposit a check.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A Boston orthopedic surgeon has been suspended from practice after
disclosures that he abandoned a patient midway through back surgery
so he could go to the bank to deposit his paycheck.</LD>
<LD>   Although the unnamed patient was resting comfortably after a
successful spinal fusion procedure, the Board of Registration in
Medicine on Wednesday labeled Dr. David C. Arndt "an immediate and
serious threat to the health, safety and welfare of the public."</LD>
<LD>   Arndt was not available for comment at his Cambridge office
Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   But a report from the state medical board said that six hours into
spinal surgery July 10, Arndt abruptly told colleagues in the
operating room at Mount Auburn Hospital that he had to "step out."</TE>
<TE>   His patient was under anesthesia at the time, with his back cut
open.</TE>
<TE>   Grabbing a ride from a medical device salesperson, Arndt went to
his bank in nearby Harvard Square. He returned to complete the
surgery about 35 minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   "Patient abandonment" is the term the medical board uses to
describe such behavior. Executive director Nancy Achin Sullivan said
she had never seen anything quite so flagrant.</TE>
<TE>   Arndt, 45, is a Harvard Medical School graduate with operating
privileges at some of Boston's most prestigious hospitals. He can
appeal his suspension at an upcoming hearing of the state board.</TE>
<TE>   The incident came to the board's attention after nurses and an
anesthesiologist on duty during the surgery reported Arndt's behavior
to hospital officials. The hospital suspended Arndt the next day.</TE>
<TE>   An affidavit filed by a state medical investigator said, "The
supervising anesthesiologist observed the patient in a prone position
with an open incision in his back."</TE>
<TE>   Another surgeon who was present but was not scrubbed or authorized
to perform the fusion procedure said he assumed Arndt had just
"stepped out" to use the restroom, according to the medical board
report.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, Arndt told an investigator for the state
medical board that he "exercised remarkably horrible judgment."</TE>

<HD>White House Streets to Be Shut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Security around the White House will become a notch tighter today as
the four blocks surrounding the presidential grounds will be made
off-limits to parked cars and meandering passersby.</LD>
<LD>   But members of the business community and the city government
expressed irritation, saying that they were not consulted and that
the closures will unnecessarily disrupt commerce.</LD>
<LD>   John Gill, a spokesman for the Secret Service, which guards the
president, said the move was a "coordinated decision" by his agency,
the White House and the District of Columbia. What is being penned as
a "no parking, no stopping, no standing" policy on the four blocks
closest to the White House is not in response to any threat, he said.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, eight blocks of the downtown area along 17th Street
between H Street and Constitution Avenue will be closed to trucks,
Gill added. The security measures will help protect the White House
from trucks that might be packed with explosive materials, similar to
the one that exploded in the World Trade Center garage in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   But the mayor's office was perturbed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not received any paper on this proposal. We're surprised
and somewhat disturbed by all this," said Tony Bullock, a spokesman
for Mayor Anthony A. Williams. "We've got truckers who've been using
the same streets for 10 years--and now all of the sudden they have to
change their route by 6 a.m. tomorrow?"</TE>
<TE>   In an October report, the National Capital Planning Commission
recommended the reopening of E Street, which was closed after the
Sept. 11 attacks and which is one of the four streets adjacent to the
White House that will remain closed. "In the future, street closures
should not be relied upon as a primary security measure," the
commission noted.</TE>
<TE>   Experts worried that the additional security measures might
further hamper traffic flow in an already congested city.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand the need to implement security measures. However,
we believe there are alternative long-term solutions to keeping the
streets safe yet accessible to the public," said Richard Friedman,
chairman of the National Capital Planning Commission task force.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara B. Lang, president and chief executive officer of the
District of Columbia Chamber of Commerce, said her organization had
not been notified either. "Security procedures should be planned in
collaboration with local government as well as business leaders to
ensure an enjoyable experience for visitors to our nation's capital
and a livable city for our residents," she said. "We must find ways
to keep our city safe and economically secure without suffocating
business operations, snarling traffic or frustrating commuters."</TE>
<TE>   The commission recommended that the stretch of Pennsylvania Avenue
between 15th and 17th streets remain closed to autos. That stretch of
Pennsylvania, just in front of the White House, was barricaded in
1995 after the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building.</TE>
<TE>   The White House, through a spokesman, declined to comment on the
increased security measures.</TE>

<HD>Armey Urges End to Cuba Sanctions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a vivid sign of waning support for the economic embargo on Cuba,
House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said he believes that the
United States should open trade with the Communist regime and that he
has backed the restrictions on travel and trade only out of loyalty
to two Cuban American members of the House.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at a trade promotion event in Wichita, Kan., on
Wednesday, Armey acknowledged that congressional support for the
4-decade-old restrictions is fading. "If they last a year, it will be
the last year they last," said Armey, who plans to retire from
Congress at the end of the year.</LD>
<LD>   With an eye on upcoming elections in the pivotal electoral state
of Florida, the White House and GOP congressional leaders have been
lobbying fiercely to maintain the embargo, which they argue will
weaken the regime of Cuban President Fidel Castro.</LD>
<TE>   But an anti-embargo coalition that includes farm state lawmakers,
northern Democrats and others has been gaining strength steadily in
recent years. They argue that a free flow of goods and people to Cuba
will accelerate the move to a more democratic system while opening up
that market to American companies.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, the House adopted by a lopsided 262-167 vote a
measure that would end restrictions on American travel to the island
nation. If the Senate adopts similar language, as expected, and
congressional conferees agree, President Bush will face a tough
choice between executing the first veto of his term or accepting the
first major easing of the embargo in four decades.</TE>
<TE>   Asked Thursday about Armey's comments, White House spokesman Sean
McCormack said Bush "is committed to enforcing the embargo.... He's
committed himself to enforcing it more strongly."</TE>
<TE>   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's brother, is facing
reelection this fall in a state with a large bloc of Cuban American
voters.</TE>
<TE>   Armey's comments to reporters in Kansas were first reported by
Associated Press and confirmed Thursday by a spokesman for Armey,
Gary Crist. The majority leader was said to be traveling and
unavailable for elaboration.</TE>
<TE>   Though Armey is retiring, he remains one of the most influential
conservative voices in Congress. As such, his shift of position
probably will carry considerable weight with other Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   In his nine terms in the House, Armey has shown himself to be a
staunch opponent of Communist governments. But the former economics
professor born in the farm town of Cando, N.D., also has been
passionate about the need to engage other countries with free trade.
Two years ago, for example, Armey pushed for a change in the law to
permit Cuba to buy food and medicine, though only with cash rather
than credit. But he has voted consistently over the years to maintain
the embargo, most recently two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Still, his general view is that "opening these markets opens these
minds," Crist said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a leading opponent of the embargo, said
Armey's comments show that "if the House had a secret ballot, there
would be an additional 75 or 100 votes in favor of lifting
restrictions."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "It's great that a free-trader as staunchly
anti-Communist as Mr. Armey recognizes that engaging Cuba and lifting
the travel ban is the best way to undermine Fidel Castro."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Garcia, executive director of the Cuban American National
Foundation, a strongly pro-embargo organization, said it is
"fortunate that Mr. Armey won't have a role in the issue next year."</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that if the embargo is lifted and Cuba is entitled to
purchase U.S. farm goods on credit, the impoverished nation will be
unable to come up with the money and the U.S. will have to foot the
bill. "The question is whether U.S. taxpayers are going to be asked
to subsidize a deadbeat dictator," Garcia said. He attributed the
shifting mood of Congress to the fact that "lots of money is being
spent by agricultural interests," led by agribusiness giant
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.</TE>
<TE>   Armey said Wednesday that if his own Dallas-area congressional
district had more of an economic stake in trade with Cuba, he might
have voted differently. But since it didn't, he followed the lead of
friends Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Rep. Ileana
Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), who are Cuban-born and staunchly anti-Castro.</TE>
<TE>   "What you see in the House of Representatives and what you see by
way of individual votes--my own is an example--is loyalties to your
friends," Armey said.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes on an issue like Cuba, my particular loyalty to Lincoln
Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen is not counterbalanced by focused
interest in my district."</TE>
<TE>   Crist said Armey's comments were intended as "an observation that
the votes are there" for a lifting of the embargo.</TE>

the used cardboard box, the envy of the world and the basis of a huge
market.</DH>

<LD>Cruising the streets of South Gate in search of America's hottest
export, Jose Gonzalez hit the brakes outside a liquor store. He
struck pay dirt, not in the refrigerated section, but in the
cardboard-filled dumpster out back.</LD>
<LD>   "With a full load I can earn around $20" at a recycling center,
Gonzalez said, pointing to the flattened Budweiser cartons in the bed
of his battered pickup. "I'm told that they'll end up in China."</LD>
<LD>   Critics have long accused Los Angeles of exporting trash to the
rest of the world. But L.A.'s blockbuster isn't Hollywood action
films or celebrity diets. It's the cardboard box.</LD>
<TE>   Foreigners are gonzo for America's high-quality used packaging,
newspapers and office scraps, last year snapping up 10.5 million tons
for recycling in their home countries. In the process, they've turned
wastepaper into America's biggest-volume export.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States is the OPEC of wastepaper," said Kent McEntee,
editor and publisher of the Paper Stock Report, a Cleveland-based
trade publication. "We produce more of it than anybody, so if you
want it, this is where you come."</TE>
<TE>   And come they have to Southern California. The Los Angeles region
has become a hotbed of used-paper merchants, drawn like '49ers to the
region's mother lode of waste. Convenient ports and cheap outbound
ocean shipping rates have helped solidify L.A.'s standing as the
nation's used-cardboard capital. Not to mention an arid climate that
helps keep scrap collectors honest.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of tricks," said Pomona businesswoman Yan Cheung,
who got her start buying wastepaper in humid Hong Kong, where cheats
tried to weight her scales with soggy loads.</TE>
<TE>   Her wastepaper exporting business, America Chung Nam Inc., is
thriving in sunny California. In little more than a decade, the
company has grown from a shoestring operation into America's No. 1
volume exporter. Last year the company sent 153,900 containers of
U.S. wastepaper across the Pacific Ocean to Asia. That's more than
twice the number of outbound sea freight containers shipped by global
giants such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Dow Chemical Co., according
to logistics trade publication the Journal of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Laboring under a massive trade deficit, the U.S. holds the dubious
distinction of claiming garbage as a prime export. But Americans can
at least take pride in knowing that the quality is second to none.</TE>
<TE>   "If U.S. wastepaper were a pretty girl, she'd be a 9 or a 10,"
said Baldwin Park-based exporter Stephen Young, president of Allan
Co. "It's the best in the world."</TE>
<TE>   To the casual observer, one brown box looks pretty much like
another. But experts such as Young know that the beauty of these and
other U.S. paper products is more than skin deep. The secret is
virgin wood pulp. Blessed with abundant forests, the U.S. is home to
some of the best-built corrugated boxes on the planet, endowed with
so much sinewy wood fiber that they put flimsy foreign-made cartons
to shame.</TE>
<TE>   Countries short on timber, especially developing Asian nations,
covet these russet beauties, chopping and boiling them to recover the
valuable fiber, which is then used as feedstock for their paper
mills. That might seem like a lot of trouble until one considers that
used corrugated paper fetches around $100 a ton, compared with about
$460 for a ton of virgin pulp. Used office paper, old newspapers,
box-factory scraps and other waste are similarly prized.</TE>
<TE>   China Drives the Market for American Castoffs</TE>
<TE>   Foreigners aren't the only ones to spot value in American
wastepaper. U.S.-based paper mills consumed nearly three-quarters of
the estimated 47 million tons recovered last year, according to the
American Forest and Paper Assn., turning it into new corrugated
cartons, newspapers, cereal boxes and grocery sacks.</TE>
<TE>   But foreign demand for U.S. castoffs is growing rapidly, up nearly
50% in the last five years alone, driven largely by a single buyer:
China.</TE>
<TE>   An emerging manufacturing powerhouse, China recently surpassed
Japan to become the world's second-largest paper consumer behind the
U.S., thanks to burgeoning domestic demand and a soaring export trade
requiring packaging for Chinese-made goods.</TE>
<TE>   Rampant deforestation and tough government restrictions on logging
mean China must rely heavily on recycling. In the last few years it
has catapulted from being a bit player to the largest single buyer of
U.S. wastepaper. In 2001 it purchased 3.6 million tons, accounting
for more than one-third of all U.S. wastepaper exports, according to
the Paper Stock Report.</TE>
<TE>   "China is gobbling everything in sight," said David Lee, general
manager of Bestway Recycling Co., which retrieves, sorts, bales and
ships thousands of tons of wastepaper annually from its four Los
Angeles-area recycling centers. "Ninety percent of everything we
collect is going there."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon at his company's South Gate recycling yard,
half a dozen 40-foot shipping containers bearing the logo of China
Ocean Shipping Co. sat waiting to be loaded with dozens of
1,500-pound bales of wastepaper. Nearly half of the material Lee's
firm processes comes from L.A.'s curbside recycling program. Thus the
junk mail, newspapers and old boxes Angelenos deposit in their blue
bins today will be reborn within weeks in China as shipping cartons,
tissue boxes, Chinese-language newspapers and disposable diapers.</TE>
<TE>   Getting all that material from here to there is the specialty of
wastepaper entrepreneurs who have flocked to the region to be close
to the source of supply. Southern California is home to 18 of the 100
largest exporting companies in the nation, 10 of them engaged in the
export of wastepaper, according to the Journal of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest is Pomona-based America Chung Nam, which is on track
to ship 3 million tons of wastepaper this year, almost all of it to
China. Founder Cheung was born on the mainland and studied accounting
before entering Hong Kong's rough-and-tumble wastepaper trade in her
20s. There the youthful number cruncher came face to face with the
realities of her new profession.</TE>
<TE>   Teaching Waste Haulers That It Pays to Be Tidy</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong recycling yards were dirty, smelly places matched only
by the business tactics of some of her customers. Loads of wastepaper
were contaminated with water and garbage, due in part to slothful
collectors but also to opportunists looking to juice the scales to
make a few extra Hong Kong dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Cheung set out to educate waste haulers about the value of
tidiness, paying premium prices for the best quality. According to
Cheung, that irritated a wise guy with the local triad society--Hong
Kong's version of the Sopranos--who informed her that he didn't want
anyone cleaning up the local recycling trade, much less some
fresh-faced female.</TE>
<TE>   "I was too young to be scared," said Cheung, now 45. "I just kept
on doing what I thought was right."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, by 1990 she realized she needed a bigger base of
supply to meet China's growing demand for wastepaper. So she set up
shop in the U.S., which last year consumed nearly 100 million tons of
paper products.</TE>
<TE>   Today, America Chung Nam employs 80 workers, and it posted sales
of $238 million in 2001. Though the dollars are relatively modest,
the company's export volume is huge, propelling it to the top of the
Journal of Commerce's list of the nation's biggest exporters, ahead
of household names such as Philip Morris and General Electric.</TE>
<TE>   America Chung Nam operates a couple of its own recycling centers,
where small-time scavengers can earn quick cash for a load of old
boxes. But it gets most of its material through contracts with
commercial waste haulers, large retailers and supermarkets and
through joint ventures it has formed with recycling yards. In China,
the company's holdings include a mammoth paper mill, a box plant and
a disposable-diaper-making facility, fed in part by the wastepaper it
collects in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   For Cheung, the L.A. region's warm weather, large Chinese-speaking
population and seemingly unlimited supply of top-notch used
wastepaper is truly the California dream.</TE>
<TE>   "So much supply ... and the quality is incomparable," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the former accountant isn't taking any chances. America
Chung Nam's 15 inspectors visit suppliers such as Bestway Recycling
regularly to ensure the quality of what they're buying. They stab the
giant paper bales with wand-like meters to test for excess moisture
and check outbound shipping containers before they're sealed to make
sure no garbage has been substituted for paper.</TE>
<TE>   Veterans such as quality-control supervisor Axel Tong can tell a
box's pedigree at a glance. Rummaging through a pile of squashed
cardboard at Bestway Recycling on a recent afternoon, he snatched up
a piece tinted a sickly orange.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Thai cardboard," he said somberly, tearing the flimsy
scrap between his fingers. "Very little fiber. The material has been
recycled many times."</TE>
<TE>   Making a Dent in the Trade Imbalance</TE>
<TE>   Spotting a caramel-brown Kellogg's shipping carton nearby, he
ripped off a flap, pointed to the downy, hair-like fibers sprouting
from the edges of the tear and broke into a wide smile.</TE>
<TE>   "That's American," he said. "It's very good quality. The best
there is."</TE>
<TE>   Suppliers don't take offense at the constant snooping. In fact
they credit America Chung Nam and other exporters for helping
stabilize the U.S. wastepaper market at a time when American
manufacturing is slumping and the domestic economy wobbling.</TE>
<TE>   Ocean shipping companies are grateful too. America's huge trade
imbalance, which in 2001 totaled $426.6 billion, has created some
wildly lopsided logistics, particularly on Asian trade routes.
Hundreds of thousands of shipping containers land annually on U.S.
shores stuffed with merchandise from China and Japan, countries that
buy from the U.S. only a fraction of what they sell here.</TE>
<TE>   Shipping lines don't get paid for transporting empties back across
the Pacific. So they offer rock-bottom rates on outbound
wastepaper--as little as $300 for a 40-foot container filled with 23
tons of material--just to get a paying load for the return trip.</TE>
<TE>   "All the carriers fight for the wastepaper," said Matt Plezia, a
planner with the Port of Long Beach, who says the material is his
facility's largest volume export, accounting for 15% of total
outbound containers last year. "They'd rather have something than
nothing in those containers."</TE>
<TE>   It's a bittersweet trade for domestic box makers such as Lewis
Eagle, owner of Carson-based Empire Container Corp. His industry has
struggled with the economic slowdown and the continuing exodus of
manufacturers from U.S. shores. Eagle's business is off nearly 15%
this year, and he doesn't see it improving any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   The only bright spot is that the corrugated waste left over from
his manufacturing process is in high demand and has become a big
contributor to his bottom line. Eagle sells two truckloads a week,
knowing full well that they probably will end up in China, whose box
plants are putting the squeeze on his livelihood.</TE>
<TE>   "It has become a significant portion of my profits," Eagle said.
"But the more they buy from me means there is that much less
manufacturing going on here. It's a double-edged sword."</TE>

<HD>Telecom Giant's Troubles Deepen</HD>
<DH>Business: WorldCom discloses $3.3 billion in improper
accounting, bringing the total to $7.2 billion. It says the figure
may go higher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly doubling the scope of what already was the largest corporate
financial scandal in U.S. history, battered telecom giant WorldCom
Inc. said Thursday that its auditors have uncovered an additional
$3.3 billion in faulty accounting dating to 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure, two months after the company said it had
improperly accounted for $3.9 billion in expenses, is expected to
turn up the heat under Bernard J. Ebbers, WorldCom's longtime chief
executive who was forced out in April. It also raises the question of
whether the company ever had the financial wherewithal to be
considered one of the nation's premier telecommunications firms.</LD>
<LD>   The revelation is sure to exacerbate worries among investors and
lawmakers about widespread corporate malfeasance and to increase
pressure on prosecutors to bring charges against Ebbers and others
connected with the rash of corporate scandals.</LD>
<TE>   And it could trigger additional regulatory actions, after Congress
was prompted to pass sweeping corporate reform laws in the wake of
WorldCom's initial disclosure of improper accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom, the parent company of MCI, already
is the focus of several federal investigations of accounting
irregularities that covered up the telecom firm's mounting losses
amid an industrywide meltdown. Taken together, the company now is
suspected of misreporting $7.2 billion on its books over the last 3
1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's latest disclosure raises doubts about the company's
financial health in 1999 and 2000, when the company posted record
sales and profit and enjoyed star status on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, WorldCom did not provide corrected figures for the
years in question.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting high jinks don't completely erase WorldCom's profit
for those years.</TE>
<TE>   But they stand to further erode the trust of skittish investors
after a series of corporate scandals this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors are completely fed up with the sector," said David
Willis, a telecommunications analyst at Meta Group, a technology
research firm in Stamford, Conn. "Nobody really knows what to believe
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom said Thursday that the newly discovered bookkeeping
irregularities boosted its operating income since 1999 through the
improper counting of money that had been set aside to cover unpaid
customer accounts.</TE>
<TE>   That is a different sort of accounting sleight of hand than the
methods used to hide $3.9 billion in expenses in 2001 and 2002, which
also boosted earnings.</TE>
<TE>   The company said in a statement that its internal financial review
is not yet complete and that "additional amounts of improperly
reported [earnings] and pretax income may be discovered and
announced."</TE>
<TE>   Crippled by debt and undermined by news of the scandal, WorldCom
filed July 21 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The case
displaced that of Enron Corp. as the nation's largest bankruptcy
filing.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, which listed $104 billion in assets and debt of $41
billion, is the country's second-largest long-distance provider and
is home to a network considered critical to the country's Internet
infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew the problem was a lot bigger than WorldCom told us, but
the extent of this fraud is staggering," said Ken Johnson, spokesman
for Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), who heads the House Energy and
Commerce Committee and is the driving force behind investigations of
WorldCom and Enron. "It's hard to believe that Bernie Ebbers had no
idea what was going on."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, federal officials arrested former WorldCom Chief
Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan and former Controller David F.
Myers on seven criminal counts of fraud, conspiracy and submitting
false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Both men were released on bail, and their attorneys have said they
would plead not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Observers believe prosecutors hope to strike a plea agreement with
one or both men to gain evidence against Ebbers, who drove WorldCom's
rapid rise on Wall Street and pocketed millions of dollars in salary,
loans and bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to come back around to Bernie," telecom analyst Willis
said. "They were relying on just a few people who knew all the pieces
of the business, and they were relying on those same people to make
the numbers. That was really a bad formula."</TE>
<TE>   Myers and his attorney met Thursday with the chief of U.S. Atty.
James Comey's white-collar fraud unit.</TE>
<TE>   None of the participants would discuss the meeting's purpose.</TE>
<TE>   The news also looks increasingly bad for accounting firm Arthur
Andersen, which served as WorldCom's auditor until it was replaced
recently by KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   The new auditing team found the additional accounting flaws while
scouring WorldCom's books.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom spokesman Brad Burns said the company is committed to
cleaning up its books.</TE>
<TE>   Additional disclosures of improper accounting still may be in the
offing, the company said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a shop to clean up, and we're going to continue to do
so," Burns said. "We're doing a full investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, WorldCom warned Thursday that it could write off as
much as $50.6 billion in intangible assets when it restates its
financial results.</TE>

<HD>Village's Prayers Answered by Surgery on Conjoined Twins</HD>
<DH>Faith: Jubilation sweeps Guatemalan birthplace of the
girls, where God is thanked for a miracle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE-MARIE O'CONNOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BELEN, Guatemala</DL>
<LD>In this tiny impoverished hamlet on Guatemala's lush south coast,
dozens of villagers are singing, clapping and praising the Lord for
the successful surgery that separated twin baby girls joined at the
head.</LD>
<LD>   As a church band plays and three preachers take turns celebrating
the word of God, people are hugging, holding hands and gathering
around the family of the "Maritas"--the little Marias--born to a
young banana packer and his wife.</LD>
<LD>   Here, at the end of a long, stony, unpaved road, miracles are in
short supply and punishing setbacks are the stuff of daily life.
Villagers' faith has been tested before. During the 1980s, many lost
friends and family in a brutal army campaign.</LD>
<TE>   But as people around the world applauded the complex surgery
performed in Los Angeles on Monday as an astounding medical feat,
here in the girls' hometown it is seen as nothing less than the work
of God.</TE>
<TE>   "It was our faith that saved them," said Loyda de Jesus Lopez, the
twins' grandmother, her eyes shining. She stood on the dirt floor of
her one-room house and smiled at dozens of family members and friends
who bowed their heads in prayer. Some nursed infants and others
rocked babies suspended in rough twine hammocks.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few weeks, the year-old twins have been the subject of
marathon prayer sessions. They were honored at a special Mass in
Guatemala's Metropolitan Cathedral, and they remain a favorite topic
among fellow guatemaltecos after the stories in newspapers and on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard that they made it, I thanked God. I cried. This
could only be the work of a miracle," said Consuelo Celada, 40, an
attendant at a Guatemala City handicrafts shop. In the store window
is a 4-foot statue of the Virgin of Fatima that has become a magnet
for pleas for the girls' safe deliverance.</TE>
<TE>   Belen is about 120 miles southwest of Guatemala City. It is in a
deep forest of towering mahogany and other tropical hardwood trees,
their trunks laced with snake-like vines. Wrinkled green pods of
cacao--the raw material for chocolate--jut out from woody plants, and
the swelling purple blooms of ripening bananas arch overhead.
Butterflies patterned in black, red and yellow flutter across the
path like confetti; parrots shriek and fuss overhead.</TE>
<TE>   It is a place where doctors are a luxury few can indulge. There is
limited electricity, no running water.</TE>
<TE>   When the twins were born last year, "we cried every day," said
Lopez, 47, the girls' grandmother. "We said, 'Why did this happen to
us?' My son was sad. He felt it couldn't have been his fault. Perhaps
it was a test of God."</TE>
<TE>   The girls' parents, Wenceslao Quiej Lopez, 21, and Alba Leticia
Alvarez, 22, went to a village midwife when Alvarez became pregnant.
No one detected the twins' abnormality.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of her pregnancy, Alvarez began to suffer
knife-like pains. After eight days, the family found someone to drive
her down the rutted road leading from the village to the city of
Mazatenango.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez thought state health insurance had been regularly deducted
from his pay, but he did not have enough documentation to satisfy the
local social security hospital, the family said. A private clinic
performed a Caesarean section for $640, they said. They had to sell
off precious farmland to pay the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The twins were sent to a state hospital in Guatemala City. A
Mazatenango church held a special Mass for them.</TE>
<TE>   "I had so much sadness in my heart," recalled Juliana Hernandez,
96, the twins' great-grandmother, a tiny, silver-haired woman with a
lined face and sparkling brown eyes. She speaks a Mayan dialect and
wears skirts made of distinctive woven cloth.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, what kind of life will our little twins have?"</TE>
<TE>   But the baby girls--Maria Teresa and Maria de Jesus--were happy,
said Lopez, their grandmother. "They smiled and laughed. If me or one
of the nurses walked into their room, they called out from their
beds."</TE>
<TE>   Their father--called "Wency" by his family--earned $60 to $70
every 20 days for bagging bananas at a plantation, his family said.
Each workday he would leave his house at 4 a.m., returning late at
night, they said.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife live on his family farm, in an 8-foot-wide
split-rail shack with a dirt floor. He seemed to be following in the
footsteps of his father, Wenceslao Quiej, 50, also a banana worker
who earns about $3 a day.</TE>
<TE>   The birth of the girls was not the first great challenge faced by
the 40-member extended family.</TE>
<TE>   During a succession of military governments in the early 1980s,
the area around Belen was hard hit. Guerrilla groups expanded, and
the army struck back at labor unionists, pro-democracy activists,
peasant leaders and church workers. Scores of people turned up dead
or simply disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, after the military abandoned an outpost near the
Belen village school, human rights groups dug up the bodies of 16
people there.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the army, but no one would dare denounce it. They would
come to burn your house or take you away," said Georgine Lopez
Hernandez, 43, the twin's great-aunt, who wore a long white dress to
the celebration Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez Hernandez's aunt and uncle were among those who disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how much you prayed, you never heard from them again,"
Lopez Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, her prayers have been answered. The celebration of the
twins' surgery brought her from Guatemala City, where she works 26
days a month caring for an elderly woman.</TE>
<TE>   She has spent every day of her furlough this week at prayer
sessions like the open-air celebration of 70 or so Belen villagers
under the trees at her sister's small farm in a valley that rises to
the Santa Maria volcano.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the power of God. God granted the doctors the wisdom to
cure the twins," said Luis Mazariegos, 60, a farmer with a leathery,
weather-lined face. Like most of the men at the gathering, he wore
dusty jeans and work boots.</TE>
<TE>   "You are with us, Lord, when we ask your help with the little
twins. You have liberated the little twins and saved them from death.
You have given them a new life," said Mazariegos, praying aloud. He
is a rural preacher, sanctioned by the Catholic Church to compensate
for a shortage of priests in Guatemala.</TE>
<TE>   As he spoke, musicians played guitar, organ and drums. Children
frolicked. A turkey with its chicks pecked at crumbs. Dogs fighting
over scraps of food interrupted the singing, but were shooed away
with brooms and shouts.</TE>
<TE>   Leonel Mejia Melgar, director of a small community program, Radio
Victoria, took notes. Mejia has spearheaded a fund-raising drive for
the family's medical bills. He aired a radio report Thursday and
planned to cover a prayer session at the Catholic church in Belen.</TE>
<TE>   The twins' grandfather spoke to his son Tuesday morning on a phone
in a nearby town and learned that the twins were doing fine. Doctors
at UCLA's Mattel Children's Hospital said Thursday that the twins
remain in critical but stable condition. Both are being weaned off
sedatives.</TE>
<TE>   The twins opened and closed their eyes and responded to
stimulation Thursday, pulling their hands away when squeezed. Maria
de Jesus looked around when opening her eyes and moved her arms and
legs slightly.</TE>
<TE>   The prayer sessions in Belen have been marked by tears in recent
weeks, but the friends and relatives who gathered at the
grandparents' home this week wore radiant smiles.</TE>
<TE>   "We are celebrating to thank God," said the grandfather, who
listened to the service from his kitchen table as his wife set out
chicken stew and blue-corn tortillas.</TE>
<TE>   "The road to [God] is not easy," a preacher, Ismael Ramos, 44,
told the crowd. "There are tribulations, trials, struggles. But with
the help of the Lord, we can do anything."</TE>

<HD>Oscar Show Could Be Split With New York in Nod to 9/11
Healing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES and JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is considering a
proposal by New York political leaders and entertainment executives
to move part of next year's Academy Award presentations--the 75th
anniversary of Hollywood's signature event--to New York as the city
seeks to rebound from last year's terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The group of prominent New Yorkers--including Gov. George Pataki,
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Miramax Films Co-Chairman Harvey
Weinstein and Loews Hotel Chairman Jonathan Tisch--has asked the
academy to consider bringing all or at least a portion of the March
23 event to New York to help the city recover from the events of
Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Pierson, the academy's president, said Thursday that the
organization would seriously consider moving some segments of next
year's show to New York as part of a one-time deal. He said an early
proposal from Weinstein to move the entire show to New York was "out
of the question," in part because of its 10-year contract with the
Kodak Theatre, which this year became the Oscars' permanent home, and
because the expense of producing the show would double or even
triple.</LD>
<TE>   "Economically, and because of our contractual obligations, and
because this is Hollywood, we have no intention of moving this show
to New York," Pierson said in Los Angeles. However, he said, "New
York will be a huge presence in next year's show.... America wouldn't
be America without New York and the movie business wouldn't be the
movie business without New York. Just like the movies, it's part of
our culture and our lives."</TE>
<TE>   Still to be determined are which segments of the show might go
bicoastal.</TE>
<TE>   Pierson noted that any decisions about that would have to come
after a producer is selected for next year's show, most likely by
next month.</TE>
<TE>   The academy has been intrigued by the New York idea since
Weinstein and filmmaker Martin Scorsese broached it in January,
Pierson said.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't until this week, he added, that the New York
campaign shifted into high gear.</TE>
<TE>   "This year it was harder to bring Woody Allen to Hollywood than it
would be to move part of the show to New York," Pierson quipped, in
reference to the director's surprise appearance at the ceremony in
March.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the city could use the lift and [the show] could use a
boost in the ratings," said one source familiar with the discussions
who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   The source characterized the talks as "very initial
conversations."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Pataki confirmed that the effort was underway. "It
is an idea we support and we certainly are looking for ways to help
make it a reality," Joe Conway said.</TE>
<TE>   The ABC television network, which will broadcast the ceremony next
year, would be eager to accommodate a bicoastal telecast, said Kevin
Brockman, an ABC spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "ABC would be very pleased if the academy decided to include New
York in the telecast," Brockman said.</TE>
<TE>   A bicoastal broadcast "is something that has happened in the past,
something that's part of the history of the Academy Awards and if the
academy wants to do that, we would absolutely embrace it."</TE>
<TE>   The Oscars ceremony returned to Hollywood last year for the first
time since 1960, to its new home at the Kodak Theatre at the
Hollywood and Highland complex in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   For years the event was held at the Shrine Auditorium and the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Kodak is a 3,500-seat venue, far smaller than the cavernous
downtown halls. Last year's ceremony drew complaints about ticket
shortages, acoustics and parking.</TE>
<TE>   While broadcasting a portion of the show from New York might help
alleviate some problems, Pierson said "we're very happy" with the
Kodak.</TE>
<TE>   If the Academy Awards make a partial return to New York, it would
be a throwback to the 1950s, when Hollywood still had the star
wattage, but both cities shared in the telecast.</TE>
<TE>   In 1953, the first telecast in both cities occurred--with Oscars
being handed out on both coasts. Bob Hope was the host in Hollywood,
while Conrad Nagel did the honors in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The last year the show was held in both cities was 1957.</TE>
<TE>   But New York officials believe the ceremony, which exudes history
and glamour, is equally suited for a New York venue, such as Radio
City Music Hall or Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   The Academy agreed this summer to move the 2004 Academy Awards
ceremony to late February.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement comes as New York City is actively seeking the
Democratic and Republican national conventions.</TE>
<TE>   This morning, Pataki and Bloomberg will greet officials of the
Republican National Committee, who are in New York to scout locations
for the 2004 GOP convention.</TE>
<TE>   Both efforts--to bring a piece of the Oscars and to lure the
political conventions--are part of a concerted effort to promote
tourism and rebuild the economy of the nation's largest city after
the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center.</TE>

<HD>Pakistani Teenager Pleads Guilty in Plot to Bomb Sites in
Florida</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A Pakistani teenager pleaded guilty Thursday in connection with a
plot to bomb power stations and a National Guard armory in South
Florida as part of a holy war, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   Imran Mandhai, 19, was convicted on a single count of conspiracy
to damage and destroy property with fire and explosives.</LD>
<LD>   In July, Shueyb Mossa Jokhan, a 24-year-old U.S. citizen charged
in the same conspiracy, pleaded guilty to the same charge. Each faces
as much as 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</LD>
<TE>   The indictment alleged they were plotting an Islamic holy war.</TE>
<TE>   It said they scouted locations, including electrical power
stations in the Miami area and a National Guard armory in Hollywood.
The bombings were to be followed by a list of demands to the U.S.
government and other governments, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Mandhai hoped to buy AK-47 assault rifles and other weapons, night
vision equipment, stun guns, pepper spray, smoke grenades and other
military equipment, the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the two discussed targets such as the Israeli
consulate in Miami, Jewish-owned businesses and Jewish community
centers, and even mentioned Mt. Rushmore as a potential target.</TE>

<HD>Boston Priest Charged With Paying Teen for Sex at Church</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A Boston-area Roman Catholic priest repeatedly paid a teenage boy for
sex inside the rectory of a church in the 1980s, according to
criminal charges filed Thursday that dealt yet another blow to the
Archdiocese of Boston.</LD>
<LD>   Father Paul Hurley, 59, became the latest priest in the
archdiocese to face child sex abuse charges after he was indicted in
Middlesex County on two counts of child rape for allegedly engaging
in oral sex as often as once a month over about 12 months in 1987 and
1988, Dist. Atty. Martha Coakley said at a news conference.</LD>
<LD>   On most occasions, Father Hurley would give the boy, whose name
was withheld, small sums of money that he used to buy drugs and
alcohol, Coakley said. The teenager "believed he was paid based on
how well he performed sexually," Coakley said.</LD>
<TE>   Hurley will be arraigned Aug.18.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Archdiocese has been at the center of a global scandal
over sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests. At least three
other priests in the Boston Archdiocese face criminal charges related
to child sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Observers have said the abuse of children by priests and the
church hierarchy's apparent cover-up of the behavior have presented
the Catholic Church with its most serious challenge in modern times.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Hurley is still a priest, but he is not assigned to a parish.</TE>

<HD>Trade Panel Allows Inquiry Into Alleged 'Dumping' of
Catfish</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSON, Miss.</DL>
<LD>The U.S. International Trade Commission said Thursday that there is a
"reasonable indication" that the nation's catfish industry is being
threatened by a cheaper Vietnamese import.</LD>
<LD>   The decision, on a 5-0 vote, will let the Commerce Department
proceed with an investigation of whether Vietnamese frozen fillets
have been "dumped" in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Dumping is the practice of exporting a product at a price lower
than that charged for the same product in a home market.</LD>
<TE>   The Commerce Department could impose a preliminary duty in
December after its investigation.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. catfish producers--backed by the industry's chief lobby,
Indianola-based Catfish Farmers of America--claim that Vietnam has
unfairly captured 20% of the frozen catfish fillet market.</TE>
<TE>   "This is that major first step we had to have in the process,"
said Hugh Warren, executive vice president of Catfish Farmers of
America. "It is kind of gloomy around these pond banks. We need some
price recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Protecting a domestic industry that had revenue of more than $590
million last year is vital to the South. The greatest concentrations
of catfish farms are in Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana.
There are more than 190,000 acres of catfish ponds in the U.S.;
Mississippi alone accounts for 110,000 of those acres.</TE>
<TE>   The average price that processors pay farmers for catfish has
fallen over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   The current price ranges from 55 cents to 62 cents per pound. The
price was 74 cents a pound in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A win for U.S. catfish farmers would be a blow to Vietnam's
catfish industry, which employs between 300,000 and 400,000 people in
the Mekong Delta region.</TE>

<HD>Charity Labeled a Terror Group Loses Ruling</HD>
<DH>Courts: Muslim entity fought the seizure of its assets by
U.S., but judge calls actions justified.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Thursday dismissed a challenge by the Holy Land
Foundation for Relief and Development, the nation's largest Muslim
charity, to its designation as a terrorist group and the seizing of
its assets by the U.S. government.</LD>
<LD>   In a 58-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler gave a
sweeping victory to the U.S. Justice Department, which had defended
the government's shutdown last year of the foundation which was
headquartered in Richardson, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   On Dec. 4, the U.S. Treasury Department designated the foundation
as a terrorist group and froze all of its assets, for allegedly
funneling millions of dollars to Hamas, a Palestinian organization
blamed for repeated attacks in Israel.</LD>
<TE>   Holy Land Foundation sued, seeking a preliminary injunction to
prevent the U.S. government from continuing to block or interfere
with its access to and disposition of its assets.</TE>
<TE>   In turning down the injunction, Kessler said, "both the government
and the public have a strong interest in curbing the escalating
violence in the Middle East and its effects on the security of the
United States and the world as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   She said orders blocking assets "are an important component of
U.S. foreign policy, and the president's choice of this tool to
combat terrorism is entitled to particular deference."</TE>
<TE>   Kessler rejected the foundation's arguments that the blocking
order violates the administrative procedure law, a law protecting
religious freedom, and various constitutional provisions, including
its due process and free-speech rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Designation of Holy Land Foundation as a terrorist and seizure of
its assets do not constitute arbitrary and capricious agency action,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The only claim Kessler did not dismiss involved the foundation's
argument that the government's entry onto its corporate premises and
removal of its property without a warrant violated its 4th Amendment
right against unreasonable search and seizure.</TE>
<TE>   Although this part of the lawsuit can go forward, Kessler said the
government advanced strong arguments in support of its position
defending the search and seizure.</TE>

<HD>Judge Says PETA May Join Party--With a Sad Elephant</HD>
<DH>Arts: Activists granted right to be part of the exhibit of
animal sculptures in D.C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Those so-called party animals--the 800-pound sculptures of donkeys
and elephants that are spending the summer on the streets of the
nation's capital--may soon be joined by a sad circus elephant.</LD>
<LD>   In a victory for the animal-rights group People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon on Thursday
ordered the District of Columbia Commission on Arts and the
Humanities to display PETA's circus animal sculpture--with a tear
running down its cheek and a shackle on its leg--in a "prominent
location."</LD>
<LD>   The commission says it is reviewing the ruling and may appeal.</LD>
<TE>   The controversy began last year when the Arts Commission,
borrowing from Chicago's cows and Baltimore's fish, began to plan an
exhibit of public art sculptures. In a bid to increase both tourism
and smiles, it briefly considered using the panda as a model for the
street art--based on the National Zoo's beloved and much-visited
pair.</TE>
<TE>   But eventually the commission settled on the city's political
legacy, opting to paint or design 100 elephants (for the Republicans)
and 100 donkeys (for the Democrats).</TE>
<TE>   Invitations were distributed to 10,000 artists. A committee chose
the finalists.</TE>
<TE>   It being Washington, there were immediate ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   The Green Party sued, arguing that there were more than two
parties in the nation's capital, that in fact Green Party candidate
Ralph Nader had won 6% of the vote in Washington, and that, at 9%,
George W. Bush did not do much better. The courts rejected the
argument, but there is a Green Party animal on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   And PETA submitted a design, created by New Yorker magazine artist
Harry Bliss, meant to depict the harsh life it said is suffered by
circus elephants. The commission, eager to showcase the "whimsical
and imaginative side of the nation's capital," rejected it as too
negative.</TE>
<TE>   Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, PETA argued
that its elephant was rejected not because it contained a message but
because the commission did not want its message on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Leon agreed that the commission had been inconsistent, since
some of the other elephants and donkeys had plenty of political
content in their art. Among the themes on the streets are animals
depicting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech,
the heroes of Sept. 11 and the Florida butterfly ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The court said the panel's "inconsistency was inherently
unreasonable and therefore constituted impermissible discrimination
in violation of the 1st Amendment."</TE>
<TE>   The D.C. Arts Commission, which plans to auction the party animals
in October for future arts projects funding, had left one
polyurethane elephant unpainted in anticipation of the court
decision. Judge Leon ordered Thursday that it be painted
"expeditiously."</TE>
<TE>   PETA, which last year successfully designed some anti-meat-eating
cows for New York's public art display, was pleased with the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Life is no party for animals forced to perform in circuses," said
Matthew Penzer, PETA's legal counsel. "With the court's ruling,
elephants' cries for justice were heard--and will now be
displayed--in Washington."</TE>

<HD>Bird on a Wire Has News for Scientists</HD>
<DH>Research: A crow shows she can make a tool to get
food--considered a sign of superior intelligence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Betty was hungry, but the food was out of reach and the tool she
needed to get at it had been swiped by a bully. What to do? Grab some
wire, bend it into a hook and get the food.</LD>
<LD>   Betty may be a crow, but she's no birdbrain.</LD>
<LD>   And she repeated the success over and over, using bent wires to
pull the small bucket of food up by its handle. Her exploits are
reported in today's issue of the journal Science.</LD>
<TE>   "We were delighted and extremely surprised," said Alex Kacelnik,
who teaches at England's Oxford University, where Betty performed her
feats.</TE>
<TE>   Kacelnik and his colleagues were trying to determine whether the
crows, which have been known to use twigs to pick things up in the
wild, could choose the right tool to retrieve food. They did not,
however, expect the birds to make their own tools.</TE>
<TE>   It was a surprising development, agreed Richard Banks of the
Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, an expert on North
American crows.</TE>
<TE>   Some chimpanzees have been observed using stones to open nuts, and
monkeys are known to use sticks to fish bugs out of nests.</TE>
<TE>   "Toolmaking and tool use has always been considered one of the
diagnostics of a superior intelligence," Kacelnik said. "Now a bird
is shown to have greater sophistication than many closer relatives of
us humans.</TE>
<TE>   "People expect apes to be the pinnacle of intelligence in the
animal kingdom because they are our closest relatives, but nature may
have reached different solutions to similar problems," he said.The
Oxford researchers gave two crows--Betty and Abel--a bucket of food
inside a tube and two pieces of wire, one hooked and one straight.</TE>
<TE>   Soon "the male stole the hooked wire from the female....She then
picked the remaining straight wire and bent it herself," Kacelnik
said, adding that she repeated the trick several times.</TE>

<HD>First Payout From 9/11 Compensation Fund to Be $1.04
Million</HD>
<DH>Settlement: The family agrees to not appeal or file suit.
They 'wanted closure,' lawyer says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The family of a man killed in the World Trade Center attacks Sept. 11
has become the first to publicly accept a package offered by the
federal Victim Compensation Fund, an attorney for the victim's family
confirmed Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The family accepted the $1.04-million settlement rather than
pursue an appeal or a lawsuit. Their son was single and in his 20s,
working in financial services and earning nearly $60,000 a year.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a family that wanted closure," said lawyer Roberta Gordon
of Bryan Cave LLP. "They wanted it done."</LD>
<TE>   Of the more than 3,000 victims in the trade center attacks, 634
families have agreed not to file lawsuits and applied to the
compensation fund. Of those cases, 14 families with straightforward
cases have received notice about their awards, calculated by a
formula.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 10 days, the Justice Department sent certified letters
to the families detailing the compensation packages and asking
whether they accept or reject the proposal, spokesman Charles Miller
said. Within the next week or two, the fund will post on its Web site
general details about the victims receiving funds and the amount
given to their families.</TE>
<TE>   In a July 27 letter to one victim's family, Kenneth Feinberg, who
oversees the fund, explained that the family may accept the award or
request a hearing to present "extraordinary circumstances indicating
that the presumed award does not adequately address your claim."</TE>
<TE>   Families who request a hearing lose the right to appeal the
compensation. Families also must complete a "compensation form for
deceased victims," describing how they plan to distribute the money
among their relatives. The package also includes a one-page tip sheet
on distributing the funds and provides families with a toll-free
number to call with questions.</TE>
<TE>   "As always, I emphasized that no amount of money can alleviate the
losses suffered on Sept. 11," Feinberg wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In Thursday's case, officials subtracted $150,000 from the
$1.19-million settlement for benefits the man had as life insurance.
The victim's parents now must determine how to split part of the
settlement among adult relatives he would have wanted to receive the
money, Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said that, depending upon how families request funds to be
distributed, they should receive their payments within weeks.</TE>
<TE>   A second set of families requested hearings with Feinberg to
explain special factors he should consider when deciding their
payouts. These 16 families still await their compensation packages.
The Justice Department would not say when it will mail compensation
packages for the families who had hearings. But lawyers involved in
their cases say that gathering information for these cases has proved
difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything has been more complicated and more time-consuming than
anybody thought," said Larry Stewart, president of Trial Lawyers
Care, a group of 1,200 lawyers who volunteered to represent victims'
families. "It's largely the process of turning over a rock and
finding three rocks to turn over."</TE>
<TE>   Some companies that lost employees in the attacks have yet to
provide information about victims' work histories, which may
determine what could have been their projected earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "There is, for lack of a better word, survivor guilt that is
slowing this process down," Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   Many families still are in the early stages of filing claims as
they sort through family squabbles about compensation or grapple with
their grief.</TE>
<TE>   "Not everybody is rushing to file their application," said Drew
Britcher, a Parsippany, N.J.-based lawyer whose firm has volunteered
to help 10 families receive compensation. Of his 10 cases, only one
family has filed its application.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Nature ran amok at a high school here over summer vacation, bringing
alligators, poisonous snakes and bobcats to campus grounds, school
officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Beavers apparently dammed a stream flowing near A. Maceo Smith
High School, creating a 15-acre swamp that became home to two
alligators that moved in while classes were out for the summer.</LD>
<LD>   Dallas animal control supervisor Tim Hawkins said he has seen two
alligators, about 4 to 6 feet long, in the swamp.</LD>
<TE>   School principal Dwain Govan asked animal control to remove the
alligators from school property, so they stay off of the football and
softball fields.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy rains over the summer caused the swamp to encroach on the
fields.</TE>
<TE>   The fences will be up before classes start at month's end. But
those students who have returned early for extracurricular
activities, such as band member Likiesha Edwards, found something
more than the start of fall classes to worry about.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's very dangerous for football players and people like
me in the band to go out there and practice," she said.</TE>

<HD>Plan on Lynx Release OKd in Colorado</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Colorado Wildlife Commission on Thursday approved plans to
release more lynx in the state on condition that federal officials
give the state greater say in managing the cats.</LD>
<LD>   A Colorado Sierra Club official claimed the decision was driven by
politics, not concern for the lynx.</LD>
<LD>   The resolution, approved 6 to 2, directs the Division of Wildlife
to proceed with plans to transplant up to 180 more lynx from Canada,
a move biologists say is needed to give the state's reintroduction
program the best chance to succeed.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not sure there's anybody who doesn't want us to succeed with
the lynx," state wildlife chief Russ George said.</TE>
<TE>   But commissioners want to make sure the animals' welfare is
balanced with protection of people's rights and believe the state can
do that better.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists think there might not be enough of the cats, now
scattered throughout the southwest Colorado mountains, to establish a
self-sustaining population.</TE>
<TE>   The state released 96 lynx from Canada in 1999 and 2000 to
reestablish the longhaired, tuft-eared cat in Colorado. There is no
evidence the remaining 39 accounted for in late spring have any
offspring.</TE>
<TE>   State officials must negotiate a deal with the U.S. Forest Service
and other agencies to manage the program because lynx are designated
as threatened on the federal Endangered Species List and as
endangered by the state. That gives the animals certain protections,
including restrictions on killing the lynx if they threaten domestic
livestock.</TE>
<TE>   George said Colorado and federal officials have already opened
negotiations on an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildlife Commission is looking for ways to get around the
Endangered Species Act, said Mike Smith, wildlife chairman of the
Colorado chapter of the Sierra Club.</TE>
<TE>   "They are holding the program hostage," Smith said. "While they
play politics with it, the numbers of lynx dwindle and make it even
harder to establish a viable population in Colorado."</TE>
<TE>   He said there is no reason to sanction the killing of lynx because
they are not the kind of predators wolves are. The cats' main prey is
snowshoe rabbits.</TE>
<TE>   George acknowledged that some of the plan's provisions may spark
controversy, but the goal is to craft something that is palatable to
as many people as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Lynx were native to Colorado, but were wiped out by trapping,
poisoning and loss of habitat because of development. The last
confirmed lynx sighting before reintroduction was in 1973 near Vail.</TE>

<HD>Moussaoui Prosecutors Seek to Play Flight 93 Tape at His
Trial</HD>
<DH>Courts: The government also asks the judge to allow a N.Y.
witness to 9/11 attack to testify.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors want to play the cockpit tape from United
Airlines Flight 93--in which passengers wrested control of the
hijacked plane--for the jury hearing the case of Zacarias Moussaoui,
according to court papers filed Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In the first glimpses of how the government intends to present the
human impact of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, prosecutors also
asked U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema for permission to have one
law enforcement officer from New York use photographs and videotapes
of two other planes crashing into the World Trade Center to summarize
the attack for the jury.</LD>
<LD>   The government also wants to introduce more than 2,800 photographs
of victims from the World Trade Center "so the jury properly
understands who was murdered instead of merely hearing statistics,"
the motion said.</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui, 34, is the only person charged with any role in the
Sept. 11 plot, and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Now
representing himself, he has said he was a member of Al Qaeda and
loyal to Osama bin Laden but was not a participant in the Sept. 11
conspiracy. Prosecutors have not revealed what evidence they have
linking Moussaoui to the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   A grand jury indictment outlines Moussaoui's actions before Sept.
11 and alleges that they were similar to the hijackers', including
receipt of money transfers from an Al Qaeda operative.</TE>
<TE>   The tape and transcript of the cockpit voice recorder of Flight
93, which crashed into a field in Pennsylvania, has been closely
guarded by the government, and the prosecutors' request to play it
includes a petition to seal any transcripts of the recording.
Relatives of the plane's passengers were allowed to listen to the
tape, but they were not given a copy. The government's motion says
that Moussaoui and his standby counsel, the appointed attorneys he
fired in June, have been given a copy.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also reveal that a private plane, ExecuJet 956, picked
up some of the radio transmissions from Flight 93 because they were
operating on the same radio frequency. They ask Brinkema for
permission to play that tape for the jury too.</TE>
<TE>   ExecuJet 956 was one of a fleet of small jets available for hire
from a company now called Net Jets, a charter service headquartered
in Woodbridge, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate motion, prosecutors say they plan to use videotapes
and photos of the World Trade Center attacks during both the guilt
and penalty phases of Moussaoui's trial. Assistant U.S. Atty. David
Novak wrote that the visual aids will be particularly important in
the penalty phase, when the government tries to prove that the crime
was especially heinous or cruel or involved serious physical abuse to
the victims in order to persuade the jury to impose the death
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors want to summon Det. James Wheeler of the New York and
New Jersey Port Authority as their "summary witness."</TE>
<TE>   The government wants to call Wheeler instead of a dozen different
people to explain what is being shown in the videos and photos.
Wheeler was at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, and although he
did not see the planes hit the towers, his experience enables him to
serve as an explanatory witness, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Novak points out that in most complicated criminal cases, both
sides stipulate to the jury that certain facts are not in dispute.
But Moussaoui has not responded to stipulation offers, Novak wrote,
meaning prosecutors will have to prove every aspect of the case,
including that the attacks happened.</TE>
<TE>   "The use of Det. Wheeler as a summary witness is particularly
appropriate in this case," Novak wrote, "because there is no question
that the Sept. 11 attacks happened and these victims were murdered."</TE>

<HD>For Feuding Nixon Sisters, Finally a Peace With Honor</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Eisenhower and Cox's deal boosts the presidential
library and ends a bitter rift.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG and STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>For about 16 hours, behind closed doors in a downtown Miami hotel,
they argued, haggled and negotiated. There were lawyers, trustees and
two daughters of an American president once so alienated from each
other they wouldn't speak.</LD>
<LD>   At one point, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower, the
feuding children of the late Richard Nixon, broke off from the group
of more than a dozen others and went off by themselves. "They sat in
a room, just the two of them, and resolved it quickly," a source
close to the families said Thursday, speaking on condition of
anonymity. "It was done in a day, which shows how little controversy
there really was."</LD>
<LD>   The concrete result was a written two-page agreement that frees up
a $20-million bequest to the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace
Foundation in Yorba Linda from one of the late president's closest
friends, Charles "Bebe" Rebozo. What may be more memorable for most
Americans is the end it may bring to the lengthy, bitter and highly
publicized rift between the Nixon daughters.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a long story, but in the end, we reached a settlement,"
said Robert Landon, a Florida attorney for the library foundation.
"Everybody is agreed, and that is good."</TE>
<TE>   "The daughters resolved this. It was just the two of them," the
source close to the families said.</TE>
<TE>   It remained unclear, however, whether the accord will help achieve
one of the library's key goals: obtaining Nixon's presidential papers
to place on public display. The nine-acre site in Orange County is
the only presidential library in the country not to possess the
papers of its subject, in this case the 37th president and only chief
executive in U.S. history to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years after his death, Nixon remains one of the most
controversial figures in modern American history--farsighted
statesman to his admirers, unprincipled saboteur of the Constitution
to his foes. Twenty-eight years ago today, amid the rising scandal of
Watergate, he boarded a helicopter and departed from the White House
in disgrace, bringing to a close one of the greatest dramas in this
country's political life.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Nixon resigned, Congress decreed that the General
Services Administration, the parent agency of the National Archives,
should seize all his official papers and recordings to guarantee that
Nixon would not destroy them.</TE>
<TE>   The collection is now held in the National Archives annex in
College Park, Md. Until his death, Nixon fought bitterly to reclaim
his presidential papers, and in 2000 the federal government agreed to
pay $18 million to his estate to settle claims that the documents
were improperly seized.</TE>
<TE>   Landon and other lawyers said the terms of the agreement finalized
around 1:45 a.m. Wednesday were supposed to remain confidential, and
they refused to disclose them. Gerald T. Wetherington, a former
Florida judge who served as court-appointed mediator, said he also
had pledged to remain silent.</TE>
<TE>   Two sources familiar with the agreement, however, said both the
library foundation and each of the Nixon sisters are to retain some
control over how the money is spent. Since 1996, the sisters have
feuded about how the library should be managed, with Cox wanting the
Nixon family to make the major decisions and Eisenhower seeking
greater power for the professional staff.</TE>
<TE>   In setting up his trust, Rebozo--a former Key Biscayne banker who
died in 1998--stipulated that both sisters and another longtime Nixon
confidant, Robert H. Abplanalp, approve the expenditure of his
bequest to the library. With the sisters unable to agree on who was
in charge, trustees of the Rebozo estate balked at releasing the
money.</TE>
<TE>   "The trustees felt that until the library and designated
individuals were in concert, it was difficult to simply forward
funds," said Abplanalp, 80, who made a fortune as inventor of the
leakproof aerosol valve.</TE>
<TE>   Nixon had hoped his daughters would serve as library co-directors.
But friends told The Times last spring that Tricia, 56, had been
effectively cut out of the important decisions, while younger sister
Julie, 53, had allied herself with the library's executive director,
John H. Taylor. A pair of lawsuits filed in Orange County this year
pitted the sisters against each other, though the settlement resolves
these disputes and the suits will be dismissed, attorneys said.</TE>
<TE>   In the talkathon at Miami's Hotel Inter-Continental that stretched
into the wee hours of Wednesday, the sisters reportedly agreed that
none of the Rebozo bequest could be spent without the unanimous
approval of themselves, Abplanalp and the library's board of
directors.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a lot of haggling and controversy," said
Abplanalp, who had returned to the Yonkers, N.Y., headquarters of his
company, Precision Valve Corp., and spoke to a reporter by telephone.
"I'm so glad it's done. If I were a drinking man, I'd go out and
celebrate."</TE>
<TE>   Conferees said they lunched on sandwiches and skipped a sit-down
dinner, gobbling finger foods instead to save time. Abplanalp gave
especially high marks to Wetherington for his skill at arbitration
and his dogged persistence in search of unanimity. "He'd let us go
out to the john--once in a while," he said. "He was extraordinary."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how relations are now between the Nixon daughters, Abplanalp
replied, "Fine. But I'd rather they tell you."</TE>
<TE>   The sisters weren't granting interviews Thursday. But in a brief
statement released through the library, they said: "Tricia Nixon Cox
and her sister, Julie Nixon Eisenhower, are delighted to announce
that Tuesday's mediation in Miami over Mr. Rebozo's wonderful bequest
was successful and that all parties are pleased with the outcome."</TE>
<TE>   Before Cox and Eisenhower left Miami, they posed together for a
news photographer. Eisenhower put her arm around her older sibling,
and they were all smiles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a wonderful relationship," predicted the source
close to the families. "This process brought them closer together."</TE>
<TE>   In January, the library foundation filed lawsuits in Florida and
California in an attempt to gain control of the Rebozo gift. In June,
a Miami probate judge, Maria Korvick, ordered the sisters, Abplanalp,
library representatives and Rebozo trustees into face-to-face
mediation. "There is going to be a party, and everybody's going to
come," Korvick quipped.</TE>
<TE>   Rebozo, who provided Nixon with a Key Biscayne retreat when he was
in office, left 65% of his estate to the library. The trust
transferred $781,000 in 1999, but nothing since. A check for $1.3
million intended for taxes has been frozen.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, the library's executive director, took part in the Miami
talks and said the agreement was a milestone for the institution.</TE>
<TE>   "While the library was never dependent upon the income from Mr.
Rebozo's wonderful bequest, it is going to be delightful news indeed
that it will now be possible to enhance the foundation's work on
behalf of the Nixon legacy," he said. Taylor declined to say how the
money would be spent, saying the decision was "up to the board."</TE>
<TE>   The collection at the National Archives includes some 44 million
pages of written records, 4,000 hours of White House audiotapes and
untold photographic, videotape and film records, Taylor said. There
are no current negotiations to bring the immense trove of information
to Yorba Linda, but this week's agreement might buttress the
library's claim.</TE>
<TE>   "The sense of reconciliation and unity cannot help but enhance the
picture," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Also unclear is whether the agreement might have consequences for
the library's executive director himself. Earlier this year, a lawyer
for Cox suggested to the board that Taylor be replaced, largely
because of his role in the dispute. In a letter, attorney Thomas R.
Malcolm said Taylor had stirred up a "media frenzy" by suing over the
Rebozo money.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Taylor said he had no intention of leaving: "I serve
at the pleasure of the board and the board has given me no indication
it wants to make a change."</TE>
<TE>   Robert F. Ellsworth, a member of the library's board of directors
and Nixon's ambassador to NATO, said it is too early to know exactly
how the library will use the Rebozo gift. "Give us a couple, three
weeks to think this through and to design our new approach in the new
era of good feeling," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ellsworth added that he was glad the disagreement between the late
president's children appeared to be behind them, and called their new
concord "a great victory for the Nixon legacy."</TE>
<TE>   Abplanalp, who was still hoarse from the negotiations, spoke of
his late friend with undimmed affection and respect when asked how he
assessed that legacy. "I think Richard Nixon was a greatly
misunderstood president," he said. "He was one of the all-time
geniuses who ever sat in that office. I don't think we'd have our
present problems if he were still there."</TE>

<HD>Osprey Has Powerful Doubter in Pentagon's Weapon Buyer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon's chief weapon buyer said Thursday that he remained
skeptical about the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, which resumed
flight testing in May after two crashes that killed 23 Marines, but
he said a decision about its continuation was unlikely until next
year.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm probably the most skeptical person in the Department of
Defense right now on the V-22," built by Boeing Co. and Textron Inc.,
Defense Undersecretary Edward Aldridge said.</LD>
<LD>   The Marine Corps is conducting two years of tests on software,
hydraulics and other changes to the aircraft, which uses twin swivel
rotors to take off and land like a helicopter and fly like an
airplane.</LD>
<TE>   "I've got some real problems with the airplane, but the only way
to prove or disprove my concerns is to put it through a very thorough
flight test program," Aldridge said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon is considering whether to scrap the $40-billion
program. In the meantime, the Pentagon expected to receive a study
next month of possible alternatives to the V-22, including the CH-53
Sea Stallion helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   The MV-22, the Marine Corps version of the V-22, was grounded in
December 2000 after one crashed in North Carolina and killed four
Marines.</TE>
<TE>   In the same year, 19 troops died in an Arizona crash blamed on
human error and other factors that caused critics to question whether
the revolutionary aircraft was too unstable to handle during combat.</TE>
<TE>   Aldridge said the aircraft could become uncontrollable if one of
its twin rotors stalled as it hovered, and tests were being conducted
to determine if pilots could learn to prevent such stalls.</TE>

<HD>State Dept. Comes to Aid of Parking Scofflaws</HD>
<DH>New York: Mayor's plan to tow diplomats' cars could bring
retaliation abroad, Powell worries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Newsday</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Besides bombings, hijackings and failed trade agreements, U.S.
diplomats abroad soon may have another worry: retaliatory towing.</LD>
<LD>   The State Department is so concerned that Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg's plan to tow diplomatic scofflaws' cars could lead to
retaliation against U.S. diplomats abroad that Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell personally intervened.</LD>
<LD>   Powell asked Bloomberg to resume negotiations with State.</LD>
<TE>   "It is always a possibility that there could be retaliation
against U.S. vehicles overseas," said a senior U.S. official who
asked not to be identified. "The thought of a U.S. diplomatic courier
vehicle moving through the streets of, say, Xanadu, carrying
classified material and having that vehicle seized by a foreign
government, I don't find that being in the best interest of the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   Xanadu is fictional, and being a good diplomat, the official
didn't want to name a specific country. But there are plenty of
nations targeted by Bloomberg's crackdown on unpaid tickets. The city
plans to start towing cars today with consular plates that have more
than $250 in outstanding fines.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday night, city and State Department officials resumed
negotiations after Bloomberg received Powell's call. The nation's top
diplomat asked Bloomberg "to return to the table to resolve this
dispute, before we [the city] are forced to tow cars," Bloomberg
spokesman Jordan Barowitz said.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of diplomatic parking--and diplomats using their
immunity to avoid paying summonses--has long soured relations between
the city and the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say that, since 1997, the city is owed more than $21.3
million in summonses and penalties accumulated by the 2,300 consular
and diplomatic cars licensed by the State Department in the New York
area--more than $9,000 per vehicle on average.</TE>
<TE>   Topping the list are Egypt, with $1.9 million in fines; Kuwait,
with almost $1.3 million; and Nigeria, at $1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope that the city and the State Department will be able to
settle this issue diplomatically," said Elizabeth Oddiri, of the
Nigerian mission to the United Nations. She declined further comment.</TE>

<HD>Bodies of 8 Crash Victims Recovered</HD>
<DH>Puerto Rico: Two are yet to be found; there are no
survivors. The Air Force plane hit a mountain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAGUAS, Puerto Rico</DL>
<LD>Rescue crews struggled up a muddy mountainside Thursday to recover
the bodies of 10 military personnel killed when an Air Force special
operations plane slammed into a mountain.</LD>
<LD>   The victims were based in Florida and Puerto Rico, the military
said.</LD>
<LD>   Police in this U.S. Caribbean territory said they had recovered
eight bodies, some charred and dismembered, in addition to parts of
the plane's fuselage.</LD>
<TE>   The bulky MC-130H hit a heavily wooded area on the outskirts of
Caguas, 20 miles south of San Juan, while flying in rain and fog
Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second accident in as many months involving a Combat
Talon II, a special operations variant of the C-130 Hercules cargo
plane. The other crashed in June while taking off from an airstrip in
Afghanistan, killing three U.S. military personnel.</TE>
<TE>   People who saw Wednesday's crash told reporters the low-flying
plane smashed into Monte Perucho, broke in two and erupted in flames,
scattering body parts and pieces of plane.</TE>
<TE>   Local resident Eulalia Martinez, 75, said the impact made her
house tremble and flames lighted up the night sky.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was very bright, very bright, and with the force the
house shook," Martinez said on WAPA radio.</TE>
<TE>   Rescuers carrying stretchers and supplies climbed a narrow
mountain trail made treacherous by rain, fog, dense woods and soggy
underbrush. They rappelled down an 80-foot drop to recover one body.</TE>
<TE>   Three helicopters circled the crash site, but clouds forced them
to retreat at least once and land at a baseball park being used as an
operations center for the recovery work.</TE>
<TE>   "Military officials on the scene have confirmed there are no
survivors," said Steve Lucas, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern
Command in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   He said seven crew members aboard the aircraft were based at
Hurlburt Field, near Fort Walton Beach, Fla., and the three others
were from Puerto Rico. The names of the victims were being withheld
until relatives could be informed, Lucas said.</TE>
<TE>   The plane belonged to the Air Force Special Operations Command and
was on a training mission from Roosevelt Roads Naval Station at the
east end of Puerto Rico to the Borinquen Air Station on the west
coast of the island.</TE>
<TE>   The force of the impact ripped open the plane's fuselage, and
parts of the debris caught fire, said Rafael Guzman, executive
director of the State Emergency Management Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The plane that crashed in Afghanistan, which also was from
Hurlburt Field, is being investigated by two separate boards.
Officials said it was unlikely the $155-million, four-engine
turboprop craft was shot down.</TE>

<HD>Aquarium Officials Probe Fall of Platform at Shark Exhibit</HD>
<DH>Accident: Some of the 10 people who fell into the tank tell
of harrowing moments in the water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Officials at the Aquarium of the Americas on Thursday were
investigating what caused a catwalk to collapse and dump 10 visitors,
including four children, into a shark tank.</LD>
<LD>   It took 15 minutes Wednesday night to get them all out of the
water. No one was seriously hurt.</LD>
<LD>   One of the onlookers, 8-year-old Amanda Kruse, said most of the
sharks scattered, but she saw one cruising underneath the panicked
guests.</LD>
<TE>   "Its lips were peeled back and its teeth were showing," Amanda
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Gulf of Mexico exhibit includes about 24 nurse sharks and sand
tiger sharks, some of them 10 feet long. The aquarium Web site warns
visitors: "You'll be glad you're on the outside looking in."</TE>
<TE>   The catwalk is normally reserved for staff but was opened for a
behind-the-scenes tour for aquarium members. When it buckled, the
group was thrown into the 20-foot-deep, 400,000-gallon tank along
with a 38-foot section of the platform.</TE>
<TE>   "All of sudden I heard something go bam, and the long catwalk
split in half right in the middle and it dropped everybody straight
into the water," said Dan Rooney, whose two daughters, 2-year-old
granddaughter and 5-year-old nephew plunged in.</TE>
<TE>   Daughter Allison Rooney, 21, told CNN: "Ironically, the man was
telling us that if anybody ever fell into the water, that the sharks
are well fed and that they would scatter.... Well, not even two
seconds later, sure enough the whole thing just collapsed."</TE>
<TE>   The water level is about 3 feet below the slick edges of the
glass-walled tank, so there was no way for those inside to pull
themselves out without help. Many clung to the mock oil platform in
the center of the tank. Adults tried to hold small children above the
water, splashing around and scattering sandals, makeup kits and
brochures inside the tank.</TE>
<TE>   "The water is clear, so you could see the stingrays and sharks
swimming beneath them," Dan Rooney said. "I know the sharks are well
fed, but with all that splashing you wonder if their hunter instincts
are going to kick in."</TE>
<TE>   Like many of those who fell in, Erin Rooney, 14, was scraped by
the barnacle-encrusted support poles of the mock oil platform.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened so fast I didn't really think about the sharks at
first, I just wanted to get out of the water," said Erin, who is
Allison's sister. "I never wanted to go near the sharks, and the
worst part is I was scared to go on the catwalk and people were
making fun of me for not wanting to go on it."</TE>
<TE>   Allison Rooney was able to hand 2-year-old daughter Amber to a
rescuer after they fell in. But she had to swim to the other side of
the tank to get out--and her rescue took 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very scary," she told CNN. "When I first looked down, I
saw a stingray right underneath me and I just freaked out. I was
scared to death what I would do if I saw a shark."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the guests were in little if any danger.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have 'Jaws' in the aquarium or anything like that,"
said Ron Forman, president of the Audubon Institute, which runs the
aquarium.</TE>
<TE>   Aquarium spokeswoman Melissa Lee said the plastic-and-fiberglass
catwalk was supposed to hold up to 5,000 pounds, much more than the
total that was on it Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   The aquarium was opened for business Thursday, but the shark tank
was curtained off.</TE>

<LD>A 6-year-old girl who disappeared from a sleepover was found dead in
a wooded area behind row houses Thursday evening, police said.</LD>
<LD>   An 18-year-old suspect who was being questioned by police and the
FBI confessed to killing Destiny Wright and led investigators to her
body, police said. The man wasn't immediately charged, and police
didn't release his name.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no motive. Nobody could possibly have a motive for
killing a 6-year-old girl," Police Commissioner Sylvester Johnson
said.</LD>
<TE>   Police didn't release a cause of death.</TE>
<TE>   Destiny was last seen at the home of her father's girlfriend,
where she went to sleep with about five children early Wednesday
morning, police said. Her body was found about 1 1/2 miles from the
row house.</TE>

<HD>Texas Executes Carjacker Who Killed 75-Year-Old Man in '94</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HUNTSVILLE, Texas</DL>
<LD>An eighth-grade dropout who was a teenager when he was convicted of
killing a man during a carjacking was executed by injection Thursday
night.</LD>
<LD>   With the victim's relatives looking on, T.J. Jones apologized for
the 1994 slaying.</LD>
<LD>   "I would like to say to the victim's family I regret the pain I
put y'all through. I hope you can move on after this," said Jones,
25.</LD>
<TE>   Jones was 17 when he was arrested with three companions for
gunning down Willard Davis, 75, who had surrendered his car to them
outside his Longview home, about 190 miles north of Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very thankful he apologized," the victim's wife, Geraldine,
said after watching Jones die.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' age at the time of the shooting renewed criticism from
death penalty opponents. As a teenage offender, he "would not be
facing this punishment in almost any other country in the world,"
Amnesty International said.</TE>
<TE>   But Gregg County Dist. Atty. Bill Jennings said, "He did an adult
crime and he deserves to receive an adult penalty, which in this case
12 jurors decided should be death."</TE>

<HD>Hard Times Keep Getting Harder in Tobacco Patch</HD>
<DH>Business: Few N.C. auction houses remain, as the industry
reels from a public disdainful of its product.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WILSON, N.C.</DL>
<LD>The old tin warehouse on Goldsboro Street, as big as two football
fields, is heavy with the sweet aroma of tobacco. Farmers wait there,
tidying up their piles of golden, ripe leaves, stretched out in neat,
seemingly endless rows. It is not yet 9 a.m. and their shirts are
already sweat-soaked. They sip coffee and talk about quotas and
drought and changing times full of uncertainty.</LD>
<LD>   Glen Turnage wipes perspiration from his brow. He yanks several
dark, crisp leaves from a 200-pound pile, tossing them aside as the
buyers approach. "That'd make a harsh smoke," he said. "Nobody but
the Japanese would want it." But this--and he picks another leaf,
smelling it and touching it as though examining a piece of fine
silk--"this is top-grade. Ripe, mature, full of flavor. This is
America's best."</LD>
<TE>   For 113 years, farmers like Turnage have gathered every August for
the annual auction in a county once known as "the tobacco marketing
capital of the world." But Wilson County's 28 auction warehouses have
shrunk over the years to two, including the Liberty on Goldsboro,
North Carolina's tobacco production has been cut in half since 1998
and the crop that financed the Revolutionary War--and still provides
taxes that plug the budget shortfalls of many states--is viewed with
disdain by much of America. Smoking has declined overall as it has
become more expensive and its risks more widely publicized.</TE>
<TE>   Never, farmers say, has the future seemed so capricious or a life
of labor so unappreciated.</TE>
<TE>   "We were asleep at the wheel," said Pender Sharp, a
fourth-generation tobacco man who farms 200 acres outside Wilson, 45
miles east of Raleigh. "Tobacco had been so good to so many
generations, has pumped so many billions of dollars in taxes into the
economy, we thought surely no one would let this happen. We were
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   What happened was the growth of the anti-tobacco movement,
culminating in the Master Settlement Agreement in 1997 and '98. In an
effort to stop states from suing to recoup health-care costs for
smoking-related disease, the tobacco industry agreed to pay 46 states
$246 billion over 25 years. Growing quotas were reduced as a result,
hitting top producer North Carolina the hardest, and manufacturers
added 45 cents to a pack of cigarettes, 28 cents more than industry
watchers said was necessary to cover the costs of the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   State budgets were flush with cash in the booming 1990s, but now,
with the national economy flirting with a double-dip recession and
tax revenue plunging, 40 states and the District of Columbia are
facing budget shortfalls. Much to the consternation of the men
gathered at the Liberty Warehouse, many of these governments have
decided, as Graham Boyd, vice president of the North Carolina Tobacco
Growers Assn., put it, "to milk the cow without feeding it." They are
looking to tobacco to help bail them out.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, facing a $23.6-billion shortfall in California,
has proposed increasing tobacco taxes, a move at least 15 other
states recently have taken. In New York City, the cost of a pack of
cigarettes jumped to $7 when taxes per pack were increased from 8
cents to $1.50. Connecticut picked up an estimated $1 billion with
its 61-cent-per pack tax increase on tobacco, the only tax increase
many politicians dare support in a year when 36 governors are on the
November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Some states want to plug their budget gaps with windfall money
from the master settlement. Wisconsin is considering issuing bonds
secured by the settlement, which in effect would spend its entire
25-year share of the payout this year and next. North Carolina Gov.
Mike Easley, the son of a tobacco farmer, has diverted--farmers use
the word "stolen"--$50 million from a trust fund set up with
settlement money to help tobacco farmers and rural counties in an
effort to balance the state budget. Farmers have asked him to return
the funds and to abandon plans to take an additional $40 million.</TE>
<TE>   For the states, the $246-billion settlement bonanza was found
money that came with no strings attached. A report by the National
Conference of State Legislatures says that, from 2000 to 2002, states
budgeted only 5% of the initial $21-billion payout to anti-smoking
efforts. Only seven states spent the minimum amount recommended by
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for
health-related programs.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska used some of its settlement funds for harbor repairs.
Alabama spent $11 million to lure new industries and $600,000 on
smoking prevention. Tennessee spent most of its settlement to balance
the budget and Connecticut put $260 million into its general fund so
it could cut taxes. North Carolina allocated $42 million to modernize
the tobacco-curing process and build a tobacco-marketing center and
less than $1 million on health.</TE>
<TE>   On the outskirts of Wilson, Marion Pridgen stands amid the stalks
of ripening tobacco in his fields. Each of his plants will fetch him
60 to 70 cents--or about $1.80 a pound--and each, by the time it is
transformed into cigarettes, will generate $20 in taxes. No crop
comes close to producing the revenue and taxes that tobacco does, but
like his neighbors, Pridgen has already started diversifying into
soybeans, cotton and sweet potatoes--aware that the golden age of
tobacco is fast fading.</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen, once a landless tenant farmer, quit smoking three years
ago after finding himself constantly short of breath. Now, he says,
he feels good again. Like most farmers, he supports measures to
prevent teenagers from smoking but says for adults it is a matter of
choice.</TE>
<TE>   He believes he has led--and few would dispute it--an honorable,
hard-working life, producing a legal commodity that is used by 51
million Americans and typically contributes $34 billion a year to the
U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Five years down the road, I don't know if I'm going to be growing
tobacco or outlawed, so it's pretty hard to make a sensible business
decision," he said. "But as far as being mad at society or the world,
I'm not. Things change in life, and this is just one of them. You've
got to adjust, though I do know that anyone who thinks people aren't
going to smoke in the world is naive."</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina has the infrastructure to produce 1 billion pounds
of tobacco a year. Its yield this year will be about half that. Some
pundits say if the state hadn't lost the revenue from 500 million
pounds not grown, it wouldn't be facing a $2-billion shortfall, the
highest since the 1930s, and Easley wouldn't be in a position of
including $250 million from lottery revenue to balance the budget of
a state that has no lottery.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling is we'd have a shortfall even without" the master
settlement, said Blake Brown, an agro-economist at North Carolina
State University in Raleigh. "The budget problems involve more than a
decline in tobacco."</TE>
<TE>   But in a study he co-authored, Brown attributes 125 million to 147
million pounds of North Carolina's 274-million-pound decline in
annual purchases of flue-cured tobacco to the effect of the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   So, beset by declining quotas, health concerns over smoking, a
four-year drought, the effects of two devastating hurricanes in the
1990s and the same stagnant prices affecting most agricultural
commodities, the small, family-owned farms that dominated the North
Carolina tobacco industry are slowly disappearing. Their demise is
reflected in Wilson County's tobacco-auction sales: a record 102
million pounds in 1975, an estimated 12 million pounds this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Used to be the opening of the auction was the big event in the
county," said farmer Allan Barnes. "Every politician showed up to
make a speech. Even the governor. We'd walk out with a pocket of
cash. You'd settle up with the fertilizer dealer, pay your bills,
maybe buy your boy a bike. But that's the old days. This year there's
just not the buzz there used to be."</TE>

<HD>West Nile Virus Victims Younger This Year, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH>Health: The median age now is 55, down from the mid-60s.
There are 112 cases, at least five fatal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>For reasons that health officials cannot explain, this year's victims
of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus are younger than usual.</LD>
<LD>   The median age for this year's infections is 55, the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention here said in a report
Thursday. In previous years, the median was in the mid-60s.</LD>
<LD>   "The reason patients seem to be younger this year is unknown and
certainly something we're looking into," the CDC's Dr. Lyle Petersen
said.</LD>
<TE>   However, CDC officials said the declining median age is not a
cause for immediate concern.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC has reported 112 human cases this year, more than half in
the last week.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those cases were in Louisiana, which has reported 71
infections and five deaths in the nation's biggest outbreak since the
disease was first detected in New York in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   A central Mississippi man who died Thursday likely was killed by
the West Nile virus, state health officer Ed Thompson said. He said
more testing was needed to confirm preliminary results. The death
would be the first outside of Louisiana in this outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi has reported more than 30 human cases of the disease.
The CDC also reported human infections in Texas and Illinois. Cases
also were announced this week in Alabama and Washington, D.C., but
came too late to be included in the CDC report.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Illinois reported its second human case Thursday, a
57-year-old man who became critically ill with encephalitis.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas officials said Thursday that the virus has spread to their
state, where it was found in a dead horse. In Missouri, 13 horses
that died from encephalitis--a swelling of the brain--also have
tested positive for West Nile at the University of Missouri's
Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory in Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the CDC announced that an additional $10 million will
be sent to states to fight infected mosquitoes. The agency already
handed out $17 million a year, but as more states requested help, the
fund didn't cover requests. About $3.7 million will be earmarked for
Louisiana and Mississippi, the hardest hit states.</TE>
<TE>   Most people bitten by infected mosquitoes will suffer no more than
flu-like symptoms, but the weak and the elderly can get encephalitis,
a potentially fatal brain inflammation.</TE>
<TE>   Petersen said advanced age remains the biggest risk factor for
getting sick from the bite of an infected mosquito. Health officials
do not compile statistics on any health problems the younger West
Nile victims had, but suspect that many had conditions that weakened
their immune systems.</TE>
<TE>   Men made up 60% of this year's West Nile cases, consistent with
years past. Petersen said that is probably because men spend more
time outdoors.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Simon, an infectious-disease expert from George Washington
University in Washington, said doctors may be more aware of the
disease and likely to look for it in patients with less serious
symptoms, explaining the lower median age.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be because we're testing people more," he said. "It's the
only possible explanation from the information I've seen so far."</TE>
<TE>   Since its first appearance in the United States, the virus has
been detected in 35 states and the District of Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   State and local officials have boosted mosquito-spraying efforts
and urged people to protect themselves by using insect repellent and
wearing long sleeves.</TE>

<LD>Is it me, or has everyone on the women's beach volleyball tour been
each other's playing partner at some point?</LD>
<LD>   "It seems like it, doesn't it?" says Holly McPeak, America's
all-time leader on the women's money list. "It seems like we all end
up playing with each other."</LD>
<LD>   People grow apart, they stop winning, they look for the bigger,
better deal.</LD>
<TE>   But McPeak might want to make her partnership with Elaine Youngs a
permanent one. Since they hooked up this year they've been
unstoppable, winning the first four stops on the AVP tour.</TE>
<TE>   "We're both very competitive," Youngs says. "We like to win and
hate to lose. My strengths and her strengths make for a good team."</TE>
<TE>   When McPeak played with Lisa Arce in 1996 and 1997, they won 14
titles. They got back together last year after McPeak played the 2000
season with Misty May, and won a 15th title. They've won more money
together than any other U.S. pair. But a joint spot in the record
books didn't provide a strong enough bond.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year we struggled," McPeak says. "We did not have a good
time together."</TE>
<TE>   So McPeak began training for the 2002 season with Diane
DeNecochea. A month before the season, McPeak received a call from
Youngs, who said she'd like to play with her.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year on the international tour and the domestic tour, she
was the most dominant player on the net," McPeak says. "I thought she
was way ahead of Diane at that point."</TE>
<TE>   Bye-bye, DeNecochea.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't easy," McPeak said. "I really liked Diane. She had
worked really hard."</TE>
<TE>   As a consolation, DeNecochea wound up playing with Youngs'
ex-partner, Barbra Fontana, who ranks second behind McPeak on the
all-time earnings list.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't leaving her too high and dry," McPeak said.</TE>
<TE>   Youngs and Fontana won two U.S. events last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We did great, but we didn't win enough," Youngs says.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, only a victory at every stop will do.</TE>
<TE>   With three more AVP events, including this week's stop at
Manhattan Beach, McPeak and Youngs have a chance to run the table.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to think ahead," McPeak says. "People are gunning to
take us down every weekend. We're the team to beat. There's a lot of
pressure."</TE>
<TE>   McPeak and Youngs crossed paths at UCLA in 1990 when McPeak
transferred there from California for her senior year. But they
didn't play together because Youngs redshirted after knee surgery.
And Youngs wasn't around the beach scene until 1997 because she was
on the U.S. national indoor team through the 1996 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   She broke onto the tour with another former Bruin, Liz Masakayan,
and played with her until the 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   But with only one month to prepare, she's surprised how well
things have worked out. Practicing wasn't easy, because Youngs lives
in San Diego and McPeak in Manhattan Beach, which meant one of them
had to drive two hours each way.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't sure how quickly it would happen," Youngs says.
"Luckily, it happened very quickly. Holly's very easy to play with.
Most people would say I'm fairly easy to play with.</TE>
<TE>   "I think one thing that we have going for us is we've both played
for a few years now. She's on her 12th, this is my sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "She's got great ball control and can put the ball on the net for
me; I'm a very powerful player and can put them down. I have a strong
block, and she's one of the best defenders out there. For us, it's
our heart and our heads. We're smart players and we fight for
everything."</TE>
<TE>   They're even closer now after spending most of July overseas
playing in international competition. Their main competition on the
FIVB tour is the team of May and Kerri Walsh, which has won four
events to McPeak and Youngs' three.</TE>
<TE>   Now McPeak is coming home, in more ways than one. She grew up in
Manhattan Beach and first learned the game at a camp by the pier.</TE>
<TE>   She would play volleyball all day long, with older guys, younger
girls, even pros like Jackie Silva and Patty Dodd.</TE>
<TE>   Now she lives in a house on the Strand with husband Leonard
Armato, the AVP commissioner and Shaquille O'Neal's former agent.
It's only a short walk from where the competition will be held this
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so nice to be able to come home," McPeak says. "Even just
practicing today on the beach that I love, that I grew up on.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a really prestigious tournament in the world of beach
volleyball. It's important to all of us."</TE>
<TE>   For McPeak and Youngs it could be another step toward history, and
a clean sweep of all the events. That might even be enough to keep
them together for another year.</TE>

<HD>Lowe Outpitches Zito to Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Derek Lowe's 16 wins are the most in the AL, but this one was
special.</LD>
<LD>   Lowe beat Oakland ace Barry Zito, stopped Boston's two-game losing
streak with a 4-2 victory Thursday night at Boston and showed, in his
first full season as a starter, that he can win a big game.</LD>
<LD>   Lowe (16-5) struck out six and gave up five hits and one walk in
seven innings as the Red Sox moved a half-game behind the Angels in
the wild-card race.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the first game, in my little short starting career, that
I felt I had to win, and it is the first time I ever put that
pressure on myself," Lowe said.</TE>
<TE>   But catcher Jason Varitek didn't see much difference from Lowe's
other games this year.</TE>
<TE>   "He seemed pretty much the same to me. He seemed as focused as
he's been," Varitek said.</TE>
<TE>   The matchup of two of the AL's three pitchers with 15 wins met
expectations as Lowe threw a season-high 114 pitches and Zito (15-5)
gave up seven hits in his first complete game of the year. Boston's
Pedro Martinez is 15-2. Curt Schilling of Arizona leads the majors
with 18 victories.</TE>
<TE>   The A's did something that none of Lowe's three previous opponents
managed to do. They scored against the majors' leader in earned-run
average. Zito lowered his mark from 2.13 to 2.09.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 3, Toronto 1--Jamie Moyer took a shutout into the eighth
inning and Jeff Cirillo had three hits at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Martinez had a two-run single in the third and Cirillo hit a
run-scoring double in the sixth for the Mariners, who have won 15 of
their last 18 games at SkyDome.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle hasn't lost a series in Toronto since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   New York 6, Kansas City 3--Alfonso Soriano, Raul Mondesi and Robin
Ventura homered to account for all the Yankees' runs, and Mariano
Rivera returned from the disabled list to close out the victory at
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Activated before the game after recovering from a strained right
shoulder, Rivera pitched a perfect inning for his 25th save in 29
chances.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees boosted their home run total to 172, most in the
majors. The AL East leaders sent Kansas City to its 14th loss in 16
games.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 4, Minnesota 1--Chris Richard and Jeff Conine drove in
two runs each to back Travis Driskill as the Orioles swept a
three-game series at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth in a row loss for Minnesota, matching its
longest skid of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 2, Texas 1--Jose Lima gave up one run in 5 1/3 innings and
the Tigers scored twice in the fourth inning at Detroit. Texas loaded
the bases with two out in the ninth, but Juan Acevedo retired Alex
Rodriguez on a groundout to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, Cleveland 2--Paul Wilson won his third start in a row
and Tampa Bay scored all its runs with two out.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson has yielded only four earned runs in his last 22 innings
and has an ERA of 2.58 since the All-Star break.</TE>

<HD>Angels Get Floored by Parque</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Former UCLA star, coming back from shoulder
surgery, gets first win in majors in two years for White Sox, 3-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>In the home clubhouse, celebration. For a team playing with next year
in mind, a toast to Jim Parque, who won his first major league game
in two years.</LD>
<LD>   In the visiting clubhouse, contemplation. For a team in a pennant
race this year, there is no room for sentiment and no consolation in
losing to a pitcher completing a comeback from shoulder surgery, a
pitcher still in search of his old fastball.</LD>
<LD>   "I think everybody feels like this is a pitcher we probably should
have gotten," Tim Salmon said.</LD>
<TE>   Parque got the best of the Angels on Thursday, holding them to two
runs over 5 1/3 innings in the Chicago White Sox's 3-2 victory. The
Angels fell 3 1/2 games behind the Seattle Mariners in the American
League West, and their wild-card lead over the Boston Red Sox shrunk
to a half-game.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Thomas hit a two-run home run and Carlos Lee a solo shot for
the White Sox, and four relievers got the final 11 outs in support of
Parque, a former UCLA star.</TE>
<TE>   In a season in which the Angels have climbed toward the top of the
standings by punishing the teams beneath them, they were disappointed
in losing two of three games to the White Sox and in losing to
Parque.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating," Salmon said. "When you look at the teams we're
playing and the pitching we're facing, this is one of the guys we
felt we had to beat. But it didn't happen, and you tip your hat to
him."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing against Parque, mind you. The Angels simply saw a guy
making his first major league start of the season, a guy who spent
most of the year in the minors, a guy without the stuff to dominate
them.</TE>
<TE>   And he didn't, really. In the first inning, three of the first
five batters singled, and the Angels scored one run. In the second,
Benji Gil hit a home run, and the Angels led, 2-0. In the fourth, the
Angels loaded the bases with two out, but right fielder Magglio
Ordonez made a sliding catch, robbing David Eckstein of a hit and
ending the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Manager Jerry Manuel allowed Parque to pitch long enough
to become eligible for the victory, then turned the game over to the
bullpen. On a night the Angels used four pinch-hitters, Manuel
exploited matchups in a way Angel Manager Mike Scioscia cannot.
That's not Scioscia's fault; the White Sox have three left-handed
relievers and the Angels have only one, though they remain in search
of another.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Sele took the loss, though the Angels were more than
satisfied with his performance. Sele, heating up along with the
pennant race, held the White Sox to three runs over seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Sele, billed as a consumer of innings when the Angels signed him
to a $24-million contract last December, failed to pitch seven
innings in any of his first seven starts. But he has pitched at least
seven innings in six of his last eight starts; his earned-run average
is 3.04 in that span and a season-low 4.57 overall.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds stupid, but it's what I've been telling you guys all
year--making quality pitches," Sele said. "Early in the year, if I
needed to get an out, I couldn't always make that quality pitch to
keep the game close. Instead of giving up three runs, it would be
five. Now I'm making far more quality pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Parque and Angel third baseman Troy Glaus were teammates at UCLA
and first-round picks in 1997, and each ascended to the majors in
1998. Parque became a fixture in the Chicago rotation, and by 2000 he
won 13 games and started the first game of the playoffs against
Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   But he underwent shoulder surgery in 2001, spending most of last
year in rehabilitation and most of this year at triple A. Parque's
fastball, which Glaus said was clocked between 89-92 mph at UCLA, now
registers from 86-89 mph. But Glaus said he saw a smarter pitcher
Thursday, with more confidence in his off-speed pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Was he happy for his old teammate?</TE>
<TE>   "Well," Glaus said, "I'd rather beat him."</TE>

<HD>It's a Tough Time for Disney to Sell Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>With Disney stock falling to an eight-year low and Chairman Michael
Eisner under renewed pressure to cut costs and boost profits, the
time would appear to be ideal to sell the Angels and Mighty Ducks.</LD>
<LD>   But, with the economy sluggish and the labor situations in both
baseball and hockey uncertain, Disney apparently faces the
unappealing choice of selling now at clearance-sale prices or holding
onto the money-losing teams.</LD>
<LD>   As the stock market has plummeted, so has the pool of interested
buyers. And, with baseball facing a potential player strike this
summer and an NHL lockout or strike increasingly likely in 2004, a
would-be buyer could face a significant loss of revenue almost
immediately upon assuming ownership.</LD>
<TE>   With Disney under similar financial pressures in 1999, the company
sold its Fairchild Publications unit for a reported $650 million and
negotiated to sell the Angels and Ducks for $450 million. But the
Angels' revenue of $100 million last year is almost insignificant
compared to Disney's overall revenue of $25 billion, and so selling
either or both teams would resolve a corporate headache but do little
to boost the stock price.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends how much pressure management feels to move some assets
off the books," said John Moag, whose Baltimore investment banking
firm specializes in sports finance. "Now may not be a good time to be
selling, even though they may want the assets off the books. The wise
thing to do may be to wait and see how the labor situation plays out
and if the market improves."</TE>
<TE>   Bob DuPuy, baseball's president and chief operating officer,
suggested recently that Disney had dropped its asking price on the
Angels by more than $100 million. Disney valued the Angels at $300
million during negotiations in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama businessman Donald Watkins, who has discussed the purchase
of the Angels for six months, is believed to have told Disney
officials he believes the franchise is worth no more than $200
million, with a labor agreement in place. In the absence of such an
agreement, he is believed to have offered about $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Major league teams place virtually every player on waivers this
month, and any player not claimed can then be traded. For example,
Detroit closer Juan Acevedo is believed to have cleared waivers, and
the Angels expressed interest in him last month. But the Tigers are
believed to have asked for dominant triple-A reliever Francisco
Rodriguez in return, and the Angels said no then and would do so
again today.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels wouldn't mind adding another left-hander to their
bullpen. They had some interest in Scott Eyre, claimed Thursday by
the San Francisco Giants. They have discussed a minor league contract
with Mike Magnante, released last week by the Oakland Athletics.</TE>

<HD>Williams Estate Withdraws Request for Hearing</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ted Williams' estate withdrew its request for a court to help resolve
the dispute over his body, a victory for two children of the baseball
great who want to keep it frozen.</LD>
<LD>   The estate's executor, Al Cassidy, said in court papers filed
Thursday at Orlando, Fla., that he's convinced the Hall of Famer
wanted to be cryonically frozen and that a judge's guidance was no
longer necessary.</LD>
<LD>   Williams' youngest children, John Henry and Claudia Williams, say
they and their father signed a handwritten pact in November 2000
agreeing their bodies would be frozen.</LD>
<TE>   Williams' eldest daughter, Bobby-Jo Williams Ferrell, believes her
father wanted to be cremated and have his ashes scattered off the
Florida coast, as he requested in his will.</TE>
<TE>   "This puts an end to the proceeding that was pending," said Robert
Goldman, the attorney for John Henry and Claudia Williams.</TE>
<TE>   But Ferrell's lawyer, Richard Fitzpatrick, said she "will not let
it end this way."</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many unanswered questions," said Fitzpatrick, who
questions the authenticity of the handwritten pact.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle Mariners acquired infielder Jose Offerman from the
Boston Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Offerman, 33, was designated for assignment by the Red Sox last
week, and refused to report to triple-A Pawtucket, his right as a
veteran player.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta Braves put left-handed reliever Mike Remlinger on the
15-day disabled list because of a strained left groin and recalled
left-hander John Foster from triple-A Richmond.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco Giants claimed left-handed reliever Scott Eyre
off waivers from Toronto.</TE>

<LD>As a rookie with the Philadelphia Eagles, wide receiver Freddie
Mitchell gained a reputation for being a selfish player because of
his flashy style. The former UCLA standout said he'll tone down the
Hollywood persona he thinks might have given teammates the wrong
impression about him last season.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of guys really didn't like that routine," Mitchell told the
Philadelphia Daily News. "I had to really slow it down, adapt to my
situation here. What I had to do was show it by actions and not
talk."</LD>
<LD>   A change like that takes a while, which explains why Mitchell's
Eagle teammates remain skeptical. "Freddie's Freddie," wide receiver
Todd Pinkston said. "He's a guy that likes to get a lot of
attention."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NHL record for penalty minutes in a
game?</TE>
<TE>   Little demands: From Phil Taylor of CNNSI.com: "It's time for the
players to go on strike. We all know how damaging it could be to the
game, especially coming so close to the World Series, but a strike is
the only way for the players to get what they want, what they need,
what they deserve. When it comes to baseball, I'm on their side all
the way, because, let's face it, the players are the game. Not major
league players. Who cares about them? I'm talking about Little
Leaguers [who] have leverage right now.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen carefully, kids: Walk out. Take a hike. Tell your parents
and coaches that until they give in to your demands, you'll be
spending your free time skateboarding without a helmet, zoning out on
your PlayStation 2 and sitting really close to the TV so you strain
your eyes. [Parents hate that.]"</TE>
<TE>   Imagine if Bill Gates pitched: Before the start of the season,
Arizona pitcher Curt Schilling invested $25,000 in customized
software for his computer. The database contains thousands of pitches
he has thrown since 1996, with a file on 490 players listing their
tendencies. And it lists tendencies of umpires.</TE>
<TE>   "It is as important as everything else I do to get better,"
Schilling told the Cincinnati Post. "It allows me to go out every
fifth day with a plan. It was one of the huge reasons for the success
I had last year. You can see patterns in hitters and you try to find
a way to exploit a weakness. I would not be the pitcher I am without
it."</TE>
<TE>   Do you remember? On this day in 1988, the Kings acquired Wayne
Gretzky in a trade with Edmonton. Gretzky, Mike Krushelniski and
Marty McSorley were exchanged for Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas,
first-round picks in the 1989, '91 and '93 drafts and about $15
million cash.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Former King Randy Holt picked up a record 67
penalty minutes against Philadelphia on March 11, 1979. Holt had one
minor, three majors, two 10-minute misconducts and three game
misconducts.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Boston was picked as the top sports city in North
America by the Sporting News, which cited the New England Patriots'
Super Bowl victory and strong seasons by the city's other major
teams.</TE>
<TE>   Second in the annual survey was the Oakland-San Francisco-San Jose
area, followed by New York-New Jersey-Long Island, Detroit,
Philadelphia and Los Angeles-Anaheim. Completing the top 10 are
Baltimore-Washington, Dallas-Fort Worth, Phoenix and Miami-Fort
Lauderdale.</TE>

<LD>What I'll miss most is laughing. Has there ever been a better man to
ride across town with than Chick Hearn?</LD>
<LD>   When the 405 was a parking lot, when it took four cycles to
finally get the arrow to let you turn left, when 10 minutes of light
rain turned the basin into a full SigAlert, you still had Chick. When
your 30-minute trip home became an hour and 30, and the landscape was
a sea of brake lights, you still had Chick, the commuter's best pal.
He was your free pass into the diamond lane.</LD>
<LD>   I never listened to Chick for more than five minutes without
laughing. I don't mean a chuckle or a giggle, I mean that all-out
tears-in-your-eyes, straight out-of-your stomach air burst. He was
the full guffaw. And he'd make you laugh only after he exhibited
every skill that made him a phenomenal broadcaster--his unmatched
descriptions, his unparalleled knowledge of game strategy and the
sport's history, his ability to match his cadence with the flow of
the action, his understanding of the art of one-way communication.</LD>
<TE>   What a heart he had! His joy was your joy. When you'd run into
Chick, it was never about Chick. The conversation was lively,
spirited, sharp, poignant and often compelling--much like his
broadcasts. Oh, he could be curmudgeonly, but you knew that never
went beyond his exterior. He'd love to make you smile, make you feel
good, make you feel more alive.</TE>
<TE>   How he did that--in fact, how he did anything--was a constant
source of amazement to me and many who knew him. How did he go on
after absorbing the worst body blows that ever could be delivered?
Every parent's definition of "horrific" is to outlive your child, so
what word could describe outliving two children, your only two?
Somehow, for the last 30 years, that constantly aching heart let that
marvelous brain function so brilliantly. How, we'll never know.</TE>
<TE>   No one in the history of his profession ever crossed the line
between radio and television so seamlessly. A broadcaster in that
environment runs the risk of overtalking to his television audience
and undertalking to those just listening. No one understood how to
straddle that line better than Chick. But then again, if you were a
Laker fan, no matter the method of delivery, you would only accept
your news from one messenger. And, if the score came in by Pony
Express, Chick had to be riding the horse.</TE>
<TE>   He was an artist. He took a blank canvas at tipoff and by the
final horn had turned it into his beautiful and vivid and vibrant
aural mosaic. The grandest compliment a sportscaster can receive
after a dramatic contest is for someone to say, "He was as good as
the game." Well, Chick was always as good as the game, and on many
nights, far better. Frankly, if the Lakers were playing the Cavaliers
in November, you didn't even need a game, as long as you had Chickie
Baby.</TE>
<TE>   For 42 years, the Lakers have provided us with the sweetest music.
From Elgin and Jerry to Wilt and Kareem, from Magic to Kobe and Shaq,
these wonderful melodies have stirred the passions of millions of
Southern Californians. Oh sure, we could have appreciated it all as
one long instrumental. But think what we'd have missed. For my money,
the most incredible and indelible lyrics the sportscasting profession
has ever produced.</TE>

<LD>St. Peter swings the pearly gates open left to right across your
radio dial. Francis Dayle Hearn strides toward the entrance of this
infinite-by-infinite hunk of paradise. He asks, "Did I make the team,
big fella?"</LD>
<LD>   "Are you kidding, my good man?" the saint replies. "You could call
it with Braille."</LD>
<LD>   John Thompson, Chino</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More than 20 years ago, my father and I agreed that to be a sports
fan in Los Angeles was to be a fortunate person. What other city
could boast of men of the quality of Jim Murray, Chick Hearn and Vin
Scully?</TE>
<TE>   My old man is gone now, and so are Murray and Chick. I will
continue to treasure every chance I have to hear Vinnie. With him
still calling games, I am still a kid.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Davis, San Pedro</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forget the championship, if there's no banner raised for Chick
Hearn come opening night at Staples this fall, then something
definitely isn't kosher in Lakerdom.</TE>
<TE>   Chris R. Johnson, Hawthorne</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You tend to notice the best ones in absentia, and here in sporting
America in the new century, the best ones we notice, often as not,
never even suit up and play the game. What they do, these guys, at
their very best, is make us want to watch it, to listen to it just a
little bit longer.</TE>
<TE>   Missing someone like Chick Hearn, whatever else gets factored into
it, is fundamentally about liking the way he does his work. Oh,
people long ago understood Chick was special, but after a while, he
was renowned more for consistently showing up to work than for his
actual game calls, and that's a real pity. The man could announce a
game.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Goldenfeld, Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was born in Southern California and have lived here all my life,
and although I was too young to understand what "The day the music
died" meant, I was not too young to go to bed and hide under the
covers with my trusty transistor radio listening to Chick or Vin
Scully calling the play-by-play to my young life.</TE>
<TE>   I felt I knew Rudy LaRusso, Mel Counts, Jerry, Elgin and all the
rest personally through Chick's magical accounts. I often fell asleep
while the shot was forever circling the hoop in a roll-a-drome. And
although I am deeply saddened by his passing I count my blessings
that I was able to grow up in a time that it was the man who made the
game, not his shoes or endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Bonning, Oxnard</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chick always used to humbly request, that for the games that were
carried on television by another broadcaster, to tune in to the radio
show for his play by play. He never needed to ask; for me, this was
always a foregone conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   David Jerrard Givens, Santa Monica</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the past, comparisons were frequently made between Vin Scully
and Chick Hearn, owing to their shared longevity, excellence and
commitment.</TE>
<TE>   Vin is a gracious, meticulous, lyrical, thoroughly enjoyable and
devoted professional, who is unfortunately married to a sport with an
apparent death wish.</TE>
<TE>   But Chick Hearn had the good fortune to be immersed in an
incredibly exciting sport, and was simply the best, most accurate,
most effective, most evocative and most exciting play-by-play
announcer in any sport that I personally have encountered in my
nearly 60 years on the planet.</TE>
<TE>   By all appearances, Chick was also a vibrant and caring human
being whose energy and optimism infused those he encountered with
what is sometimes trivially referred to as "the indomitable human
spirit." There was nothing trivial about Chick. Southern California
was a better place for having him around all these decades.</TE>
<TE>   If you can't bear to see a grown man cry, avoid my house for a
while. God bless you, Chick, and thank you.</TE>
<TE>   Cay Sehnert, South Pasadena</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chick Hearn was more than the voice of the Lakers. He was their
heart, their soul.</TE>
<TE>   Having worked with Chick on the Laker pregame program for KHJ and
KCAL-TV in the '80s and '90s, I saw day to day what immeasurable,
almost superhuman passion he had for the job.</TE>
<TE>   In the late '80s it was one of my career gifts to host the Laker
pregame show and produce a one-hour tribute to Chick when he had
broadcast his then-astonishing 2,000th consecutive Laker game.</TE>
<TE>   What moved me most was the love he had for the Laker family while
he carried personal pain in his own family. Last year when he
underwent critical heart surgery, and then recovered from a broken
hip, I believe the thing that kept Chick Hearn alive was his joy at
the microphone.</TE>
<TE>   No one, not Jerry West, Wilt, Elgin, Magic, Shaq or Kobe, no one
meant more to this franchise than Francis Hearn. The microphone will
be passed to someone else. Surely that person will be competent. But
the character and the conscience of this team will have been changed
forever. We all loved you, Chick. I don't say it often, but you were
better than the game itself.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Firestone, ESPN</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I moved to Oregon 16 years ago. When people ask me if I miss
Southern California I always say there are only two things that I
miss. It's not the beaches, mountains, Disneyland, or even the
weather. Although all of those things are nice.</TE>
<TE>   What I really miss are Chick Hearn and Vin Scully. Listening to
Chick call a game, you just knew he enjoyed it as a fan. He called it
as he saw it and not as a "homer." Los Angeles, you have lost what I
consider to be one of your real major attractions.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Olguin, Eugene, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When I departed Los Angeles four years ago, there were few things
I missed more than listening to Chick Hearn. I am sometimes blessed
with the pleasant weather, I occasionally see the Lakers on TV, I can
even duplicate a decent burrito, but there was always one thing
missing in my life come basketball season--hearing Chick Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   Lendoan Wright, Charleston, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chick Hearn was without peer as a basketball announcer and gave us
many brilliant descriptions of memorable games. But my favorite
memory of Chick was not of a game, but of a pregame.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime in the 1980s, when he was working with Keith Erickson,
the Lakers were playing a road game. The poor woman singing the
national anthem was just awful. After she finished there was a long,
awkward pause. Then Chick, ever the truthful reporter, finally said,
"My, she hit some notes in there." After another long awkward pause
Erickson added, "She sure did, Chick."</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to accept after all these years that the door is
closed and the light is out.</TE>
<TE>   Paul R. Graves, Lake Orion, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen years ago I was a bartender at a Marina del Rey
restaurant, attending broadcasting school. One Tuesday afternoon
Chick and his wife Marge came into an empty bar and chose to sit
right in front of me. As a fan and aspiring sports broadcaster I was
in heaven.</TE>
<TE>   Chick gave me a good 45 minutes of his time in conversation, and
ultimately offered me only one piece of advice--be yourself.</TE>
<TE>   That advice has stuck with me over the course of my life. I later
received a phone call at home from Chick giving me a telephone number
of a man who gave me an opportunity to announce the NBA Summer Pro
League at Loyola Marymount. A few days after the call I received a
pair of tickets to see the Lakers play Portland.</TE>
<TE>   What a wonderful man Chick Hearn was. He touched my life in a very
special way, and, of course, taught me everything I know about the
game of basketball. He did it all by simply being himself.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Powell, Fallbrook</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When I was on the college paper at Loyola Marymount in the late
'70s I had to take the stats and roster to Chick before a UNLV/LMU
game at Vegas. Chick was announcing the games on Channel 9. I
approached him along with a girlfriend of one of the LMU players who
was also a big Chick fan. The stats were on hard-to-read mimeographed
paper. When I gave them to him he yelled at me: "What the *&amp;%$ is
this? You people want to go big time and you give me this @#$%? I
can't read this @#$%!"</TE>
<TE>   The girl and I cringed. We sat by Chick and printed over the names
and stats by hand. When we were finished he softened a bit, signed an
autograph without looking up, and mumbled, "Thanks."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Amodei, South Bend, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In 1978 I was seated next to Chick on a flight from LAX to Denver.
He asked why I was going there. I told him that my son was graduating
that day from the University of Colorado and I had flown from an
Asian city, where I had been on business, to be present at the
graduation. However, because of plane delays it was apparent that I
would miss the graduation ceremony, but I might arrive in time for
the party to follow. Chick commiserated with me.</TE>
<TE>   When I deplaned, an attendant gave me a package, saying it was
compliments of Mr. Hearn. It contained a bottle of champagne with a
note that it was for the graduation party! I have never forgotten
this thoughtful act from a man who had never met me before and
probably never expected to see me again. From what I read, this was a
typical Chick Hearn gesture.</TE>
<TE>   Harold Lian, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The last Laker game I attended was in the playoffs this year when
Robert Horry made the incredible game-winning shot. But the highlight
for me was something else.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game my friend and I were in the customer service
office at Staples. My friend is handicapped and we were exchanging
our tickets for wheelchair accessible seats. I glanced over and Chick
Hearn was sitting on a sofa. We approached Chick and I told him I'd
been listening to him for 35 years (I'm 41). Chick asked us our names
and said it was a pleasure to meet us.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 minutes later Chick got up to start the game. He looked
extremely frail struggling with his walker. But that didn't stop him
from going out of his way to tell my friend and I to enjoy the game.
Incredibly, he addressed us by our names. What a class act.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Steinberg, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you, Marge, for letting us borrow your best friend. He
became ours as well. Many of us learned to play basketball from our
fathers. But we learned to have the passion for this great sport from
one man. He wasn't a famous athlete. He just called an honest,
straightforward game.</TE>
<TE>   Chick Hearn would scold the Lakers and praise the Lakers. I met
him one time, like many others. Little did I know just how special a
friend I had made that day. So now when I order a hot dog, mustard
will be too hard to swallow. Opening the fridge and seeing the Jell-O
jigglin' will have a different effect on me.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Torney, Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Every time I listened to Chick Hearn, he taught me something new
about the nuances of the game of basketball. After thousands of
broadcasts, that's saying something.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Murphy, Whittier</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chick was basketball in this town. More than the stream of great
players and coaches we've had: Chamberlain, West, Kareem, Nixon,
McAdoo, Magic, Worthy, Scott, Coop, A.C., Clark Kent, Vlade, Shaq,
Kobe, Fox, etc. They are/were great players, and they stay in the
Laker family, but Chick was the Voice.</TE>
<TE>   He was the best thing for cable TV too. Who could think of
dropping it and lose Chick and the Lakers?</TE>
<TE>   Tony Esporma, Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A little-known fact: Early in their tenure in Los Angeles, the
Lakers were playing a preseason game in a high school gym (basketball
wasn't the major league event it later became), and a player was,
indeed, faked into the popcorn machine that was situated next to the
exit. I think it might have been the only time Chick wasn't ready
with a colorful description.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Robinson, Ridgecrest</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After moving to L.A. from Detroit in the late 1990s, one thing
I've learned is that you can be a Chick fan without being a Laker
fan.</TE>
<TE>   Alan R. Hopkins, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was thinking how deeply moved Chick would have been by all the
accolades of the last few days. Had he retired a year or two ago, the
accolades would have been much the same, and he would have been
around to enjoy them. I was thinking how sad that was, until I
realized that Chick would not have traded a chance to call the
Lakers' recent championship--or possibly, any Laker game--for all the
accolades in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Rip Rense, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak mentioned the way three
generations of families listened to, and loved, Chick Hearn. In my
family, it's actually four generations: My 93-year-old grandfather
(who has been known to turn down a dinner invitation if it conflicts
with a Laker game), my father, myself, and my two sons, 8 and 11.</TE>
<TE>   If I'm ever lucky enough to have a grandchild, and we're watching
or listening to a game together, I can already imagine myself saying
of the announcer, "Yeah, this guy's fine. It's just too bad you never
got to hear the best ever, Chick Hearn."</TE>

<HD>Beltre Still Rising</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He gets three hits, including homer, as L.A.
defeats Pirates, 10-5, to regain wild-card lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Adrian Beltre were to continue this torrid offensive pace for the
rest of the season and somehow lead the Dodgers into the playoffs,
utility player Tyler Houston could be the team's most valuable
player.</LD>
<LD>   Though Beltre has downplayed the connection, it's impossible to
ignore the fact that his hot streak coincided with the Dodgers' July
24 trade for Houston, the former Milwaukee Brewer third baseman who
posed the first threat to Beltre's job in his five seasons with the
Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   Beltre responded to the deal with four hits and four runs batted
in against San Francisco on July 26, and he hasn't stopped hitting
since, extending his streak with three hits, including a key two-run
homer, and three runs to lead a 10-5 victory over the Pittsburgh
Pirates before 31,776 in Dodger Stadium on Thursday night.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers' second consecutive victory moved them back into the
National League wild-card lead, a half-game ahead of San Francisco,
and pulled them to within six games of Arizona in the West, the first
time the Dodgers gained ground on the Diamondbacks since July 14.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre's homer in the fifth gave the Dodgers a 5-4 lead, and his
leadoff infield single in the seventh sparked a two-run rally that
pushed a 6-5 advantage to 8-5.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Dodgers traded for Houston, a move they hoped would
light a fire under Beltre as well as bolster their bench, Beltre is
batting .434 (23 for 53) with five homers, two triples, three doubles
and 17 RBIs in 13 games, lifting his average from .236 on July 24 to
.261.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen this guy do things similar to this in 2000, and what I
witnessed in the second half that year was that once he gets going,
it's difficult to shut him down," Manager Jim Tracy said. "He's
driving the ball to left field and to right field.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the guy we've talked about, the player we know he's
capable of being, a foundation type of player. We've been trying all
season to get him to realize that. He's a very focused player right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Houston was the motivation Beltre needed. Beltre has
frustrated the Dodgers with his lack of discipline at the plate and
occasional lackadaisical play in the field, but since Houston
arrived, Beltre has had no problems.</TE>
<TE>   "He should cough up some of his contract to me," Houston joked,
when asked if he thought he'd have this kind of effect on Beltre.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers figured it was only a matter of time before Beltre
found his stride.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to be an offensive force for a long time," said right
fielder Shawn Green, whose two-run homer in the eighth, his 32nd of
the season, provided some insurance. "It's just a matter of him
understanding what his strengths and weaknesses are. When he's
swinging the bat well, he's the type of guy who can carry a team."</TE>
<TE>   It seems the only thing that can stop Beltre now is an injury, and
the Dodgers got a scare when Beltre, who moved from the fifth to the
third spot in the order Thursday night, pulled up after his
seventh-inning single because of tight hamstrings.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre remained in the game, scoring on Brian Jordan's RBI single,
but he was replaced at third by Dave Hansen to start the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than push the envelope with a guy who's been one of the
hottest hitters in the National League, we took him out," Tracy said.
"We did not want to take a chance of him pulling a hamstring. He
should be ready to go [tonight]."</TE>
<TE>   So should struggling catcher Paul Lo Duca, who was given Thursday
night off, but his replacement, seldom-used catcher Chad Kreuter,
provided some offense, with a double, two singles and a run. Kreuter
doubled in the sixth and broke a 5-5 tie when he scored on Cesar
Izturis' bloop RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   A well-rested Dodger bullpen rescued struggling starter Kazuhisa
Ishii, as Paul Shuey escaped a runner-on-third, one-out jam in the
seventh to preserve a one-run lead, Paul Quantrill threw a scoreless
eighth, and Jesse Orosco a scoreless ninth. Kevin Beirne gave up a
tying home run to Craig Wilson in the fifth, but he picked up the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers built a 3-0 lead in the first without the benefit of a
hit, taking advantage of two Pittsburgh errors, two walks and
sacrifice flies by Jordan and Eric Karros.</TE>

<HD>Slumping Lo Duca Not Blaming Fatigue</HD>

<LD>The natural inclination when a catcher goes into a slump in August is
to blame fatigue, the four months of wear and tear that comes with
the most physically demanding position in baseball.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca, who did not start Thursday night
after going two for 27 in the last seven games, a skid that dropped
his average from .306 to .291, will not use that as an excuse.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel great physically--I'm actually healthier than I've been
all year," Lo Duca said. "I was more banged up earlier in the season
than I am now."</LD>
<TE>   But the scars of a grueling season aren't all physical. The two
balls Lo Duca blistered up the middle Wednesday, only to have them
ricochet off the pitcher and to the second baseman for a double-play
grounder and a groundout, left a mark. So does the frustration of
driving in only nine runs in 24 games since the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important we get him a day [off]," Manager Jim Tracy
said. "He's been hitting in some awfully tough luck. He's caught
Kazuhisa Ishii all season, and he's taken a good beating with all the
balls in the dirt. With all the things going on, I thought this was a
good day to give him a breather."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, who has started 94 of the Dodgers' 115 games behind the
plate, did not object, even though the Dodgers were facing a
left-hander in Pittsburgh starter Jimmy Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not getting the job done, so maybe I do need a day off," Lo
Duca said. "That's the bottom line. I'm not pressing. Things just
aren't going well for me right now. I'm not swinging the bat like I'm
capable of, and when I hit the ball hard, they're not falling in."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown will make his second--and likely final--minor league
rehabilitation start when he pitches for triple-A Las Vegas tonight
in Edmonton.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who underwent surgery for a herniated disk in his lower
back on June 11 and on his elbow last September, will throw 80 to 90
pitches, and if all goes well, he will likely be activated to pitch
next week in Montreal or New York.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm not going to be prophetic," Brown said. "These days, I'm
not going to make any predictions. I can pitch [now]. The question
is, how effective will I be? They have to feel I'll be effective."</TE>
<TE>   That won't be measured by how many hits or runs or walks or
strikeouts Brown records tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "I want him to be healthy, to be sound," Tracy said. "I'm not
interested in how many strikeouts he has. I want him back in one
piece. I want the Kevin Brown I used to manage, the guy I saw when I
was a coach in Montreal. It's been hard not seeing him in one piece."</TE>
<TE>   When Brown returns, either Omar Daal or Ishii will go to the
bullpen, "but I'm not going to speculate on that right now," Tracy
said. "We will have a decision to make."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby threw 7 1/3 scoreless innings in Wednesday night's 4-0
win over Pittsburgh but was still chuckling Thursday over one pitch,
a fifth-inning changeup to Jack Wilson that sailed to the screen--the
upper half of it. "I thought it was going to hit my wife in the
family section," Ashby said. "I guess that's what you call being
effectively wild."</TE>
<TE>   ON DECK</TE>

<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150), KWKW (1330).</TE>

<TE>   vs.</TE>
<TE>   PHILLIES'</TE>
<TE>   BRETT MYERS</TE>
<TE>   (1-2, 4.50 ERA)</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Phillies have won 10 of their last 17 games. Daal is
the most likely candidate to be sent to the bullpen when Brown is
activated, but if he keeps pitching like he has in his last three
starts, in which the left-hander has given up six earned runs in 19
1/3 innings, he will make that decision very difficult for Tracy.
Myers is a 22-year-old right-hander who will be making his fourth
major league start.</TE>

<HD>Woods Off to Good Start, Trails by Two</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods, in his first tournament since his Grand Slam chances
ended at the British Open, shot a five-under 67 Thursday and was two
strokes behind first-round leader Kent Jones at the Buick Open at
Grand Blanc, Mich. Mark Brooks and K.J. Choi shot 66s.</LD>
<LD>   Mark O'Meara, playing in the same group as Woods, shot a 68 to
join 13 players, including defending PGA Championship winner David
Toms, at four under.</LD>
<LD>   The last time Woods and O'Meara were in the same group at a
tournament was the third round of last month's British Open.</LD>
<TE>   On that unforgettable Saturday, Woods shot an 81--his worst score
as a professional--and saw his chances of making history end after
becoming the first player since Jack Nicklaus in 1972 to win the
Masters and U.S. Open, the first two legs of the Grand Slam.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time we played together wasn't exactly a great day,"
Woods said with a grin.</TE>
<TE>   Enough time has passed for O'Meara to also be able to joke about
it.</TE>
<TE>   "I beat him," said O'Meara, who shot a 77 that day at the British
Open.</TE>
<TE>   Woods was in a group of nine tied at 67, including Hal Sutton.
Woods started well and finished strong with two birdies in his last
three holes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Candie Kung celebrated her 21st birthday with a seven-under
65 to lead the Women's British Open after the first round at
Turnberry, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   Kung is a stroke ahead of two-time champion Karrie Webb, with
defending champion Se Ri Pak and leading American Tina Barrett among
four players two strokes behind.</TE>
<TE>   With top-10 finishes in her last two tournaments, Kung came into
the tournament on form. The fickle Scottish weather behaved itself,
allowing Kung to race around the tricky links with birdies on the
first two holes.</TE>
<TE>   Kung, who is from Taiwan, said she took up golf seven years ago
after her parents moved to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "We moved to the States in '95 and I had nothing to do at that
time, and that's how I got started," Kung said.</TE>

<KH>RANDY HARVEY</KH>
<HD>He Turned L.A. Into a Small Town</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A friend visiting from the East Coast called Wednesday and said he
was astonished by the amount of coverage Chick Hearn's death has
received in the local media and asked whether I believed it was
justified.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, I said without thinking twice. Then I realized that I
would have to explain. To someone who hasn't lived in Los Angeles, I
suppose Chick was merely a local basketball announcer.</LD>
<LD>   To us, he was so much more. I knew that long before this week, as
long as 20 years ago, when, during my two seasons on the Laker beat,
as many people would ask whether I knew Chick Hearn as whether I knew
Magic Johnson or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.</LD>
<TE>   But it really hit me Monday afternoon when local television
channels led afternoon newscasts with detailed reports from the
Northridge hospital where Chick lay dying, then switched to his star
on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Fans had gathered at both places,
bearing flowers and candles and signs of encouragement for him and
his family.</TE>
<TE>   As if for one afternoon there was no news from Washington or Wall
Street or Jerusalem or Bogota, the newscasts were devoted almost
solely to the vigil. When time came to sign off, one of the news
anchors asked us to pray.</TE>
<TE>   We live in the world's seventh-largest metropolitan area, the
nation's second largest. The World Almanac refers to it as an urban
center. But there is no center here, not structurally, politically,
economically or spiritually. There is a Main Street in name only. Our
megalopolis is too densely populated, too sprawling, too diverse.</TE>
<TE>   On a day like Monday, though, we were living in just another small
town, praying for the local basketball announcer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I explained to my friend that Chick was like the teacher every
town seems to have who taught your grandparents, your parents and you
and is now teaching your children or maybe even your grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the teacher isn't quite as sharp as he or she once was;
maybe he or she sometimes gets Voltaire confused with Rousseau; maybe
he or she sometimes calls your child or grandchild by your name. But
you wouldn't want anyone else teaching them. You couldn't imagine
anyone else teaching them.</TE>
<TE>   Chick was our Mr. Chips. He was the corner grocer, the barber, the
librarian, the milk man.</TE>
<TE>   Some of you will remember the milk man. And the ice man. When
Chick began broadcasting Laker games, they were part of our daily
lives. He would be too, for the next 42 years.</TE>
<TE>   He played, literally, in Peoria, broadcasting Bradley Brave
basketball games in the early '50s. And he played in Los Angeles. And
Orange County. And Pasadena. And Pomona. And Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   This son of a Midwestern railroad worker cut across geographical,
generational, racial, ethnic and socioeconomic divides. He was our
connection not only to the past but to each other.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicholson, Dyan Cannon, Denzel Washington and the working
stiffs who pay $10 to sit in the upper deck at Staples Center
celebrate together when the Lakers win a championship. Today, they
mourn together.</TE>
<TE>   Chick was familiar to all of us who live here, even those who
don't follow the Lakers or sports. To those who regularly watch the
Lakers on television or listen to them on the radio, he was
practically family. He was in our homes so often that we might as
well have set a place for him at the dinner table. We would have
served jiggling Jell-O.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Chick died Monday evening, one fan interviewed on television
called it a tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Not true, not even close. There is sadness, of course, for Marge,
his wife of almost 64 years; for the poor guy or--more than
likely--guys eventually chosen to replace him in the Laker broadcast
booth only to discover that he is irreplaceable; and for those of us
left behind to contemplate all that we lost with his passing.</TE>
<TE>   From Chick's words-eye view, though, tragedy isn't a word that
would occur to him. He had a job that he loved and that he was able
to do until he was 85, and, when he died, he was as beloved as anyone
whoever called this place home. He would put his life into the
refrigerator as a triumph.</TE>
<TE>   He wouldn't want a funeral. He'd want a parade, down Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, when more and more fans began to congregate on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame, the fire department sent some of its men over
there to sweep off Chick's star. Their next stop, I imagine, was to
rescue a kitten from a tree.</TE>

<LD>The first winner of what is now the Manhattan Beach tournament did
more than simply play tennis. First of all, the event was named after
her--the Billie Jean King Invitational--and its first home was
indoors under modest circumstances in the gym at Long Beach City
College in 1971.</LD>
<LD>   Ownership had its privileges, if you could call them that.</LD>
<LD>   "We were helping lay down the court. I even had my mom and dad
helping," King said.</LD>
<TE>   The effort has not changed. King is still working hard, promoting
the JPMorgan Chase Open at Manhattan Beach with a series of
interviews this week. The U.S. Fed Cup captain had an unwanted
appearance in the spotlight earlier this year, when she kicked
Jennifer Capriati off the team in April because of a dispute over
team rules.</TE>
<TE>   Question: You said that Capriati removed herself from the team
twice before the final confrontation. What was her emotional state
like during the Fed Cup week?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: She didn't really lose it. She lost it after I asked her
to leave. She just seems in a tough place right now. That's what
people keep saying to me, but I'm not around her every day. I was
disappointed and hurt. I know relationships are more important than
anything else. But I'm also 58 going on 59, and can look back. I know
when I was playing I was pretty maniacal.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you think of the suggestion of some that the dominance
of Venus and Serena Williams is not good for women's tennis?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's great for the game. They used to say that when Chris
[Evert] and Martina [Navratilova] were there at the top. Any time you
have rivalries, people are very interested in the sport. It always
helps promote the sport. We're so lucky to have what we have in
women's tennis right now.... I think they didn't really appreciate
Martina until now. And now she's 45 and they're saying, 'Look at her.
She still can volley. She can do this.'</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have attitudes regarding an all-out effort shifted now that
Venus and Serena had a well-played final at Wimbledon?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think it helped a lot. It's starting to get rid of the
stigma. I don't know how they do it, personally. When Serena publicly
said, 'I want to be No. 1,' that shifted her emphasis a lot. That was
a good sign that there will be more of a separation between the two
and the two can really just go at it. I don't think I could have
played against [brother] Randy [Moffitt]. We've talked about it.
There's no way we'd want to play against each other. We're so close.
Thank God we're opposite genders. I would have been crying. I don't
know if I could have played.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Wasn't it difficult even playing against close friend Rosie
Casals?</TE>
<TE>   A: We hated playing each other. It was terrible. I hated playing
her. I felt close to Chris. Chris and I talked about it. She said, 'I
cannot be close to you until I'm finished playing competitively.' I
said, 'OK, that's fair enough.'</TE>
<TE>   Q: Does it help that the Venus and Serena are being viewed as
individuals, not as a unit?</TE>
<TE>   A: I used to talk to them about it. At Fed Cup, I used to never
let them stand together in the photos. I kept trying to separate
them. As long as you talk to them, they're very bright and they get
it. I told them, 'I don't want the media referring to you as the
Williams sisters. Each one of you is an individual. Not to say you're
not sisters. I want you to be respected on your own terms.' They kind
of went, 'Oh, I don't mind that at all.'</TE>
<TE>   Q: The last time Venus and Serena played Fed Cup was in 1999,
shortly after Serena won the U.S. Open. What was the atmosphere like
in training that week at Stanford?</TE>
<TE>   A: They're so connected anyway. They came to the team meeting and
tried to sit themselves in a big chair. [laughs.] I remember this one
big armchair and them both trying to sit together. They did finally
make it. I swear you almost needed Vaseline on both sides. I didn't
know how it was going to work because it was right after the Open.
There was a little tension, we thought. I saw how they were and I
knew we were golden. They were still very attached, literally, at the
hip. It was very sweet.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've been vocal about the potential threat to Title IX.</TE>
<TE>   A: It is under attack.... We're not supposed to be a free NFL farm
system or free NBA farm system for basketball and I don't think
taxpayers should pay for that. Let's say a parent or primary
caregiver has three boys. They're going to get ticked off because
they think the girls are hurting the boys. It's not true. They need
to understand that if they want to spend 100% of their money and
scholarships for football, guess what? That means the other guys
aren't going to get what they deserve. But don't get the have-nots
against the have-nots. I just hope men and women will stick together
on this.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Players and owners agree to raise lowest pay by
$100,000 per year as they head into key weekend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Players and owners agreed to a $100,000 increase in baseball's
minimum salary Thursday, making more progress on minor issues as
labor negotiations enter a key weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with the possibility the union's executive board might set a
strike date when it meets Monday in Chicago, both sides got three
items out of the way and prepared to deal with larger issues.</LD>
<LD>   They set the minimum at $300,000 starting next year, and agreed to
increases in the benefits plan that allow most 10-year veterans who
played after 1970 to earn pensions of about $160,000 annually, the
federal maximum. Also, they agreed to shorten the period for teams to
fund deferred salaries.</LD>
<TE>   A day after baseball players ended decades of opposition to
mandatory drug testing by agreeing to be checked for illegal
steroids, management worked on a counterproposal it intended to
present today.</TE>
<TE>   Increased revenue sharing and a luxury tax on high payrolls--the
key economic issues--were not discussed.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston Astros became the latest team to authorize the union's
executive board to set a strike deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Players, however, haven't reached a consensus on whether a date
should be set.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on what potentially happens the rest of this week,
hoping that progress continues to be made," Boston's Tony Clark, the
AL player representative, said after his team met with union head
Donald Fehr.</TE>
<TE>   Management labor lawyer Rob Manfred said negotiators intended to
work through the weekend. Until now, talks have been limited to
weekdays.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you are doing an agreement, there are points that become
focus points in terms of attempting to reach an agreement to avoid
this or that happening," Manfred said. "Clearly, the parties have
focused on this meeting Monday as a point in the process. We've
worked hard against that deadline. Both sides have."</TE>

<HD>Unser May Need to Go Slower on New Course</HD>

<LD>Al Unser Jr. will race this weekend at Sparta, Ky., in the Belterra
Casino Indy 300, less than a week after leaving an undisclosed
rehabilitation center for alcohol abuse.</LD>
<LD>   The Indy Racing League driver resurfaced Monday, only 18 days
after he had voluntarily begun the program July 18.</LD>
<LD>   "I am Al, the grateful alcoholic," Unser said at a news conference
Thursday at Kentucky Speedway. "My recovery program didn't end
earlier this week. That's just the beginning. I have a program that
I'm following today, tomorrow, next week, next month and for the rest
of my life."</LD>
<TE>   Speed may be Unser's life, and though he and team owner Tom Kelley
apparently believe he is ready to return--he was also cleared by the
IRL's medical director, Dr. Henry Bock--there's at least some reason
to believe 18 days were not enough for the two-time Indianapolis 500
champion to receive the care he needs to beat his problem.</TE>
<TE>   According to Dr. Anne Linton, chief medical officer of the Betty
Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, the nation's leading rehabilitation
hospital, an 18-day inpatient stay is short.</TE>
<TE>   "Our traditional inpatient program is four weeks," she said. "And
we started a professional recovery and relapse program, which is a
three-month program for people in high-profile professions such as
pilots, doctors, nurses and lawyers."</TE>
<TE>   Race car drivers, she added, would fit into that category.</TE>
<TE>   "What we found with the professionals is, they have bigger
defenses and it's harder to get to them in a shorter period of time.
Their denial and defenses are so huge, it takes time to break that
down and make behavioral changes so they don't have to drink.</TE>
<TE>   "What we know too about making behavior change, it takes three
months of repeating the same behavior and then it becomes ingrained."</TE>
<TE>   Unser, 40, was arrested in Indianapolis on July 9, after allegedly
striking his girlfriend in the car and leaving her at the side of the
highway.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors later dropped domestic violence charges, but the
incident brought to light a problem that was known in the paddock but
never surfaced on race day.</TE>
<TE>   His car sponsor, Corteco, made arrangements for Unser to enter the
undisclosed "nationally recognized substance-abuse center."</TE>
<TE>   Unser said he was comfortable with being a role model for those
with substance-abuse problems, that his alcohol indulgence took place
away from the racetrack, and that this is a race he is going to win.</TE>
<TE>   Had Unser remained in rehab for four weeks, the minimum at the
Betty Ford Center, he would have missed three of the IRL's 15 events.
With four races remaining, he is ninth in the standings, 54 points
out of the top five.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest misconception with alcohol is that it is [not] a
disease.... ," Unser said. "The tough part for me was admitting I was
powerless against that disease and needed help.</TE>
<TE>   "That race car is the best therapy I could go into. It's certainly
not too soon."</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR</TE>
<TE>   Winston Cup driver Tony Stewart's wish apparently was Home Depot's
command.</TE>
<TE>   When Stewart was fined $10,000 by NASCAR for punching Indianapolis
photographer Gary Mook in the chest after Sunday's Brickyard 400,
Stewart said it should have been more.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what NASCAR fined me was not stiff enough, given my
past," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, Home Depot, which sponsors the Pontiac Stewart drives
for Joe Gibbs, fined Stewart $50,000 and, as NASCAR had done earlier,
put him on probation for the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "This was my heart attack, my wake-up call," Stewart said. "There
is no excuse for what I've done.... "Meeting with Mr. Mook is now my
first priority. He didn't deserve any of this and my apology to him
needs to come face to face, as soon as possible."</TE>
<TE>   And as Unser was getting out of treatment, Stewart was looking for
some in the form of an anger management program.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to do something to make it where I can control my anger
better," he said. "It's obvious over 3 1/2 years, I can't do it on my
own, so I'm going to seek professional help and get somebody that can
help me learn how to control my emotions."</TE>
<TE>   Stewart also ended last season on probation, after arguing with a
Winston Cup official and slapping a tape recorder from a reporter's
hand. He was fined $10,000 for that incident, as well.</TE>
<TE>   With Petty Enterprises hiring Christian Fittipaldi as a Busch
driver for next season, with the intention of his running a full
Winston Cup schedule in 2004, Kyle Petty--son of Richard Petty--could
be stockpiling some of the biggest surnames in the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Petty said he also hopes to retain his current driver, John
Andretti, nephew of Mario Andretti, for next season. Fittipaldi is
the nephew of two-time Formula One world champion Emerson Fittipaldi.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've been around our organization, you know that personality
becomes a huge factor in what we try to do," said Kyle Petty, driver
of the No. 45 Dodge. "Christian fits the mold as what we see being a
Petty Enterprises driver. His family goals, his family orientation,
the tradition he has behind him. I think in every shape and form he
matches what we want at Petty Enterprises, and that's a blessing. To
get an opportunity to have him, we couldn't pass it up."</TE>

<TE>   Racing on an Arrowhead Speedway dirt oval conducive to passing,
four former American Motorcyclist Assn. national champions with nine
titles among them lead a stellar field into Round 1 of the AMA U.S.
National Championship on Wednesday at Orange Show Events Center in
San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time champion Mike Faria of Reno and two-time champion Bobby
Schwartz of Costa Mesa will be racing, as will Billy Hamill of
Monrovia and Greg Hancock, formerly of Costa Mesa. Hamill has been
riding in the British League for the Coventry Bees. Hancock lives in
Sweden and is head coach of the British Speedway Promoters
Assn.-backed National Training Academy. Hamill and Hancock have each
won two AMA national titles and one Grand Prix world championship,
and will be trying to fend off Josh Larsen, Chris Manchester and Bart
Bast, as well as other regulars who compete at Costa Mesa, San
Bernardino and Victorville.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Hamill's Coventry teammates, Ryan Fisher of Norco and Billy
Janniro of Benicia, will also compete.</TE>
<TE>   Hamill won at San Bernardino on July 31, and Larsen won the
scratch main Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Racing begins at 8 p.m.</TE>

<LD>A resurgent Andre Agassi advanced to the quarterfinals of the
$2.95-million Cincinnati Masters Series tennis tournament with a 6-4,
7-5 victory over Thomas Enqvist on Thursday at Mason, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   Today, he will face top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt, who beat Jarko
Nieminen, 2-6, 6-2, 6-3.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a high-standard match," said Agassi, who wore Enqvist down
with unrelenting baseline strokes. "It was quite a thriller."</LD>
<TE>   Agassi, seeded sixth, has won four titles this year and is coming
off a victory in Los Angeles. He is 37-5 in matches this year.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel pretty good about the year," Agassi said. "Unfortunately,
the Slams haven't worked out very well."</TE>
<TE>   Agassi missed the Australian Open because of a wrist injury, lost
in the quarterfinals of the French Open and lost in the second round
at Wimbledon, his last tournament before Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, he has had a remarkably consistent year, reaching at
least the quarterfinals in eight of 10 appearances.</TE>

<TE>   The Detroit Red Wings expect captain Steve Yzerman to recover from
a knee operation in time for the second half of the season, a team
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The 37-year-old Yzerman had knee surgery for the third time in two
years on Aug. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to play, but I accept the fact that if it hurts too much,
you get to the point where it doesn't make sense," Yzerman told the
Detroit News. "If I get to that point, I won't play. Common sense
would take over."</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Ward averted a weekend arbitration hearing with the Carolina
Hurricanes by signing a four-year, $7.5-million contract.</TE>
<TE>   The defenseman, who had career highs in games, assists and points
last season for the Eastern Conference champions, will make $1.5
million this season, and then $2 million a year for three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Ottawa Senators will keep center Radek Bonk despite the
two-year, $6.7-million contract he won in salary arbitration this
week.</TE>
<TE>   That was $1 million more than the Senators wanted to give him, but
General Manager John Muckler said the club would not attempt to trade
their No. 1 center.</TE>
<TE>   Goaltender Martin Biron of the Buffalo Sabres signed a two-year
contract that will pay him $1.9 million next season and $2.2 million
in 2003-04.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Runners Mehdi Baala of France and Reyes Estevez of Spain finished
in an apparent tie and each thought he won the men's 1,500 meters at
the European Athletics Championship at Munich, Germany, before Baala
was eventually declared the winner.</TE>
<TE>   They finished in 3 minutes 45.25 seconds, and officials at first
called it a tie.</TE>
<TE>   Estevez even celebrated with a victory lap. But after 10 minutes
of confusion, officials awarded the win to Baala when advanced timing
showed he had finished ahead by .002 of a second.</TE>
<TE>   Defending triple jump champion Jonathan Edwards of England lost
his title to Sweden's Christian Olsson, who jumped 57 feet, 6 1/2
inches. Edwards settled for third with a jump of 56-10.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Shawn Marion signed a six-year, $79-million contract
extension with the Phoenix Suns.... A televised game between the
Lakers and Sacramento, and a Minnesota-Miami matchup in the Dominican
Republic, highlight the NBA exhibition schedule. In a rematch of the
Western Conference finals, the Lakers and Kings will play Oct. 25 at
Staples Center. The game will be televised by ESPN.... The Denver
Nuggets signed free-agent center Mark Blount to a one-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Former Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding was sentenced to 10
days in jail at Camas, Wash., for drinking alcohol while on
probation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm grateful to the judge for giving me this opportunity; I
finally found out what my problem is: It's alcohol," Harding said.</TE>
<TE>   Mohini Bhardwaj, an 11-time All-American at UCLA, dislocated her
right elbow performing on uneven bars and will miss the rest of the

<HD>Steelers Have Problems in Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Pittsburgh Steelers, beginning the exhibition season the same way
they ended last season, felt fortunate that it wasn't a game that
counted. The New York Jets only wish it did.</LD>
<LD>   Vinny Testaverde led a long touchdown drive on New York's opening
possession and the Jets, aided by the special teams mistakes and
turnovers that doomed Pittsburgh in the AFC title game, beat the
Steelers, 16-6, Thursday night at Pittsburgh.</LD>
<LD>   "It was really encouraging to open the preseason with a
touchdown," said Testaverde, who completed six of eight passes for 61
yards despite a thumb injury that bothered him early in camp. "I felt
right in stride."</LD>
<TE>   The Steelers, consensus picks to win the AFC championship they
lost at home to New England seven months ago, probably felt stuck in
time.</TE>
<TE>   Except for a couple of big plays by second-round draft pick
Antwaan Randle El, who created first downs the first four times he
touched the ball, it was an effort remarkably similar to the AFC
championship game loss.</TE>
<TE>   Jerome Bettis gained only eight yards in seven carries.</TE>
<TE>   Again, there were turnovers--Kordell Stewart was intercepted on
the first of two series run by the Steeler starters, leading to one
of John Hall's field goals--and some mistakes by Troy Edwards on
special teams, plus a blocked punt, and four turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   These were the same kind of errors that led the Steelers to fire
former special teams coach Jay Hayes and bring in Kevin Spencer, only
to get a repeat performance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's eerie to get all that again.... It's amazing. I'm
stuttering, I almost don't know what to say," punter Josh Miller
said. "But we'll get it fixed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle offensive tackle Chris McIntosh will be out indefinitely
because of a recurring neck injury, Seahawk Coach Mike Holmgren said.</TE>
<TE>   McIntosh suffered a neck stinger in training camp last year and
played in only 10 games, starting three. Holmgren said McIntosh
appears to have the same injury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ben Lynch, a top reserve for San Francisco last year who filled in
when Pro Bowl center Jeremy Newberry was lost for an early portion of
the season, re-signed with the 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers did not tender Lynch, a three-year veteran, a contract
offer this spring, hoping to get by at backup center with younger
players who also could play different positions on the offensive
line. But training camp injuries to starters Newberry and guard Ron
Stone, among others, finally persuaded the team to re-sign Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee linebacker Peter Sirmon was released from the hospital
and Coach Jeff Fisher said he might play Saturday night against the
St. Louis Rams in the exhibition opener.</TE>
<TE>   Sirmon was hospitalized Tuesday for flu-like symptoms including a
fever that worsened.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center Mark Fischer signed with the Denver Broncos after four
years with the Washington Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   The 28-year-old Fischer spent most of last season on injured
reserve after hurting his right knee.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Remains Stuck, but Sosa Doesn't</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matt Clement was so excited to pitch to Barry Bonds that he couldn't
give the San Francisco slugger anything to hit.</LD>
<LD>   No matter--Sammy Sosa still provided a home run to remember.</LD>
<LD>   Sosa homered twice, including a 461-foot drive to straightaway
center, and Bonds was denied his 600th home run for the second
consecutive game as the Cubs beat the San Francisco Giants, 9-3,
Thursday at San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   All the attention in the series was focused on Bonds, who hit his
599th homer on Tuesday night. Clement was so worked up for the
challenge that he got overexcited and walked Bonds twice on nine
pitches in his first two at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "I was out of control against him, but I was fine against
everybody else," said Clement, who pitched seven shutout innings of
two-hit ball. "It was a great atmosphere out here. I was able to
settle down, but you're talking about the best ballplayer of my
generation. That was a highlight for my career."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds went one for two with a single and a strikeout. Instead, the
stars were Clement and Sosa, who saved Chicago from being swept and
ended San Francisco's four-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "I really didn't care how far that home run was," said Sosa, who
hit the second-longest homer in Pacific Bell Park's three-year
history. "My concern was to get the win for Matt, because he pitched
a great game. Barry is going to get 600. It's just a matter of time.
He'll just have to be a little bit more patient."</TE>
<TE>   While Clement (9-8) got nine strikeouts, Sosa provided the
excitement with a two-run homer in the first and the long two-run
shot in the eighth against reliever Troy Brohawn.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa leads the NL with 35 homers, and has 485 in his career. His
eighth-inning drive, which caromed off the 490-foot sign on one short
hop, trails only Andres Galarraga's 485-foot homer last season in Pac
Bell history.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 4, Arizona 1--Tom Glavine took a shutout into the ninth
inning at Phoenix and John Smoltz reached 40 saves in a season faster
than any pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Julio Franco and Mark De Rosa homered off Brian Anderson (5-8) in
the final regular-season matchup of the top two teams in the National
League. Franco, who turns 41 on Aug. 23, went three for five with a
double and three RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine (15-6) gave up four hits, struck out five, walked three
and hit a batter. Junior Spivey broke up Glavine's shutout bid with a
leadoff home run in the ninth. It was Arizona's second hit since the
first inning.</TE>
<TE>   Smoltz replaced Glavine and got three outs to earn his
franchise-record 40th save in Atlanta's 114th game. Lee Smith of St.
Louis was the previous fastest to 40 saves, doing it in his team's
117th game in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves have not lost a road series since dropping two of three
to the New York Mets on April 15-17. They have won 11 series away
from Turner Field and tied four since then.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, Montreal 3--Matt Morris won his 13th game and the
Cardinal hitters broke out of their slump at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Pujols hit a two-run home run in the first and Jim Edmonds
had a two-run shot in the second for the Cardinals, whose five runs
in the first two innings were one more than their total in the
previous four games. St. Louis won for the first time in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 7, Philadelphia 4--Ron Gant hit a three-run homer with
two out in the ninth inning at San Diego to lead the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   Gant hit Terry Adams' 2-and-0 fastball 400 feet to left, capping a
comeback from a 4-0 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 10, Cincinnati 3--Mike Hampton won for the first time
since July 5, allowing one unearned run in six innings at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton (6-13), who already has matched his career high for
losses, had been winless in five previous starts. He gave up three
hits, walked four and struck out two, working out of trouble in two
innings.</TE>
<TE>   New York 9, Milwaukee 0--Steve Trachsel scattered five hits at
Milwaukee in his first complete game and shutout of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Trachsel (8-7), who is 5-1 in his last nine starts, pitched his
first complete game since Oct. 3.</TE>
<TE>   The only runner he allowed past second base was Alex Sanchez, who
tripled in the sixth inning. He was stranded when center fielder Timo
Perez made a running catch of Eric Young's fly to the right-field
gap.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 4, Houston 3--Julian Tavarez won for the first time in a
month, and Ramon Castro had two hits and three RBIs at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Braden Looper got his fifth save in eight chances, giving up a
two-out triple to Craig Biggio and an RBI single to Lance Berkman
before retiring Bagwell on a game-ending fly out.</TE>

<HD>Fishing's Slow, but Tournament Reels Them In</HD>

<DL>KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>Sometime this afternoon a winner will emerge in the 43rd Hawaiian
International Billfish Tournament. One of 22 teams will be
immortalized, its name and those of its anglers inscribed on a
four-foot wooden marlin on prominent display at King Kamehameha's
Kona Beach Hotel.</LD>
<LD>   But in a way, the winners have already emerged. They did this
simply by showing up, with their families and friends, whereupon they
quickly caught a bug known around here as the Aloha spirit.</LD>
<LD>   It's something you don't see in most tournaments, where the lure
of big money transforms fishermen into sharks, out to win at all
costs.</LD>
<TE>   In those tournaments--and more are springing up every year--the
bug is one that brings out the worst in the competitors.</TE>
<TE>   People become cheats whether they're cheating or not as paranoia
runs as deep as the sparkling sea. It takes a polygraph expert to
determine the winners, and even they are often looked at through
suspect eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Here at the billfish tournament, an event that in 1959 put the
Kona coast on the map as a big-game fishing destination, there is no
cash prize. A victory is simply that and having won is reward enough.
Competition is fierce but friendly. The honesty displayed by the
participants is as refreshing as the trade winds raking gently over
the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Teams turn themselves in for even the smallest of accidental
infractions, such as having someone other than the designated angler
touching the rod or the line before the fish comes to leader. It
happens every year, "And we wouldn't have it any other way," said
Brooks Morris, 74, who founded the Laguna Niguel Billfish Club in
1979 specifically to have a team to compete in this tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The team has won twice and has reason to be proud: One of its
anglers, Gil Kraemer of San Juan Capistrano, in 1986 caught the
largest marlin in tournament history, a 1,062-pound blue that stands
as the only "grander" ever landed during the event.</TE>
<TE>   "But we come for the friendships we've made over the years as much
as for the fishing," Morris added. "Those friendships will last a
lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   This year's tournament has teams from as far east as Japan, as far
south as Australia and as far north as Northern Ireland. It also has
several teams from the United States. Four are from Southern
California and include the King Harbor Marlin Club, Marina del Rey
Anglers and Malibu Marlin Club.</TE>
<TE>   The latter is a two-man team worthy of--although not
seeking--recognition despite not having caught a fish through the
first three days of fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of the participants, Mark Pfeiffer and Sam Spinello
arrived a week early to participate in the tournament's pro-am event,
one that does offer a fairly sizable cash purse as an incentive. On
the jet that brought them here they met Mike Redpath, a New York City
firefighter honeymooning with wife Jennifer.</TE>
<TE>   Redpath was not on duty when the terrorists struck last Sept. 11,
but from the coast he watched in horror as the planes crashed into
the World Trade Center buildings. Several in his battalion were
killed in the ensuing rescue effort.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a year later, "He has a wonderful attitude about life,"
Pfeiffer said, and during his first trip to Hawaii he asked what it
was like to catch a big marlin. On the spot, the two anglers made
Redpath an honorary member of the club and invited him to fish with
them in the pro-am, giving him the first seat in the fighting chair.</TE>
<TE>   "We both said that we'd rather see him catch his first marlin than
win the event, because that only happens once in a person's
lifetime," Pfeiffer said. "He didn't catch one, and neither did we,
but we gave it our best crack."</TE>
<TE>   Redpath gave the two anglers patches honoring the names of his
fallen co-workers and they now adorn the tournament shirts worn
Pfeiffer and Spinello.</TE>
<TE>   It is this kind of spirit that swirls around the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Maxwell, one of the Laguna Niguel members, came for the
fishing but also to spend time on the Big Island with some of the
special people in his life. One is his wife, Helen. The others are
Karolina  and Agnieszka Gochnio, identical twins from Poland who have
never had an opportunity to visit such a tropical paradise.</TE>
<TE>   "It is every Polish girl's dream to come to Hawaii," said
Agnieszka, who has been busy working on her tan and touring the
island.</TE>
<TE>   The Maxwells, who have a home nearby, volunteer as English
teachers in Poland. They've become close with several families there,
the Gochnios in particular. The 18-year-old twins were invited to
spend their summer vacation here.</TE>
<TE>   Blond and beautiful, they've been turning lots of heads during the
billfish tournament's shotgun starts, where they have shown up each
morning to send Maxwell off with hugs.</TE>
<TE>   But they're providing only a small dose of the international
flavor so prevalent during the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Reece, a retired airline company executive, has been coming
for 30 years as a member of the Malindi Sea Fishing Club of Kenya.
"And I haven't caught a marlin in 10 years," he said Thursday
morning, "but my son [Glenn] has caught eight [in those 10 years]."
Glenn Reece's 12-year-old son, Brian, is also on board, giving the
Kenya team three generations of representation.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Weir is a member of the Queen's Counsel in Belfast, but
the high-profile barrister is also a dedicated member of the Odyssey
team from Northern Ireland. With him is his son, Laurence, his nephew
Rory Gleadhill and Gleadhill's girlfriend, Jennifer Rea.</TE>
<TE>   "I first came to Hawaii because I had always heard this was one of
the best places in the world to catch big marlin," said Weir, who has
yet to leader one of the really big ones. "I now come because Hawaii
and its people I just adore. I love the tournament because it's not a
money tournament. It's not a pressure situation, although you want to
do well and win. There's still that pride. It's a clear, clean
competition without any worry about money or anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Weir must really love Hawaii. His team's routing is from Belfast
to London to Los Angeles to Honolulu to Kailua-Kona. "It took us 18
hours to get here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That's nearly as long as the longest battle in tournament history,
a 23-hour unsuccessful struggle--by one of the Marina del Rey Anglers
team--with a marlin estimated to weigh 1,100 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Blame It on Meo</TE>
<TE>   Last year's tournament was one of the most productive in history,
with competitors logging 72 catches, including 56 blue marlin, 13
short-nosed spearfish, one striped marlin and two yellowfin tuna, or
ahi.</TE>
<TE>   This year's tournament is shaping up to be one of the least
productive. After the first two days of the four-day event only eight
blue marlin were tagged and released, none of which met the 300-pound
minimum required to be brought aboard and thus worth fewer points.
There was a small flurry of activity late Thursday, with a few
hookups reported as the deadline approached.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody's sure why the fishing, which had been phenomenal until
about three weeks ago, suddenly dropped off. Some are blaming a
developing El Nino for warming surface temperatures to as high as 82
degrees and altering the local currents.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing has helped. Many of the teams have been boarding their
vessels carrying bundles of tea leaves for good luck. A few of them
tagged and released a small marlin or two, which is better than what
could be said about the Laguna Niguel team. Its members invited a
reporter along for the first two days--and they were skunked.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long before they started whispering about the
so-called "media jinx" and at one point they jokingly--one would
presume--threatened to toss the reporter overboard.</TE>
<TE>   Tag and Brag</TE>
<TE>   Organizers can boast of being among the first billfish tournaments
to implement a conservation aspect. In 1988 the tournament outlawed
gaffing and boating any fish estimated to weigh less than 300 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, those fish have had to be tagged to be worth any
points--a blue marlin tagged and released on 50-pound test, for
example, is worth 300 points while one caught on stronger 80-pound
test is worth 250 points. A captured fish scores points based on its
weight.</TE>
<TE>   The tagging efforts have provided some insight as to the movements
of marlin. Tournament founder Peter Fithian said one turned up on the
end of a line 2 1/2 years after it was tagged--in the South China
Sea. Another was caught a year later in the same area it was
initially caught, indicating, perhaps, that individual fish do return
to the same places year after year. Another tagged marlin turned up
near the Galapagos Islands off Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   Winding Up</TE>
<TE>   Last year's top skipper, Randy Parker of the Huntress, is one of
an elite few dozen active Kona skippers to have a grander to his
credit, and one of an even smaller group to have two fish weighing
1,000 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   While skill was certainly a factor, so was luck. His first
involved an angler who insisted on talking to his friends in Florida
on a cell phone during a fight that turned tricky on several
occasions. On the second, deckhand Boyd Decoito pulled the hook out
of the fish's mouth after getting it to leader.</TE>
<TE>   Parker reached for a gaff and stuck the fish just as it was
swimming away. The granders weighed 1,045 and 1,174 pounds,
respectively. His brother, Marlin Parker, also has two granders, the
largest weighing 1,400 pounds.</TE>

<HD>Russian Officials Tell Their Side of the Story</HD>
<DH>Figure skating: They deny knowledge of alleged fixing of
Olympic events, put blame on American referee.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Russian figure skating officials denied knowledge of an alleged
conspiracy to fix the pairs and ice dancing events at the Salt Lake
City Olympics, denouncing what they called "the continuing campaign
of groundless attacks on Russian figure skaters that has been
unleashed in North America."</LD>
<LD>   If anyone is to blame for the controversy surrounding the pairs
event, judge Marina Sanaya said Thursday, it was American referee Ron
Pfenning, who she said had pressured judges into favoring flawed
performances by Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier over
superior performances by Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze.</LD>
<LD>   Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov, a reputed crime figure from Uzbekistan, was
accused last week by U.S. authorities of orchestrating a
vote-swapping scheme in which a French judge was supposed to vote for
the Russian pair and a Russian judge was to vote for French ice
dancers Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat.</LD>
<TE>   Tokhtakhunov was arrested last week in Italy, where police said he
might have involved six ice dance judges in the plot. He has denied
wrongdoing and said he would fight extradition to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze won the pairs gold medal but Sale and
Pelletier received duplicate medals after French judge Marie-Reine Le
Gougne said she had been pressured to vote for the Russians. She
later recanted, but she and Didier Gailhaguet, head of the French ice
sports federation, were each suspended for three years and banned
from the 2006 Winter Games.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking during a news conference in Moscow, Sanaya said Pfenning
instructed judges before the pairs short programs not to give the
Russians scores higher than 5.8 in order to give others a chance to
win. She also said the Canadians should have been penalized for
exceeding the time limit for their routine, but Pfenning deliberately
neglected to tell the judges about the infraction.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, we see the referee's favorable attitude to the pair
from Canada," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Pfenning, who said the FBI has asked to interview him later this
month, disputed Sanaya's interpretation of events.</TE>
<TE>   "From her perspective, she thinks it's truthful," he said. "If you
go back, I never said not to give the Russians anything above a
certain mark. I don't recall using the number 5.8. My recollection is
[that] because some of the judges had asked me how to handle it--the
third team was the former world champions [Berezhnaya and
Sikharulidze]--I said something like, 'Keep in mind we use reflective
marking and if someone comes out later and skates better, you have to
give them a higher mark.'</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way it goes in this sport. I wanted to make sure they
didn't close the door [on rewarding a superb performance later].</TE>
<TE>   "I remember the Canadians fell at the end of their program. They
sort of took their final pose and the clock stopped and at that
moment, it was not over 2 minutes 40 seconds. If it had been, I would
have instructed the judges to make a deduction."</TE>
<TE>   The International Skating Union said it isn't ignoring the charges
against Tokhtakhunov, who has been linked by U.S. investigators to
drug trafficking, illegal arms sales and dealing in stolen cars. But
it said it can't begin looking into the matter until it receives
"reasonable, verified and credible evidence" of his alleged
activities. The ISU, however, is not a defendant in the case and has
no legal standing to be included in formal mailings.</TE>
<TE>   "Unlike government authorities, the ISU cannot subpoena persons or
documents, tap into telephone calls, seize documents, mail,
computers, computer discs or e-mail," it said in a press release. "If
and when the ISU receives from Italian or U.S. authorities probative
evidence establishing that persons within the jurisdiction of the ISU
have engaged in improper conduct to influence the results of the Salt
Lake City Winter Games, the ISU will immediately commence further
disciplinary action."</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials say they don't know Tokhtakhunov and that no
member of the country's delegation was involved in a fix.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, Italian police released more wiretapped
conversations they say involved Tokhtakhunov and Anissina. In one
excerpt, he allegedly told her, "The mess has begun! I think you are
the last champion of the Olympic Games. I think that ice dancing will
be banned."</TE>
<TE>   However, Russian ice dance judge Alla Shekhovtseva, who ranked
Russians Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh ahead of Anissina and
Peizerat in the finale, said she had not been pressured to vote for
the French duo and did not believe other judges had been so
pressured.</TE>

<HD>Price for Argentina's Friendship: $1 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Argentina might have been a World Cup flop, but its national team
continues to be a top attraction, at least in Japan.</LD>
<LD>   Japanese organizers will pay the Argentine Football Assn. more
than $1 million in appearance fees and expenses when Argentina plays
Japan in a friendly in Tokyo in November, according to figures
released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The catch is that Argentina must bring virtually its entire World
Cup team to the game, including all-time leading scorer Gabriel
Batistuta, who announced his international retirement after the South
Americans were ousted in the first round of Korea/Japan '02.</LD>
<TE>   The Argentine sports daily Ole quoted Julio Grondona, the AFA
president, as saying that he favors Batistuta's recall, but that the
final decision is up to the player and Coach Marcelo Bielsa, who is
expected to be rehired next week despite the World Cup failure.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina will receive a $900,000 appearance fee and will have all
its expenses paid for the November match.</TE>
<TE>   A Diplomatic Tie</TE>
<TE>   United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger were among the 70,635 present at
Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., Thursday night to see
European champion Real Madrid and AS Roma play to a 0-0 tie in a
benefit game for the Global AIDS Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid created three clear scoring chances, but they were
squandered by Roberto Carlos and Ivan Helguera in the first half and
by Esteban Cambiasso in the second. Damiano Tomassi came closest to
scoring for AS Roma.</TE>
<TE>   Gold Cup Referees</TE>
<TE>   Two referees from the United States and two from Canada are among
10 referees selected to officiate the CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup,
which will be played Oct. 27-Nov. 9 at several sites, including the
Rose Bowl and Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Americans Sandra Hunt and Kari Seitz and Canadians Sonia
Denoncourt and Jillanta Proctor will take part in the 12-nation
tournament, which also serves as regional qualifying for the 2003
Women's World Cup in China.</TE>
<TE>   Also named were Varnette Laing (Bahamas), Ave Maria Alpizar (Costa
Rica), Irazema Agullera (Cuba), Dianne Ferreira-James (Guyana),
Virginia Tovar (Mexico) and Cassie Moore (Trinidad and Tobago).</TE>
<TE>   Scolari Angered</TE>
<TE>   For the second time in a week, Luis Felipe Scolari, Brazil's World
Cup-winning coach, postponed a decision on whether to continue in the
post.</TE>
<TE>   But Scolari, torn between the desires of the Brazilian soccer
federation, which wants him to stay on, and his family, which wants
him to step down, blasted reports in Rio de Janeiro that suggested
his indecision was financially driven.</TE>
<TE>   "When I joined the Brazil team, I was earning less money than I
was at Cruzeiro," he said, referring to his previous club job. "The
people who invented this story have no brains."</TE>
<TE>   Cannavaro Signs</TE>
<TE>   Italy national team defender Fabio Cannavaro was acquired Thursday
by Inter Milan from Serie A rival Parma for a reported $14.58
million.</TE>
<TE>   Cannavaro, 29, was hailed by Uruguay winger and new teammate
Alvaro Recoba as "one of the strongest defenders in the world" and
would have been an even more costly acquisition but for the financial
crisis plaguing the Italian league.</TE>
<TE>   He signed a four-year contract, terms of which were not revealed.</TE>
<TE>   Best Recovering</TE>
<TE>   Former Manchester United and Northern Ireland winger George Best,
56, was recovering satisfactorily at a London hospital Thursday, nine
days after undergoing liver transplant surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Best was up and walking unaided, a Cromwell Hospital spokesman
said, adding that it will be some time before the 1968 European
player of the year is discharged.</TE>
<TE>   Chilean Referee Quits</TE>
<TE>   Referee Francisco Caamano, who during a first-division game on
Sunday kneed a player in the groin, allegedly in self-defense,
resigned Thursday rather than face an anticipated lifetime ban from
Chile's soccer federation.</TE>
<TE>   Refereeing officials rejected Caamano's explanation of the
incident, saying that television footage showed that he had kneed an
Audax Italiano player in the groin and not in the thigh as he had
claimed, before red-carding the player for feigning injury.</TE>
<TE>   Asian Initiative</TE>
<TE>   China, Japan and South Korea will hold the first edition of what
is expected to become an annual tri-nation club championship from
Feb. 16-22 in either Tokyo or Yokohama, South Korea's Yonhap news
agency reported.</TE>
<TE>   The inaugural four-team event will feature the league champions of
China and South Korea, along with Japan's J-League champion and its
Nabisco Cup winner. The tournament, scheduled for China in 2004 and
South Korea in 2005, will offer $850,000 in prize money, with
$400,000 going to the winner.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Losing Their Touch</HD>
<DH>WNBA: Cooper says team 'in trouble' after it shoots 25.7%
in 67-64 home loss to Comets, who knock L.A. out of first in West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been a while since the Sparks played a game of this importance
at this time of the year. When a team posts consecutive 28-4 records,
it tends not to sweat the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe that's what's wrong with them.</LD>
<LD>   The Sparks played their biggest game of the season Thursday
against their bitter rivals, the Houston Comets. And the Sparks fell
on their faces, losing, 67-64.</LD>
<TE>   In front of a sellout crowd of 12,540 at Staples Center, the
Sparks shot a franchise-low 25.7%, making only 19 of 74 shots. The
previous low was 27.9%, when Los Angeles made only 19 of 68 against
Detroit on Aug. 9, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   A sturdy defense, Sheryl Swoopes' 31 points and 16 points and 11
rebounds by rookie Michelle Snow, who replaced the injured Tina
Thompson in the lineup, propelled the Comets (23-7) to a victory that
gave them a half-game lead over the Sparks in the Western Conference
race and a decisive 2-1 edge in the season series between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   If Houston and Los Angeles wind up tied after the regular season,
the Comets will be the top-seeded team and have home-court advantage
in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   And home court is definitely an advantage for the Comets right
now. Since losing the season opener to the Sparks in May, Houston has
won 13 straight at home. That's where they will play their final two
games.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the most gutsy win I have ever seen," Houston Coach Van
Chancellor said. "We had incredible team play without Tina Thompson,
and Snow really stepped up in her first start."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks, who got 27 points from Mwadi Mabika and 19 points and
12 rebounds from Lisa Leslie, finish with three road games. If Los
Angeles is to defend its WNBA championship, it will have to find the
missing element in its game, and quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Michael Cooper thinks it is more than jump shots.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in trouble," Cooper said after the game. "I'm troubled
about our heart and desire to win. Every time a game has been on the
line for us this year, we haven't had the ability to win.</TE>
<TE>   "We're better than Houston athletically. But they did everything
they had to do to win. This [loss] was not a wakeup call; the wakeup
call was five losses ago. Swoopes said we only won last year because
she was hurt and I'm beginning to wonder if she's right. Houston
looks like it wants to take back the championship we won last year."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper didn't call out any names this time, but he would have had
plenty of options at which to point fingers.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie, Mabika and Latasha Byears were the only Sparks to make
more than one basket. DeLisha Milton (one for 13), Tamecka Dixon (one
for 11) and Nikki Teasley (one for eight) couldn't hit from outside.
And after Leslie fouled out with 3:16 to play, Mabika was the only
reliable shooter Los Angeles had on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Sparks got to the free-throw line 25 times, they
did not make enough efforts to drive to the basket and force the
Houston defense to foul.</TE>
<TE>   "Again, we settled for too many jump shots," Cooper said. "Houston
is a great defensive team. They'll give you the perimeter, and if you
miss the outside shot it just plays into their hands."</TE>
<TE>   The score was tied, 28-28, at halftime, and with 5:58 to play Los
Angeles took its last lead, 52-50, on a layup by Leslie. But the
Sparks would not make another field goal until Milton threw in her
only basket, a three-pointer, with 7.4 seconds left. By that time
Houston was ahead, 65-58.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks were left to sift through the ashes.</TE>
<TE>   "I do think we have the heart and desire," Leslie said. "We want
to win. But it seems so much harder at one end of the court than it
does the other."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very tough loss, especially when I didn't do anything
to contribute like I can," Dixon said. "But Houston had us on our
heels all night. They took it to us."</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't get any easier for the Sparks, who play at Utah
tonight. Perhaps they need to get away from Staples. After winning 28
consecutive games here, they have lost three of their last four.
Houston has beaten them here twice.</TE>
<TE>   Sophia Witherspoon said the team is not ready to quit. "It's not
over," she said. "And when the playoffs start everyone will be
zero-zero again."</TE>
<TE>   If something doesn't change for the Sparks, however, it won't be a
long postseason.</TE>

<HD>Could Dokic Be Great for Britain?</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Fifth-ranked player's father, unhappy with
treatment in native Yugoslavia, says she may move to England.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's amazing that England, a country with a proud tennis tradition,
can have no female players ranked in the top 100, then suddenly one
day, there's hope for potential glory.</LD>
<LD>   If Greg Rusedski can do it for the Brits, why not Jelena Dokic?</LD>
<LD>   The Canadian-born Rusedski had to make only one change, though,
gaining British citizenship in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   Dokic, 19, has already been something of a citizen of the world.
She was born in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, emigrated to Australia in 1994,
then moved back to Belgrade last year with a stop for training
purposes in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   What brought her wanderings into sharper focus Thursday were
comments this week in Yugoslavia by her often-controversial father,
Damir Dokic. He was apparently upset that Belgrade officials had not
provided a suitable location for a family mansion and tennis club.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had enough of everything," Damir Dokic told Vecernje
Novosti, a Belgrade newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to ... de-register Jelena. She will no longer be an
inhabitant of Belgrade. I will register her in England, to pay taxes
and everything else there."</TE>
<TE>   Jelena Dokic spent about as much time talking about that as she
spent on the court Thursday at the JPMorgan Chase Open at the
Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach. After 16 minutes, the
fourth-seeded Dokic led Janette Husarova of Slovakia, 4-0, when
Husarova retired because of a sprained lower right back. Today, Dokic
will play Rita Grande of Italy in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   In other third-round matches, No. 1 Serena Williams defeated No.
15 Nathalie Dechy of France, 6-2, 6-1, in 56 minutes; No. 3 Lindsay
Davenport beat Tatiana Panova of Russia, 6-2, 6-4; No. 12 Chanda
Rubin upset No. 8 Daja Bedanova of the Czech Republic, 6-2, 6-1, and
unseeded Eleni Daniilidou of Greece upset No. 10 Anne Kremer of
Luxembourg, 6-0, 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   In the night match, No. 2 Jennifer Capriati defeated Tamarine
Tanasugarn of Thailand, 6-3, 6-7 (3), 6-2, in 2 hours 9 minutes.
Capriati was pushed into the third set after losing the final four
points of the second-set tiebreaker. In the third, Capriati was
broken in the first game but broke right back.</TE>
<TE>   Tanasugarn did not hold serve once in the third set. Capriati, who
had laser eye surgery two years ago, had problems adjusting to the
lights. In particular, on her serve.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shanking even some balls on my groundstrokes," she said. "I
guess I had a little bit of a halo. I had my eyes done. They say
sometimes after a while, at night, the lights start to become really
bright. I feel like it's wearing off a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Dokic acknowledged that there had been discussions about a
possible move to England.</TE>
<TE>   "If it did happen, it would be a long thing," she said. "He has
some plans to do something. I don't know what it is. But not right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Would such a move be better for her?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Dokic said. "I'm hardly even at home wherever I
am. I don't think I have a home right now. Even if I was to be there,
maybe it would only be a few weeks a year."</TE>
<TE>   Dokic and her father seem to have no trouble packing up and
leaving when they perceive that matters aren't going to their
satisfaction. Jelena did not play the Australian Open this year after
losing to Davenport in the first round last year, when the family
said the draw was "fixed."</TE>
<TE>   Damir was taken off the grounds at Wimbledon in 2000 after
smashing a journalist's cell phone and was kicked out of the U.S.
Open a few months later after an incident regarding the price of
salmon in the players' restaurant. The WTA banned him from tour
events for six months in 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the family is considering another move.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure [Damir] has good reasons. We've had a lot of problems
there, a lot of trouble," Jelena said, without offering additional
details. "If he does something or if we do something, there's always
a good reason for that.... There's a lot of things that happen over
there, and a lot of not-so-good things for me."</TE>
<TE>   Dokic is ranked fifth in the world. The highest-ranking British
woman is Julie Pullin, No. 143.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   About the only problem Williams had was leaving the tiara she had
worn Wednesday in her hotel room. Dechy provided little opposition as
Williams broke her serve at love to take the first set, 6-2, on the
way to extending her winning streak to 21 matches.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is an aspiring actress. She said she is serious about it
but was laughing as she said it.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I'm a struggling actress. I'm trying to get some parts,"
she said. "A lot of people want me but my schedule right now is
conflicting with my acting. But I've been taking classes. I have a
new acting coach. I'm doing really well."</TE>
<TE>   Williams said she would like to star with Sean Connery, Anthony
Hopkins or Morgan Freeman. What role would she like to play?</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult to say with my time schedule," she said. "I'd have
to have a smaller role but I would like the movie to be all about me.
So maybe I can get hurt in the beginning of the movie and be in a
coma the whole time."</TE>

<HD>Hearn Missed Grand Farewell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How perfect would it have been for Chick Hearn to have announced that
last season was going to be his last behind a microphone?</LD>
<LD>   It would have been a grand farewell.</LD>
<LD>   "It would have been ideal," said longtime broadcast partner Stu
Lantz. "But we do not live in an idealistic world. Unfortunately, we
live in a realistic world."</LD>
<TE>   The outpouring Hearn received last season, when his
consecutive-games streak was ended by heart surgery, was tremendous.
So was the reception he got when he returned after a 56-game absence,
an absence extended by a fall in which he suffered a broken hip.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hearn's career as the Lakers' voice for 42 years did not
have the kind of closure one would have hoped for. There was no
farewell tour, no last time for Laker fans at Staples Center to let
Chick know how much he was loved, no final tribute for him to absorb.</TE>
<TE>   There would have been all that had he announced that last season
was his last, and he came close to doing that.</TE>
<TE>   I sat with Marge, his wife, at a game during the 2001 NBA
playoffs. The seat next to her was empty and as I walked by she
invited me to sit with her for a while. I did, and Chick picked right
up on it.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw you sitting with Marge," he said a couple of days later on
the phone. "I tried to wave but you never turned around."</TE>
<TE>   He never knew, though, what Marge and I were talking about. We
were plotting.</TE>
<TE>   She wanted Chick to announce that he was going to retire after one
more season. I wanted the story.</TE>
<TE>   We agreed that a farewell tour would be to his liking.</TE>
<TE>   During the NBA Finals that season, Chick and Marge invited me to
their home in Encino for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   After some small talk, I asked, "Have you thought about announcing
next season as your last?"</TE>
<TE>   Hearn glanced over at Marge.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what she wants me to do," he said. "But that's off the
record. Don't write that."</TE>
<TE>   So, our plan went up in smoke. There was not going to be any
retirement announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Marge didn't get what she wanted--an announced retirement--and I
didn't get my story.</TE>
<TE>   Going On Forever</TE>
<TE>   I asked Hearn about retirement a number of times over the years.
For a while, he said he'd retire when Magic Johnson did. But that
didn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   It was impossible to pin him down, even after his heart and
subsequent hip surgery. He acknowledged not long ago that he'd
probably never actually announce his retirement. He always wanted to
leave the door open.</TE>
<TE>   "What if I were to say next season is going to be my last, then at
the end of the season I decided I wanted to come back?" he asked.
"What would I do next?"</TE>
<TE>   He had Lantz convinced.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he'd go on forever," Lantz said. "I always thought he'd
still be announcing long after I was gone."</TE>
<TE>   Mystery Solved</TE>
<TE>   Besides retirement, Hearn's age was taboo. He kept it a secret for
years, then did an about-face after returning to work in April, when
he acknowledged he was 85.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of my age," he said at the time. "You put it in the
paper, so I might as well admit to it."</TE>
<TE>   The Memories</TE>
<TE>   I began going to Laker games at the Forum when I first came to Los
Angeles as a sportswriter for the old Herald Examiner in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   At the Forum, writers would gather in the Press Lounge after their
work was done. In those days, the Press Lounge really was a press
lounge. No Hollywood types, no hangers-on. And the press corps was a
small one, an intimate group. This was before cable television and
sports-talk radio.</TE>
<TE>   Chick and Marge were always there, and usually until the wee
hours. Chick would often step behind the bar and help the late Bill
Grainger pour drinks. Grainger really didn't need help, since there
were never that many people there.</TE>
<TE>   But behind the bar was the perfect spot for Chick to regale the
group. You might be the target of a jibe, the butt of a joke, but you
always laughed.</TE>
<TE>   Chick, icon that he was, really was just one of the guys. And he
loved it.</TE>
<TE>   Chick to the Rescue</TE>
<TE>   I didn't travel often with the Lakers, but I was with the team for
a playoff game in Chicago in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, I was getting on the team bus when a huge leg shot
out in front of the door, blocking my path.</TE>
<TE>   "Where do you think you're going, my man?" bellowed Wilt
Chamberlain, who as usual was sitting in the front row.</TE>
<TE>   "He's OK, Wilt," Chick said. "He's one of us."</TE>
<TE>   That was Chick, always making one feel he belonged.</TE>
<TE>   The Ultimate Team</TE>
<TE>   I probably interviewed Hearn at least 100 times, and chatted with
him informally hundreds more.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure he didn't like everything I wrote. I was particularly
hard on him when he announced a Raider preseason game for local
television, an assignment he'd had only a day or two to prepare for.
But not once can I remember him complaining.</TE>
<TE>   I remember only all the nice cards and notes from Chick and Marge,
thanking me for something I had written.</TE>
<TE>   The cards and notes were always signed by both. They did
everything together.</TE>
<TE>   Chick and Marge were a team--a great team.</TE>
<TE>   Tributes</TE>
<TE>   There will be a one-hour tribute, "Chick Hearn: a Life Behind the
Mic," on Fox Sports Net tonight at 7, with an encore showing on Fox
Sports Net 2 at 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Lantz and Paul Sunderland will serve as co-hosts. They'll be
joined in separate segments by Elgin Baylor and Tommy Hawkins,
followed by interviews with two of Hearn's former broadcast partners,
Lynn Shackelford and Keith Erickson.</TE>
<TE>   The special also includes interviews with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
Magic Johnson, Ann Meyers and many others.</TE>
<TE>   Channel 9 will have a one-hour tribute Sunday at 8 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The commercial-free special will be co-hosted by Alan Massengale
and Channel 9 pregame show commentator James Worthy. Guests will
include Jack Nicholson and other Laker fans from the entertainment
world.</TE>
<TE>   Another Tribute</TE>
<TE>   Bill Sharman, for one, points out that, besides being a
top-of-the-line broadcaster, Hearn also had a brilliant basketball
mind. In 1971-72, Sharman's first season as Laker coach, the team won
33 consecutive games, still an NBA record, and won its first
championship in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Chick had a lot to do with our success that season," Sharman
said. "I picked his brain a lot about players on other teams and how
they matched up with us. He was very helpful."</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   The Assn. of Volleyball Professionals is back on NBC for the first
time since 1997. The men's finals of the Michelob Light Manhattan
Beach Open will be televised live Sunday at 1 p.m. The second hour of
NBC's coverage will be taped coverage of the women's final
Saturday.... Mary Joe Fernandez and Pam Shriver, a recent inductee
into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, are the announcers for
ESPN's coverage of this weekend's JPMorgan Chase Open at Manhattan
Country Club in Manhattan Beach. ESPN2 will televise the first
semifinal match Saturday, delayed, at 7 p.m. Sunday's final will be
televised live on ESPN at 11:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   This week's Hall of Fame game, ABC's first "Monday Night Football"
telecast with Al Michaels and John Madden, got a 7.0 national Nielsen
rating. That's better than the 6.3 last year but below the 7.3 for
Dennis Miller's ABC debut two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Michaels, a guest of Chris Myers and Bob Golic on KMPC (1540), was
asked about the ratings.</TE>
<TE>   "TV ratings are like financial books of major corporations these
days," he said. "You don't know what is real and what you can
believe."</TE>

<HD>Old Friendship Is Paying Dividends</HD>
<DH>Prep baseball: Former major leaguer Eric Davis tries to
help Sapp become a standout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steven Sapp remembers those evenings as a young boy when he would tag
along with his dad to watch Eric Davis wow the Dodger Stadium crowd
with his blistering speed and powerful bat.</LD>
<LD>   OK, so Davis played for the Cincinnati Reds at the time and never
accomplished much in his two seasons with the Dodgers, but Sapp
didn't mind. He idolized the outfielder, whom his dad had known since
their Little League days together, becoming wide-eyed every time he
shook hands with the major leaguer who invited them to games.</LD>
<LD>   More than a decade later, it is Davis who has come to watch Sapp,
16, roam the outfield in the Area Code Baseball Games, a weeklong
tournament in Long Beach that features 250 of the top high school
baseball players from the United States and abroad. It concludes
Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Davis isn't making the trek from his home in Calabasas to Blair
Field as a favor to Sapp's father, Leonard. Davis comes to track the
progress of his protege after having spent much of the last year
training him one-on-one at baseball diamonds in Manhattan Beach and
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Steven has a lot of ability," said Davis, in his first year of
retirement after a 17-year major league career in which he batted
.269 with 282 home runs. "He has the right makeup and attitude. He
has an opportunity to be something special."</TE>
<TE>   All it took for Davis to volunteer his time was a phone call from
Leonard Sapp.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my idea for him to work out with Eric," the elder Sapp
said. "Who would be better to teach him than an actual pro?"</TE>
<TE>   After shaking off some initial jitters, the younger Sapp quickly
displayed his capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has taught Sapp everything from the mechanics of batting to
getting a good jump on a ball hit to the outfield during their one or
two sessions a week.</TE>
<TE>   "What I've tried to stress to Steven is that nine times out of 10,
it's not about athletic ability," Davis said. "It's about your mental
makeup. Everyone can play. What makes you a great player and stand
out is attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're facing Randy Johnson, you can't be intimidated. You
have to be strong mentally and believe in yourself. Not hoping I can,
but knowing I can."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-3, 190-pound Sapp plans to play for West Torrance High
after spending his first three years at Redondo. His training with
Davis could pay immediate dividends, West Torrance Coach Harry
Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most kids pay for private lessons and they don't have access to
major league baseball players," Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said his biggest responsibility is to make sure Sapp has his
priorities in order.</TE>
<TE>   That became evident last spring, when Sapp's grades slipped and he
was forced to sit out a large part of the baseball season. Davis
stayed on Sapp until he achieved a 3.5 grade-point average for his
final term of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "The academic side is the most important thing. He understands
that," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important advice I have given him is to make sure you
give yourself an opportunity to go to college and to never let anyone
tell you what you can or can't do."</TE>

<LD>The five geldings entered in tonight's $17,500 MCI California
Challenge have won 52 of 182 races and banked more than $750,000.</LD>
<LD>   And most of that winning has been done by Sign Of Lanty, the
longtime 870-yard king.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Jackie and Rod MacPherson and trained by John Cooper, the
California-bred son of The Signature has won 26 of 60 and has a
bankroll of nearly $441,000.</LD>
<TE>   Looking for his fourth victory in eight starts and his third in a
row in the California Challenge, Sign Of Lanty and jockey Alex
Bautista will break from the inside against Sterling Sport, who has
won five times; Heza Sand Trap, a 10-time winner; Diamond Cut
Diamond, who has won four races, and seven-time winner Chicks Charger
Easy.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. A Cover Story. 2. Vels Silent Charger. 3. Our Prince
John. 4. Murrieta Red. 5. Sheza Mighty Bobby. 6. Yes I'm No Fool. 7.
Willie Awesome. 8. Marmeta. 9. Sign Of Lanty. 10. Go Mr Revange.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Pennants Headlight, A Cover Story and Oh To Win in the
first, Vels Silent Charger and Greek Gus in the second, Our Prince
John and Top Elimator in the third and Murrieta Red and Ripped Fuel
in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shot in the dark: Kalki chased the runaway winner in his last
outing and gamely saved the place at 72-1 and could be dangerous in
the sixth if able to run two alike.</TE>

<TE>   Record vs. Starzz--2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Sparks are coming off an emotional 67-64 loss to
Houston Thursday night, and first place in the Western Conference is
still to be decided. Last year Utah ended Los Angeles' league-record
18-game winning streak at the end of the season in the Delta Center.
The Starzz are locked in third place; even if they tie Los Angeles in
the standings, the Sparks won the season series and own the
tiebreaker. The Starzz end the regular season with games Sunday at
Seattle and Monday against Sacramento, then wait to see who they will
host in the opening game of the first playoff round.</TE>

<LD>Chamique Holdsclaw scored 22 points and Coco Miller added 16 as the
Washington Mystics beat the New York Liberty, 65-54, on Thursday
night at New York to end a seven-game losing streak.</LD>
<LD>   "They started our losing streak, and we ended it here," said
Holdsclaw, who missed the July loss to New York that started the
streak because of a sprained ankle. "This is how we wanted it.
Everything is a test. We've been tested, and we persevered."</LD>
<LD>   The Mystics (16-13) moved a game behind the first-place Liberty
(17-12) in the Eastern Conference, and both teams clinched playoff
spots.</LD>
<TE>   Sacramento 82, Orlando 72--Kedra Holland-Corn scored 20 points and
Yolanda Griffith added 18 points for the Monarchs at Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy Palmer led Orlando with 17 points as the Miracle dropped a
half-game behind Indiana with two games left in the race for the
fourth and final Eastern Conference playoff spot.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-place Indiana holds the tiebreaker over the Miracle.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento, which won for the ninth time in 11 games to improve to
12-17, is out of the Western Conference playoff race.</TE>
