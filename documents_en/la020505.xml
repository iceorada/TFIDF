<HD>Associate of Anne Frank's Father Suspected of Betrayal</HD>
<DH>History: The man, condemned as anti-Semitic even by his own
relatives, had done business with Otto Frank before and during World
War II.</DH>

<DL>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands</DL>
<LD>The enduring mystery of the Anne Frank story is, who betrayed her to
the Nazis?</LD>
<LD>   Anne and her family hid for 25 months in a canal-side warehouse in
central Amsterdam, where the teenager wrote her thoughts, yearnings
and descriptions of life in the cramped annex into notebooks.</LD>
<LD>   First published in English in 1952 as "The Diary of a Young Girl"
and later as a stage play and film, her story made her a symbol both
of the Holocaust and of Dutch bravery.</LD>
<TE>   On a warm summer day in 1944, four German and Dutch security
police pulled up to the warehouse at 263 Prinsengracht and asked the
employee, Willem Van Maaren, where the Jews were hiding. Van Maaren
pointed up the stairs, but the police already seemed to know exactly
where to go.</TE>
<TE>   Hours earlier, Karl Josef Silberbauer, the Austrian commander of
the squad, received a phone call from the head of the Amsterdam
security police who said eight Jews were hiding in the warehouse.</TE>
<TE>   Who tipped them off?</TE>
<TE>   For more than 20 years, employee Van Maaren was the main suspect.
A petty thief and unsavory braggart, Van Maaren was investigated
shortly after the war, but nothing was proved.</TE>
<TE>   The case was reopened in 1963 after Austrian Nazi hunter Simon
Wiesenthal located Silberbauer on the Vienna police force. But the
evidence against Van Maaren remained inconclusive, and he died in
1971 professing his innocence. Historians made no further headway.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a biographer of Anne Frank has published a new theory that
has intrigued the nation and revived a dark chapter in Dutch history:
the failure to protect Jewish citizens from the genocidal Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100,000 Dutch Jews--70% of the community, and
proportionally more than in any other European country--were deported
to concentration camps in Germany. Most were gassed with brutal
assembly-line efficiency. Anne died of typhus in Bergen-Belsen in the
spring of 1945, just weeks before the camp was liberated.</TE>
<TE>   The book by Carol Ann Lee, a British author living in Amsterdam,
says the likely informant was a former business associate of Otto
Frank, Anne's father and the only family member who survived the war.
His name was Anton Ahlers.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at his files in The Hague because after the war he was
convicted of betraying people and he was jailed," Lee said in an
interview for a Dutch television documentary. "Everyone, including
his own family, condemned him as distinctly anti-Jewish and a
thoroughly unpleasant character."</TE>
<TE>   The Netherlands Institute for War Documentation, the group of
researchers that published the authoritative version of the diary and
the caretaker of the Frank papers, said Ahlers had not been a suspect
until Lee started probing his background for her book, "The Hidden
Life of Otto Frank," published in March.</TE>
<TE>   But David Barnouw, a researcher and spokesman of the
government-financed historical institute, said Lee's case sounded
credible enough for the institute to reopen its investigation into
the betrayal. "We are interested, that's for sure," he said. Lee "has
no proof, but I can imagine this was the case."</TE>
<TE>   Barnouw said that he and another colleague will review old files
and testimony for new revelations. "Sometimes you can go through the
same material with fresh eyes," he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Bosboom of the Anne Frank Foundation, which maintains the
house where Anne hid, said Lee's theory is plausible. "But it's still
only a theory. The proof is not final. It probably never will be,"
she said. "It's been such a long time, and most of the people who
knew are dead."</TE>
<TE>   Lee says Ahlers not only turned in the Frank family, but also may
have blackmailed Otto Frank for years after the war, receiving
payment for his silence about Frank's business with Nazi Germany at
the beginning of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The German-born Frank, who moved to Holland in 1933, ran a
spice-trading company that sold goods to the Wehrmacht, the German
army. The business continued to operate while the Franks were in
hiding, although it apparently was no longer trading with the
Germans.</TE>
<TE>   When Frank returned from Auschwitz in 1945, having lost his wife
and two daughters, he may have feared that his company would be
confiscated if his prewar business with Germany became known.</TE>
<TE>   Lee says among the four men who raided the Prinsengracht warehouse
on Aug. 4, 1944, was Maarten Kuiper, a Dutch policeman who was a
friend of Ahlers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he actually made the call. I think he got the information
from Ahlers," Lee said. "They were friends. Ahlers had so much
information on Otto Frank. Maarten Kuiper was one of the major
betrayers of Jews in hiding during that time."</TE>
<TE>   Lee said Ahlers probably decided to tip off the authorities after
his own company slid into bankruptcy and he no longer needed to do
business with Frank.</TE>
<TE>   "Otto Frank was of no more use to him in that sense, so he
betrayed them," Lee said in the television interview. "He may have
got money for it. Certainly, Maarten Kuiper received money for the
betrayals he made."</TE>
<TE>   The Germans were paying a bounty of 40 guilders per head, which
was "a large amount in those days," she said. Anne, her sister and
parents were caught in the two-story annex with Hermann van Pels, who
had worked in Frank's company, with van Pels' wife and teenage son,
and with Friedrich Pfeffer, a dentist.</TE>
<TE>   After Lee's book was published, Ahlers' son was quoted as saying
that he is convinced her theory is true.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt he did it," Anton Ahlers Jr. told the Volkskrant
newspaper. Ahlers said he believes that his father received money
from Frank because the flow of funds stopped when Frank died in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Barnouw, the historian, said the blackmail supposition is thin.
"There's no smoking gun, and the theory has too many loose ends," he
said. He also doubted the Ahlers family, saying they simply may be
seeking notoriety.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Lee's book "is interesting because it takes a more
balanced view of Otto Frank," Barnouw said. "After the play and the
book, Otto Frank was kind of like a saint. In this book, he's much
more flesh and blood."</TE>

<HD>Media Blitz: Family in Need Flexes Its Quads</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ROXANA HEGEMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WICHITA, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Weeks before their birth, the Tetrick quadruplets already had their
very own professionally designed logo. And Web site. And advertising
agency.</LD>
<LD>   Before tiny Peyton, Parker, Camden and Christian--rare two sets of
identical twins--entered the world, their parents were part of an
unusual public relations blitz that portrays the joy of a suddenly
large family and the distress of the financial burden caused, in
part, by a father's military activation.</LD>
<LD>   Christina and Patrick Tetrick hired Lottridge Advertising of
Wichita to solicit donations from local and national corporations,
and to arrange media interviews.</LD>
<TE>   Their goal is simple: Use the rarity of having two sets of
identical twins--without fertility drugs, no less--the more general
oddity of having quadruplets and the father's plight as promotional
tools to lure advertisers and help the family stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   Across town at Via Christi Medical Center, Sondra and Eldon
Headrick were also dealing with the media frenzy generated by the
birth of sextuplets, one day after the Tetrick boys were born April
5. The Headricks, who did use fertility drugs, said they would not
hire an ad agency.</TE>
<TE>   Commotion over multiple births isn't new. Generous neighbors and
firms often help newly enlarged families with room additions,
outfitted minivans and months--or years--of diaper supplies.</TE>
<TE>   But those offering help usually seek out the family in need,
making the Tetricks' effort an interesting twist. "We are not
interested in making money out of our kids," Christina Tetrick said.
"We are just interested in keeping our house."</TE>
<TE>   The couple bought a two-bedroom home just days before learning
they would have quadruplets. (Doctors said the odds of having two
sets of identical twins are 1 in 25 million.)</TE>
<TE>   Their income, meanwhile, has dropped by 60%, they say. Christina,
formerly employed as a construction engineer, can't work while
rearing four infants, and Patrick has had to take a leave from his
regular job because his Army Reserve unit has been activated as part
of Operation Enduring Freedom, and his military pay is less than his
civilian salary.</TE>
<TE>   So the Tetricks hired Lottridge, and a media campaign was born:</TE>
<TE>   * Hundreds of buttons bearing the babies' red, white and blue
logo--four tiny footprints forming a circle around a star--were
printed and handed out to hospital staff, family, friends and others.</TE>
<TE>   * The logo was printed on cigar bands and put around 75 blue
bubble-gum cigars, many given to reporters at a news conference. Even
the press passes carried the logo.</TE>
<TE>   * The Web site is a splash of red, white and blue, with pictures
of the children and their latest news. One graphic features four tiny
babies and Mom, joined by what looks like a soldier carrying a rifle.</TE>
<TE>   * After their birth, the ad agency ordered 70 T-shirts to
distribute to the doctors and nurses as well as the soldiers in Dad's
Reserve unit. "Welcome the Tetrick Quadruplets," the shirts say,
complete with their birth date and names.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was a nice little gesture, something that hadn't
happened before--something to give to people who have given so much
time and energy," said Jerry Pierce of Lottridge Advertising.</TE>
<TE>   At the Assn. of American Advertising Agencies in New York City,
editorial assistant Earnie Stevenson pulled up the Tetricks' Web
site. He said it surprised him, as did the parents' hiring an ad
agency. "I've never heard of it," he said. "Historically, I remember
with births of quintuplets what usually happens is advertisers
approach them and corporations donate diapers. But I'm not aware of
parents actually going out and seeking sponsorship."</TE>
<TE>   Pierce acknowledged that Lottridge has received "a little bit of
flak" about its involvement, but he said all the promotional items
were donated to the family by the agency. "They are concerned about
honest-to-goodness keeping the lights on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency had said before the birth that it was "investing" in
the family, and that it hoped one day to get paid by finding product
endorsements that would also help the Tetricks meet the cost of
rearing the quads.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people should judge--without being in the
position," Christina Tetrick said.</TE>
<TE>   As both sets of parents await the day their children come
home--all the babies are expected to stay in the hospital for about a
month--each is dealing with the financial aftermath in different
ways.</TE>
<TE>   For the Headrick sextuplets, the hospital's foundation is handling
donations to help the family. Among them are $6,000 worth of breast
milk, offers of baby-care products for a year, car seats, diapers,
and blankets from a Wichita woman. About $1,000 in unsolicited cash
donations have arrived.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Tetricks, the agency has secured a leased van and four
car seats from a local car dealership. It's also working on a
shopping spree for other items.</TE>
<TE>   The Tetricks also received a donation of storage for the babies'
umbilical cord blood for the next 18 years from Cord Blood Banking of
San Bruno, Calif. Cord blood is rich in stem cells, which could be
valuable if the babies ever developed cancer, leukemia or certain
other diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The Tetricks have established a Quad Fund at a local bank, with a
toll-free phone number for donations. Pierce was uncertain about the
amount of donations made to the fund so far, but said they were not
substantial.</TE>
<TE>   His agency is trying to get as much media exposure as possible for
the quadruplets, but the parents ultimately will decide what they
will or won't do.</TE>
<TE>   Christina Tetrick said she decided against hiring an agent after
the agency she initially contacted wanted her to bring the children
to California to do ads while they were still less than a year old.
She does not plan to put her children in ads while they are so young.</TE>
<TE>   In return for donating the van to the family, Christina and
Patrick have appeared in ads for the car dealership, which is
mentioned on the quadruplets' Web page.</TE>
<TE>   "With exposure and notoriety, it will attract advertisers. Right
now, they are so small as far as getting involved with corporate
sponsors," Pierce said.</TE>
<TE>   What's more important, he said, is that the babies will eventually
need an education. "The family needs privacy, but they also need
help--and there is a very fine line between them," he said.</TE>

<HD>Researchers Suspect Bats May be Source of Brain Ailment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Scientists have long sought to understand a horrific brain disease
that once devastated the native people of Guam--Lou Gehrig's,
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's symptoms rolled into one.</LD>
<LD>   Now two researchers have uncovered clues that suggest a Chamorro
dietary tradition--eating a type of bat that feeds on neurotoxic
plants--might be behind the mystery illness.</LD>
<LD>   It's circumstantial evidence so far. But if the new theory is
proved right, it could be more than another dismal discovery that
diet can wreck the human brain. Understanding the Guam disease may
help uncover novel ways to treat regular Lou Gehrig's, Alzheimer's or
Parkinson's diseases.</LD>
<TE>   The theory, published recently in the journal Neurology, turns on
the principle that changing economies can have an impact on disease.
The brain disease peaked after World War II brought guns and cash to
Guam, spurring commercial hunting until the bats neared
extinction--and then the human disease in turn rapidly waned, said
ethnobotanist Paul Alan Cox, who studies how indigenous people relate
to their environment.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very good news, of course, for the Chamorrons ... but
neuropathologists thought they were losing the opportunity to
understand the potential linkage" between the three diseases, said
Cox, director of the National Tropical Botanical Garden in Hawaii. He
co-wrote the article with neurologist Oliver Sacks of New York's
Albert Einstein College of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Their hypothesis is "very interesting," said Diane Murphy, chief
of neurodegenerative research at the National Institutes of Health.
"Anything that sheds light on the pathological process in that
disease potentially gives you places you could intervene with
therapeutics."</TE>
<TE>   The Chamorro disease is a mix of the slow paralysis of Lou
Gehrig's disease (known medically as ALS), the tremors of
Parkinson's, and dementia. Dubbed ALS-PDC, it occurred at rates more
than a hundred times greater than regular ALS elsewhere, and was
almost completely confined to Chamorro people who followed
traditional cultural practices.</TE>
<TE>   Theories abounded. Water contamination and lack of nutrients were
ruled out. No suspicious genes have been found.</TE>
<TE>   The leading theory turned on cycads, a plant found throughout the
tropics whose seeds native populations have long known were
poisonous. The Chamorro repeatedly washed the seeds to detoxify them
and then mashed them into flour. Toxicologist Peter Spencer of Oregon
Health and Science University says they still got enough toxin to
build up over time. But Cox and NIH's Murphy say animal studies
failed to prove that flour alone was the culprit.</TE>
<TE>   Cox's theory is biomagnification: maybe people became ill by
eating large bats that ate lots of toxin and stored it in their fat.
A single two-pound bat can eat up to 2 1/2 times its weight a night
in plants, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bat consumption had been largely ceremonial until commercial
hunting began after World War II, Cox said. Then a bat population
once estimated at 60,000 began to plummet. By the 1970s, one Guam
species was extinct and the remaining one was endangered. Guam began
importing bat meat from Samoa--where there are no cycads, Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   Rates of ALS-PDC mirrored the change, he argued: In 1956, there
were 308 cases of the brain disease per 100,000 people, but just 22
cases per 100,000 by 1985. Today, no one born after 1960 seems to get
it, and men--who traditionally ate more bat--got ill more than women,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer, author of the cycad flour theory, is skeptical. "It would
be surprising if consumption of such a delicacy proved to be a more
important source of exposure to cycad toxins than what was formerly
daily use" of the flour.</TE>
<TE>   But Cox says that mercury-tainted fish, PCB-tainted whale meat and
mad cow disease-tainted beef have all caused brain diseases--and that
it's important to know if bats eating a natural toxin could too.</TE>

<HD>Bibles Chart County's Family Tree</HD>
<DH>History: A Maryland library is archiving personal pages
containing births, deaths and other information.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID DISHNEAU</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HAGERSTOWN, Md.</DL>
<LD>The history of Bob and Jean Beck's family is written in their Bible,
on a few yellowed pages between the Old and New Testaments.</LD>
<LD>   "Mother Beck," it begins. "Susanna Miller was born May the 30,
1793."</LD>
<LD>   Subsequent entries cover generations of births, deaths and
marriages, ending with the wedding of their daughter, Jeanne, in
1999.</LD>
<TE>   This cherished handwritten record of a family is now a public
treasure too. The Becks are among hundreds of area families who have
had their Bible pages photocopied and placed on file at the
Washington County Free Library for genealogical studies.</TE>
<TE>   Genealogy experts say the project is a rare and unusually
well-organized effort to create a public repository of such material.
Many of the nation's private genealogy societies also have collected
such material, said Russell Henderson, spokesman for the National
Genealogical Society in Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of those old family Bibles are better records than anything
else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Maryland, systematic public recording of births and deaths did
not exist before 1898 in counties and 1875 in the city of Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, I don't know of any other project like it," said Nancy
Bramucci, director of special collections at the Maryland State
Archives. "I actually thought about doing the same thing at one point
because it really would be a valuable resource, but it was just more
than I could do."</TE>
<TE>   The library in downtown Hagerstown has been copying family records
from Bibles since 1968 and now has 400 to 500 such files. This year,
the library is using a grant from a private estate to begin compiling
and indexing the records.</TE>
<TE>   "When this is all completed, it will be a capitulation of vital
statistics from all those Bibles," said John Frye, director of the
institution's Western Maryland Room.</TE>
<TE>   Large, hardcover Bibles often contain a handful of blank middle
pages for recording important family events. Those entries, along
with church records of christenings, weddings and burials, can prove
invaluable in documenting early Maryland life, said R.J. Rockefeller,
the state archives' director of reference services.</TE>
<TE>   "If you know a woman had five children and that she died the same
day as the birth of her fifth child, and from that same family Bible
you know that only two of those children lived to adulthood, then you
know how hard life was in early America," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Historians have long recognized the value of Bible records, but
compiling them has been problematic.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes some central management, which is not always possible,"
Rockefeller said. "The Washington County library project is so
significant because it will give an institutional framework for the
project."</TE>
<TE>   Henderson said advances in digital scanner technology promise to
make Bible record-keeping less cumbersome. The improvements make it
practical to scan even large pages of handwritten material into
electronic files, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The interesting thing about Bible records that makes them unique
is that it might be the Henderson Bible, but it will have Joneses and
Smiths and everybody else in it as people marry into the family," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The two Beck family Bibles list Becks, Bakers, Middlekaufs,
Ellsworths--some of the most common names in the local telephone
book.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're related to everyone in the whole town," said Jean
Beck, who married into the family after moving to Hagerstown from
Baltimore in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   The clan included farmers, musicians, saloonkeepers, tailors and
dry cleaners, as well as the builder of an early mansion, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Beck, a retired Hagerstown businessman whose family goes back
five generations in the area, said he liked the idea of preserving
the Bible records for posterity.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was great that someone was doing that," he said.
"And we thought that if anybody was looking for it, we'd be happy to
add to it."</TE>

<HD>For More Dough, Crustless Bread</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Look ma, no crusts.</LD>
<LD>   Sara Lee wants to take over a duty moms have carried out for kids
for decades--slicing the crusts off white bread.</LD>
<LD>   The consumer-goods giant is touting its new IronKids Crustless
Bread as a fresh-from-the-oven idea.</LD>
<TE>   The product, being introduced at the supermarket industry's annual
convention in Chicago starting this weekend, will be a bit of an
upper-crust loaf.</TE>
<TE>   Sara Lee is selling it for about 75 cents more than crusted bread,
or $2.59 to $3.39 for a 16-ounce loaf, depending on the market.</TE>
<TE>   In an era when convenience tops U.S. shopping lists, Sara Lee
figures enough consumers will turn over the extra dough. It's
spending nearly $10 million to roll it out, making it the bakery
group's biggest product launch yet.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers told us they'd be willing to pay a premium for this
product," said Matt Hall of the St. Louis-based Sara Lee Bakery
Group. "Twenty years ago, they probably wouldn't have paid for it."</TE>
<TE>   A similar product that Sara Lee introduced in Spain in 1999 has
generated stellar sales.</TE>
<TE>   The fastest-growing area of the $5.6-billion bread industry is the
super-premium segment, encompassing everything from French-style to
roasted garlic to rosemary and olive oil bread.</TE>
<TE>   Sara Lee acquired IronKids--a leading brand of white bread that
advertises itself as having the fiber of whole-wheat bread--when it
bought Earthgrains last year. The deal made the company the nation's
second-biggest fresh-bread maker.</TE>
<TE>   Crustless Bread is made at its bakery in Paris, Texas, where
crusts are removed by an automated slicer.</TE>
<TE>   Baking pans are larger and cooling time is twice as long as normal
in the "decrusting room." The rejected crusts are used for croutons,
bread crumbs and other products.</TE>
<TE>   The product is now available in the South, Midwest and Arizona and
will be stocked by July throughout Sara Lee's fresh-bread system,
which covers all U.S. regions but the Northeast and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't rocket science--but it's a good idea," said analyst
John McMillin of Prudential Securities.</TE>

<HD>Baby Orangutans, Rare Tigers Just Part of Inventory</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Indonesia's black market peddles endangered
species without pity. Dwindling habitat also contributes to the
animals' decline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Peering out from a filthy cage filled with animal droppings and
rotting food, the siamang gibbon stretches out a long black hairy arm
to grab a banana offered by one of the four men who keep it
imprisoned while they search for a buyer.</LD>
<LD>   These animal traders are part of an illegal multimillion-dollar
business in Indonesia, which has more endangered primates, including
the siamang gibbon, than any other country. Animal rights activists
say Jakarta's Pramuka Market--a five-minute walk from where the
siamang gibbon is held in a ramshackle house stacked with cages--is
Asia's largest black market for rare animals.</LD>
<LD>   "You want baby orangutans?" said a market vendor who identified
himself only as Iwan. "How about a siamang gibbon? Better be quick,
I've sold five already today.</LD>
<TE>   "If there is anything you want, we can get it for you," Iwan
added.</TE>
<TE>   The total value of Indonesia's illegal animal trade is unknown,
but animal activists say hundreds of creatures are sold each month
despite their protection under the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for rare animals is great; they are sold as pets or
valuable collectors' items and for use as food or medicine. Typical
is the siamang, the largest of the gibbon apes, with long arms for
swinging in trees. The cute siamang babies are popular as pets, but
owners often abandon the full-grown animals, which can be 3 feet tall
and have a piercing cry.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say a shrinking habitat also threatens
Indonesia's rare species. The lush forests are rapidly disappearing
due to urban expansion and uncontrolled logging.</TE>
<TE>   Often the wild animals wind up at the Pramuka Market, which covers
an area the size of a football field in East Jakarta. Established in
1967 as a bird market, it has sold all manner of creatures since the
1980s. Overlooking it is a remnant of failed campaigns to combat the
illegal trade--a faded billboard threatening sellers and buyers of
endangered animals with five years' imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   Market officials insist that there are no illegal sales of
animals, but shady transactions regularly take place in the market's
back alleys.</TE>
<TE>   "The illegal trade of endangered animals is rampant here," said
Will Smith, an activist with the Liechtenstein-based Gibbon
Foundation, which focuses on Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Department stores display jewelry and knickknacks fashioned from
giant turtles and elephants' tusks, and hawkers approach drivers at
busy downtown intersections, offering terrified animals like the
cuscus, a small marsupial, for as little as $25.</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers and online media sites publish classified ads under
"collector's items," offering rare animals or just parts of them.</TE>
<TE>   A stuffed Sumatran tiger carries one of the largest price tags,
about $2,500. Even pieces of this magnificent creature are for
sale--tiger's penises are sold as aphrodisiacs, and ground-up bones,
claws and teeth go into traditional Chinese remedies for arthritis
and rheumatism.</TE>
<TE>   The World Wide Fund for Nature Indonesia is planning a major
campaign starting this month to raise awareness of endangered
animals, focusing on the plight of the tigers along with orangutans
and rhinoceroses.</TE>
<TE>   The fund says an average of 33 Sumatran tigers are killed every
year and the species could become extinct by 2010. The Javan rhino,
once abundant in Southeast Asia, is on the critically endangered
list. Hunters slaughter it merely for its horn, a valued ingredient
in Oriental medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than 20,000 orangutans are left in Indonesia because
hundreds of the orange-haired apes are smuggled each year to the
United States and other industrialized countries, where they fetch up
to $30,000. Baby orangutans are the most popular--and the most
vulnerable. Smugglers usually ship five babies together, sedated in a
cardboard box, to ensure that at least one survives the long, arduous
journey by boat.</TE>
<TE>   Chairul Saleh, a senior campaigner for the nature fund, said the
new campaign of information about rare species must go beyond the
usual cooperation with authorities to catch smugglers.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to cut off the trade from the consumer side," he said.
"We want to make endangered animals deeply unfashionable."</TE>

<HD>Benefactors See a Way to Give Gift of Sight</HD>
<DH>Medicine: Doctors replace cornea of blind Mexican boy, and
for the first time Israel Cortez sees the world in crisp detail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SETH HETTENA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ENSENADA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>On a gray April morning, a Mexican boy and his mother sit in a
doctor's office in San Diego. A bandage covers the boy's left eye.
His right eye, as blue as the deep ocean, has a vacant look.</LD>
<LD>   A birth defect left the 16-year-old unable to see much beyond a
few inches. His corneas, the clear tissue at the front of his eyes,
are clouded over. It's as though Israel Cortez Guzman always looks at
the world through a dirty, frosted window pane.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the doctor tells him, that may change. Just 24 hours
earlier, surgeons removed the diseased cornea in Israel's left eye
and replaced it with a healthy, donated cornea. There's a small
chance that the procedure will improve his vision significantly. If
it works, the doctor will peel back the bandage and, for the first
time, Israel may see beyond a few inches.</LD>
<TE>   It's a day that Israel and his mother, 46-year-old Francisca
Guzman, have long prayed for. The shy boy with coffee-colored skin
and a warm, toothy smile wants to be able to work and help his
mother, who has raised Israel on her own. He loves machines, and
dreams of working with computers.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to do what other people can do," Israel says.</TE>
<TE>   Had Israel been born in the United States, his defect likely would
have been quickly identified and corrected. But he was born in rural
Mexico, and his defect has cost him much more than sight.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's eyes clouded over at birth, giving them an unearthly blue
hue. His father, who owned land in the poor southern state of Oaxaca,
thought there was only one way that a blue-eyed child could come from
two brown-eyed parents.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't my son," Francisca says he told her.</TE>
<TE>   He accused her of infidelity. Francisca says he beat her. When
Israel was a year old, he kicked her out of the house. She had no
money and no job--and Israel and his 5-year-old brother, Angel, to
support.</TE>
<TE>   "We had nothing," Francisca says. "Only a change of clothing."</TE>
<TE>   She left Angel with her parents in Oaxaca and headed north with
Israel to the Pacific port town of Ensenada. She rented a room, awoke
at 4 a.m. each day to make tamales and tortillas, strapped Israel to
her back and walked door to door peddling the goods to her neighbors.
She barely earned enough to eat.</TE>
<TE>   Francisca first noticed there was something wrong with her son's
eyes after his third birthday. When she dropped an object, Israel had
trouble finding it. The boy was sensitive to light, his mother said,
so much so that tears would flow from his eyes and stain his shirt.</TE>
<TE>   He could see his hand held close to his face, but everything
around it was a blur. In school, he struggled to read, holding books
inches from his eyes. His classmates teased him mercilessly.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm never going to see," he would tell his mother, crying. "I
don't want to live this way for the rest of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors call it congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy. The
endothelial cells that pump out fluid from the cornea don't work
properly. Fluid backs up in the corneas, like a clogged drain, and
they sometimes grow painfully swollen.</TE>
<TE>   The condition is so rare that a review of medical literature
doesn't spell out how often it occurs, said Dr. Janine Smith of the
National Eye Institute in Bethesda, Md. "The really horrifying thing
about this disease is it's completely treatable with corneal
transplants," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   But if it's not caught before age 9, the child's brain-eye
connections don't develop properly, and even a transplant is unlikely
to fully restore vision.</TE>
<TE>   Francisca desperately wanted her son to see. Doctors in Ensenada
told her a corneal transplant would cost $6,000--far beyond her
means.</TE>
<TE>   She had given up hope, she said, but then Israel came home one day
last year with an exciting story. Doctors from the local child
welfare agency had visited his school and examined him. They told him
his eyes could be fixed.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Mexican doctors brought Israel to an eye clinic in
the border city of Tecate, run one weekend a month by volunteer
physicians, nurses and others from San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's exam revealed that his eyes were relatively healthy and
might respond well to a corneal transplant--a procedure done about
45,000 times a year in the United States. At the clinic, Israel won
over a strong ally: nurse Cindy Fulton. A 12-year veteran of
humanitarian medicine, Fulton said she noticed Israel waiting
patiently for his turn to be examined, staring at nothing. Taken with
the sweet, shy teen-ager, she put her connections to use to help him.</TE>
<TE>   Things came together quickly. The doctor she works for, Tommy
Korn, agreed to do the surgery at no charge. Fresh Start, a charity
that provides cosmetic surgery for deformed children, offered its
operating facility. Another doctor lined up the powerful microscopes
and surgical tools needed.</TE>
<TE>   During the surgery in the San Diego suburb of Encinitas, Korn uses
a trephine, an instrument like a cookie cutter, to remove Israel's
cloudy cornea. It's replaced with a healthy one donated by the San
Diego Eye Bank. Korn sews it in place with fine thread, thinner than
a human hair. The whole procedure, which goes flawlessly, takes about
90 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   No surgery is without risk. A small number of eye surgery patients
develop complications such as glaucoma, infection, a damaged retina
or bleeding. A bigger concern, however, is whether Israel is too old.
His brain may not be able to process the clearer images his improved
eye will send it.</TE>
<TE>   Korn gives the operation a 20% chance of success. He allows
Israel's eye one day to recover before checking the results. It's
like opening presents on Christmas Day, he says. You don't know what
to expect.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Israel arrives early in Korn's aseptic waiting
room.</TE>
<TE>   Korn walks into the waiting room and greets Israel. With little
delay, he peels away the bandage over the boy's eye.</TE>
<TE>   "Open a little," the doctor tells Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The boy peers out through his new cornea. Tears stream from his
left eye as the lid blinks over a cornea encircled with sutures. The
eye is no longer blue.</TE>
<TE>   Israel's face lights up.</TE>
<TE>   "Much better?" Korn asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Israel says.</TE>
<TE>   Korn runs some tests. For the first time, Israel sees the world in
crisp detail. The vision in his left eye improved more than twofold,
and he is no longer considered legally blind. Korn is very satisfied.
"I'm very optimistic he should lead a normal, healthy life," Korn
says.</TE>
<TE>   As Korn makes plans to operate on the other eye in a few months,
Israel starts crying again, this time, from emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Fulton shakes her head in amazement.</TE>
<TE>   "The boy can see," she says.</TE>

<DH>Culture: The remains of an African woman exploited two
centuries ago are returned home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOPHIE TETREL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Nearly two centuries after she was taken to Europe, sold to an animal
trainer and exhibited naked like a circus freak, an African woman has
finally regained some of her stolen dignity.</LD>
<LD>   Saartjie Baartman's skeleton and bottled organs--long stored at a
French natural history museum--were turned over to South African
officials last week at a ceremony in Paris. The event was the
culmination of years of requests by countrymen who wanted to bring
her home.</LD>
<LD>   Drummers beat on marimbas and young women in face paint and
African garb sang gospel songs at the ceremony at the South African
embassy. Officials had draped a white wooden box containing
Baartman's remains with a jewel-toned African cloth.</LD>
<TE>   Thuthukile Skweyiya, South Africa's ambassador to France, said
Baartman has become a symbol in her native country, "the symbol of a
nation's need to confront and acknowledge its past, and of a nation's
overwhelming desire to restore and reaffirm dignity and honor to all
its people."</TE>
<TE>   Baartman has also been a symbol of the cruelty of racism, sexism
and colonialism.</TE>
<TE>   She was called the "Hottentot Venus," a derogatory reference both
to her roots and to her large buttocks and sexual organs, which made
her the subject of crude fascination. Baartman was brought to Europe
in the early 19th century, and likely believed that she would make
her fortune there.</TE>
<TE>   But Baartman died in poverty in 1816, after being exhibited in
London and Paris as a curiosity for six years.</TE>
<TE>   During shows in London, she was ordered to emerge from a cage like
a wild beast. In Paris, she was sold to an animal trainer. She also
was paraded before high society at balls, and once was dressed only
in feathers.</TE>
<TE>   After Baartman's death, a famous surgeon made a cast of her body,
dissected her and conserved her brain and genitalia in bottles of
formaldehyde.</TE>
<TE>   The painted plaster cast of Baartman's body was displayed in
Paris' Musee de l'Homme until 1974, when it was stashed in a back
room along with her remains.</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of apartheid, Khoisan people--South Africa's first
inhabitants--have been searching for their lost heritage and wanted
to get their native daughter back.</TE>
<TE>   Former South African President Nelson Mandela brought up the
subject of Baartman in 1994 during an official visit by former French
President Francois Mitterrand.</TE>
<TE>   But the return of Baartman's remains raised difficult questions in
France, including whether it would set a precedent for countries
seeking the return of artifacts. It was only this year that French
lawmakers voted to return the remains to South Africa, with one
prominent deputy calling it a "duty of memory."</TE>
<TE>   French Research Minister Roger-Gerard Schwartzenberg said France
is "willing to return human remains to every country that asks,"
because human remains cannot be state property.</TE>
<TE>   Baartman's remains, as well as the cast of her body, are to be
stored in a South African military hangar until a funeral is
organized in August or September.</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Back in high school, the only people Jean Kahler knew who played
guitar were guys. They weren't very good, she says, but they were
their own little club.</LD>
<LD>   Then, sometime in college, "there started to be a cool girlie
guitar thing," says Kahler, a 23-year-old Chicagoan who started
guitar lessons two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Now, an instrument once associated with such male rock pioneers as
Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Carlos Santana is getting lots of
interest from young women and girls. And guitar makers are taking
note.</LD>
<TE>   "The tide is starting to turn," says Tish Ciravolo, owner and
designer of Daisy Rock Guitars, a line of smaller, colorful daisy-
and heart-shaped electric models made with females in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Ovation Guitars, meanwhile, has begun marketing a line of Melissa
Etheridge instruments, and Gibson Guitars has a Sheryl Crow model.</TE>
<TE>   Ciravolo introduced her guitar line last year.</TE>
<TE>   She was among a handful of women playing the bass professionally
in Los Angeles in the early 1980s, but gender lines in the music
business shifted noticeably in the '90s with a wave of new
singer-songwriters such as Ani DiFranco and Jewel. Then came the
Lilith Fair, an all-women's music tour led by Canadian songstress
Sarah McLachlan.</TE>
<TE>   These days, images of women with guitars are commonplace, from
India.Arie, who played and sang at this year's Grammy Awards, to
up-and-comer Michelle Branch.</TE>
<TE>   The trend is inspiring everyday women to join the ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Snyder bought her first electric guitar last fall--a move
she attributes to her ill-fated attempts to date "bad-boy rocker
types."</TE>
<TE>   "After the last one dumped me, I decided, if you can't date 'em,
join 'em," says Snyder, 23, from State College, Pa., who named her
guitar "Betty."</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Clark, 12, from Monrovia, also took up the guitar last
fall. She plays with fellow sixth-graders--six other girls and two
boys--and prefers the instrument to the violin.</TE>
<TE>   "For one thing, you can sing while playing the guitar," she says,
noting that she most often jams with the girls in her class.</TE>
<TE>   Stories like that are catching the interest of guitar
manufacturers. Taylor Guitars has begun donating smaller "baby"
versions of its instruments to elementary school classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   C.F. Martin &amp; Co. carries a line of smaller "Women in Music"
guitars meant to be easier for a young girl or petite woman to
handle.</TE>
<TE>   "The car industry has recognized that, 'Gee, women buy cars,
too,'" says Christian F. Martin IV, chairman and CEO of the Nazareth,
Pa.-based company. "The guitar industry needs to do the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   He says women account for at least 15% of the company's
sales--well above the industry average of about 5%.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Horowitz, vice president of purchasing at Sam Ash Music
Corp., says guitar sales are increasing generally, in part because
the cost of an instrument is dropping. Sam Ash doesn't track who buys
its guitars, but Horowitz thinks "women are more involved than they
used to be."</TE>
<TE>   Some women say buying a guitar would be easier if stores added a
few female salesclerks, offered classes and made it simpler to ask
questions.</TE>
<TE>   Kahler, who plays acoustic guitar, is one of many who says she
still feels "totally intimidated" walking into music stores. She's
most comfortable at Chicago's Oldtown School of Folk Music, where
she's taking a guitar class featuring tunes by female artists.</TE>
<TE>   Mariela Azcuy says she also felt out of place the first time she
walked into a small guitar store in Manhattan's West Village. But
Azcuy says the salesman put her at ease when he let her try out any
number of electric guitars in a soundproof room.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago, she walked out of the store with a baby-blue
Fender Stratocaster and an amplifier.</TE>
<TE>   Now she jams regularly with a group of budding female musicians,
ages 24 to 27.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's anything that says that only [men]
genetically can be rock stars," says Azcuy, 25, who's a magazine
promoter by day.</TE>

<HD>Where Slavery, Freedom Met</HD>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>When visitors walk through the new $9-million pavilion housing one of
the nation's most enduring icons of freedom, they will tread above
the spot where the first president kept his slaves.</LD>
<LD>   But even before the Liberty Bell Center opens in 2003, a debate is
brewing over how best to treat the place where slavery and freedom
coexisted.</LD>
<LD>   Some historians say building the center's entrance just beyond the
site of George Washington's slave quarters is tantamount to burying
history--both literally and symbolically. The National Park Service
argues that the underground structure, yards from the bell that
became a symbol of the abolitionist movement, has to be covered over
to be preserved.</LD>
<TE>   "If it's not going to be destroyed, the best preservation is to
leave it in place--that's standard practice and one of the tenets of
archeology," Park Service spokesman Phil Sheridan said. "Excavating
it can mean you have to destroy it."</TE>
<TE>   However, critics say it appears that the government is avoiding
the obvious contradiction of freedom and servitude. They want the
Park Service to halt construction and perform an extensive
archeological evaluation, although they say there are no plans to
force the issue with a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "Our historical memory is often managed and manipulated, [but]
it's downright being murdered in Philadelphia," said Gary B. Nash, a
UCLA history professor and a scholar of the Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   The Park Service says it already has done excavation work and
recovered thousands of artifacts. The slave quarters were untouched.</TE>
<TE>   "The excavation was very thorough....We looked at everything we
could have looked at," added Rebecca Yamin of John Milner Associates,
which did the work.</TE>
<TE>   The Liberty Bell Center is part of a $300-million redesign of
Independence Mall that includes the new Independence Visitor's Center
and the under-construction National Constitution Center.</TE>
<TE>   The new center is just steps from where the Liberty Bell has been
displayed in a glass pavilion since 1976. It attracts 1.6 million
visitors a year.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, the Independence Hall Assn., a watchdog group,
wants a memorial, perhaps an outline marking the house where
Washington once lived.</TE>
<TE>   City officials also want some sort of commemoration, said Frank
Keel, spokesman for Mayor John F. Street, adding that it was "too
early to determine whether excavation can or cannot happen."</TE>
<TE>   Washington's house was a red-brick mansion at 6th and Market (then
called High) streets, where the founding father conducted the
nation's business. It's also where he brought eight slaves from Mount
Vernon, including his cook, Hercules, and Martha Washington's
personal servant, Oney Judge, who eventually fled those now-buried
slave quarters and gained their own freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's successor, John Adams, also used the home during
Philadelphia's time as the national capital, from 1790 to 1800,
before moving to Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   In 1951, the remains of the house were demolished to make way for
Independence Mall.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>URBANDALE, Iowa</DL>
<LD>Pipe bombs accompanied by anti-government propaganda exploded Friday
in five mailboxes in rural parts of Illinois and Iowa, an attack
authorities called domestic terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Five people were injured, none seriously.</LD>
<LD>   A note found with the bombs said more "attention getters" were on
the way. It was signed "someone who cares."</LD>
<TE>   The Postal Service suspended delivery through Saturday in the
agricultural region that straddles the Mississippi River and urged
residents not to remove any devices that they might find in their
mailboxes.</TE>
<TE>   "We are reviewing this as a domestic terrorism incident," said
James Bogner, an FBI spokesman. "We don't know if all the devices
have been found or [if] there are devices remaining. . . . We
probably won't know for a while."</TE>
<TE>   In all, eight devices were found and five exploded. The bombs were
not sent by mail but were instead placed in the mailboxes and set to
detonate when the boxes were opened, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Postal Service Inspector Linda Jensen said consistencies in
placement suggested the bombs were linked., but that did not mean
just one person was involved.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago FBI officials said its multi-agency Joint Terrorist Task
Force would help in the investigation. Federal officials did not say
how many investigators would be involved, although ATF Special Agent
Thomas Ahern said his agency sent at least 10.</TE>
<TE>   Bombs were found in Morrison, Mount Carroll and Elizabeth in
Illinois, and in Asbury, Farley, Tipton, Anamosa and a farm outside
Davenport in Iowa. The communities all can be reached within a day's
drive.</TE>
<TE>   None of the injuries was considered life-threatening.</TE>

<HD>Currency With Consciousness</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PITT</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>VEDIC CITY, Iowa</DL>
<LD>If Walt Disney World can make Disney Dollars and Club Med can print
its own currency, then this Iowa town founded by practitioners of
transcendental meditation figured that it too could make its own
money.</LD>
<LD>   The raam mudra, as the colorful notes are called, began
circulating last month in this city incorporated last year by 125
followers of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Beatles guru and founder
of the TM movement.</LD>
<LD>   The currency has achieved a little consciousness-raising about
Vedic City. But it has not created the wider monetary harmony that
some had hoped for.</LD>
<TE>   The idea in creating the money was to promote the city--a
collection of onion-dome buildings set amid farmland about 100 miles
from Des Moines--and its plans for a theme park devoted to world
peace and the magic tricks of the late illusionist and TM
practitioner Doug Henning.</TE>
<TE>   The currency originally was intended to be used in Vedic City
only, but thousands of meditators also live in Fairfield, a town of
8,700 two miles away. They also began to circulate the raam. Vedic
City Mayor Bob Wynne asked businesses throughout Jefferson County to
consider using the new currency.</TE>
<TE>   But only Maharishi University of Management--which operates in
Fairfield with more than 700 students--and a few businesses run by
meditators accept the bills. Local banks, county officials and other
merchants have balked.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors passed a resolution requiring homeowners to pay
their property taxes in dollars, just in case anyone got the idea of
using raam.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided that we're not a bank, that the function of exchanging
money should be at a bank," said county Supervisor Steve Burgmeier.</TE>
<TE>   The First National Bank in Fairfield initially agreed to exchange
raam for dollars but pulled out after a few weeks. Bank President
Steve Cracker said First National feared that it could get stuck
holding worthless raam.</TE>
<TE>   Vedic City can legally make its own money, as long as it does not
replicate U.S. currency, and people are free to use it. But Secret
Service agent Chuck Hull warned: "Anybody who uses it does it at
their own risk."</TE>
<TE>   The currency is named for Raam Mudra, the ancient Indian prince
whose image appears on the notes. The colorful bills also feature
Sanskrit messages of peace and prosperity, a cow and a
wish-fulfilling tree.</TE>
<TE>   One raam is worth $10. The one-raam note is green, the five-raam
note blue and the 10-raam bill, worth $100, orange-yellow. The notes
are printed in the Netherlands by the company that makes the euro.</TE>
<TE>   TM adherent Mark Welch, who runs the Radio Shack in Fairfield,
accepts raam. So does meditator Mel Sauerbeck, owner of a Fairfield
photo studio. TM-connected stores exchange the bills among themselves
in the course of business.</TE>
<TE>   And the Vedic City Hall serves as an exchange service for those
who want to change dollars to raam. Rogers Badgett, Vedic City mayor
pro tem, said the colorful bills could become collector's items.</TE>
<TE>   "We're excited about the excitement it's creating," he said.
"We've had calls from all across the country from people who want to
buy it or see it."</TE>
<TE>   The Maharishi brought his followers to Iowa in 1974, causing a
stir among farmers and business owners. The meditators bought the
trim red brick campus of bankrupt Parsons College in Fairfield.
Within months, hundreds of people were assembling on campus for
twice-daily meditation sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, university officials began tearing down original campus
buildings--some on the National Register of Historic Places--to make
room for new buildings facing east, to improve health and mental
well-being.</TE>
<TE>   But the neighbors and the meditators have learned to coexist.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some things we agree to disagree on," Burgmeier said.</TE>

<HD>Russians in Despair at Street Urchins' Plight</HD>
<DH>Culture: The upheaval after communism leaves up to 3
million youngsters to fend for themselves. Their plight could
foretell a dire future for the nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANGELA CHARLTON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Kristina was 5 when she was found curled on a barroom floor,
pockmarked from syphilis and terrified of affection.</LD>
<LD>   Fifteen-year-old Zhenya, who makes his home on a grime-caked
heating vent, asked shyly for something to read--"science fiction,
preferably"--to fill his school-less, aimless, hopeless days.</LD>
<LD>   Nine-year-old Masha urinated behind a trash heap, a moment of
escape from a broken family.</LD>
<TE>   For many Russians, these children are cause to despair at the
future of their country. Lurching from uncaring homes to underfunded
orphanages to alleys haunted by drug dealers and pimps, these
neglected children--estimated to number up to 3 million--are making
up an increasing share of Russia's shrinking population.</TE>
<TE>   Investors and politicians boast that long-suffering Russia is at
last prospering. Economic indicators show growing incomes, and
Moscow's streets glisten with boutiques.</TE>
<TE>   But these street children embody the hardships Russia has suffered
since shedding communist rule a decade ago: mass poverty, loss of
social and family security, growth of crime and alcoholism, decline
in health care, wars in Chechnya and former Soviet republics.</TE>
<TE>   Long overlooked by the country's leadership, the children's plight
recently caught President Vladimir Putin's eye, and he chided his
government for allowing their number to reach "threatening
proportions."</TE>
<TE>   Soviet authorities had a swift and brutal solution to the problem
of street urchins. When orphans flooded the streets after the
Bolshevik Revolution and after World War II, they were transported to
labor camps and factories.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, the police state routinely made troubled children
vanish into orphanages or institutions for the disabled. Post-Soviet
freedoms and economic turmoil have let the problem explode into the
open.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, Russian police have been barred from picking up
wayward children unless they commit a crime. Yet bureaucratic
confusion has meant the social services expected to take
responsibility for at-risk families have accomplished little.</TE>
<TE>   Child welfare workers welcome Putin's concern, but wonder whether
he will commit as much energy to mending Russia's frayed society as
he does to waging a war in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "We can wash them, feed them, dress them, and tell them that they
are loved," said Irina Abramova, director of the Children's Crisis
Center in the Moscow suburb of Lyubertsy. "That is not enough to heal
the illnesses of today's society."</TE>
<TE>   In the hallway of a Moscow children's shelter, Masha jerked up
from a reading assignment when she heard a familiar voice.
Breathless, the 9-year-old ran to embrace her mother, Galina. It was
their first encounter since social workers had found the girl at the
trash heap and brought her to the shelter four weeks earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Masha stroked her mother's dirt-caked fingernails and tugged on
the drawstring of her baggy green jacket. "Why don't you come to see
me?" she pleaded.</TE>
<TE>   Galina Filipenko's watery eyes rarely met her daughter's. Her
voice was clear but her words held little conviction. She brandished
documents appealing for state welfare payments and explaining how her
apartment building had been demolished and she had been unable to
find adequate housing. They described her estrangement from Masha's
father, who provides no financial support.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll come back with chocolates for you, my sweet little girl,"
she said as she departed.</TE>
<TE>   Many Russian children enjoy more adult attention than their
Western counterparts. They often live with grandparents as well as
parents. Education is paramount even in many poor families (It's
noteworthy that both Masha and the sci-fi-loving Zhenya can read.)
Families that have prospered in post-Soviet Russia, meanwhile, are
sending children to upscale shopping malls and European boarding
schools.</TE>
<TE>   But that's scant comfort to Yevgeny Gontmasser, head of the
Cabinet's social development department. According to him, about
150,000 to 200,000 children in Russia are technically homeless. But
more alarming, he said, is that an overwhelming 3 million children
have homes so dreadful that they sometimes prefer the streets, and
parents too poor, drunk, violent, or mentally or physically unable to
raise them.</TE>
<TE>   That means nearly 10% of Russia's 32 million children are
neglected--and the proportion is rising.</TE>
<TE>   The average monthly wage of $140 a month barely feeds and clothes
one child. As a result, Russians are having few children, and the
population has shriveled by 2.2% to 144.9 million in the past decade.
Meanwhile, more and more children are born to poor single mothers,
according to official figures.</TE>
<TE>   Some simply go missing. Anya, 15, hasn't shown up at home since
mid-January, or at school, or at the police station in her Lyubertsy
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Yevgenia Nurova, missing several front teeth and with
failing eyesight, feels her way around their single room in a
communal apartment. The room reeks of grain alcohol. The cracked
window lets in freezing drafts of wind. A single bed sags between a
rusty refrigerator and a heap of stained underwear.</TE>
<TE>   Nurova once worked as a teacher but her eye troubles ended that.
"My eyes are guilty of everything," she said, including Anya's
unwillingness to come home.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband discovered that drug-dealing dramatically boosted the
family's income--until he was imprisoned when Anya was 12.</TE>
<TE>   "The overall problem will take years to solve. This will last as
long as in the country there is such huge stratification of our
economy, such a difference between rich and poor," Gontmasser said.</TE>
<TE>   At Moscow's Kazansky train station, police officers lament that
when they see a preschooler sniffling alone in a darkened corridor,
all they can do is watch.</TE>
<TE>   Fostering is new to Russia, and adoption is a social stigma. Just
7,000 of Russia's orphans were adopted in 2000, according to the
Labor and Social Development Ministry. Nearly as many Russian
children were adopted by foreigners--more than 4,000 of those by
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "These children are so damaged, who would take them?" Abramova
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Overcrowded orphanages and shelters have just a fraction of the
state financing of Soviet times.</TE>
<TE>   The churches, crippled by decades of state-sponsored atheism,
rarely step in. Charities are scarce, because few Russians are rich
enough to support them and punitive tax laws scare off corporate
sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   There are exceptions, as 14-year-old Denis Yegorov and 15-year-old
Zhenya Kurashov have discovered. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, they
get a free lunch at the Church of Saints Kozma and Demyan across from
the Moscow mayor's office. The Center for Humanitarian Aid also
offers free meals and second-hand clothes to Moscow's homeless.
Foreign aid groups such as Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross
are active too.</TE>
<TE>   Denis and Zhenya sleep on or under a heating vent between Red
Square and the country's largest hotel, the Rossiya.</TE>
<TE>   In the predawn chill, pulling his knitted cap down to shade a
bruise he won't explain, Denis describes daily life: "We guard parked
cars for 30 rubles [a dollar]. We beg cigarettes off passersby. We
evade the police."</TE>
<TE>   Police have been rounding up street kids since Putin ordered
action, sending them to hospitals and overcrowded holding cells.
"They ignore the law," Denis claimed, citing police beatings he has
suffered and witnessed.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Russia's street children are in Moscow, but most weren't
born in the teeming capital, city council statistics show. Instead
they come from atrophying industrial towns, or are fleeing the
violence in Chechnya or Tajikistan. Denis came from the town of
Nerekhty northeast of Moscow where few of the men he knows are
employed and ultranationalist violence is rife.</TE>
<TE>   Gontmasser wants the law changed to strengthen school oversight
and make it easier to take children away from abusive parents. Other
government officials want less police interference and simplified
adoption procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Abramova wants better pay for social workers, who now earn as
little as 600 rubles ($20) a month.</TE>
<TE>   The Lyubertsy crisis center is trying to do more than stopgap
measures that feed the children but leave them drifting. Helped by
European donors who supplement meager state funding, the center
offers a school, clean beds, doctors and psychologists, and a
basement youth club.</TE>
<TE>   "We must help our children now because in the years to come they
will be our leaders," said Boris Altshuler, director of the Right of
the Child advocacy group. "In this way we are building the future of
the country."</TE>

<HD>Nepal Says at Least 90 Rebels Slain in Gun Battles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal</DL>
<LD>Security forces killed at least 90 Maoist guerrillas in western Nepal
overnight, the government said Friday. The skirmishes took place days
before the prime minister visits Washington to seek help in fighting
the rebels.</LD>
<LD>   The death toll is among the largest since King Gyanendra imposed a
state of emergency Nov. 26, ordering the army to clamp down on the
rebels after they withdrew from peace talks and attacked government
troops and offices.</LD>
<LD>   The rebels, who operate in more than half of this mountainous
Himalayan kingdom of exquisite beauty and violent politics, are
demanding sweeping land reforms and an end to the constitutional
monarchy.</LD>
<TE>   Their insurgency has claimed more than 3,000 lives since it began
in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   The human rights group Amnesty International has accused both the
security forces and the insurgents of killing civilians and
committing other atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   Two army soldiers also were killed and another was wounded in the
latest gun battles with the rebels, the Defense Ministry said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   At least 40 guerrillas were killed Thursday night during a gun
battle with Nepalese army forces in Lisne, a village some 200 miles
west of the capital, Katmandu, the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   The fighting in Lisne started when Maoists attacked a team of
security forces patrolling the area, the government said.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, security forces gunned down at least 50 guerrillas in
the village of Bhagal, about 300 miles west of Katmandu, the ministry
said.</TE>
<TE>   State-run Radio Nepal quoted its correspondent in the area as
saying that 150 rebels had been killed. Neither the ministry's death
toll nor the radio report could be independently confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   The toll was the highest since battles on April 11 and 12 left
more than 200 policemen and guerrilla fighters dead--the deadliest
couple of days in the rebels' 6-year-old campaign to replace Nepal's
constitutional monarchy with a communist state.</TE>
<TE>   The government intensified its campaign against the rebels after
the guerrillas called for a nationwide strike last month that did not
get much public support.</TE>
<TE>   The intensified fighting comes ahead of Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba's visit to Washington this week. He is scheduled to
meet with President Bush to discuss the insurgency.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration recently asked Congress for $20 million in
military aid for Nepal.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Deuba rejected a reported offer by rebel leader
Prachand to hold peace talks. Nepali newspapers on Thursday said they
had received a statement from Prachand, whose real name is Pushpa
Kamal Dahal, offering to resume talks that ended in a stalemate last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no possibility of talks with the guerrillas until they
surrender weapons to the security forces," Deuba said.</TE>

<HD>Archeology Museum Tries to Dig Out of Hole</HD>
<DH>Massachusetts: Phillips Academy may scatter the
500,000-piece collection housed at the Peabody institution, which is
plagued by money woes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUSTIN POPE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ANDOVER, Mass.</DL>
<LD>It was 64 years ago that 11-year-old Eugene Winter first came to the
Robert S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology and lost himself among the
thousands of American Indian relics.</LD>
<LD>   He spent his days collecting artifacts in the woods and riverbeds,
imagining the world before Europeans arrived. Once, he sewed together
a tepee from canvas patches and slept in it 138 nights to find out
what life back then was really like.</LD>
<LD>   The museum was love at first sight, and love for life.</LD>
<TE>   As a volunteer, he has given hours to the Peabody: teaching
archeology to locals, exploring ruins with museum directors, fielding
calls from farmers and construction workers who stumble onto a find.</TE>
<TE>   But the Peabody has been more than one man's toy box. It holds a
500,000-piece collection that archeologists call one of the most
significant in the field. And many consider it a shrine to the modern
science of archeology, thanks to pioneering research by a series of
Peabody directors.</TE>
<TE>   But the Peabody's future is in jeopardy. Its 101-year history has
seen fantastic discoveries but also money problems and disagreements
with Phillips Academy, the boarding school across the street, to
which it is bound through Robert Peabody's will.</TE>
<TE>   A committee at the school, commonly called Andover, is
contemplating the Peabody's future on behalf of the academy's board,
which also oversees the museum. According to committee Chairwoman
Rebecca Sykes, it will likely recommend dispersing much of the
collection to be cared for by other institutions, perhaps keeping a
small core for student use.</TE>
<TE>   Staff cuts have left just two full-time employees, but salaries,
utility bills, exhibits--all necessary to the day-to-day upkeep of
the museum--are still eating up $100,000 a year. Andover, despite its
own $500-million endowment, says it cannot continue to bail out the
museum. It would take at least $6 million to endow it properly.</TE>
<TE>   There's no talk of selling the Peabody.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some members of the Society for American Archaeology have
written letters urging Andover to support the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Winter isn't giving up hope that the Peabody will survive, but he
knows the future is dim. The heating pipes in the empty hall where he
recounts his days groan through the dilapidated walls of a two-story
building that needs millions of dollars in repairs.</TE>
<TE>   There's no fire escape, so the staircase to the upstairs library
is roped off.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Vision of Brushing Away Old Myths</TE>
<TE>   Robert Peabody was an Andover and Harvard man, but he envisioned
archeology as more than a hobby for Victorian-era gentlemen. He
wanted it to be a science that would brush away myths of the past,
and he wanted Andover at the vanguard.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a unique idea when Robert Peabody proposed it: to have
in a high school, not a college, a science museum that would
fascinate kids," says Jim Bradley, the museum's director from 1990
until last year. "He said high school is the time when you grab
students' attention."</TE>
<TE>   Peabody directors like Alfred V. Kidder and Richard MacNeish put
the museum on the cutting edge of archeological research. Kidder
pioneered the technique of stratigraphy, which scientists use to
examine an archeological site in layers and get a full picture of
what it may have looked like at a particular time.</TE>
<TE>   His nine years of digging at a site in Pecos, N.M., helped fulfill
Peabody's vision of changing archeology from a hobby to a systematic
science that borrowed from other disciplines like geology and
ethnography.</TE>
<TE>   In 1954, a conference in the Peabody building was the scene of
early discussions about carbon-14 dating, a technology that measures
the radioactive decay of carbon to determine the age of artifacts. It
revolutionized the field.</TE>
<TE>   Expeditions and donations expanded the Peabody collection to
500,000 artifacts, including textiles ranging from Eskimos' sealskin
boots and parkas to holiday garb from Peru and Mexico, and a vast
assortment of knives, axes and other tools from the Arctic through
South America. A handful are on display--among them, a spoon signed
by Sitting Bull and a row of small, then progressively larger,
corncobs that measure the American Indians' progress in hybridizing
the plant.</TE>
<TE>   "The collections are of inestimable importance," says Dena
Dincauze, a former president of the Society for American Archaeology,
which was founded in the Peabody.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Few Courses Have Used the Collection</TE>
<TE>   But though the museum's research flourished through the 1970s,
Peabody's dream of a close connection with the school never fully
materialized. Few teachers have incorporated the collection into
course work.</TE>
<TE>   "The school and the museum have operated often on parallel
tracks," Sykes said. "Not really in conflict with each other, but
simply having very different missions."</TE>
<TE>   It's a polite interpretation. People familiar with the museum's
history say not a single director has left the job in circumstances
other than a spat with the school. Money has been a consistent
struggle. In 1909, the museum had about $480,000 in its coffers, but
that has grown to just $1.5 million. Andover officials couldn't say
precisely what the school's endowment was in 1909, but it has grown
to more than $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   How did the finances of two institutions, governed by the same
board, fare so differently? The school says the Peabody's initial
funds were more a gift than an endowment, so the museum was more
inclined to spend than invest. During the 1990s, the Peabody was
dipping into its principal to pay bills. And because few students had
ties to the museum, there was only a small constituency of alumni
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, museum supporters say they can't raise money because of
uncertainty about the facility's future.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cheaper for Andover to Endow the Museum?</TE>
<TE>   But Andover says the school has been generous, spending $100,000
or more per year during the past decade. Tuition runs $26,900 a year,
and 39% of students are on financial aid. That $100,000 could provide
three full scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   Sykes says the collection would be dispersed only to someone who
could care for it properly. But Bradley doubts that anyone willing to
take on the work could be found. He also thinks it would be cheaper
for Andover to endow the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Sykes says Andover would welcome a donor stepping forward to save
the museum. She said $6 million to $12 million would do it. But a
message on the school's Web site says the Peabody would need $8
million to endow its current budget, and requires $3 million to $4
million in repairs.</TE>
<TE>   If the Peabody closes, Winter says, he'll probably find another
place to volunteer. Until then, he stops by a couple of days a week.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, we have to try to save the museum," he says.
"But if that doesn't turn out, the most important thing is to try to
save the collections, which are irreplaceable."</TE>

<HD>A Mayor Is Taking On Satan, No Offense Intended</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE SCHNEIDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>INGLIS, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The last time an agent of temptation came to this sleepy hamlet near
the Gulf Coast, throngs of screaming girls followed his every move.</LD>
<LD>   Forty years later, a more pernicious force than Elvis Presley was
apparently stalking the town--Satan--or so the mayor believed.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Carolyn Risher began seeing growing examples of what she
deemed Satan's work: instances of fathers abusing their children,
increased drug use and children wearing devil costumes for Halloween.</LD>
<TE>   So Risher did what she thought any good public servant would do
for the town's 1,400 residents. She wrote a proclamation in November
banning Satan from the town.</TE>
<TE>   "We exercise our authority over the devil in Jesus' name," the
proclamation read. "By that authority ... we command all satanic and
demonic forces to cease their activities and depart the town." The
mayor ended the proclamation by saying she was taking this action "in
accordance with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."</TE>
<TE>   What followed was an international uproar that has raised
questions about the appropriateness of religion in government.</TE>
<TE>   Risher has received hundreds of letters, from as far away as
Australia and Spain, praising her for taking a stand against evil.
She also has been condemned by advocates of the separation of church
and state.</TE>
<TE>   The town hall now frequently receives phone calls from pranksters
claiming to be Satan. Comedy Central's "The Daily Show" sent a
correspondent who put a person in a red-devil's costume and had
residents chase him out of town for the camera.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents talked about getting a petition to remove the mayor
from office, but that effort has been put on hold.</TE>
<TE>   "She used this for self-glorification, trying to make a name for
herself, and I can't condone it," said town commissioner Floyd Craig,
who plans to run against Risher next year.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union considered filing a lawsuit but
backed off after town commissioners said the proclamation was not an
official town act.</TE>
<TE>   Risher reimbursed the town more than $13 for the costs of
stationery, copying and telephone calls related to the proclamation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like we're on a witch hunt for the mayor; we just want
to make sure she's following the Constitution," said Gary Edinger, an
ACLU attorney in Gainesville.</TE>
<TE>   Risher, a 61-year-old Pentecostal who has been mayor for 10 years,
said she had no intention of offending anyone and doesn't believe she
was violating the Constitution because she wasn't establishing a
religion.</TE>
<TE>   Inglis, 75 miles north of Tampa, has a handful of churches and
just a scattering of businesses. Some town residents said Risher is a
good mayor and a well-meaning, friendly, no-nonsense leader. But many
worry that her actions have made the town a laughingstock.</TE>
<TE>   "People think it's kind of a joke in the area," said Sunny Price,
owner of River Coast Realty. "She's entitled to believe whatever she
believes in, but don't do it in the name of the town."</TE>
<TE>   There has been no decrease in crime since the proclamation, but
there wasn't a lot of crime in the first place, said Inglis Police
Chief Mitchell Billups. The last murder happened about 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   One crime has even involved the proclamation. Risher ordered
rolled-up copies of it inserted into four hollowed-out wooden posts
on which were painted "Repent, Request, Resist." The posts were
placed at the entrance to the town--only to be removed by vandals.</TE>
<TE>   The posts were replaced with reinforced concrete. After the ACLU
stepped in, they were moved off a state road to private property.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents said they wholeheartedly support the mayor and
believe that too much of public life is devoid of religion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of quaint and unique and it kind of harkens back to the
16th century," joked pawnshop owner Steve Baughn, who hung the
proclamation in his shop.</TE>

<HD>Silent Stones Cast a Spell</HD>
<DH>History: U.S. site likened to Stonehenge puzzles those who
hope to learn its age, purpose, creators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRUDY TYNAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HEATH, Mass.</DL>
<LD>As cold and lonely as the winter sky, the standing stones atop Burnt
Hill have snagged the imagination of fiction writers and generations
of blueberry pickers.</LD>
<LD>   But who erected them, and why, remains a mystery.</LD>
<LD>   All told, 21 stones, some weighing 300 to 500 pounds, have been
jammed into the bedrock on the 1,855-foot-high knoll in the state's
wild northwestern corner.</LD>
<TE>   Five others have fallen. And interspersed among the monoliths are
four glistening stacks of white quartz boulders.</TE>
<TE>   For the last five years, about a half-dozen members of the New
England Antiquities Research Assn., working weekends and winters,
have been mapping and puzzling over the stones.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the group has come up with more questions than answers,
said Colgate Gilbert III, an amateur historian from Spofford, N.H.,
who heads the project.</TE>
<TE>   They are not the first to wonder.</TE>
<TE>   H.P. Lovecraft, who summered here in the 1920s, also fell under
the stones' spell.</TE>
<TE>   According to local lore, the master of New England tales of the
supernatural used the Heath stones to set the opening scene for his
story "The Dunwitch Horror": "Oldest of all are the great rings on
rough hewn stone columns on the hilltops."</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert scoffs at such primeval hyperbole. But even without
Lovecraft's mythical "Old Ones," there is plenty about the stones to
puzzle over, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't anticipate the site would be anywhere near as complex
as it is," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Gilbert thought they would quickly be able to establish
that the stones were erected by a 19th-century farmer to mark the
boundaries of his land or some similar purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected it to be very straightforward and very clear, with
some tie to historical background," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But after five years of peering through surveyor's transits and
poring over old deeds and military diaries dating back to the French
and Indian War, he has come to believe the stones were in place at
least by 1750.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of lining up with old boundary lines, they appear to point
to the surrounding mountains, capturing such celestial events as the
solstice sunrise and movements of the moon in the rugged teeth of New
England's high peaks.</TE>
<TE>   If the hill was used as an observatory, the stones cannot be more
than 1,000 years old, Gilbert said. Otherwise, because of the
movement of the Earth, they would no longer be in sync with the
celestial events, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The stones can draw comparisons to the ancient monument Stonehenge
in England, portions of which are believed to be about 5,000 years
old. It is no longer in perfect alignment.</TE>
<TE>   On a clear day, the top of the little knoll is a vantage point
offering a stunning panorama of New England's roof.</TE>
<TE>   To the northwest are the white flanks of Haystack, Mt. Snow and
the ski hills of Vermont.</TE>
<TE>   To the west is the granite bulk of Mt. Greylock, the state's
highest peak.</TE>
<TE>   Northeast in New Hampshire is the white crown of Mt. Monadnock,
the region's highest.</TE>
<TE>   East are the towers of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst
and beyond them the blue smudge of Mt. Wachusett, more than 50 miles
away.</TE>
<TE>   The old records hint that long before the settlers arrived, the
hill was periodically burned by the Indian tribes that lived here to
keep it clear for wild blueberries and to encourage deer to gather on
the grasslands, Gilbert said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is very much an open question if the tribes erected the
stones.</TE>
<TE>   The periodic burns have muddied the picture, but pollen-dating,
which is one of the next avenues that Gilbert's group plans to
explore, may help provide clues as to how long ago the stones were
set in place.</TE>
<TE>   Fur traders and other adventurers were wandering through the area
for a century, before the first colonial farmers settled here in the
1750s, Gilbert said.</TE>
<TE>   And some archeologists were skeptical about any suggestion that
the stones could be Indian work.</TE>
<TE>   Dena Dincauze, a retired anthropology professor at the University
of Massachusetts whose specialty is the native peoples of New
England, said the tribes here did not build structures around their
calendars. Dincauze, who has visited the site, noted that their
calendars were based on the moon, not the sun.</TE>
<TE>   They also built with wood, not stone, said Elizabeth Chilton,
another anthropology professor at the university. Most such sites in
New England have turned out to be a bit of Colonial whimsy, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the stones have an enduring fascination. For nearly 40
years they have been part of a privately owned blueberry farm, open
to the public only during picking season.</TE>
<TE>   "I started out thinking this would be a quick job and got hooked,"
Gilbert said. "We've learned some things, but we still have a long
way to go."</TE>

<HD>Urban 'Wall' for Rural Chinese</HD>
<DH>Asia: A residency system in place since the 1950s hinders
migrants who seek jobs, housing and basic services in cities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN FACKLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HUZHOU, China</DL>
<LD>Seamstress Jiao Guixia complains that she feels like a second-class
citizen in her own country--refused work, ripped off by cashiers,
denied her dignity.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is China's residency system, which binds people to
their place of birth. Her residence permit says the 20-year-old Jiao
is supposed to live in the countryside. That puts her at a
disadvantage in Huzhou, the city in the booming coastal province of
Zhejiang to which she moved four years ago in search of work.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a huge wall separating us from city residents. People
know you are migrant workers, you are poor, and they look down on
you," she said.</LD>
<TE>   China has a "floating population" of about 200 million rural
residents who have flowed to cities to take low-paying jobs that
urbanites shun, which range from construction to dishwashing to being
nannies and other, often dangerous, work.</TE>
<TE>   But because of the residency system in place since the 1950s,
which aimed to keep farmers on the land and prevent them from
swamping cities, rural Chinese remain a social underclass. Rural
residents have trouble getting steady jobs, housing and even basic
services such as health care and education.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese leaders say they are trying to liberalize the system, both
to ease social strains and to expand opportunities for tens of
millions of jobless people still in the countryside.</TE>
<TE>   Membership in the World Trade Organization, which promises to pry
open Chinese markets, has made reforms more urgent. An expected
influx of cheaper, better quality agricultural imports could throw
millions more farmers out of work.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Chinese government eased residency requirements in
more than 20,000 small and medium-sized cities. These areas are
expected to absorb 40 million "surplus rural laborers" over the next
several years, according to the state-run newspaper China Daily.</TE>
<TE>   Bigger, better-off cities such as Shanghai will continue to
restrict migration, in part for fear of crime, the paper said.</TE>
<TE>   In the long term, China's leaders hope that relocating much of its
900-million-strong rural population to urban areas will speed
economic development.</TE>
<TE>   "Urbanization should proceed in a positive and sound manner, and
the rural work force should be encouraged to shift to nonagricultural
industries," Premier Zhu Rongji said in an address to the annual
meeting of China's legislature.</TE>
<TE>   But rural migrants still complain of discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Migrants need a steady city job for two years before they can
apply to change their residency. But most employers will give good
jobs only to those who have permanent resident status.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way for migrants like us to benefit. The requirements
are too high," Jiao said.</TE>
<TE>   For 12 hours a day, Jiao sits in a room with dozens of other women
sewing baby clothes by machine. She earns about $100 a month--twice
what she'd earn back home in poor rural Anhui province.</TE>
<TE>   Though Huzhou is one of the cities covered by the reforms, Jiao
hasn't worked at this job long enough to qualify for residency.</TE>
<TE>   Without it, hospitals charge her extra. Jiao complains that even
women running fruit stands keep her change, knowing that she can't go
to the police for help.</TE>
<TE>   "No one will protect me here," she said. "It is their territory."</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say only an outright end to residency restrictions
will defuse such resentments, especially at a time when rural incomes
are stagnating.</TE>
<TE>   The current reforms, they also warn, might only accelerate a brain
drain of the talented and ambitious away from rural areas. They also
fail to fix another negative consequence of the residency
system--millions of migrant children in cities now barred from
getting a proper education.</TE>
<TE>   But the government says lifting all restrictions would unleash a
wave of crime and instability.</TE>
<TE>   Restrictions perform "a major function in safeguarding public
security," the China Daily quoted Bao Suixian, deputy director of the
Ministry of Public Security, as saying.</TE>

<HD>The Shape of the Story</HD>
<DH>MAKING STORIES: Law, Literature, Life, By Jerome Bruner,
Farrar, Straus and Giroux:  130 pp., $18</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LAURIE GOODMAN</AU>
<BD>Jill Laurie Goodman is a lawyer and writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The best books have the capacity to change lives, sometimes by the
sheer force of ideas communicated with felicity and grace. Jerome
Bruner's short, compelling new work, "Making Stories: Law,
Literature, Life," is just such a book.</LD>
<LD>   Bruner does so very well what he sets out to do by making sharply
visible what otherwise would be only indistinctly felt. He trains his
searchlight on the complex and diverse uses not only of the
conventional, easily-recognized stories of myth and literature but
also of obscure stories, those found not lying on library shelves but
buried within our culture, our institutions and ourselves.</LD>
<LD>   Bruner, who teaches at New York University's School of Law after a
distinguished career as an academic psychologist, makes a case,
first, for the primacy of storytelling. He argues that stories are
not merely entertaining or enlightening or sources of deep pleasure,
at once primitive and sophisticated, but utterly essential to the
people we are collectively and individually. Without them, Bruner
suggests, we would be something less than human. Narrative, Bruner
audaciously claims, "is our preferred, perhaps even our obligatory
medium for expressing human aspirations and their vicissitudes."
Stories are "the coin and currency of culture," through which "we
construct, reconstruct, in some ways reinvent yesterday and
tomorrow."</LD>
<TE>   Stories are all around us and, Bruner says, woefully unexamined,
so he sets out to elucidate them. A story begins, he says, with
something gone awry. Combining that with a cast of characters, a
narrator, a resolution and a coda, we have the essential elements
that allow "for coming to terms with the surprises and oddities of
the human condition and for coming to terms with our imperfect grasp
of that condition."</TE>
<TE>   Bruner finds relevant, important stories everywhere. He ranges
freely across cultures, millenniums and disciplines. Law, for
example, dependent as it is on narrative pleading, is one place
stories abound. Judges and lawyers, Bruner says, do their best to
make "law stories as unstory-like as possible, even anti-story-like:
factual, logically self-evident, hostile to the fanciful, respectful
to the ordinary, seemingly 'untailored.' Yet in pleading cases, they
create drama." And in the drama of the lawsuit can lie urgent
consequences for the parties and maybe for the law itself. Small
wonder that, as Bruner reports, when the stages of ancient Greece
were bare, "Athenians often repaired to the law courts."</TE>
<TE>   The stories we tell about ourselves as a nation also influence the
course of our lives, and Bruner traces the evolving narratives about
race that in the last century shaped an expanding and then
contracting understanding of constitutional rights and the meaning of
equality.</TE>
<TE>   Bruner hears stories as well in the voices of friends and
students. Some of these are stories they created in the process of
having to make choices about the trajectory of their lives. Stories
told, for example, of a young doctor's sojourn in Africa or a law
student's encounter with parents summoned to court on charges of
abuse and neglect of their children allow for balancing "autonomy and
commitment in one's sense of self," a way to "make it all of a
piece." These are difficult but urgent tasks in the construction of a
self.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Bruner's argument suggests that we might make sense of
much in our lives and our world through the prism of stories, our
love for them, our hunger for them and our instinctive, addictive,
often unconscious need to make them. Stories, Bruner argues, are
live, dynamic forces, tools for manipulating the world, not tableaux
through which to view it. His is a call to action. To use this
precious story-making capacity well is a provocative challenge.</TE>

<HD>Feminism's American Roots</HD>
<DH>Elizabeth Cady Stanton's lasting contribution to the
polemical literature of our culture</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN GORNICK</AU>
<BD>Vivian Gornick is a contributing writer to Book Review.
This essay is adapted from a lecture that she will give Thursday at
the Huntington Library in San Marino.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nineteenth century feminist firebrand Elizabeth Cady Stanton once
wrote of Susan B. Anthony, "In ancient Greece she would have been a
Stoic; in the era of the Reformation, a Calvinist; in King Charles'
time, a Puritan; but in this nineteenth century, by the very laws of
her being, she is a Reformer."</LD>
<LD>   "And you?" I remember thinking when I read these words. "What
about you? Is that how you are to be summed up? As an essence of an
Age of Reform?" Just to ask the question was to hear it answered. No,
the description was insufficient. If anything, it made her reader
(this reader, at least) more aware than ever of the difference
between Stanton and her great comrade in arms, between Stanton and
the mass of vibrant, eloquent women who stood shoulder to shoulder
with her, if it came to that.</LD>
<TE>   Stanton is the American visionary thinker equal in intellectual
stature to Mary Wollstonecraft and Simone de Beauvoir. She, like
they, had the philosophic cast of mind large enough to grasp with
radical speed the immensity that women's rights addressed. Each of
these women--Wollstonecraft, Stanton, de Beauvoir--had been an ardent
partisan of a powerful social movement connected with a great
war--the Enlightenment, the anti-slavery movement,
existentialism--and the contribution that each made to feminist
understanding turned, appropriately enough, on an application of the
central insight of the movement to which she had been devoted.</TE>
<TE>   Wollstonecraft urged passionately that women become rational
beings, Stanton that every woman exercise governance over her own
inviolable self, de Beauvoir that women cease to be the "other."</TE>
<TE>   Stanton differed from the other two in that each of them wrote a
single famous-making book at white heat in a comparatively short
time--"Vindication of the Rights of Women" over a period of a few
weeks, "The Second Sex" over a few years--while she, Stanton, lived
within the embrace of feminist thought for half a century, thinking
the matter out decade by decade, provocation by provocation, through
a series of speeches, letters and essays that demonstrate an
ever-deepening, ever more encompassing worldview.</TE>
<TE>   Had she written "the book," we would be reading her today instead
of John Stuart Mill on "The Subjection of Women." As it is, in the
end she left political life with a final public address--"The
Solitude of Self"--written by a woman possessed of a vital piece of
understanding tempered by 50 years of political struggle that cast
long shadows back to Plato, forward to the existentialists. Hers was
the American contribution, and it makes clear why feminism as a
liberation movement has flourished here as nowhere else in the
Western world. Her writings are a major addition to the polemical
literature of our culture.</TE>
<TE>   Stanton was born in 1815, in upstate New York, into a rich,
conservative, socially connected family, and she grew up to become
the brilliant relative of brilliant people--daughter to a
distinguished jurist, cousin and wife to abolitionists of reputation.
As a girl, she read law in her father's office and had as many
thoughts as his students on the nature of political liberty. As a
young woman, she was a constant visitor to her cousin Gerrit Smith's
home--a stop on the Underground Railway--and took part in the
impassioned conversation going on there. It was at Smith's home that
she met Henry Stanton, already a well-known abolitionist speaker.
When she decided to marry him, it was as if the daughter of a
respectable Belfast lawyer had brought home a speechwriter for the
IRA.</TE>
<TE>   Then she and her husband went to the 1840 anti-slavery meeting in
England, and the conference refused to seat her; a meeting called in
the name of equality for all would not seat women. Her husband was
disturbed, but not that disturbed: He took his place in the hall,
although William Lloyd Garrison would not. Elizabeth was 25, not long
married. Lucretia Mott--patient, intelligent, 20 years older, also
not seated at the conference--walked her around London and explained
her to herself. With all the thinking Elizabeth had done about
slavery, liberty and the American idea, it had never dawned on her
until this moment: When the democracy was conceived, she was not what
the Founders had in mind.</TE>
<TE>   She never got over that flash of plain sight. It was a stunning
moment of conversion--the moment when she realized that in the eyes
of the world, she was not as she saw herself, she was "only a woman."
In her writing, the memory of it returns repeatedly to galvanize mind
and spirit. One can almost see her picking up the pen to make the
moment live again.</TE>
<TE>   Her own character was extreme. She took Flaubert--who said "dress
like a bourgeois, think like a revolutionary"--for her mentor. She
always observed the social amenities--good manners and proper
dress--but nothing could make her temper her thought. While her
personality was vivid, fun-loving and cheerful, it was also willful,
stubborn and autocratic. She hardly ever spoke before she thought,
but she always spoke without consultation or strategic consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Her intellectual independence was seen by many as highhandedness:
It broke party ranks, alienated radicals and reformers alike and
drove feminist speaker Lucy Stone wild, as well as Garrison and
countless others whose goodwill she could have used. But what she
needed was to speak truth, as she saw it, at any given moment. She
needed this more than the approval of family or steady companionship
or even political success. The need often made her reckless,
hot-tempered and insensitive.</TE>
<TE>   In her memoir, "Eighty Years and More," she tells of how after
she'd written her obituary of Lucretia Mott, she received a letter
from a man who accused her of using an anecdote of his without
attribution. "I laughed him to scorn," she writes, "that he should
have thought it was my duty to have done so. I told him plainly that
he belonged to a class of citizens who had robbed me of all civil and
political rights ... and now it ill became him to call me to account
for using one of his little anecdotes that, ten to one, he had
cribbed from some woman. I told him that I considered his whole class
as fair game for literary pilfering. That women had been taxed to
build colleges to educate men, and if we could pick up a literary
crumb that had fallen from their feasts, we surely had a right to it
.... Moreover, I told him that ... he should feel highly
complimented, instead of complaining, that he had written something I
thought worth using ...."</TE>
<TE>   In Nebraska in 1875, on the circuit, she is baited by a man in the
audience. "My wife has presented me with eight beautiful children,"
he announces. "Is not this a better life work than that of exercising
the right of suffrage?" Stanton looks him up and down and says, "I
have met few men worth repeating eight times."</TE>
<TE>   On a Sunday afternoon--also in the 1870s--sitting in a railroad
hotel, she writes to her daughter Margaret, who has written to ask if
it's not lonely traveling as she does. "It is indeed, and I should
have enjoyed above all things having Hattie with me." Sensitive
mother! Hattie is Margaret's sister, Harriot, Stanton's favorite
child.</TE>
<TE>   But suffrage was on her mind morning, noon and night. It galled
her--as it has many others after her--that the majority of women in
her country did not see clearly on the matter of their own rights. It
was a grievance that held her attention year after year.</TE>
<TE>   In 1848 at the first women's rights convention, in Seneca Falls,
N.Y., she wrote: "Resolved, that the women of this country ought to
be enlightened in regard to the laws under which they live, that they
may no longer publish their degradation, by declaring themselves
satisfied with their present position, nor their ignorance, by
asserting that they have all the rights they want."</TE>
<TE>   In 1855, she wrote: "Go watch the daily life of fortune's most
favored woman .... Who that has mingled with this class, is ignorant
of the senseless round, the utter vacuity of such an existence. The
woman who has no fixed purpose in her life is like a traveler at the
depot, waiting hour after hour for the cars to come in--listless,
uneasy, expectant--with this difference, the traveler has a definite
object to look for, whereas the woman is simply waiting for something
to 'turn up' .... She may write books, but ... instead of dealing
stout blows ... [she is] trimming [her] sails to the popular breeze
.... Had our literary women 'all the rights they want,' we should
have better books from them on subjects which they understand and
feel most deeply."</TE>
<TE>   In 1867: "Sometimes when I sit alone, and all the bearings of this
question [of suffrage] loom up before me, I am filled with wonder at
the apathy and indifference of our women .... When they come to see
that ideas as well as babies need the mother soul for their growth
and perfection, that there is sex in mind and spirit, as well as
body, they will appreciate the necessity of a full recognition of
womanhood in every department of life ...."</TE>
<TE>   Much as the European feminists burned over their second-class
status, it was impossible for them--from Wollstonecraft to de
Beauvoir--to give up their longing for inclusion in the world as men
had made it: too lonely a prospect. This longing--erotic in its power
to compel--bound them to a dividedness of will--they wanted to both
rebel and belong--that was politically crippling. The Americans, on
the other hand, staring into democratic inequality, hardened their
hearts against the romantic pull of the world as it is and eroticized
feminism: They could do it, they had enough company. Women's
rights--in the name of the Republic with a capital R--became their
single-minded passion. This made them undivided in their pursuit of
equality and incomparably more revolutionary.</TE>
<TE>   Stanton's life encompasses all of these influences and equations.
In her is gathered an essence of Americanism informing this
particular liberation movement. She is fiercely concentrated on the
denial of what is promised her by right of birth--not birth into the
world but birth into the American democracy. That concentration is
the poetry of her political existence: It multiplies her insight,
deepens her thought, clarifies her spirit. It infuses everything she
wrote and said for the 50 years between Seneca Falls and her death
and speaks powerfully to feminism today.</TE>

<DH>WARNING OF WAR: A Novel, By James Brady, Thomas Dunne Books
/ St. Martin's Press: 352 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Billy Port's ride" to rescue U.S. Marines stranded in China in World
War II is a legend, James Brady says, told and retold whenever old
"Chinaside" veterans gather. But official documentation is scarce,
leaving Brady ample room to embroider the legend in his novel,
"Warning of War."</LD>
<LD>   Days before Pearl Harbor, Brady says, a warning that war might
soon break out with Japan was sent to U.S. troops overseas, including
the 1,008 men of the 4th Marine Regiment, "in their forest-green
uniforms, their canvas leggings, with their Springfield rifles and
tin hats," who had been stationed in China since the Boxer Rebellion.</LD>
<LD>   Much of China by that time was occupied by a million Japanese
soldiers, so the Marines planned a hasty exit. Garrisons in port
cities would embark by ship to the Philippines (and soon be engulfed
in the fighting for Bataan and Corregidor). But smaller contingents
were scattered inland from Peking to the edge of the Gobi Desert.
According to the legend, Capt. Billy Port was sent with a few
selected men and four trucks to get them out any way he could.</LD>
<TE>   In Peking, a by-the-book commander preferred to wait for orders to
proceed to the coast for transport. He and his men were forced to
surrender only hours after Port slipped out of the city, en route to
the Great Wall, the Gobi and the wastes of Manchuria and Siberia,
pursued by an elite Japanese force led by the embittered
American-born Col. Jesse Irabu.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanying Port, for various reasons, were an English Jesuit
paleontologist, a French race-car driver, a Chinese doctor and a
White Russian prince bent on helping his old enemies, the Reds, to
resist Hitler. All come in handy in Brady's reconstruction of their
journey through a 500-mile obstacle course of bandits, warlords,
blizzards, epidemics and occasional strafing from the air.</TE>
<TE>   Port, it seems, was no ordinary Marine captain. He was rich: heir
to a Boston bootlegging fortune that rivaled the Kennedys', he lived
in a mansion in Shanghai with servants and a 19-year-old Russian
mistress; he drove a Bentley and, in Brady's account, takes that
luxury car along on the rescue mission.</TE>
<TE>   Brady ("The Marines of Autumn," "The Coldest War") clearly views
the U.S. Marine Corps as the noblest and most puissant body of men
since the Table Round--an attitude that will endear him to some
readers and grate on others. The sketchy historical record (an
annoying feature of "Warning of War" is the extent of the doubtful
area between what's obviously true and what's obviously made up) is
an armature on which Brady sculpts an image of an ideal Marine, a
born leader who may chafe at peacetime regulations but is "a
virtuoso" at fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Brady quotes Gen. Lewis B. "Chesty" Puller, Port's commander when
Marines were sent to quell the Sandino revolt in Nicaragua from 1927
to 1933: "I'd as soon go to war with Billy Port as any man I know.
Marines will follow him anywhere. An officer either has command or he
doesn't. Billy has it. And besides that, he knows how to kill a
fellow and has the stomach to do so."</TE>
<TE>   That those Nicaraguans might have had a reason to revolt--or that
the Marines' job was to train a National Guard that would keep the
Somoza dictatorship in power for decades to come--seems not to have
crossed Port's mind. He's a man of action, aware that too much
introspection would blunt his edge; and he's a professional among
other professionals in a pre-draft era.</TE>
<TE>   As "Black Hawk Down" reminded us, the range of personalities in
America's post-draft military--from lifer to seriously gung-ho--is
much narrower than the range portrayed in war novels from "The Naked
and the Dead" through "Catch-22" to "The Things They Carried," in
which many characters were civilians only temporarily in uniform who
kept their civilian viewpoints.</TE>
<TE>   In "Warning of War," the civilians are, literally, just along for
the ride. Port kills with relish in combat scenes that display
Brady's descriptive power and knowledge of period weapons and
tactics. Only toward the end does Port reveal a deeper humanity. He's
bothered by the collateral damage his mission causes, including
children and Mongol ponies machine-gunned by a Zero fighter plane. He
confides to the Jesuit: "Like the lepers of Molokai, everything I
touch dies."</TE>
<TE>   The Jesuit, it seems, existed but, repatriated to England, he was
killed by a buzz bomb in 1944. Port's confession, then, may be
imaginary, but Brady uses it to explain a final self-sacrificial act
of heroism: In Siberia, Port left his unit to serve as defense
counsel for the Russian prince, who had been arrested by Stalin's
secret police, and vanished himself--into the gulag and probable
death and into legend.</TE>

<HD>Fairy Tale</HD>
<DH>QUEEN AND COUNTRY: The Fifty-Year Reign of Elizabeth II, By
William Shawcross Simon &amp; Schuster: 240 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS</AU>
<BD>Christopher Hitchens is a columnist for Vanity Fair and
the Nation and teaches at the New School University in New York. He
is the author of several books, including "Letters to a Young
Contrarian" and his forthcoming study of George Orwell, "Orwell's
Victory."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Cobbett, a great English radical, dryly observed more than a
century ago that there was something absurd in a system that referred
to "the national debt" and "the Royal Mint." Thomas Paine, one of our
less-acknowledged Founding Fathers, pointed out that a hereditary
head of state made no more sense than a hereditary mathematician. The
sheer, obvious rationality and justice of this critique is countered,
by partisans of royalism, with numinous claims about the need for
magical and mystical authority; for something to lift our everyday
politics out of the drudgery of mere administration. "Fairy tale" is
a term often employed (and rightly in my view, since I scorn to
conceal my prejudice) by monarchists themselves.</LD>
<TE>   A serious defense of monarchy or of a monarch might begin by
recognizing this essential difference in approach. To take only a
recent instance, the death of the queen mother provoked the writing
of literally hundreds of valedictory articles, all of which dwelt on
the supposedly gallant way in which she had visited bombed-out slum
dwellers during the Nazi blitzkrieg. None of these moist tributes
mentioned the unswerving support that the old lady and her husband,
King George VI, had given to Neville Chamberlain a couple of years
earlier. Now, "fairy tales" require that the emphasis should fall
only on the first anecdote. But elementary journalism, to say nothing
of scholarship, requires that the second point be noticed at least in
passing. William Shawcross' "Queen and Country" simply omits it,
along with much else.</TE>
<TE>   I pause here to note another claim made by monarchists: that
royalty provides a context of historical continuity and teaches the
value of tradition and the past. This lofty objective is not to be
accomplished by such air-brushing. In 1988, the tercentennial of the
Glorious Revolution, which brought the ancestors of the current
Windsor dynasty to power, there was a celebration in Westminster
Hall--the same place where the queen mother's body lay in state.
Anyone who has been to that great hall knows that it features a
plaque commemorating the occasion in 1649 on which Charles I was
tried there for crimes against humanity and lost his head on the
wicked and fallacious proposition of the "divine right of kings." But
during the 1988 festivities, this plaque was covered with a velvet
cloak, as if the British lived in some Stalinist "people's democracy"
or banana republic. Shawcross' courtier-style volume is in the same
tradition.</TE>
<TE>   It may or may not be true that royalty provides glamour,
stability, pageantry and all the rest of it, rather than a wearisome
parade of tax-dodgers, unexciting adulterers, chinless princes and
frumpish ladies of the bedchamber. But the first belief, if only in
the recent and glaring light of the second, does require a little
argument. I was continually amazed by the flat, un-ironic, orthodox
way that Shawcross relied upon mere assertion: The royal family is a
force for political legitimacy. It does have the right to run the
national state-supported church. It has enshrined itself in the
hearts of a grateful people. Moreover, every gesture made by a
monarch is either charmingly informal ("just like the rest of us") or
magnificently regal ("the royal touch"). This does occasionally--no,
make that repeatedly--become plain ridiculous:</TE>
<TE>   "The Queen's faith has supported her throughout her reign in a job
that is very isolating. In 1947, during the royal trip to South
Africa, her father turned to Field Marshal Smuts and said, 'There she
goes, alone as usual, an extraordinary girl.' It is a theme that
painters such as Annigoni have picked up on. In his lovely 1954
painting he portrayed her standing quite alone."</TE>
<TE>   Where to begin? In 1947 she was not yet queen (as her father's
contemporary comment suggests). She has never taken a step, even as
princess, without an enormous retinue of servants. And, despite the
suggestion that Annigoni was on to something unheralded, most people
do tend to sit for their portraits unaccompanied. Indeed, the word
"portrait" rather implies a study of an individual. But our author is
so awash in sycophancy that he cannot venture upon the most banal
story without investing its object with quasi-supernatural
properties. Indeed, he doesn't even bother to register the fact that
a monarchic position, supposedly conferred by exclusive breeding, is
by its own definition "sole." It's not dignified for a courtier to
bow once to contradiction and once to tautology and then to collapse
in a heap between the two.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does Shawcross notice how often he contradicts himself.
Describing the way in which the queen and the queen mother colluded
with the archbishop of Canterbury and the prime minister to deny the
late Princess Margaret the right to marry a divorced man, he writes
that "in those days even the innocent party to a divorce was
cold-shouldered." Only one page later, he records that the highly
popular Daily Mirror conducted the first "royal poll" ever carried by
a newspaper, asking its readers "if they thought the couple should be
allowed to marry. The vast majority of the respondents were in
favor." So what happens to his first assertion? In translation, it
becomes his unexamined excuse for the extreme cruelty with which
Buckingham Palace wrecked the lives of two people, in the cause of
the fusion of church and state and in the name of "family values"
that, it now turns out, few of the sulky royal brood seem able or
willing to maintain.</TE>
<TE>   In earlier days it was believed that the affliction of scrofula
("the King's evil") could be cured by a touch from the reigning
monarch. (The great loyalist Dr. Samuel Johnson was taken to be
"touched," but it didn't work for him.) Nowadays, this superstition
seems to operate in reverse. Ted Hughes and Andrew Motion were quite
good poets before they became poets laureate and began to write
abject piffle in praise of the throne. Shawcross was an outstanding
reporter and human rights champion before he took on this
knee-weakening assignment. One day he will wake up, shake himself and
realize that the attempt to breed a ruling family is as silly, and in
some ways as sinister, as the attempt to breed a ruling race.
Meanwhile, Paine's struggle against the Hanoverian usurpers has only,
so far, been victorious in the former American colonies, where the
descendants of George III are viewed with proper affectionate
condescension as archaic celebrity freaks.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>Robert Lee Hotz is a science writer for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether we worship it in the marketplace for its ability to create
wealth or as the purest expression of human endeavor, science is a
god of unintended consequences. Not since the innovations of
astronomy during the Renaissance have unexpected technical advances
spurred so many arguments over the meaning of life and our place in
the universe.</LD>
<LD>   Legislators today routinely grapple with human cloning, genome
sequencing and embryonic stem cells. Advances on the horizon in
neuroscience and genetics promise even more control over human
biology and behavior. Congress is only at the beginning of a debate
over how much freedom people should have to alter not only their own
progeny but also the fundamental biological character of the human
species.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine a world in which human embryos are tailored for desirable
hereditary traits, one in which children are customized with packets
of genetic aptitudes and talents that can be switched on or off at
the age of consent. Imagine a time when even normal variations in
behavior become conditions to be treated medically by mind-altering
drugs: the more sophisticated descendants of today's Prozac and
Ritalin. Imagine as well a world in which people use computer chips
implanted in the brain to boost mental abilities. This is a future in
which we may become something more and something less than we are.</LD>
<TE>   This revolution in biology is no less worrisome because it is
uncertain. No one can know where innovation will lead. Could any
futurist have predicted that the internal combustion engine would
result in suburbs and shopping malls or that antibiotics would
eventually make diseases harder to cure?</TE>
<TE>   Today, as always, progress moves well in advance of wisdom.
Scientists bridle at any legal limits on their curiosity. Reams of
expert testimony document the special pleadings of medical
entrepreneurs, their desperate patients and researchers who wish to
be left to their own devices. They offer little guidance on how
society should safely navigate this maze of possibilities, and
legislators instinctively reach for the brakes.</TE>
<TE>   In weighing the political consequences of scientific advances, two
of the clearest voices belong to Johns Hopkins University social
philosopher Francis Fukuyama--who was recently appointed to President
Bush's Council on Bioethics--and UCLA futurist Gregory Stock. As
authors of incisive new books on biopolitics, Fukuyama and Stock take
opposite sides of the controversies over biotechnology. One prods us
to press ahead. The other urges caution. If only we could be more
certain which of them was right. Theirs is an argument at the
confluence of possibility and political choice.</TE>
<TE>   Fukuyama, author of "Our Post- human Future: Consequences of the
Biotechnology Revolution," is convinced that only a powerful new
government agency can safely channel what he considers an assault on
the biological foundations of human nature.</TE>
<TE>   "We appear to be poised at the cusp of one of the most momentous
periods of technological advance in history," Fukuyama writes. "These
developments will be hugely controversial because they will challenge
dearly held notions of human equality and the capacity for moral
choice; they will give societies new techniques for controlling the
behavior of their citizens; they will change our understanding of
human personality and identity; they will upend existing social
hierarchies and affect the rate of intellectual, material and
political progress; and they will affect the nature of global
politics."</TE>
<TE>   For those who would look before they leap, Fukuyama has written an
invaluable prescription for government regulation. Rarely has someone
entering the policy arena so eloquently and precisely laid out the
case for political control of emerging technology.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Stock, author of "Redesigning Humans: Our Inevitable
Genetic Future," is certain that nothing can check the impulse to
manipulate human heredity, even if it ultimately means turning
humanity itself into something unrecognizable. Stock relishes the
prospect.</TE>
<TE>   "Remaking ourselves is the ultimate expression and realization of
our humanity," he writes. "We are beginning an extraordinary
adventure that we cannot avoid, because, judging from our past,
whether we like it or not this is human destiny." Resistance, he
argues, is futile. "If there is a window of opportunity for
government to influence the path of these technologies, it is
unlikely to last for long."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed that window may already be closing. Even as Congress
debates bills to ban human cloning, other unsettling bioengineering
experiments are moving ahead. Medical experts are debating whether
they should attempt to cure hereditary diseases by making genetic
changes in human embryos that can be inherited by succeeding
generations, even though many biomedical ethics experts, religious
leaders and researchers contend that such genetic changes are
technically uncertain and morally perilous.</TE>
<TE>   Stock, however, envisions a kinder, gentler eugenics. In his
vision of things to come, reproductive control will remain, in spite
of government efforts, a matter for parents. The love for a child is
a powerful incentive to innovate, especially if the child suffers
from an inherited disease. If science gives doting parents the
opportunity, Stock argues, they inevitably will stylize their
children's genetic makeup, at first only to cure illness but soon
enough to insert new talents or excise undesirable traits. Call it
genetic cosmetic surgery. But Stock recognizes the peril: Driven by
parental fads and fashion, humanity could unintentionally transform
itself into hereditary castes of genetic haves and have-nots, like
the Eloi and Morlocks imagined by H.G. Wells.</TE>
<TE>   But, as Fukuyama and Stock recognize, though the possibilities may
be limitless, our political vocabulary is not. For decades, the
debate over advances in the technology of human reproduction has been
couched in terms of abortion politics and how much control people
have over their bodies. How then to fit clockwork chromosomes,
designer genes and customized neurochemistry into a frame defined
solely by a woman's right to choose and the right to life? The debate
so far over cloning and stem cells has centered more on the troubling
source of these tissues--human embryos--than on where the technology
may lead us. Here, the worry is how we may alter the biology our
children inherit. Perhaps we have a birthright to an unaltered
existence.</TE>
<TE>   This drive to perfect the human condition--is it really anything
less?--touches more than one raw cultural nerve. In the 24 years
since the birth of the first test-tube baby, at least 85 national
bioethics and law reform commissions in 25 countries have debated the
reproductive technologies developed as a result of embryo research.
At least 24 countries have banned human reproductive cloning.</TE>
<TE>   William Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard, and Eric Cohen, a
fellow at the New America Foundation, understand this apprehension.
In their anthology, "The Future Is Now: America Confronts the New
Genetics," they have assembled 60 years of second thoughts about
modern biology's dark side. For those with an archival interest in
the history of this debate, there may be no more useful primer to
conservative arguments over human nature and the limits of science.</TE>
<TE>   On one thing Stock and Fukuyama agree: Ultimately, nothing less
than the character of the human species is at stake. They share a
touching, almost Victorian faith in the power of science and the
inevitable march of progress. Much of what they treat as science is
still speculation. In the end, this is not a debate about science so
much as it is about hubris and half-knowledge. For science can do far
less than politicians fear, patients hope or scientists today claim.
When it comes to supplanting sex and procreation, even the simplest
in vitro fertilization procedures are painful, expensive, fraught
with failure and often emotionally devastating. Even so, thousands of
healthy newborns are delivered every year who began life as sperm and
eggs in a petri dish or embryos frozen in a tank of liquid nitrogen,
without undermining verities of love and the human family.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the advances debated today may never fulfill their
promise. Even apparently healthy clones may harbor unpredictable
genetic flaws that can cause premature death or abnormalities. Stem
cells are surprisingly unstable. For all our newfound ability to
sequence the genes that code for humankind, we still have little
understanding of the biochemical text we read there.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, genes rarely behave in the simplistic way that political
debate demands. The proteins they make are infinitely more complex.
The people they code for are no less unpredictable, for the influence
of the world around us orchestrates the life and death of brain cells
in ways that genetic imperialists are reluctant to acknowledge.</TE>
<TE>   We should take comfort in this uncertainty. As members of a
species defined by curiosity, we always are poised at the edge of the
abyss of the future. Our next step is forever an act of faith.</TE>

<DH>BREAKING THE SLUMP: Baseball in the Depression Era, By
Charles C. Alexander Columbia University Press: 338 pp., $29.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER KAHN</AU>
<BD>Roger Kahn is the author of many books, including "The
Boys of Summer," "The Head Game: Baseball Seen From the Pitchers'
Mound" and "The Era: When the Yankees, the Giants and the Dodgers
Ruled the World." He is visiting lecturer on creative writing at the
State University of New York at New Paltz.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The academic invasion of baseball writing began in 1966 with Lawrence
Ritter's "The Glory of Their Times," a luminous oral history of early
big-league baseball (and early 20th century America) remembered by
the men who played the game. Armed with a tape recorder, Ritter, an
economics professor at New York University, sought out 22 very old
old-timers and shaped their stories with accuracy and compassion.
After that fine foray, other academics swarmed baseball writing,
offering everything from nice, brief studies of forgotten sluggers to
portentous volumes that are a little tough to read.</LD>
<LD>   We have splendid work by Harvard's Stephen Jay Gould, notably his
Joe DiMaggio piece "The Streak of Streaks," and "The Life That Ruth
Built" by the Notre Dame historian Marshall Smelser. But there have
also been books like "The Dodgers Move West," in which Neil J.
Sullivan, who teaches in the School of Public Affairs at the City
University of New York, describes Walter O'Malley's march on
California land, gold, oil and silver as if it were Galahad's search
for the Grail. The results are unfortunate.</LD>
<TE>   The ubiquitous Doris Kearns Goodwin makes a downside appearance
with a 1998 memoir about growing up as a passionate rooter for the
Brooklyn Dodgers. I found her passion commercial rather than
believable and her choice of title, "Wait Till Next Year," simply
appalling. Jackie Robinson's fiery memoir, composed with journalist
Carl Rowan, appeared in 1960. Jack called this book, the best of all
the Robinson volumes, "Wait Till Next Year." Titles cannot be
copyrighted, so there is nothing illegal in Doris Kearns, girl Dodger
fan, cribbing from the bravest Dodger of them all. Nothing nice,
either.</TE>
<TE>   Do I mean to suggest that academic baseball writing is a mixed
bag? Indeed I do. Is Charles C. Alexander's "Breaking the Slump" a
mixed bag all by itself? Once more, indeed. Alexander, distinguished
professor of history at Ohio University, seems a Midwestern
small-town sort of fellow, more than a little provincial in his view
of Joe DiMaggio, the New York media and baseball fans who happen to
be Jewish. He does, however, credit sources. Sometimes he affixes as
many as 46 footnotes to a single chapter. Regrettably, his
methodology is the book's undoing.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball during the Great Depression, which Alexander calls "the
worst thing to happen to the American people since the calamitous
Civil War," was dramatic and full of stress and innovation. Hard
times make interesting stories. Alexander writes that for much of the
1930s in America, "the smell of revolution was in the air." Block
that hyperbole. During the undeniably grim year of 1932, the
Communist Party drew only 102,991 votes out of more than 39 million
cast for the presidency. The Socialists garnered almost 900,000, but
Socialists preached evolution, not revolution. (For a minute in the
early going, I was afraid I would have to wire Alexander that the
Cleveland first baseman who batted .330 in 1934 was Hal Trosky, not
Leon Trotsky.) Anyway, the historical consensus is that FDR's uneven
New Deal and radiant personality kept capitalism secure. Times were
tough, but no one barricaded the boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander is more useful when he reports that 4,337 banks failed
between 1930 and 1933. Scores of ballplayers lost savings. So did
some club owners, including Connie Mack, who responded by selling
star athletes to the Boston Red Sox, which led his Philadelphia
Athletics on to ruin and, eventually, to Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   As lean years persisted, attendance at major league games, which
had reached 10 million in 1930, sagged to 6 million in 1933. The
Dodgers, who attracted a million paying fans in 1930, saw their
attendance shrivel to 434,188. In 1933, the St. Louis Browns played
77 games at home and attracted 89,113 onlookers, not including their
peanut vendors, who were lonely men. Although player salaries shrank
to an average of $6,000, every big league job became a treasure amid
massive general unemployment. "When I made the Pittsburgh Pirates in
1934," Cookie Lavagetto once told me, "five other guys named
Lavagetto in the Bay area come off the home relief."</TE>
<TE>   Competition, more than fierce, was nasty. As Alexander notes,
throwing at batters' heads became almost universal. Needling grew
unpleasant, mixing sexual taunts, which Alexander misses, with ethnic
slights. Hank Greenberg told me Dizzy Dean tried to rattle him
throughout the 1934 World Series by calling him "Moe" (not "Mose," as
Alexander writes). Annoyed, Greenberg hit .321. DiMaggio accepted the
nickname of "Daig," short for dago, as pretty much the way things
were. Blacks were restricted to the Negro League. Women reporters
were barred from press boxes. The times were not exactly free.</TE>
<TE>   The universal need for cash did produce innovation. Night baseball
came to the major leagues to boost attendance in 1935 and took hold.
Radio broadcasts produced 7.3% of big league revenue in 1939, up from
0.3% in 1930. As economic times improved, so did the baseball
business, brightened with such new stars as Stan Musial and Ted
Williams. By 1941, baseball's prospects looked fine--except, of
course, the world was waltzing on the precipice.</TE>
<TE>   Odd conclusions mar Alexander's book. "For some 2 percent of the
U.S. population," he writes, "[Hank] Greenberg was the most important
big-league player so far." When he says "some 2 percent," he's
referring to Jewish fans. This is ethnic stereotyping and, further,
wildly untrue. I knew dozens of Jewish Yankee fans who rooted against
Greenberg because he played for the Detroit Tigers against their home
team. Their "most important big-league player" usually was Lou
Gehrig. Alexander writes that DiMaggio "performed in the nation's
media capital ... and kept on good terms with the press even if he
rarely spoke in anything but banalities." Two gifted journalists,
Heywood Hale Broun and Red Smith, assured me that the young DiMaggio
was a thoughtful and entertaining companion.</TE>
<TE>   For sources, Alexander cites 13 newspapers, five published in
Ohio, where he lives. No Philadelphia Record, where Red Smith told of
Connie Mack's decline. Nothing from Boston, where the press went to
war against Ted Williams. His main New York source is the Times, and
thus he misses the splendid DiMaggio chronicler, Jimmy Cannon, who
wrote for the New York Journal-American and later the Post.</TE>
<TE>   Over a period of 11 years, Alexander says, he conducted a total of
four interviews. Four, although hundreds of people from Depression
baseball survive. In essence, then, everything that appears in
"Breaking the Slump" has been written somewhere else. Ritter says he
traveled 75,000 miles to reach sources for "The Glory of Their
Times." Spring is upon us. It's a nice idea, isn't it, to step out of
the house?</TE>

<DH>THE REPUBLIC OF EAST L.A.: Stories, By Luis J. Rodriguez,
Rayo/HarperCollins: 240 pp., $23.95 JUST ANOTHER POSTER? Chicano
Graphic Arts in California, Edited by Chon A. Noriega, University Art
Museum / University of Washington  Press: 218 pp., $39.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KIRSCH</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The very first story in "The Republic of East L.A.," a collection of
short fiction by Luis J. Rodriguez, opens with the arresting image of
a limousine parked at a curb in Boyle Heights, one of the byways of
the barrio that Rodriguez calls "East Los." The limo, a universal
symbol of wealth and privilege, is seemingly out of place in a
neighborhood that shelters the poor and powerless.</LD>
<LD>   "The unshaven men gather around to put words together about this
wonder on the roadway, to excavate a new vocabulary for this
intrusion that seems to smirk at their poverty, to lay like a diamond
on a garbage-strewn lot," muses the narrator of the story titled "My
Ride, My Revolution." "But still, it's kind of their hostage."</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez himself is devising a language that will enable him to
describe the experience of the barrio to his readers, and he delights
in exploring the cross-wired cultures that sizzle and pop on the
streets of East Los Angeles. The limo driver, whose voice we hear in
"My Ride, My Revolution," for example, is both Mexican and Indian and
proud of it. "We're known for taking on the Aztecs--the Mexikas--back
before the conquista." He plays in a "rap and rock" group called La
Cruz Negra (The Black Cross) whose songs are rendered in "mostly
unintelligible English." And he announces that his favorite books
include the Bible and works by Black Elk, Marx and Jung, even Stephen
King.</LD>
<TE>   "I have a spiritual curiosity that isn't just to fill in the
voids," the young man declares, presumably voicing the author's own
credo. "[I]t's the satisfaction one gets from learning about the
vibrant universe of arts, words, images and ideas that human beings
have created over time."</TE>
<TE>   But Rodriguez understands that a terrible price is paid when, for
example, the bearers of a rich and ancient culture are tempted to
abandon La Virgin de Guadalupe and embrace a pop singer named
Madonna. The point is made in "Shadows," the story of a promising
young man who ends up sprawled on the corner of 1st and Soto streets,
clutching a bottle and begging the passersby for spare change.</TE>
<TE>   "What they saw wasn't just a strange broken man in a strange
broken body," Rodriguez observes. "He was the specter of their
deepest aches, a reminder of what happens when you leave so much of
the old for the new."</TE>
<TE>   But he also shows us figures of valor and courage. "Las Chicas
Chuecas," for example, is the tale of a young woman called Noemi, one
of the "troubled girls" at Garfield High, who survives and ultimately
prevails over the stresses that result from an absent father, a
heroin-addicted mother, a sister whose murder she witnesses at the
age of 8 and a rape that results in pregnancy. She is running with a
gang--Las Chicas Chuecas means The Bent Girls--and Rodriguez explains
that they were "pushed into all kinds of shape by forces stronger
than their innocence could withstand"--but Noemi ultimately finds a
way out.</TE>
<TE>   "Their hearts were bent," writes Rodriguez, "but not broken."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the book, we come upon a story that offers, at last,
the grace and redemption for which he and his characters search so
insistently. "Sometimes You Dance With a Watermelon" introduces us to
Rosalba and Chila, a woman and her granddaughter and invites us to
accompany them on an excursion to the fruit stands of the Grand
Central Market. Rodriguez has already shown us the journey that took
Rosalba from a poor but decent life on a rancho in Mexico to the mean
streets of Los Angeles, but nothing quite prepares us for the magical
moment when Rosalba dances down Broadway with a watermelon balanced
atop her head.</TE>
<TE>   "Rosalba swayed back and forth to a salsa beat thundering out of
an appliance store," Rodriguez writes. "She danced in the shadow of a
multi-storied Victorian--dancing for one contemptuous husband and for
another who was dead. She danced for a daughter who didn't love
herself enough to truly have the love of another man. She danced for
her grandchildren, especially that fireball Chila. She danced for her
people, wherever they were scattered, and for this country she would
never quite comprehend."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez is best known for his memoir of gang life, "Always
Running: La Vida Loca, Gang Days in L.A." His more recent experiences
working with "at risk" adolescents in San Francisco were the
inspiration for his manifesto of community activism, "Hearts and
Hands: Creating Community in Violent Times." But he is, first, always
and above all, a poet and a storyteller, and the tales he tells in
"The Republic of East L.A." are elevated and enriched by his gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Posters are usually relegated to the "margins of art," as one of
the contributors to "Just Another Poster?" puts it, if only because
the poster has been used so often and so forcefully as an instrument
of protest and political activism. Indeed, the very name of one of
L.A.'s own cultural landmarks--Self-Help Graphics, an art collective
in East Los Angeles--says as much about building a sense of community
and promoting self-esteem as it does about making art.</TE>
<TE>   "The poster exists somewhere between the unique art object and the
mass media," explains Chon A. Noriega, editor of "Just Another
Poster?," which serves as the catalog of a traveling exhibition
organized by the University Art Museum at UC Santa Barbara. "It
blends the formal qualities of both in order to reach an audience
neither cares about: urban exiles in search of community."</TE>
<TE>   The point is made in each of the various essays collected here but
nowhere more forcefully than in the 56 color plates and various other
incidental illustrations that decorate the fully bilingual text. The
skeletal figures in a 1975 poster by Ricardo Favela, for example,
evoke the iconography of Mexican folk-art while reminding the viewer
that the Chicano community in California represents something rich,
new and potent: The poster is the work of a Sacramento art collective
called the Royal Chicano Air Force and proposes that the making of
art is an alternative to the gang life.</TE>
<TE>   So, too, does Herbert Siguenza use the traditional imagery of
loteria cards in a 1986 poster titled "Drogas y SIDA" (Drug Abuse and
AIDS), which shows that love, life and family are imperiled by the
bottle and the needle. "No juegues loteria con tu vida" is the
plain-spoken message, printed in both Spanish and English: "Don't
play lottery with your life."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, many of the poster artists aspire to be fine artists,
too, and their work is not always overtly political. But even when
they seek to transcend the wall poster, they are still rooted in
tradition and they still make artful use of deeply familiar imagery.
In a 1988 silk-screen titled "La Ofrenda" (The Offering) by Ester
Hernandez, for example, the image of the Virgin as depicted in
religious art appears as an elaborate tattoo on the back of an
otherwise contemporary young woman.</TE>
<TE>   "The Chicano poster's immediacy and portability, which had made it
invaluable as a political tool," concludes Tere Romo in an essay
titled "Points of Convergence," "also made it a perfect vehicle for
imaging the cultural reclamation process."</TE>

<DH>THE SEAL WIFE: A Novel, By Kathryn Harrison, Random House:
230 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELLER McALPIN</AU>
<BD>Heller McAlpin is a reviewer for the Washington Post,
the Christian Science Monitor and other publications.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After circling the dark secret of her incestuous relationship with
her father in her first two novels, "Thicker Than Water" and
"Exposure," Kathryn Harrison confronted her demons head-on in the
memoir "The Kiss." Anyone who's read this eviscerating memoir about
her affair with her father won't be surprised by the icy intensity of
her latest novel, "The Seal Wife." Harrison is a beautiful stylist, a
master of spareness in the service of over-the-top obsessions.</LD>
<LD>   In her recent fiction, she has gone to enormous lengths--mental
and geographical--to escape her personal story, setting "Poison" in
17th century Spain during the Spanish Inquisition and "The Binding
Chair" in late 19th and early 20th century China. She is skilled at
seamlessly incorporating research into tales of sexual compulsions.</LD>
<LD>   But no matter how far Harrison ranges, her creepy sensibility
travels with her. Despite exotic locales and grisly historical eras,
she ends up not so much escaping her private horrors as mirroring
them. The obsessive love and detached, mute sex she nailed in her
memoir keep turning up under different guises.</LD>
<TE>   She is drawn to things that make most people squirm--whether
incest, foot-binding or her daughter's lice, which she wrote about in
a memorable New Yorker article. Her trademark is to examine these
repellent subjects minutely, without flinching, until she transforms
them through craft and precision into objects of morbidly beautiful
fascination. Harrison is a writer who might make you gasp but rarely
will make you laugh.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Seal Wife," the main character is a weatherman stationed
in Anchorage who becomes smitten with a native woman as mute and
elusive as the selkie of Celtic legend: a gray seal that strips her
pelt and becomes human for one day a year, or as long as her sealskin
is kept hidden from her.</TE>
<TE>   Bigelow Greene is a 26-year-old scientist sent north by the United
States government to establish a weather observatory. The year is
1915, and Anchorage is a frozen frontier railroad town of some 3,000
men and a few hundred women, evoking in its extremes of deprivation
Chaplin's "Gold Rush"--minus the humor. Bigelow is used to storms but
unprepared for the 20-hour mosquito-ridden days of summer, the frigid
20-hour nights of winter, the incessant howling of sled dogs, "like
hideous hymns to the devil," and the numbing year-round loneliness in
this "land that will insist on its strangeness."</TE>
<TE>   Bigelow's salary is insufficient to cover his basic necessities,
so he finds himself strapped physically as well as emotionally. Under
these circumstances, it is small wonder that a willfully mute native
known as the Aleut becomes so all-consumingly important to him. This
bizarrely impassive woman, with her black eyes, black braid and three
black lines tattooed across her chin, is an enigma who drives Bigelow
into a frenzy by her ultimate inaccessibility.</TE>
<TE>   From the first time he visits her hut, bearing a dead rabbit as an
offering, she allows him to copulate with her, yet he is frustrated
by her rejection of affection and all gifts other than fresh kill.
"He's getting what he hoped, he tells himself, but it isn't at all
what he expected, and a desolation seizes him. He's not joined to
her, he can't reach her."</TE>
<TE>   As usual, Harrison's descriptions of sex are severely erotic. She
brings the same analytic precision to bear on her characters' odd
couplings as she does on Bigelow's other object of obsession, the box
kite he is building to send his weather equipment aloft and record
atmospheric conditions miles above Earth. Harrison's restraint pays
off, enabling her to chart the progress of Bigelow's passions without
becoming tedious.</TE>
<TE>   When the Aleut vanishes without a trace, Bigelow reels with
loneliness. He tries to distract himself with prostitutes, movies,
dances and his kite. Eventually, he finds "another focus for his
longing," another mute, but this woman uses her silence not to
preserve her integrity but to heighten her mysteriousness and entrap
Bigelow.</TE>
<TE>   Tension builds incrementally in Harrison's short chapters, written
in a stripped-down present tense for immediacy. Her novel features as
much white space on its pages as the snow-and-fog blanketed territory
they depict. By evoking the legend of the seal wife who can never be
happy on land and by reminding us that "tragedy is humankind's one
talent," Harrison leads us to expect disasters. She delivers several
violent outbursts, including a life-and-death struggle with the wind
and a nasty run-in with a seal. But the most surprising aspect of
this mesmerizing tale about passion's capability to empower and
deflate is Harrison's subversion of our worst expectations.</TE>
<TE>   How astonishing that Harrison, the doyenne of darkness, has her
characters happily flying kites while, on the other side of the
world, she reminds us, a war-torn Europe is "digging itself into
rat-infested trenches." Call it the wonder of love or just the power
of amatory obsession.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `The Seal Wife'</TE>
<TE>   In the dream, he dismembers her. It's easy enough; he's learned
from watching her skin and cut up game. And there is no blood.
Instead, a stream of writing spills from her veins, letters and runes
and symbols he doesn't understand. They pour out in order, like a
Weather Bureau teletype, a cipher he is to translate into meaning.</TE>
<TE>   Except he can't fathom the writing inside the woman. He's killed
her for nothing.</TE>

<DH>THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE: A Novel, By Ann Beattie, Scribner: 284
pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MORRIS</AU>
<BD>Scott Morris is the author of the novels "The Total
View of Taftly" and the forthcoming "April."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ann Beattie is regarded as one of our finest observers of
upper-middle-class urban and suburban contemporary culture. Her prose
is gentle, spare and incisive, and her stories offer careful
psychological profiles of everyday life. Like Updike, to whom she is
sometimes compared, Beattie's beat is how Americans love and cheat,
how families grow and fragment and expire. Her latest novel continues
in that tradition, though with a wonderful exception: She has loosed
a monster in "The Doctor's House."</LD>
<LD>   The novel's first narrator, Nina, a copy editor in her early 40s
living in Cambridge, Mass., comes across as intelligent and inviting,
a familiar enough denizen of Beattie territory. It's easy to like
her, to wonder about her, and she seems an able and trustworthy
guide, but soon a tension develops: Nina's story darkens as it dips
into her past, and her pleasantness and sure-handedness give way to
uncertainty and fear. It's not clear if she is reliable anymore. Of
course, now the reader can't leave Nina: What will she reveal next,
and will she continue to fall apart?</LD>
<TE>   "The Doctor's House" assembles three narrators in an attempt to
sort things out: Nina, her mother and her older brother, Andrew. They
are the damaged survivors of a family life filled with treachery and
even terror. The treachery and terror were provided with sadistic
glee by the former head of the family, Frank, a bully, philanderer
and doctor, in that order. The home he presided over was anything but
salubrious, and as each narrator makes clear, even though he died
long ago, his presence continues to be a frightening one.</TE>
<TE>   The novel begins with Nina worrying over Andrew's promiscuity.
Good-looking and successful, Andrew has suddenly started looking up
all his old high school flames. As Nina learns about Andrew's
behavior, she finds herself returning to their childhood along with
him. It's a painful journey, on the whole, but through it we discover
that Andrew has always been the dazzling big brother. The affection
that Andrew and Nina have for each other is one of Beattie's nicest
touches. They have come through many battles together. Their mother,
according to Nina, was drunk and corrosive all the day long, but that
is nothing compared to their monstrous father. Among many abusive
episodes, we are told of how he once caught Nina and Andrew and two
girlfriends trying to take nude photographs when they were in their
early teens. He discovered them in the basement of the girls' house
because he was having an affair with the girls' mother. In a wildly
edgy passage, he actually attempts to take over the photography
session.</TE>
<TE>   "You would have thought our father was Charlie Manson, there was
so much pandemonium," Nina explains. Frank begins kicking Andrew
around and says: "'Is my son playing doctor? Is he exploring girls'
bodies? Is he getting his jollies with two little sluts? ... With
three little sluts? ... ' " Finally he demands that everyone disrobe,
at which point Andrew stands up to him.</TE>
<TE>   Because Andrew has defended Nina--and others--against her father
for so long, it is no wonder that Nina feels affectionate toward her
brother. She had once been married, but her husband died in a car
wreck a few years after their wedding. "I couldn't imagine myself
anymore as the other half of a couple, so my thoughts went, instead,
to Andrew," she tells us. As Andrew later explains: "When Nina and I
were young, there had been elaborate signals between all us.... We
fought, but we always kept our secrets."</TE>
<TE>   Nina's mother makes it clear that Nina's recollection of events is
too much a case of the siblings against the world. She witnessed
Nina's and Andrew's youth from an adult vantage and consequently is
able to fill in many details. Still, she was long ago rendered a
mostly passive observer due to alcohol, affording her husband run of
the house.</TE>
<TE>   No matter who's narrating, Dr. Frank is a terrifying nut case. He
speaks in staccato bursts of insanely withering argumentation that
make one feel as if he will go on a killing rampage at any moment.
Beattie has created this character with such relish that every time
he appears, he provides a jolt of macabre pleasure. When Andrew
recounts conversations he had with his father, the reader cringes and
reads faster.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe Mom has passed out from drinking too much," he says to
Andrew one night. "That's the thing about women: they like alcohol,
but they can't handle it.... But you can take advantage of women when
they're in this state.... By 'taking advantage' I mean sex, of
course.... But since Mom doesn't seem able to rouse herself, maybe if
you wrote her a note ... and put it on her pillow. Or down there," he
said. Down there, on the floor by the bed, is a pool of vomit.</TE>
<TE>   Beattie never explains the source of the doctor's anger. The rest
of his family has been so shell-shocked by him that he remains an
enigma. It seems as if they are frozen in various states of
disappointment and despair, unable to go on, half expecting him to
return at any moment. We have come to expect a sort of minimalist
sophistication from Beattie, explorations that lay bare the minutia
of everyday living. Old fans will find she has delivered those goods
in her latest offering, but they will also be delighted to find that
she has placed a Frankenstein monster in "The Doctor's House."</TE>

<LD>HER</LD>
<LD>   By Laura Zigman</LD>
<LD>   Alfred A. Knopf: 210 pp., $22</LD>
<TE>   Ever had the pleasure of withstanding the constant intrusions of
an ex-girlfriend in your new relationship? The kind who does whatever
she can to stay in his life? She is what "Her" is about. Elise meets
Donald, traveling by plane on the Northeast corridor from New York to
Washington. Snappy young professionals, they fall in love, become
engaged, move to Washington, D.C., and plan a conspicuously
consumptive wedding. All is joyous until Adrienne, Donald's old
girlfriend, calls to announce that she is moving to Washington.
Adrienne is everything Elise is not: tall, buxom, flashy,
flirtatious, rich and well-connected. "Adrienne was my Chinese water
torture," Elise confesses. "Drop by drop by drop; phone call by phone
call by phone call." Elise the happy wife-to-be becomes Elise the
message-checking, hang-up calling, suspicious woman, the shrew
everyone is so busy hating that they let the guy off the hook
entirely. As for Adrienne, she is a piece of manipulative work,
calling Donald regularly to ask for his help and advice, insinuating
herself into the wedding plans and sharing deep intense memories with
a man she left seven years earlier. The hazards of male-female
relations are Laura Zigman's territory, particularly the ones that
are too trite for most print media other than Cosmopolitan. But ask
yourself: Why are they trite? Answer: Because they happen so often.
Zigman is funny but less so than in her previous novel, "Animal
Husbandry," which was altogether more subtle and inventive.</TE>

<TE>   THE HORNED MAN</TE>
<TE>   By James Lasdun</TE>
<TE>   W.W. Norton: 208 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   Fascinating how the eerie echoes of past authors reverberate
through generations of literature. Or maybe it's true that there is
only a finite number of bones that literature is suited to chew on,
human dilemmas that the best and brightest set their minds to. Can we
ever really understand one another? How can we make love stay? How do
we know who we really are? In James Lasdun's "The Horned Man," it
takes about five pages to smell Kafka in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence Miller is a professor of gender studies at a liberal arts
college in New Jersey. In this capacity, he serves on the sexual
harassment committee. New on the job, he wanders around his office
collecting clues of past inhabitants: a coat belonging to a professor
who died, a book and a manuscript. He's haunted by the ghost of a
larger than life professor who indulged in relationships with his
students and fled to Eastern Europe. His world begins to unravel when
a bookmark seems mysteriously to have changed its place in a book he
is reading. Next, the phone bill reveals calls from his office that
he has not made. Then he thinks he sees his therapist on the street
when she has actually been in her office. Little transgressions,
slips in reality, begin to unravel Miller's assiduously organized
life. Suddenly Lasdun turns up the volume: Murders and sexual
assaults swirl around Miller, who believes that he is being framed
for these crimes. Escalating paranoia increases his disorientation
and the reader's. He becomes judge and judged, in pursuit of demons
in a life and an environment that is covered by a cloud of unknowing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AMERICAN FALLS</TE>
<TE>   By Barry Gifford</TE>
<TE>   Seven Stories: 252 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   The Hemingway generation is almost gone, so it's rare to see a
novel or collection of stories in which an author makes almost no
attempt to explain a character's actions. Barry Gifford is this type
of writer. His characters are more like character actors, and the
result is a kind of sentimental poignancy, a collection of deeply
meaningful moments (usually involving flights into the sunset) that
have almost no clout and no relevance to anyone's life except the
actors'. For example, "Danny sat in the idling automobile, trembling.
It was time to find Yolanda." Which is a shame, because Gifford's
reach across class and place and age and gender is wide. He strays
far from home and is not afraid to use his imagination. But his
characters are disconnected, even from their stage sets. A Japanese
man running a motel in Idaho warns a black man staying there that the
police are after him. A man in Italy pays a ransom for his car and
ends the evening in the home of the robbers, meeting their families.
A bolt of lightning prompts a man to confront his self-hating
girlfriend. A man in a bar is approached by a woman who tells him the
story of her life over a martini and then leaves. Each is like a
captivating play in which the cast simply walks offstage before the
third act, and the audience sits alone, waiting in the dark theater.</TE>

<DH>SAKHAROV: A Biography, By Richard Lourie, Brandeis
University Press: 466 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SCAMMELL</AU>
<BD>Michael Scammell is the author of "Solzhenitsyn: A
Biography." He is writing a biography of Arthur Koestler.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The life and career of the late Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov were rich
in paradox. As one of the Soviet Union's most brilliant nuclear
scientists, he was instrumental in arming the regime with a second
generation of nuclear weapons that undoubtedly bolstered Soviet power
at home and abroad. Twenty years later, as one of the leaders of the
Soviet dissident movement, he played a major role in weakening the
regime and hastening its downfall, by his public support for
political prisoners and by his books, articles and speeches.</LD>
<LD>   From being feted as the "father of the H-bomb," Sakharov went to
being a virtual political prisoner, banished into internal exile,
systematically spied upon and force-fed when he resorted to hunger
strikes. The paradox was all the more striking in that his authority
as a dissident derived in large part from his formidable reputation
as an establishment scientist, while his dissidence reflected remorse
over the consequences of the weapons he had helped to create.</LD>
<LD>   It is an amazing story, a complex moral parable with multiple
shades of light and dark, with elements of a political thriller and a
happy ending, and though it has been told in Sakharov's and second
wife Elena Bonner's memoirs, Richard Lourie has done a valuable
service by bringing these sources together and placing them in the
necessary context in "Sakharov: A Biography."</LD>
<TE>   In doing so, he displays a thorough knowledge of Russian history
and the Soviet dissident movement and, through his personal
friendship with Sakharov during the last years of the latter's life,
he is able to offer a valuable firsthand snapshot of the scientist at
the height of his influence and fame. He also does a good job of
presenting Sakharov's scientific work in terms the layman can
understand.</TE>
<TE>   Like most members of the Soviet cultural elite, Sakharov was a
child of the upper-middle class. His grandfather owned a country
estate in southern Russian, and his father was a teacher in Moscow
and the author of several books on popular science. Born in 1921,
Sakharov was tutored at home until he was ready for high school and
thus was shielded from the ideological rigors of a post-revolutionary
education. Tall and thin, physically clumsy and painfully shy, he
grew up a geek and a bookworm, shunned by most students as naive and
eccentrically absent-minded.</TE>
<TE>   There were two arenas in which Sakharov shone: math and physics,
where his brilliance seemed to rest on a mysterious native talent. It
was enough to carry him into Moscow University just before World War
II and from there to the prestigious Physics Institute of the Academy
of Sciences, where his mentor was freethinking physicist Igor Tamm.</TE>
<TE>   He twice rejected invitations to join the Soviet atomic program
but was given no choice when, in 1948, Tamm was ordered to explore
the possibilities of thermonuclear fusion. Eighteen months later, he
accompanied Tamm to the top-secret "Installation" in far-off
Kazakhstan, where he was to spend the next 18 years working on the
hydrogen bomb.</TE>
<TE>   As Lourie demonstrates, Sakharov's motives for accepting such work
were both patriotic and intellectual. America was threatening a first
strike against the Soviet Union, and nuclear physics was, in
Sakharov's words, "a theoretician's paradise. A thermonuclear
reaction--the mysterious source of the energy of the sun and the
stars ... was within my grasp." It was a species of hubris, but he
justified that hubris by producing successful formulas for not one,
not two but three successful nuclear fusion bombs, placing the Soviet
Union--in destructive power at least--on a par with the United
States. A grateful government rewarded Sakharov with three Hero of
the Soviet Union medals and large monetary rewards, and at 32 he was
unanimously elected the youngest-ever full member of the Academy of
Soviet Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   But after the successful explosion of his second bomb in 1955, he
began to experience misgivings about the effects of fallout on the
population at large. At a Kremlin banquet he proposed the first
toast: "May all our devices explode as successfully as today's, but
always over test sites and never over cities." It was met by
Khrushchev and his ministers with an icy silence. Still loyal to the
government, Sakharov lobbied for a test ban treaty, which Khrushchev
accepted, rejected for a while, then accepted again. In the interval,
when the ban was not in force, the Soviet Union exploded its biggest
ever hydrogen bomb, Sakharov's third and last, which he had agreed to
work on despite growing doubts about the morality of nuclear war.</TE>
<TE>   These doubts were eventually expressed in a seminal essay,
"Reflections on Progress, Co-Existence and Intellectual Freedom," in
which he argued that nuclear war could lead humanity to "universal
suicide" and, to avert it, called for complete freedom of information
and the "convergence" of communism and capitalism. Within weeks of
the essay's completion, it was printed in the New York Times, and
within a year it had sold 18 million copies worldwide. Hopes were
high in the summer of 1968 for fundamental change in both East and
West. Those hopes were dashed when the Prague Spring was answered by
Brezhnev's tanks, and Sakharov's essay by his dismissal from the
Installation. To the party, it seemed like a logical step; but in
terms of silencing Sakharov, it was a grievous mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Brezhnev's repression of the marginal freedoms granted by his
predecessor, Khrushchev, led to the rise of a flourishing dissident
movement and, in the course of the next six years, Sakharov became
one of its two undisputed leaders. The other was Solzhenitsyn, who
could hardly have been more different, psychologically and
politically, from the personally diffident Sakharov, and the account
of their encounters is one of the highlights of Lourie's book.</TE>
<TE>   After Solzhenitsyn's expulsion in 1974, Sakharov became the Soviet
government's "public enemy number one." The designation was bestowed
on him by the new KGB chief, Yuri Andropov, after Sakharov was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975. By then Sakharov's public
opposition to the regime had hardened considerably, and Lourie
adroitly demonstrates how Sakharov was radicalized.</TE>
<TE>   From then on, Sakharov was ubiquitous, calling for investigations
of the Gulag and of the practice of confining healthy dissidents in
psychiatric institutions, attending trials and accepting delegations
from all manner of oppressed groups. His opposition was based on
moral and ethical considerations but was also fueled by a
slow-burning personal fury fanned by the vindictive treatment of his
wife, Bonner, and members of her family. Lourie is circumspect about
Sakharov's family affairs, but he makes it clear that Sakharov's
first marriage, to Klavdia Vikhereva, was conventional and that he
was a mostly absentee father to their son and two daughters.</TE>
<TE>   His second marriage, after Klavdia's death from stomach cancer,
was a genuine love match. Bonner was (and still is) a firebrand, the
daughter and granddaughter of revolutionary activists, and she
brought him not only a new family but also vast knowledge of the
techniques of nonviolent resistance and underground activism. Not the
least of these was the hunger strike, which Sakharov resorted to
first for political causes but which he used increasingly on behalf
of Bonner's efforts to go abroad for treatment of her failing
eyesight and of her children's efforts to emigrate.</TE>
<TE>   These hunger strikes steadily escalated in length and intensity,
particularly after Sakharov and Bonner had been exiled in 1980 to
Gorky, and the most painful parts of this book are the descriptions
of these dangerous and debilitating ordeals. Bonner's role in
Sakharov's dissident activities was controversial. The KGB tried to
play the anti-Semitic card by emphasizing her Jewishness, but some
dissidents also questioned her role.</TE>
<TE>   Lourie shows that Bonner herself occasionally tried--and
failed--to dissuade her husband from hunger strikes, but he doesn't
really tackle the question of how much her volatile character swayed
the steadier Sakharov. When Gorbachev came to power, Sakharov was
released from exile and returned to Moscow as an international
celebrity. An early supporter of perestroika, he accepted election to
the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies as the representative of the
Academy of Science and quickly became one of the leaders of the
political opposition, steadfastly pushing for more democracy and
human rights.</TE>
<TE>   He also launched a campaign to persuade the Congress to abolish
Article 6 of the old constitution, guaranteeing the leading role of
the Communist party, but was defeated on a voice vote. That night in
1989, he rallied his political allies with a stirring speech, ate a
quick dinner, lay down for a brief nap and died peacefully in his
sleep.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50,000 people attended his funeral, and he was held by
many to have died a martyr's death, hastened by his suffering at the
hands of a cruel regime. Many speakers at the funeral likened
Sakharov to a secular saint, and Lourie compares Sakharov, somewhat
extravagantly, to Gandhi, Giordano Bruno and Leonardo da Vinci. More
realistically, he invokes the American nuclear scientists Robert
Oppenheimer and Edward Teller, with both of whom Sakharov identified
himself at one time or another.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, Sakharov was unique, becoming a player in ways that
no nuclear scientist elsewhere could hope to emulate, if only because
none other faced such a degree of repression and none other
experienced a monolithic regime's collapse. As a result he was an
entirely new phenomenon in Russian history: the martyred scientist
(as opposed to poet, philosopher or priest) who was forced from
contemplation into action by the sheer injustice of the world around
him.</TE>

<HD>The Man Who Wasn't There</HD>
<DH>A LIFE IN PIECES: The Making and Unmaking of Binjamin
Wilkomirski, By Blake Eskin W.W. Norton: 252 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUISE STEINMAN</AU>
<BD>Louise Steinman is the author of "The Souvenir: A
Daughter Discovers Her Father's War."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Full disclosure: I was gulled. In 1997 I interviewed child Holocaust
survivor and memoirist Binjamin Wilkomirski for The Times. I still
remember his voice on the phone. It was, I wrote, "soft and kind,
vulnerable and urgent." It was also believable. I had no reason to
suspect otherwise. After all, Wilkomirski's devastating account of
his childhood in the death camps of Majdanek and Birkenau,
"Fragments," was published by the esteemed Schocken Books and had
received the 1996 National Jewish Book Award for autobiography.
"Fragments" came garlanded with superlative reviews. The New York
Times Book Review called it an "extraordinary memoir." In the Nation,
Jonathan Kozol predicted that "Fragments" would be studied as much by
child psychologists as by historians "because it poses questions
asked by those who work with spiritually tormented children
everywhere."</LD>
<TE>   Wilkomirski's memoir, now discredited as the work of an impostor,
has been the subject of much study, but not for the reason Kozol
predicted. Wilkomirski's story aroused the suspicion of a Swiss
writer, Daniel Ganzfried (the son of a Holocaust survivor), who
published an expose of Wilkomirski's true origins in the Swiss paper
Weltwoche in 1998. Philip Gourevitch wrote a lengthy article on the
Wilkomirski affair for the New Yorker. A Swiss historian named Stefan
Maechler was commissioned by the publishers of "Fragments" to conduct
a full investigation into Wilkomirski's life. Maechler's book, "The
Wilkomirski Affair: A Study in Biographical Truth," came out in
paperback last year.</TE>
<TE>   Now there is another take on the subject, Blake Eskin's "A Life in
Pieces: The Making and Unmaking of Binjamin Wilkomirski." A reporter
for the Forward and a commentator for the public radio program "This
American Life," Eskin has written a meditation on identity, memory
and the search for authenticity that is riveting and profound.</TE>
<TE>   What makes this book different in approach from the others is that
Eskin's relationship to Wilkomirski's bewildering deception is rooted
in the personal. On his mother's side, the family name was originally
Wilkomirski. (After the family immigrated to the United States from
Riga, Latvia, the name was Anglicized to Wilbur.)</TE>
<TE>   When Eskin first encounters a description of Wilkomirski's book,
he wonders if he's found a link to a family past sundered by
emigration and the Holocaust. When Wilkomirski, a Swiss citizen,
comes to New York on a book tour, he accepts an invitation to visit
the extended Wilbur family (including both Orthodox and secular Jews,
some of whom had never met one another). The scene jump-starts the
book: Eskin's aged cousin Miriam from Brooklyn pores over worn photos
from Riga with the supposed Holocaust survivor.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkomirski had written of being not much more than a toddler when
he saw his father shot and killed. He writes that he was then
dispatched to the camps. He claims to have been too young when he was
separated from his parents to remember details of his early years.
His memories, he writes, are "mostly a chaotic jumble." On the other
hand, Eskin's family history is well documented--at least after
emigration to America. When it comes to their exact European origins,
however, Eskin's family can't really be certain who they are either.
The history of the Wilkomirskis is oral and imprecise. "It's strange
to admit that authenticity was something we craved," writes Eskin.
How does one maintain an authentic sense of one's past?</TE>
<TE>   Though Wilkomirski ultimately turns out to be a fraud, his
incarnation as a possible relative catalyzes Eskin's search for
family history and coherence--the emotional theme of the book.</TE>
<TE>   Eskin chronicles how "local and literary" doubt finally collided
in Wilkomirski's case. He relates his own considerable efforts,
before all the facts were in, to give Wilkomirski the benefit of the
doubt.</TE>
<TE>   He describes how his mother's desire to find living relatives
blinded her to information that increasingly suggested Wilkomirski
wasn't one of them. Eskin writes: "I felt like the better reporter,
yet her compassion for Binjamin made her the better human being."
Eskin acknowledges that trauma can cloud memory. He understands that
the believability of Holocaust testimony was "a source of anxiety for
its victims even before they knew whether they would survive to tell
their stories." A Jewish archivist in Riga reminds him of a sad
truth: "Every person who survived, who was a priori condemned to
death, his story was unbelievable." Partly for these reasons, as long
as it was possible, Eskin was willing to grant Wilkomirski an "...
extralarge helping of inconsistency. Some of his memories may be
unreliable--after all, he's human--but his story must have some
kernel of truth to it; even a confirmed masochist would never invent
such a life for himself."</TE>
<TE>   Which apparently turns out to be what Wilkomirski did: He
appropriated the Holocaust as a metaphor for his personal torment.
Born Bruno Grosjean (later called Bruno Doessekker), the author of
"Fragments" was abandoned by his young mother. He spent part of his
childhood in an orphanage and a foster home. But the orphanage and
foster home were not in war-ravaged Poland, as he claimed, but in
comfortable Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkomirski's deception falls hardest on those who did suffer
through the camps, particularly those child Holocaust survivors who
faced doubt and disbelief when telling their stories. When
Wilkomirski's deception is finally unraveled, Eskin also feels taken.
Though he had questioned whether Wilkomirski was a relative, he had
never seriously considered the possibility that he was not even a
Holocaust survivor. He attends an annual meeting of child survivors
in Prague to look for Wilkomirski, though, he admits, "what that
means is not so simple anymore."</TE>
<TE>   When he finally brings himself to watch the videotaped testimony
of a bona fide child survivor, however, he is quickly engrossed. "I
did not want to fast-forward and I could not push stop."For the first
time since doubting Wilkomirski's story, he is able to open himself
to the story of a child survivor.</TE>
<TE>   He observes that the real survivor's testimony has "the unedited
quality of life, not the episodic drama of cinema" that Wilkomirski
used in "Fragments."</TE>
<TE>   The characters who populate Eskin's story (relatives, frauds,
historians, cranky journalists, child Holocaust survivors,
psychologists) are a lively and contentious lot. The author has done
a formidable amount of research. A bibliography or index would have
helped in keeping track of all the players and sources.</TE>
<TE>   Eskin is an excellent reporter, and he asks good questions, even
of himself. He writes (of Wilkomirski): "How did the ingratiating,
reverent attitude of the journalists he encountered affect his sense
of himself?"</TE>
<TE>   I'm inspired to dig up the audiotape of my interview with
Wilkomirski. The urgency in his voice is impressive, even knowing
what I now know. I can see I was reluctant to ask him questions that
might cause him more pain. When I did ask, when his voice choked up,
I apologized.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkomirski, Eskin fairly concludes, is a cipher. "Each one of us
made use of Binjamin's story in our own way, and in so doing we gave
him substance, we made him real." We may never know why he did what
he did. To this day, the man still insists he is Binjamin
Wilkomirski. Why? Eskin suggests two possible answers: "Either he
still believes he is Binjamin, or he is a shrewd con artist."</TE>
<TE>   I believed Binjamin Wilkomirski and, I dare say, I was in good
company. In believing him, I helped give substance to his story. Now,
after extensive investigation, the paramount question in the
Wilkomirski case has been settled: He is not the person he said he
was. However, the important issues explored in Eskin's book--the need
to invent identity, the yearning to connect with the past, the
fallibility of memory and the believability of those who suffer
trauma--will long continue to resonate.</TE>

<KH>Summer Sneaks</KH>
<HD>A Chick Flick by Any Other Name</HD>
<DH>Four high-profile movies are rewriting the rules of the old
'women's picture.' Formulaic weepiness is out; girl power and
attitude are in.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Warner Bros. market-tested its new summer dramedy "Divine
Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood," the researchers asked members of
the focus group, "Would you describe this as a chick flick?" For the
men who liked the film, a rollicking saga about a warring mother and
daughter and the mother's lifelong friends, the mere question was an
affront to their manhood.</LD>
<LD>   That label meant the movie was somehow "off-limits for them or
restricting the experience," writer-director Callie Khouri recalls.
"They would say, 'It's not a chick flick. It's a movie about human
relationships,' as if there's some difference. They think a 'chick
flick' means it's a weepy. This movie provokes plenty of tears, but
it's not sentimental. It's pretty hard-core in terms of what it
delivers."</LD>
<LD>   After spending almost a decade resisting the inevitable
pigeonholing that came with her success writing the Oscar-winning,
headline-generating "Thelma &amp; Louise," Khouri is now ready to embrace
the mantle as a doyenne of the chick flick. "I don't think of that as
a negative thing. If it's a movie directed at women, I have no
problem with that whatsoever. Why not? It's a huge audience. Oprah
Winfrey didn't get to be the richest woman in the world by not
focusing on the female audience.</LD>
<TE>   "In terms of feature films, there have always been movies,
'Waiting to Exhale,' 'The First Wives Club,' and what do you know?
They made a hundred million dollars. It's always a big shock, but
there's a lot of women in the world, and if there's a movie for them,
they'll go for it."</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the summer of 2002. A few hardy souls are bucking
sequel mania and the joys of re-creating the testosterone-packed
summers of 1995, 1999 and even 1977, with new installments of the
"Austin Powers," "Men in Black" and "Star Wars" franchises. This does
not mean that the makers of "Enough," "Unfaithful," "Blue Crush" and
"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"--the summer's four major
studio releases about women--don't want to go boom. They do. Only
they're using different tools to set the pulses racing. These are
women's films on steroids.</TE>
<TE>   In the Hollywood of the '80s and '90s, "chick flick" was a
pejorative term denoting movies about women that were soft,
low-concept character studies. Worst of all in this bottom-line
industry, most of them didn't make money.</TE>
<TE>   "What [angered me] is they just talked about films about women
that didn't work," recalls Columbia Chairman Amy Pascal, who was
involved with a range of female-driven projects from the commercial
blockbuster "A League of Their Own" to the unsuccessful "28 Days." "I
called them dramas, not female films. Nobody ever said anything about
'Charlie's Angels' being a chick flick and how terrible it was. If it
didn't work, it was a chick flick."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a host of the most successful movies of the last decade,
everything from "Erin Brockovich" to the all-time champ, "Titanic,"
featured female protagonists and were powered at the box office by
female moviegoers. But those were simply perceived as everybody
movies.</TE>
<TE>   Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan ("Frances") says that studios have
grown increasingly reluctant to make adult relationship movies, the
kind of movies that usually target female audiences. "What everyone
is looking for is the material that if it's done badly will still eke
out its money. Relationship pictures, if done badly, die."</TE>
<TE>   Noting studio resistance to making full-blooded characters "with
skill and dimension," Kazan adds, "Women like to go to good movies
about real people, and the only way you can make a relatively good
movie about relatively real people is to put those people in
jeopardy, not to put them into interesting circumstances which
reflect the real world, but to put them into extreme circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Hence, for this summer he wrote "Enough," a Jennifer Lopez revenge
thriller, the latest in a recent line of such women-in-jeopardy
movies as "Panic Room" and a rash of Ashley Judd thrillers. The
heroine in "Unfaithful" must contend with the consequences of
adultery--her own; the surfer girls of "Blue Crush" are battling
20-foot waves.</TE>
<TE>   A subtext running through these movies is girl power, but it's
delivered without any old-school feminist politics, or often without
any of the messy nuances of real life that characterized earlier
films like "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" or "Broadcast News."</TE>
<TE>   Pascal points to last year's big Columbia hit "Charlie's Angels,"
the chop-socky, butt-wiggling yarn of fabulous girl crime-fighters,
as the prototype for the kind of chick flick she's interested in
making now: "I wanted to make a movie about girl empowerment. That's
what I set out to do, but I put it in a genre where it's a piece of
entertainment and where it can get the point across without hammering
it over people's heads."</TE>
<TE>   "The key is to find a fresh idea and get it to appeal to both men
and women," says Elizabeth Gabler, president of Fox 2000, which is
releasing "Unfaithful." "If you have a women's picture that men are
going to be dragged to, then you're in a tough situation."</TE>
<TE>   What follows is a brief guide to the four high-profile women's
films of the summer. They're more popcorn than pedantic, as Hollywood
has applied the rules of high-concept filmmaking to the world of
chick flicks, presenting women who stride across the screen
self-confidently, and men who are either evil or supporting players
in the girl-centric drama. (The films are listed in order of
release.)</TE>
<TE>   One thing that hasn't changed, however--three of the four were
directed by men.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfaithful"</TE>
<TE>   For years, Adrian Lyne has been the filmmaker feminists have loved
to hate. His '80s zeitgeist film "Fatal Attraction" fueled talk shows
and spawned magazine covers for its controversial depiction of the
aftermath of an adulterous affair, which included a bunny-boiling
career woman, vixen Glenn Close, and a helpless Michael Douglas
trying to defend his family.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the box office success of his oeuvre, which includes
everything from "91/2 Weeks" to "Flashdance" and "Indecent Proposal,"
is powered by a female audience hungry for the transgressive female
fantasies that Lyne serves up with sensual, back-lit abandon. His
films often work as modern parables of the garden of Eden, where the
female character opts to taste the forbidden fruit of knowledge, with
disastrous consequences.</TE>
<TE>   In "Unfaithful," due Wednesday, a happily married suburban
housewife (Diane Lane) embarks on an affair with a young French book
dealer (who, of course, was a boxer in the past).</TE>
<TE>   "I think that women in general are much more open-minded to a
situation like this than men," Lyne says. "With '91/2 Weeks' [about a
woman who has a sadomasochistic affair], you would have thought women
would be outraged, but women were much more open to the idea of
liberating themselves, of being uncivilized for 10 weeks, and being
tactile. I've found that men tend to be much more threatened by this
situation. Why would she have this affair? What is her
motivation?"One of the more controversial aspects of "Unfaithful" is
that's there's not a putative excuse for Lane's character to stray.
She's not married to a monster or even a bore.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what so rewarding, because that's how affairs really go
down," Lane says. "How many times is there a justification, or an
apology, or an excuse? Did the question even come up in Michael
Douglas' press conference? The word 'philanderer' doesn't conjure a
woman in people's minds. The truth is that women have much more of an
emotional risk [in having an affair] than men because they're more
emotionally connected to their sexuality. Would we want them to
separate it like church and state, like men seem capable of? I doubt
it."</TE>
<TE>   "Enough"</TE>
<TE>   Many viewers might not lump "Enough" with such classic social
justice pictures as "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?," "Philadelphia"
and "Norma Rae." But Jennifer Lopez is the first to say she was drawn
by the message of the film (due May 24), in which she plays an abused
wife who straps on brass rings, learns Krav Maga, an Israeli martial
art, and takes on her vicious husband.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody gets into a bad situation, and through the power of you
you can change that. The women-empowerment aspect of it was really
attractive to me," says the actress-singer.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez's stint as a victim-turned-Dirty Harry is the latest in
Hollywood's new favorite genre: "hell hath no fury ... " pictures, in
which the plot turns on woman's anger--righteous anger.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought it was a popcorn movie with something interesting
to say about people standing up for themselves," director Michael
Apted says. "I'd just done 'Enigma,' an arty film, so it's nice to
get a balance."</TE>
<TE>   Apted is another Hollywood pro practiced in the art of the women's
film. He guided Sissy Spacek to an Oscar in "Coal Miner's Daughter,"
a sensitive character study that is hard to imagine getting made in
today's climate. Yet he also directed the last James Bond
installment, "The World Is Not Enough." For this film, he not only
worked on Lopez's character, but also "the James Bond thing," where
"everything is slightly more fantastical than has been done before.
It's the same process to a greater or lesser extent."</TE>
<TE>   For screenwriter Kazan, the subtext of the picture is a little
more ambiguous than simply "chicks kick butt." Indeed, it's a grim
vision of the war between the sexes.</TE>
<TE>   "This picture expresses not only the desire of women to strike
back at men who mistreat them, but it also expressed the men's anger
toward women," Kazan says. "Although the guy is clearly the villain,
some of the things which he says are straight out of the mouths of
people I've known, friends of mine. That's terrifying, but it gives
the picture resonance."</TE>
<TE>   Kazan is married to screenwriter Robin Swicord, who wrote one of
the most beloved women's films of the early '90s, "Little Women."
"Robin said that she would have loved to write the movie ['Enough'],
but had she written the movie, people would have thought it was an
angry woman picture. I could get away with things she couldn't get
away with. I don't know if it's true. It might be."</TE>
<TE>   "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"</TE>
<TE>   As the most classic of this summer's women's films, it's hard to
imagine how "Ya-Ya" got made in today's climate except that it's
based on the best-selling book by Rebecca Wells.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really simple. We loved the book and thought everybody
could relate to different aspects of the story in terms of their
personal experiences with their moms," says Warner Bros. Pictures
President of Worldwide Production Lorenzo di Bonaventura. He adds
that despite its reputation as the Home Box Office of testosterone,
the studio has made "a few of these films over the years." Indeed,
for years in the early '90s, the Kevin Costner-Whitney Houston
romance "The Bodyguard" was the studio's highest-grossing film,
outpacing such staples as "Batman" and "Lethal Weapon."</TE>
<TE>   Khouri is the only female director on any of the summer's women's
films, and Di Bonaventura had to plead with her to take the job.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to get pigeonholed.... Any time there's something
with a woman in it, it comes my way as if I'm some expert on that,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   When Khouri's film "Thelma &amp; Louise" was released in 1991, it
unleashed a torrent of controversy and polarized critics: Some loved
its gender-busting premises, and others found it degrading to men, a
paean to violence and an insult to feminism. A decade later, the
film, in which Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon go on the lam, seems
simply prescient about the ways pop culture would progress.</TE>
<TE>   Like "Thelma &amp; Louise" and "Enough," the plot of "Ya-Ya
Sisterhood," due out June 7, turns on anger, this time between a
mother and a daughter. "If you're dealing with drama and emotion,
anger is the equivalent of a gun," Khouri says. "The Vivi character
[played by Ashley Judd and later Ellen Burstyn] has a tremendous
amount of anger in her youth, and that gets passed on to her
daughter. That's a classic family dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   "Anger is such a part of the human condition. Look at the world!
Anger is just acted out on this huge stage of our life every single
day! In this movie, anger is just the first thing that everybody
deals with, but what they're really dealing with is shame, fear,
disappointment, and yet they're all funny, lovely, loving people.</TE>
<TE>   "When people ask if this is a movie for men, I say it delivers on
the promise of this kind of movie and it packs an emotional wallop.
If you're man enough to take it, go right on in."</TE>
<TE>   "Blue Crush"</TE>
<TE>   The first movie that Oscar-winning producer Brian Grazer made for
his daughter was "Fear," a father's nightmare of what happens when a
daughter dates a psychopath.</TE>
<TE>   His daughter is now 13, and Grazer is making his second girl
movie, "Blue Crush," an extreme sports movie (due July 12) about a
trio of female competitive surfers in Hawaii. "I feel like I
understand and have deep compassion for women and the fact that our
daughters are forced to sublimate the identity.... They're forced to
relay their power, identity and accumulation of knowledge to get men
and I resent it. Anytime I can do a movie that empowers girls, I want
to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Being an avid surfer, he's received every surf script that's
circulated in Hollywood in the last decade, but he found "90% of the
scripts were about men, and it's not very interesting. There's no
counterpoint. It's just really aggressive guys in a really aggressive
world. Here you have the beautiful counterpoint between the innocence
and fragility, the softness of women in a sport that's life or death,
in a male-dominated subculture that's rough and pretty barbaric. To
see them triumph against these critically insurmountable odds--I
think it's poetic."</TE>
<TE>   "The surfing world is particularly sexist and chauvinistic," says
director and co-writer John Stockwell. "When we started shooting, all
the real surfers on the film crew were saying, 'Girls can't surf the
pipeline. Girls can't surf big waves. You'll never pull this off.' By
the end of filming, we turned their heads around. We had girls
pushing the limits of female surfing."</TE>
<TE>   While "Unfaithful" and "Enough" evoke the chasms between men and
women, "Blue Crush" treats men as sideline players in a woman's life.
"It's a girl-with-a-dream movie," Stockwell says. "The way I
approached it was to try to turn all the gender issues on their head.
The guy in this movie is what the girl would have been in a sports
movie 10 years ago. He's the one who has to stand on the sideline and
cheer. He's the one who's the sex object in the film."</TE>
<TE>   Like Apted and Lyne, Stockwell has also forayed into the world of
chick flicks, most notably with last year's "Crazy/Beautiful," a
touching teen drama about lovers from opposite sides of the tracks.
Unlike "Bring It On" or "Clueless," it failed commercially, in part
because teenage girl audiences were conflicted about the heroine,
played by Kirsten Dunst, whom they perceived to be a "slut,"
according to Stockwell.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls are very judgmental about other girls," Stockwell says.
"You have to be careful when you have a female protagonist. There are
certain things a teenage audience will and won't accept. It's not
unlike being in high school. If you start pushing boundaries, the
teenage girls have a hard time relating. Thankfully, I'm not dealing
with that in 'Blue Crush.'"</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say that the girl surfers, with their lithe,
athletic bodies in bikinis, aren't sexy. Admittedly, "that's
something that really appealed to the marketing folks at Universal,"
Stockwell says with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "Universal was very conscious of letting people know that it's not
a Gidget movie. That's the reason the title changed from 'Surfer
Girl' to 'Blue Crush.' If you had 'girl' in the title, it limited the
scope of the audience. They want to let guys know that it's ...
hard-charging and not soft. If guys determine it's a chick flick,
they're not going. Universal wants this movie to bring in everyone."</TE>

<DH>They don't like to be called character actors, but they
often make the film worth watching.</DH>

<LD>"All great actors are really character actors."</LD>
<LD>   --Orson Welles</LD>
<LD>   Remember when an entertaining bit by a great character actor used
to save an otherwise lousy movie? Harry Dean Stanton or M. Emmet
Walsh could turn up, make something diverting out of a mundane
script, and all of a sudden the two hours didn't seem quite so
wasted.</LD>
<TE>   Movies have certainly changed since the days of Hollywood golden
agers Patsy Kelly and Everett Sloane. Nowadays, most actors don't
want to be labeled "character" actors. To some, the phrase seems
pejorative, suggesting a limited range, a tendency to play the same
type again and again, or an inability to break out of the pack and
reach A-level status. (Indeed, some actors contacted for this story
did not want to participate for those reasons.)</TE>
<TE>   "The term as we know it, and most film buffs use it, refers to
supporting players, who tend to play a more colorful range of
characters than the leading man or woman," film historian Leonard
Maltin says.</TE>
<TE>   He cites the classic "Casablanca" as the ultimate character-actor
movie. "Every single person who speaks in that film is colorful and
interesting. That's very rare nowadays."</TE>
<TE>   The studio system that created movies like "Casablanca," and kept
all those supporting players under contract, is kaput. But those
kinds of actors do exist. The best of today's supporting actors help
to make contemporary films better. Especially when the movies
themselves are, shall we say, less than they ought to be.</TE>
<TE>   "There used to be the leading man, leading woman and the
juveniles. The character actors were all the other people: the
mother, the father, the uncle, the crook and so forth," says veteran
acting coach Jeff Corey, whose character turns have spiced up movies
from "The Killers" (1946) to "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"
(1969).</TE>
<TE>   Corey, 87, has taught hundreds of actors, from James Dean and Jack
Nicholson to Jane Fonda and Barbra Streisand. He cites a historical
basis for the concept of character acting. "Shakespeare and the
Elizabethan playwrights believed in the humors of the human
body--some people are phlegmatic, bilious and so forth. In 'Julius
Caesar,' Brutus was a sanguine man, but Cassius was splenetic."</TE>
<TE>   Directors dating back to D.W. Griffith often depended on the same
stable of actors again and again, sometimes playing similar parts.
Ward Bond, Harry Carey Jr., Ben Johnson, Jane Darwell and others show
up regularly in John Ford westerns.</TE>
<TE>   Ditto William Demarest, Franklin Pangborn and Jimmy Conlin in
Preston Sturges comedies. Maltin also cites the Fred Astaire-Ginger
Rogers dance films of the '30s as an example. "People went to see
them for Fred and Ginger," he concedes, "but those films were built
on the shoulders of great comedy character actors: Edward Everett
Horton, Erik Rhodes, Victor Moore, Helen Broderick."</TE>
<TE>   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences created categories
for supporting actor and actress Oscars in 1936. "By the middle
'30s," says film critic and author David Thomson, "it was quite clear
that there was something in the nature of Hollywood storytelling that
[required] the supporting actor. People were being cast to do again
what they had done before: the crusty old teacher, the senior editor
to the young newspaper reporter.... It's very much a notion that the
world is made up of stories about heroes who are surrounded by tent
poles, lesser characters."</TE>
<TE>   So how do you define "character actor" in today's very different
moviemaking environment? There's the quirky, always interesting
fellow (Steve Buscemi, Jim Broadbent, Billy Bob Thornton, Philip
Seymour Hoffman); the nut case (James Woods, Christopher Walken,
Bruce Dern, Dennis Hopper); the aging star (Maggie Smith, James
Coburn, Lauren Bacall); the girlfriend/confidante (Joan Cusack,
Janeane Garofalo, Rosie O'Donnell); and so forth.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of what you get when you hire Steve Buscemi or Christopher
Walken or Joe Pantoliano or M. Emmet Walsh is the baggage they bring
with them," Maltin says. "They're not necessarily similar characters,
but we anticipate them doing something interesting. Just as the
audience [in the '30s and '40s] must have felt when they saw Eugene
Pallette or Allen Jenkins or Frank McHugh."</TE>
<TE>   "Christopher Lloyd, Geoffrey Lewis, Harvey Keitel, Rip Torn, Gene
Hackman, Seymour Cassel--these are men who don't necessarily get the
girl, so we refer to them as character men," says casting director
Mike Fenton, who helped to assemble the casts of "Chinatown,"
"Shampoo," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Raiders of the Lost
Ark."</TE>
<TE>   He says American attitudes differ from those of the British. Judi
Dench shifts effortlessly from a brief bit in "Shakespeare in Love"
to the demanding title role in "Iris." "I think that Helen Mirren can
star in a film as a leading lady, or she can play Aunt Tillie,"
Fenton says. "It doesn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   Thomson agrees: "There's a tradition in British repertory theater
where you would engage a star, and in a season he might play a couple
of very big parts, but he also might play a couple of very small
parts.</TE>
<TE>   "That feeling of versatility and dedication to the group
enterprise is very important to the supporting actor," Thomson
continues, "because he or she knows that they're not dominant. But
they know they're valuable, and they have to be content with that,
with a very much reduced level of pay."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "the industry is almost driving character actors out of
existence," Maltin contends. "What happens is, when someone gets some
notice, some real attention, their salary goes up."</TE>
<TE>   But with major stars now demanding $10 million to $20 million for
the lead roles, there's little money left for supporting actors.</TE>
<TE>   Maltin cites a recent case in which a veteran character actor was
approached about a big-budget film and told that the deal was $3,000
a week, "take it or leave it," because of a deal with the entire
supporting cast. He took it, because he wanted the work, even though
it was far below his usual asking price.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson's favorites--the Thelma Ritters, Agnes Mooreheads and Akim
Tamiroffs--aren't around anymore. But neither, for the most part, is
the need for a character "type" to play endless variations on a
single theme. Today's supporting actors are expected to be trained,
smart and versatile.</TE>
<TE>   Adds Fenton: "Not everybody can star in the movie. The rest of the
people are the characters supporting the stars. They may be leading
people in type, but they are the character actors. They are the
people who make the movie work."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the industry's best supporting players are appearing in
this year's summer movies:</TE>
<TE>   Peter Stormare</TE>
<TE>   He may be the only actor whose resume includes Ingmar Bergman,
Jerry Bruckheimer and the Coen brothers. Currently on view as Ingvar,
Julia Louis-Dreyfus' mysterious neighbor on NBC's "Watching Ellie,"
Stormare will be featured in four films this summer: "Windtalkers,"
"Minority Report," "The Tuxedo" and "Bad Company."</TE>
<TE>   The 48-year-old Swede began his career on stage, taking direction
from Bergman for 11 years in Sweden's Royal National Theatre. But it
was as Buscemi's blond, silent partner in Joel and Ethan Coen's
"Fargo" (1996) that he was first widely noticed.</TE>
<TE>   In Bruckheimer's summer '98 blockbuster "Armageddon," Stormare got
laughs as the Russian cosmonaut who nearly gets Bruce Willis' team
killed during a refueling stop. He also played the nice guy in love
with Bjork in "Dancer in the Dark" and Lena Olin's abusive husband in
"Chocolat" (both 2000).</TE>
<TE>   "I don't envy Bruce Willis or Schwarzenegger or Banderas or Cage
or Clooney," Stormare says. "They have to have the same hairdo and
the same clothes in every movie, whether it's in outer space or if
it's a movie about dinosaurs. I like what I'm doing. I feel rewarded
when people say, 'Oh, that's not you in that movie.' Some people
think I'm working at the local Sav-on."</TE>
<TE>   Liev Schreiber</TE>
<TE>   Of all the cast members in the "Scream" movies, perhaps only
Schreiber has gone on to a substantial, wide-ranging career in
respected movies.</TE>
<TE>   He was Stuart Besser, the time-traveler who makes Meg Ryan and
Hugh Jackman's love affair possible, in the holiday hit "Kate &amp;
Leopold." He was nominated for an Emmy for his portrayal of Orson
Welles in "RKO 281," the 1999 HBO movie about the making of "Citizen
Kane." And he was part of the Canadian team that helped free unjustly
imprisoned Denzel Washington in "The Hurricane" (1999).</TE>
<TE>   Schreiber doesn't dismiss his appearances as Cotton Weary in the
horror trilogy. "They probably increased my exposure to a great
degree. A lot of people saw those films that might not have seen me
do 'Hamlet' at the New York Shakespeare Festival," he says with a
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the 34-year-old New Yorker plays John Clark, a CIA
operative with a pivotal role in the Tom Clancy thriller "The Sum of
All Fears." Smart, ruthless and ready (but reluctant) to kill if
necessary, Clark is an American James Bond minus the wisecracks and
martinis. There is already talk of spinning off his character into
his own films, so Schreiber may have a chance to tackle the role
again.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think of myself as a character actor," he says. "All
actors play characters. That's what we do. These are definitions of
the industry that have little to do with acting. You are contracted
to play a part and you play that part regardless of how big or small
it is. Paul Newman, his whole career, thought he was a character
actor, and he's one of the most well-known leading men ever."</TE>
<TE>   Seth Green</TE>
<TE>   He used to be Oz, the guitar-playing werewolf on "Buffy the
Vampire Slayer." Then he was Scott, the mouthy son of Dr. Evil in the
original "Austin Powers" spy spoof in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Green's stock has been rising, with a role in the hit
teen comedy "Can't Hardly Wait" (1998), a reprise of his Scott Evil
character in "The Spy Who Shagged Me" (1999), and meatier roles in
two of last summer's films: "America's Sweethearts" and "Rat Race."</TE>
<TE>   Now he's returned to TV as production assistant Jimmy Bender on
Fox's puppet-show sendup "Greg the Bunny" and back for a third time
as Scott Evil in the new "Austin Powers" sequel.</TE>
<TE>   The 28-year-old redhead admits that he had reservations about
doing both "Austin Powers" sequels. "Is this worth doing? Is this
going to be funny? Is this somebody trying to capitalize on an
established thing? I read the script and I was just delighted that it
had been so well thought-out. They don't come from a place of 'how
can we tell the same jokes again?'"</TE>
<TE>   Green is now playing James St. James, a fixture on the '90s New
York club circuit, in "Party Monster," the true story of party
promoter and convicted killer Michael Alig (who's played by Macaulay
Culkin). "It's a very challenging thing that I'm really excited about
and afraid of at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Pruitt Taylor Vince</TE>
<TE>   Don't call Vince a character actor. "I hate that term," he says,
"because I know what it means: You're going to play the best friend
or the creep or the clown, but you're never going to be the guy."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, he says, "I've been here 15 years and to this
day, I'm still officially classified as, 'We don't know what to do
with him.'"</TE>
<TE>   A handful of directors have known what to do with the 41-year-old
Baton Rouge, La., native. He was the small-town sheriff who catches
up with Renee Zellweger in "Nurse Betty" (2000); the down-and-out
jazz musician who relates "The Legend of 1900" (1999); and what he
calls "the sweet but slow guy" opposite Paul Newman in "Nobody's
Fool" (1994).</TE>
<TE>   Vince won a 1997 Emmy for his chilling portrayal of a vigilante
killer on "Murder One." He enjoyed a rare leading role in the 1995
Sundance favorite "Heavy," playing a lovelorn pizza chef.</TE>
<TE>   Director Andrew Niccol cast him in this summer's "Simone" as a
low-rent Bob Woodward, the trench-coated investigative reporter for a
sleazy tabloid who is out to discover Hollywood's best-kept secret:
the location of the title character, a mysterious beauty being kept
under wraps by movie director Al Pacino. Later this year, in
"Trapped," he will play sidekick to kidnapper Kevin Bacon.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been typecast in certain ways," he concedes, "but in a good
way, I've never been famous for one movie. So I've been able to fly
under the radar and play a lot of different things. I want one of
those old-fashioned careers that last 40 years, not four."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Shalhoub</TE>
<TE>   Many observers felt that Shalhoub should have been nominated for
an Oscar for his role in last year's Coen brothers' film, "The Man
Who Wasn't There." As big-city lawyer Freddy Riedenschneider, who
shows up to represent accused murderer Frances McDormand, he
energized the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "Every once in a while you get lucky, like with the Coen
brothers," Shalhoub says. "That happened to be a period, the 1940s,
that fits me very well." ("Man" was set in 1949; his earlier Coen
brothers film, "Barton Fink," was also set in the '40s.) Shalhoub,
48, has been lucky a lot, especially in the past five years.</TE>
<TE>   He enjoyed a brief role in the 1997 sci-fi comedy "Men in Black"
as Jeebs, an alien weapons dealer. He reprises that role in this
summer's sequel, although, Shalhoub says, "he looks somewhat
different because he's degenerated even more, having had his head
blown off several times between movies."</TE>
<TE>   Since playing Antonio, the Italian cab driver on the long-running
series "Wings," he has won attention as an uncompromising chef in
Stanley Tucci's "Big Night" (1996), the strangely non-Asian crewman
Fred Kwan in "Galaxy Quest" (1999) and a street prophet in the
current Angelina Jolie film "Life or Something Like It."</TE>
<TE>   Shalhoub returns to TV this summer in the title role of the USA
series "Monk," about an ex-police detective who suffers from
obsessive-compulsive disorder. "I wanted to have a series with a part
that was really odd and challenging, and this affords me that," he
says, "because the guy is so messed up."</TE>
<TE>   Anna Friel</TE>
<TE>   Friel is still building a profile in the U.S., but she's already
famous throughout England for her character on a nighttime soap,
described by one writer as "a murderous, sexually abused lesbian" who
gave British TV its first two-woman smooch.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, she's done Dickens for the BBC ("Our Mutual Friend,"
which aired on "Masterpiece Theatre" in 1999), made a splash on
Broadway (in "Closer," which won her a Drama Desk Award) and appeared
in two American films, neither of which was widely seen: "A Midsummer
Night's Dream" (1999), in which she played Hermia opposite Kevin
Kline and Michelle Pfeiffer; and the Barry Levinson comedy "An
Everlasting Piece" (2000), in which she played the feisty girlfriend
of an Irish wig salesman.</TE>
<TE>   Friel, 25, is hoping her next role will bring her a bit more
attention. She stars with Michelle Williams ("Dawson's Creek") in "Me
Without You," a film about the ups and downs of two best friends over
three decades in England. She describes her character as "an
incredibly complex teenager who uses her body to get what she wants,
someone who's very confused and terribly needy."</TE>
<TE>   She wants to be "a bit more known in America" and she's on her
way: She's now in Montreal shooting "Timeline," an $80-million
time-travel tale directed by Richard Donner and written by Michael
Crichton.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if she considers herself a character actor, she replies,
"Yeah! Hopefully a pretty one."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Cooper</TE>
<TE>   Cooper likes to do his research before shooting starts. "Half the
joy for me--if it's called for, if it's a historical piece--is doing
the homework," he says, "sitting down in the easy chair night after
night and learning about this character or analyzing the script."</TE>
<TE>   Many of his best-known roles have benefited from Cooper's
meticulous preparation, beginning with his first film, John Sayles'
West Virginia miners' union saga, "Matewan" (1987). He was also the
Texas border-town sheriff in Sayles' "Lone Star" (1996), the stern
father figure in "October Sky" (1999) and the rigid, homophobic
ex-Marine in 1999's best picture Oscar winner, "American Beauty."</TE>
<TE>   But it pains the 50-year-old Missouri native when his work is
chopped and a once-rich character portrait loses much of its nuance.
On "American Beauty," for example, "a good 40% to 50% of my work was
cut out of that film. It was just devastating," Cooper says.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, he plays the chief of a secret operations unit at
CIA's Langley headquarters in "The Bourne Identity," an action
thriller starring Matt Damon that's based on a Robert Ludlum novel.
Later this year, he will play orchid-cloning schemer John Laroche in
the complex "Adaptation," from the "Being John Malkovich" team of
director Spike Jonze and writer Charlie Kaufman.</TE>
<TE>   "When I go to a film, I don't necessarily want to be entertained,"
Cooper says. "I want those characterizations and story to really take
me on a trip. I want to be completely engrossed in the story, as
opposed to seeing a bunch of pretty faces and a bunch of tricks up on
the screen."</TE>
<TE>   Danny Trejo</TE>
<TE>   Trejo is not the only actor in Hollywood with a criminal record.
But he may be the only one who has turned a decade in state prison on
drug and robbery convictions into a steady stream of bad-guy roles
for 17 years.</TE>
<TE>   With his weather-beaten face, tattooed chest and arms, and
frightening scowl, the 57-year-old doesn't have to act much. "I look
like a bad guy," he points out. "I don't look like a guy named Todd."</TE>
<TE>   He's softening his image just a bit with his recurring role in the
"Spy Kids" films as Uncle Machete, who started out as a tough-guy
gadget-maker but who came to the rescue at the end of last year's
original film. (He's hoping there will soon be an Uncle Machete
action figure.)</TE>
<TE>   Trejo has worked regularly for his cousin, director Robert
Rodriguez: in the "Spy Kids" movies, the "From Dusk Till Dawn"
vampire trilogy and the upcoming "Desperado" sequel, "Once Upon a
Time in Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   He was also a convict in the Chicano gang epic "Bound by Honor"
(1993), a thug in "Heat" (1995) and a rapist in "Con Air" (1997).</TE>
<TE>   Trejo got into the movies through what he calls his real job,
counseling recovering drug and alcohol abusers like himself. It
happened on the set of "Runaway Train" (1985), where he was spotted
and asked if he could play a convict. He also wound up training actor
Eric Roberts as a boxer. "Most of the actors in Hollywood have never
even been in a fight," he says, mimicking their usual response to his
queries: "Are you kidding? I went to Harvard."</TE>
<TE>   Jill Clayburgh</TE>
<TE>   Best-known for her starring roles of the late '70s, including
back-to-back best actress Oscar nominations for "An Unmarried Woman"
(1978) and "Starting Over" (1979), Clayburgh has made a comeback in
recent years, often in supporting roles on television.</TE>
<TE>   She currently plays the eccentric socialite mom on NBC's "Leap of
Faith," and before that was a mom on two short-lived series in the
'98-'99 season. She has also played Ally McBeal's mother on the Fox
series.</TE>
<TE>   Her new film, the $500,000 indie "Never Again," is about two
people in their 50s who happen to meet in a gay bar: Jeffrey Tambor's
character, single for three decades, thinks he may be gay;
Clayburgh's is a single mother experiencing empty-nest syndrome.
"It's pretty raunchy and 'out there' and ultimately extremely funny,"
says Clayburgh, 58. "It's about possibilities and what can happen in
people's lives." Rather than capitalizing on her late '70s success
with more high-profile commercial films, she worked with Bernardo
Bertolucci ("La Luna," 1979), Costa-Gavras ("Hanna K," 1983) and
Andrei Konchalovsky ("Shy People," 1987), none of which were
successful. "It was just who I was at the time," she says. "Now I
look back and think, I don't know if I would have done that. But the
adventure of making movies is really very important to me. Those were
very adventurous projects."</TE>
<TE>   David Ogden Stiers</TE>
<TE>   He's played King Lear and conducted symphony orchestras. He was
Maj. Winchester for six seasons on TV's "MASH." He's also done five
Woody Allen movies, notably as the criminally minded hypnotist in
last year's "Curse of the Jade Scorpion."</TE>
<TE>   But Stiers has also secured a unique kind of fame with the younger
set, performing voices in five animated Disney features, including
1991's "Beauty and the Beast" (also, "Pocahontas," "Hunchback of
Notre Dame" and "Atlantis"). In this summer's "Lilo &amp; Stitch," he is
the voice of Jumba Jookiba, an alien scientist--with a Russian
accent, Stiers notes--whom Disney publicity describes as "a bit of a
loudmouth with some serious anger-management issues."</TE>
<TE>   Is voice-over character acting different from performing in front
of a camera? "My notion is that it all starts in the same place. I
don't care if you're doing a VW commercial or Euripides," says
Stiers, 59.</TE>
<TE>   "There is an elevation of emotion, spirit, audibility, that
happens particularly in classical theater," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you're unafraid on stage to do the storm scene in 'Lear' or
be the ghost in 'Hamlet,' you can summon all those images of size and
space and vividness in front of a microphone."</TE>

<HD>A Traveling Trove of Latino Riches</HD>
<DH>Show pulls together pieces that span miles, centuries.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A deliriously decorated bauble hangs from the ceiling at the entry to
the exhibition "Arte Latino: Treasures From the Smithsonian American
Art Museum," just off the main lobby of the Palm Springs Desert
Museum. Pepon Osorio's glass chandelier is encrusted with a fanciful
jumble of pearls and colored beads, plastic swans and dolls, toy palm
trees and even a few religious figures, including a priest and St.
Christopher.</LD>
<LD>   According to the Smithsonian's exhibition catalog, the artist
considers chandeliers to be a symbol of pride in his Puerto Rican
neighborhood in New York. Furthermore, his mother had been a cake
decorator, so his artwork ties together both references.</LD>
<LD>   Such personal touches mark many of the 60 works included in this
exhibition, the highlights of the Latino collection in the
Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. When it shut down for
a five-year renovation in January 2000, the museum decided to send
its collections on tour rather than relegate them to storage. "Arte
Latino," one of the eight traveling exhibitions the curators
organized, makes its sole Southern California appearance at the
Desert Museum.</LD>
<TE>   The collection and the exhibition span 300 years, but the
Washington museum only recently began to focus on Latino art--seeking
work by artists living in the U.S., both immigrant and native-born.
"We have been collecting Latino artists since the '70s," says
Virginia Mecklenburg, senior curator at the Smithsonian American Art
Museum, "but it was collecting the occasional piece."</TE>
<TE>   Then something from California gave them a jolt. In 1992 the
museum presented "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation,
1965-1985," which had originated at the Wight Art Gallery at UCLA.
"It demonstrated to us," Mecklenburg says, "that there was a whole
body of art we in Washington didn't have access to very often."</TE>
<TE>   The Smithsonian acquired several pieces from the show, including a
painting by Carmen Lomas Garza ("Bed for Dreams"), an altar table by
Emanuel Martinez ("Farm Workers' Altar") and a multimedia
installation by Amalia Mesa-Bains ("An Ofrenda for Dolores del Rio").
Then in 1997, Teodoro Vidal, a Puerto Rican scholar and author ,
donated a number of historical pieces from his homeland to the
museum, including two of the oldest works in its collection, "Saint
Barbara," from 1680-90, and the painted wood statue "Our Lady of
Sorrows," from 1675-1725.</TE>
<TE>   "It gave us this incredibly rich collection of Puerto Rican art
from the 17th through 19th centuries, it was a major addition,"
Mecklenburg says. "And once you get moving, the process has a
momentum."</TE>
<TE>   That momentum is what the Smithsonian hopes to demonstrate with
"Arte Latino."</TE>
<TE>   Each museum that presents "Arte Latino" can hang the show as it
sees fit, given different curatorial approaches as well as gallery
configurations. The Desert Museum's director of
collections/exhibitions, Katherine Hough, decided to approach the
artworks thematically.</TE>
<TE>   "I found five separate themes," Hough says. What unites the works
in the entry area are the personal stories they reveal. The works
include Osorio's "El Chandelier" as well as "Screen," a portrait of a
young man behind a lace curtain by Roberto Gil de Montes, who is
originally from Mexico, and, by Cuban American Maria Castagliola, an
assemblage of sealed envelopes that contain the written secrets of
her friends and relatives ("A Matter of Trust").</TE>
<TE>   Hough leads the way to a rear wing where the earliest works in the
show are found. Here, she grouped devotional works, inspired by the
Catholic faith, in two parts: works from the American Southwest and
those from Puerto Rico. The donated "Our Lady of Sorrows," which
reflects 17th century Spanish Baroque influences, shows Mary
half-kneeling in prayer, eyes upcast--an image associated with a
verse in the Gospel of Luke, "Yea, a sword shall pierce through thine
own soul also."</TE>
<TE>   Historical pieces are juxtaposed with contemporary ones. There is
an "Our Lady of Sorrows" created in 1998 by Felix Lopez. Two other
works by living artists--like Lopez, based in New Mexico--are
"Liturgical Cross" by Ramon Jose Lopez, a painted wooden crucifix
with rays of silver metal bursting out between the arms of the cross,
and "Our Lady of Light," hand-carved out of contrasting, unpainted
aspen and juniper woods, by Gloria Lopez Cordova.</TE>
<TE>   In the next wing, there are works that suggest the fourth theme,
"the blending of cultures," Hough says. Texan Luis Jimenez's "Man on
Fire" dominates this gallery-- "drawing upon Aztec themes," Hough
says, "and combining them with the fiberglass, airbrush, slick
low-rider aesthetic." The figure is Jimenez's interpretation of
Cuautemoc, an Aztec hero who rebelled against the Spanish
conquistadors in the early 1500s and was captured, tortured and set
on fire.</TE>
<TE>   Also in this section is Cuban American Maria Brito's multimedia
piece "The Patio of My House," which on one side shows a cutaway of a
cramped kitchenette and on the other side a crib, from which rises a
stylized tree whose roots are cut into. "It's an autobiographical
installation," Hough says, "that kind of leads the viewer from
childhood to maturity."</TE>
<TE>   Other works in this diverse section include rugs woven by New
Mexican artists Agueda Martinez and Irvin L. Trujillo, and
photographs of portraits made from powdered sugar on black paper, by
Brazilian-born Vic Muniz.</TE>
<TE>   The central gallery holds works that explore social issues and
ethnic identity--"the Chicano movement, the feminist movement, gang
members and the graffiti art movement," Hough says. Los Angeles
painter Frank Romero is represented by his oil painting "Death of
Ruben Salazar," which depicts a 1970 incident in which L.A. police
shot tear gas canisters into a bar, killing Salazar, a journalist
vocal about social injustice.</TE>
<TE>   "Farm Workers' Altar" is also in this section. Made to celebrate
the day Cesar Chavez broke a 25-day fast protesting the working and
living conditions of migrant farm workers, the box-like altar is
decorated with stylized ears of corn and grapevines. Painted on one
panel is the image of an Indian woman wearing a peace sign medallion;
on the other side, the crucified Christ.</TE>
<TE>   One area of this gallery celebrates Latinas. "The Protagonist of
an Endless Story" is a larger-than-life oil portrait of novelist
Sandra Cisneros by Chicana Angel Rodriguez-Diaz. Mesa-Bains' "An
Ofrenda for Dolores del Rio" is a kind of cultural altar whose
centerpiece is a black-and-white photograph of the actress surrounded
by a lace shawl, beads, cosmetics, dried rose petals, pink gauze and
swags, and mementos, including stills from movies she starred in.
"The artist is honoring Dolores because she elevated the image of
Mexican women in our society," Hough says.</TE>
<TE>   The renovated Smithsonian American Art Museum facilities in
Washington won't open until 2005. In the meantime, the show will
continue to tour--to the Museum of Fine Arts in Santa Fe for the
summer and then to the Oakland Museum in the fall. When permanently
reinstalled, the Latino artworks will be integrated into the overall
chronological organization of the museum.</TE>
<TE>   At its previous stops, the Smithsonian's "Arte Latino" show has
gotten good reviews but with one caveat--for an American Latino
collection, it has some gaps. The Miami Herald found that the show
"with its chronological breadth invariable cuts corners with
contemporary art."</TE>
<TE>   Mecklenburg recognizes there may be things missing. At the moment,
however, the museum has no specific funding in place to add to this
collection. When she finds what she wants, she'll seek donations.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many wonderful artists whose works are not yet
here," Mecklenburg says. "We want to be looking for the significant
piece, the great piece, the piece that defines the artist and the
social, cultural and artistic issues that they're concerned with and
the world is concerned with."</TE>

<HD>About Two Boys</HD>
<DH>When Hugh Grant and his 'About a Boy' co-star Nicholas
Hoult get together at the Central Park Zoo, it's hard to tell who's
the adult and who's the kid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CLARK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Hugh Grant is being stared at. Paparazzi and fans he's used to, but
this is a bit different. It's a sea lion perched on the edge of a
water tank, its big brown eyes bulging beseechingly at Grant's cool
blue ones. Grant stares back a bit uncertainly, then turns and says,
"Stark, raving mad. They're probably insane, aren't they?"</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the sea lion is looking for a handout rather than a
romantic lead (though it is a female), and Grant is not here, at the
Central Park Zoo on a thundery Friday afternoon, to toss her a fish
or flirt. He is with Nicholas Hoult, the 12-year-old co-star of his
new film, "About a Boy," which opens May 17. Together, they enact the
live version of the chumminess they displayed on film together--the
kind of casual camaraderie that's hard to fake.</LD>
<TE>   In the Universal Pictures film, directed by Chris and Paul Weitz
("American Pie") from the Nick Hornby novel, Grant plays Will, a
38-year-old London slacker who lives off the royalties of his
father's Christmas jingle and steers clear of commitments of any
kind. He has his gadgets, his routines and his excuses. He meets
Marcus (Hoult) through Marcus' flaky single mom (Toni Collette), and
they begin to develop a relationship. Aside from the fact that Will
hates kids, the joke is that Marcus is more mature than Will is, so
Will teaches Marcus how to be a cool kid, and Marcus teaches Will how
to be a caring, responsible adult.</TE>
<TE>   This is not nearly as gooey as it sounds. Grant sees right through
Will's surface charm and wit, having played variations on him before,
notably in his breakout movie, "Four Weddings and a Funeral." At the
same time, he also shares some of Will's surface charm and wit,
which, along with his floppy hair and busy personal life (that
13-year relationship with actress Elizabeth Hurley, that 1995 arrest
for consorting with a prostitute) has obscured the fact that he's a
serious, driven actor.</TE>
<TE>   Grant is nobody's idea of a dad, no more than Will is. His stock
in trade is irony and self-deprecation, not exactly kid-friendly
qualities. But as he and Hoult wander through the zoo (along with a
helpful zoo employee who guides them), it's clear that he connects
with the boy on several levels: as a sports enthusiast, a
know-it-all, a wise guy and a dark humorist. Their conversation
floats along on a tide of sarcasm and non sequiturs, just a couple of
guys hangin' out at the zoo, making fun of the animals--and each
other.</TE>
<TE>   As they get together for photographs by the sea lion tank, Grant
shows Hoult, a sweet, un-actory kid who has appeared on British TV,
how to square up to an imaginary golf ball. Then, seeing a little
girl walk up to the begging sea lions, he says, "Throw that toddler
in," causing Hoult to giggle. Grant really is a very naughty boy.</TE>
<TE>   Question: (following a garden path, midtown Manhattan looming
nearby): So you're showing him how to play golf?</TE>
<TE>   Grant: Yes, we're working on his swing. He's made depressingly
little progress over the last few months.</TE>
<TE>   Hoult: I have. It just doesn't show in my swing. It shows in where
the ball goes.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: Our match will be the evidence of that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have you played together?</TE>
<TE>   Grant: No, we're going to. I told him he had to play better.
Otherwise it would be boring.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is this the first time you've seen each other since the shoot
ended?</TE>
<TE>   Grant: We saw each other last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Hoult: And for photos and all that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You said you hung on his coattails at the premiere in London
because you were nervous about it.</TE>
<TE>   Hoult: Yeah, just a bit.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: It's quite a scene, British premieres. It's not like the
ones here. Huge crowds, like something from the 1950s. A lot of
photographers, a lot of screaming people. It's very odd. Normally
reserved people turn into "The Day of the Locust."</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did you hit it off immediately?</TE>
<TE>   Hoult: I think he was intimidated by me.</TE>
<TE>   Grant (laughing): We were pretty friendly from the get-go.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Your relationship on screen is uncertain for a while, though I
guess you're not shooting in order.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: That's true. But you know what it's like on a film set. I'm
quite intense on a film set. Surprisingly neurotic. Concentrated.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Paul [Weitz] said his job was to get you to lighten up.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: Yes, that's everyone's job in life for me.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did you show him [Hoult] the ropes, acting-wise?</TE>
<TE>   Grant: No, he knew exactly what he was up to. I didn't have to do
any business like that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: This must be the polar bear exhibit. [It's under repair,
inhabited by workmen instead of bears.]</TE>
<TE>   Grant: Fantastic if they'd left one in there by mistake and he
came out and devoured all four of those men. That would be a
spectacle. That, I would pay to see. [To a zoo employee:] We don't
find any animals in your zoo. I don't think there are any.</TE>
<TE>   Zoo employee: There are otters over there, and red pandas.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: We're losing faith in the Manhattan zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Hoult: Strange, I was driving around and I said, "Where's
Manhattan?" And we're here.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: That was a really stupid thing to say.</TE>
<TE>   Zoo employee (pointing to more animals): Otters.</TE>
<TE>   Hoult: They reek.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: They are semi-vermin. They look a bit rat-like to me.
Members of the weasel family.</TE>
<TE>   Hoult: There's this humongous rat in our garden that my dog
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: Have you had any fatalities amongst your visitors here?</TE>
<TE>   Zoo employee: No.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: No one's been devoured?</TE>
<TE>   Zoo employee: No.</TE>
<TE>   Hoult: That happened in London. A couple of people went into the
lion pen.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: The zoo in London, people get killed every week. A keeper
or something.</TE>
<TE>   Zoo employee (arriving at another exhibit): Breezy is a very old
sea lion. She's in her 30s. They only live to be in their mid-20s.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: I think it's rather cynical of you to keep a dead sea lion.</TE>
<TE>   Zoo employee: She's very responsive. She's also blind.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: That's tragic. Why don't you put her down?</TE>
<TE>   Zoo employee: Because she's very happy. She likes to swim. She
goes out on her rock. She's resting.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: Poor Breezy. She looks quite comfortable. I would like to
go lie on her. Very nice. Next animal, please.</TE>
<TE>   Hoult (at another exhibit): Penguins!</TE>
<TE>   Grant: How sweet. They look like they're posing. I like the way
you've mixed live ones with a stuffed one. Those two over there are
clearly stuffed. Do they have any fishing for them to do here? Do you
make it fun for them?</TE>
<TE>   Zoo employee: We're bringing in live trout.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: That's cool. Give them some live trout. How big is an
emperor penguin? I read a whole book about finding the emperor
penguin's egg.</TE>
<TE>   Zoo employee: Four to five feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: Like a child. About your height.</TE>
<TE>   Hoult: I'm not that small. [He's 5 feet, 4 inches.]</TE>
<TE>   Grant: As big as he was when he did the movie. How much have you
grown since the film?</TE>
<TE>   Hoult: Two inches.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: Nah. It's more like a foot. [He switches topics.] I did a
TV thing about the Antarctic expedition in 1912 [1985's "The Last
Place on Earth"]. We actually shot it in the Arctic up in Baffin
Island.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What a cool aspect of your job, to be able to do things like
that. Have you done other stuff like that?</TE>
<TE>   Grant: You know me, romantic comedy doesn't take you to very
exotic locations. In the old days, it was more fun. I got to drive
dog sleds and all kinds of things. I know how to command huskies. You
know, there are no reins or anything. You've just got to shout at
them in Inuit. "Ahee" means left; "heeha" means right. I never quite
mastered it.</TE>
<TE>   Zoo employee (moving on): Puffins.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: I feel a bit sorry for the puffins. They're just not as
interesting as the penguins. [Pointing to the puffins:] Hideous too.
Someone in Hollywood has hair like that. Horrible. [Outside now, hot,
humid, thunder, lightning, but no rain.] It would really make your
story if one of us were killed by lightning.</TE>
<TE>   Q: It would. It's supposed to be a nice weekend, except you'll be
inside [doing interviews].</TE>
<TE>   Grant: I have a fantastic golf course in my hotel room. I have an
excellent little golf hole. It's like this electronic thing on a mat
with a hole drawn on it. When the ball goes over the hole, it makes
the gurgling sound of a hole swallowing a ball. Glug, glug, glug,
nice putt. I'm obsessed with it.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did you bring that putting device with you?</TE>
<TE>   Grant: I was given it at the start of shooting [a movie he's
currently filming in New York] to keep me quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Zoo employee (inside steamy greenhouse): This is the rain forest.</TE>
<TE>   Hoult: Where are the animals? There's got to be a crocodile. I
love that program ["The Crocodile Hunter"], but he's a nut case, the
Australian guy [Steve Irwin], and he runs up to them and goes, "This
is a real big one."</TE>
<TE>   Grant: He's always sort of hanging out with dangerous animals.
"Look at that beauty. God, he's biting my arm, get off!"</TE>
<TE>   Grant (stopping in front of a glass case): Oh, tree boa. Look at
that. Let's see if we can make it attack. [Raps on the glass.] Open
your fangs, tree boa. Do you think that's one or two snakes?</TE>
<TE>   Zoo employee: I think there are two in there.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: It's like trying to sort out your telephone cables.</TE>
<TE>   Hoult: Do you feed them live stuff, like mice?</TE>
<TE>   Zoo employee: At times. Crickets. Some of the snakes get mice.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: Is that one about to strike or we could stay here all night
and it wouldn't move?</TE>
<TE>   Hoult (outside again, the heavens about to open up): I was hoping
they'd have a crocodile, but they don't.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: Thanks for the trip.</TE>
<TE>   Q: It was different, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Grant: It was. And we've learned so much.</TE>

<LD>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, sequels may be
Hollywood's biggest compliment to itself.</LD>
<LD>   Among offerings that will soon wash into theaters like a red tide
are "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones," "Men in Black II"
and "Austin Powers in Goldmember."</LD>
<LD>   Each has been the subject of intense Internet speculation about
how closely it will resemble its predecessor, with varying degrees of
secrecy surrounding each production. Hollywood's usual formula is
simply to repeat the previous formula in hopes of doubling the take.
These films, however, were made by people who seem too smart to
simply repeat themselves.</LD>
<TE>   Nor do the rules of sequels from "Scream 2" ("No. 1, the body
count is always bigger. No. 2, the death scenes are always much more
elaborate") necessarily apply. As we contemplated these movies, we
tried to extrapolate what the filmmakers are likely to do--and what a
little wishful thinking could provide.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones"</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: Anakin Skywalker, the future Darth Vader, was a
gratingly chipper 10-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: Anakin Skywalker will be twice as old
and played by future Tiger Beat centerfold Hayden Christensen.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see: How he morphs into the half-man, half-machine
monstrosity of "Return of the Jedi"--but we'll probably have to wait
for "Episode III."</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: Anakin and Princess Amidala had a
baby-sitter/baby-sittee relationship.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: They will develop an older
woman-younger man romance, complicated by the fact that he serves as
her Jedi bodyguard.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see: Amidala singing "I Will Always Love You" a la
Whitney Houston in "The Bodyguard," backed by 'N Sync (rumored in
cameos).</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: The highlight was the "Ben-Hur"-like pod race
between Anakin and vicious Sebulba.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: Anakin to outrace bad guys' spaceships
in an interstellar dogfight.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see: Anakin do his flight training on the Game Cube
or Xbox versions already in stores.</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: The best villain was Darth Maul, the
red-and-black-faced, horned Sith who was cut in half by Obi-Wan
Kenobi after killing Qui-Gon Jinn.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: The best villain will be bounty hunter
Jango Fett, forebear of original-trilogy bad guy Boba Fett.</TE>
<TE>   We like to see: Which earthling ethnic stereotypes will be applied
to new aliens.</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: Samuel L. Jackson did a cameo as a member of the
Jedi Council.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: Jimmy Smits will show up as a senator
who will figure prominently in "Episode III" as the adoptive father
of the Anakin-Amidala offspring who grows up to be Princess Leia.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see: As little as possible of Jar Jar Binks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Austin Powers in Goldmember"</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: Austin Powers, ultimate hipster spy, went back in
time to save the world from Dr. Evil.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: Austin to return to the past, to
pre-secret agent days when he and Dr. Evil were youths at school.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see: Austin explore alternate realities--or perhaps
discover that he is a fictional character.</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: His sidekick was the aptly named Felicity
Shagwell, played by Heather Graham.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: Myers will send up Pam Grier's early
movie career, with Beyonce Knowles as sidekick Foxy Cleopatra.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see: Burt Bacharach, who had cameos in the first two,
promoted to full sidekick status.</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: The villain was bald, padded super-villain Dr.
Evil, with henchmen Fat Bastard and Mini-Me.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: Those three are joined by Goldmember.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see: MPAA head Jack Valenti in a cameo as the true
Mr. Big, with the MGM lion as his pet.</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: Myers played three characters: Austin Powers, Dr.
Evil and Fat Bastard.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: Myers will play four--those plus
Goldmember.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see: Myers go the full Eddie Murphy and play every
character--as long as he doesn't reprise his Steve Rubell impression
from "54."</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: Tim Robbins popped up in a cameo as the president
of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: Michael Caine to show up as Austin's
father, along with cameos by others including Katie Couric and
Gwyneth Paltrow.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see: Sean Connery as the Powers' progenitor, a role
he reportedly turned down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Men in Black II"</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: Energetic Will Smith was teamed with deadpan
Tommy Lee Jones as interstellar immigration agents.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: Energetic Will Smith's new partner
will be deadpan Patrick Warburton.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see: Energetic Will Smith teamed with original
man-in-black Johnny Cash.</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: Hotshot Smith discovered a whole 'nother level to
reality on Earth--including computer-generated aliens.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: More, weirder aliens--including a
two-headed Johnny Knoxville.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see: Rip Torn's Zed revealed as an alien double
agent.</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: The MiBs wielded the memory-erasing neuralyzer.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: Smith will have to find a way to
de-neuralyze Jones, who wiped his own slate clean and joined the
Postal Service at the end of "MiB."</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see: Smith find a way to focus the neuralyzer on our
memories of "Wild Wild West."</TE>
<TE>   In the last one: There were sparks of lust between Smith and
coroner Linda Fiorentino, but the real love story was the bonding of
Smith and Jones as partners.</TE>
<TE>   In the next one, we expect: Smith to have a girlfriend played by
Rosario Dawson--and to be tempted by queen alien Lara Flynn Boyle,
disguised as a lingerie model.</TE>
<TE>   We'd like to see: Smith playing hard to get for a change.</TE>

<HD>Drawing Inspiration From the Gods</HD>
<DH>Stephen Legawiec borrows from world myths to create
uncommon productions for his Ziggurat Theatre.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philosophers from Plato to Paglia have long acknowledged that myth is
society's building block, the barometer of a common world culture
extending back to the cave. But just what place does myth have in
Hollywood, where the high concept is king and humanistic
considerations commonly yield to the youth demographic?</LD>
<LD>   That's an issue Stephen Legawiec, founder and artistic director of
the Ziggurat Theatre, has set out to address, one production at a
time.</LD>
<LD>   During the past half-dozen years, the Ziggurat Theatre has made a
name for itself with evocative, visually stunning productions
inspired by world myths. The company's inaugural production in 1997,
"Ninshaba," featured two Middle Eastern goddesses as central
characters. "Twilight World," mounted in 2000, was a loose adaptation
of the Tereus and Procne story from Ovid's "Metamorphosis." In 2001,
"Aquitania" employed the French legends of Charlemagne as a
jumping-off point for a lighthearted meditation on time and
utopianism. "Red Thread," Ziggurat's latest  production at the Gascon
Center in Culver City, opening Friday, borrows freely from a Chinese
folk tale for a timely parable about a heroic female assassin who
must break her new vow of pacifism to save the kingdom.</LD>
<TE>   Ironically, Legawiec makes a living as a television promo
writer--a professional distiller of high concepts. But if by day he
is a spinner of spiels, by night he's a weaver of tales--the
curiously timeless original theater pieces that he creates.</TE>
<TE>   A multi-tasker with a vengeance, Legawiec has written, directed
and largely designed (sets and makeup) every Ziggurat production
since the company's inception. He comes by his interdisciplinary
skills naturally. The son of noted Polish violinist and composer
Walter Legawiec and Eleanor Legawiec, a secretary and homemaker,
Legawiec was an art major before he switched to acting--a painful
transition, as it turned out.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to two graduate schools for acting--first Cornell, then
Rutgers," Legawiec explains. "They both kicked me out. They thought I
wasn't any good. That was a pretty severe experience."</TE>
<TE>   Experience that later stood him in good stead. "Directing
comprises so many things," he says. "I had a design sense because of
art school and a musical sense because of my father. I think that my
art and music and acting backgrounds all coalesced into the raw
skills that one needs for directing."</TE>
<TE>   Those skills impressed Robert Velasquez, Ziggurat's resident
costume designer, from the outset. "I like Stephen's work because
it's so innovative," Velasquez says. "He writes everything himself,
and his work is so unique. That's the real challenge. You can't just
pull things from costume shops. Everything must be designed."</TE>
<TE>   After his acting school debacle, Legawiec eventually teamed up
with his friend Steven Leon (now a Ziggurat board member) to found
the White River Theatre Festival, a Vermont theater that evolved from
a summer-only venue to a six-month season. During the winter months,
when the theater was dark, Legawiec lived in Boston, where he began
toying in earnest with the notion of myth.</TE>
<TE>   "My family is Polish," he says. "And being a Polish Catholic, you
are really steeped in ritual, because of the Mass. I thought a lot
about the importance of myth and ritual in theater--an area I had
never turned my attention to before."</TE>
<TE>   Legawiec used his Polish heritage as a starting point for his
initial exploration. "I assumed everyone in Poland was working in
myth and ritual," he says. "Of course, that was far from the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Acting on that mistaken assumption, Legawiec wrote to the
Krakow-based Teatr Stary, Poland's leading repertory theater,
explaining that he was a young American theater director interested
in observing a Polish theater's rehearsal process.</TE>
<TE>   To his amazement, his inquiry was met with a firm invitation.
"They were very accommodating," he says. "They sent me the schedule
for the whole year and said, 'Come when you can.'"</TE>
<TE>   Legawiec spent the winter of 1990-91 in Poland, arriving in time
for the country's first post-Communist presidential elections. "It
was a very tempestuous time for the country and the theater," he
recalls. "Under the old Communist system, actors couldn't be fired;
they were employed for life. For the first time, the theater was in
the position of having to fire people."</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of the political upheaval, however, the Teatr Stary
remained surprisingly laid-back. Legawiec was particularly impressed
with the theater's lengthy rehearsal process. "They would rehearse
something for three or four months, until it was ready to open," he
marvels. "That kind of unlimited rehearsal time was a real revelation
to me."</TE>
<TE>   A more profound revelation was to follow--Legawiec's visit to
Jerzy Grotowski's theater and archive. "I didn't know much about
Grotowski at the time. I just knew he was important," he says. "I
talked to the people who ran the archive, and they gave me
Grotowski's book, 'Towards a Poor Theatre,' and videotapes of his
productions. That night, I slept in the theater. I read the book from
cover to cover and watched the videotapes. It was a surreal
experience."</TE>
<TE>   And a life-altering one. "Grotowski talked a lot about myth in his
book, and it was clear that all his staged productions used ritual in
a big way. Grotowski's philosophy really had meaning for me. And I
was also struck by the idea that Grotowski spent a year or so on each
individual production. He had no time limit."</TE>
<TE>   Returning to his Vermont theater, Legawiec chafed at the
strictures he'd formerly accepted as routine. "When I was confronted
with my short little two-week rehearsal periods, I didn't feel I
could go on," he says. "So I proposed to my non-Equity actors, 'Give
me two extra hours a week to work on a piece. Maybe we'll perform it,
maybe we won't.'"</TE>
<TE>   That venture, the Invisible Theatre Project, resulted in "The
Cure," later remounted in Los Angeles in 1998. Subtitled "A Dramatic
Ceremony in One Act," the play also marked Legawiec's first
experiment with invented language, a technique he returned to in
2001's "A Cult of Isis."</TE>
<TE>   Although the words in Legawiec's invented language pieces may not
be intelligible, the meaning is--a distinction Ziggurat member Jenny
Woo appreciates.</TE>
<TE>   "When he experiments with invented language, Stephen is trying to
tap into the subconscious, to express something more guttural and
emotional," Woo says. "At other times, his work is very verbal and
intellectual. You have to listen to the words and really pay
attention. But the invented-language pieces do the opposite. They
distance people from the literal understanding so that they can
merely feel."</TE>
<TE>   After his Vermont theater folded, Legawiec moved to L.A. and set
out to form a new company, implementing the principles he'd developed
with the Invisible Theatre Project. Actress Dana Wieluns, a charter
member of Ziggurat, then known as the Gilgamesh Theatre, remembers
those days.</TE>
<TE>   "I responded to an ad in Back Stage West that called for actors
interested in a long rehearsal process and new theatrical forms,"
Wieluns says. "I remember the ad made that distinction. It was a call
for actors wanting to work in the theater as opposed to film and
television. That first piece, 'Ninshaba,' rehearsed for six months."</TE>
<TE>   In L.A., where actors routinely ditch small-theater commitments
for more lucrative bookings, Legawiec's leisurely process was a hard
sell. "On that first project, we started with nine actors," Wieluns
recalls. "By the second rehearsal we were down to six, and a week
later there were only three of us. The others realized they couldn't
commit for that length of time."</TE>
<TE>   What inspired such loyalty among the die-hards? "The reason I keep
working with Stephen is that he's one of the few people who embraces
the theatrical," Wieluns says. "He wants to put on stage the kinds of
things that can't be committed to film or TV. I think for Los Angeles
that's a unique thing."</TE>
<TE>   An unapologetic purist, Legawiec views the gap between theater and
other media as a great divide. "It seems to me that the spiritual
component exists in the theater as in no other medium," he says.
"I've never had a spiritual experience in the movies, the feeling
that you're part of something larger, or you are beholding the
mystery of life."</TE>
<TE>   Legawiec routinely travels the world to research his plays. On a
trip to China in September, he immersed himself in Chinese opera, a
style that influences his staging of "Red Thread." The play derives
from an obscure folk yarn written during the Tang dynasty. Despite
the antiquity of his source material, Legawiec's updating resonates
in ways he never anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   "The story's about an assassin who swears off killing just when
the kingdom needs her most," he says. "Coincidentally, the play deals
with war versus pacifism during a time of crisis."</TE>
<TE>   The timing may be coincidental, but the message of "Red Thread" is
as fresh as when the story was written 1,200 years ago. That's
typical of the Ziggurat Theatre, as it crosses cultural boundaries
and spans generations in its own continuing saga.</TE>

<DH>With so many films drawn from the 007 genre, we sought out
the agents with true box-office power: opinionated teens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For months now, this Hollywood vacation season has been billed as the
summer of the Franchise Movie.</LD>
<LD>   The sequels are coming fast and furious, with second installments
of "Men in Black," "Stuart Little" and "Spy Kids"; a third Mike Myers
spy spoof ("Austin Powers in Goldmember"); a fourth Jack Ryan
thriller ("Sum of All Fears"); and a fifth "Star Wars" film, known as
"Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones." (It's the second
prequel following two sequels, if you want to get technical about
it.)</LD>
<TE>   And that's not even counting movies inspired by other movies, such
as "XXX," the unofficial sequel to "The Fast and the Furious"; an
update of Frank Capra's "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," known now simply as
"Mr. Deeds," with Adam Sandler, if you can imagine, in the Gary
Cooper role; plus big-screen versions of TV shows ("Scooby-Doo,"
"Jackass" and "Crocodile Hunter"), comic books ("Spider-Man" opened
Friday) and theme-park attractions, such as Disney's "The Country
Bears." If you're older than 25, this sounds like a pretty good time
to take a three-month summer vacation from moviegoing altogether,
although, thankfully, a few adult enticements will also be in
theaters, including "Insomnia," a cerebral thriller from "Memento"
director Christopher Nolan that stars Al Pacino and Robin Williams;
"Road to Perdition," a moody tale from "American Beauty" director Sam
Mendes that features Tom Hanks as a Depression-era hit man and Paul
Newman as a mob boss; "Unfaithful," a sexy thriller about adultery
from director Adrian Lyne; and "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya
Sisterhood," an intergenerational family saga starring Sandra
Bullock, Ashley Judd and Ellen Burstyn.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the talk of how this summer represents a new wave in
the corporatization of Hollywood filmmaking, I see something
different and much more old-fashioned happening. The real spiritual
father of this season's sci-fi, special-effects movies isn't Luke
Skywalker or the mechanical shark from "Jaws." The real Big Daddy of
2002 is James Bond. The stars of this summer, be they secret agent,
undercover operative or impossibly cool superhero, are nearly all
fresh twists on the venerable Bond template.</TE>
<TE>   "XXX," due Aug. 2, was consciously conceived as an
extreme-sports-style Bond franchise, with Vin Diesel as a gruff
secret agent who does gravity-defying stunts on a motocross freestyle
bike the way Sean Connery used to maneuver his sports cars.</TE>
<TE>   "Austin Powers in Goldmember" (July 26) is the ultimate Bond
takeoff, complete with tweedy Brit accents, curvaceous supermodels
and a campy villain, Dr. Evil, who was gunning for world domination
long before George W. Bush took aim at his "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   That's just the beginning: Bond goes hip-hop in "Bad Company," due
June 7, in which Chris Rock plays a ghetto hustler-turned-CIA covert
operative in a film full of Bond touches, including Anthony Hopkins
as the upper-crust, MI5-style handler. Steven Spielberg's "Minority
Report," due June 21, stars Tom Cruise as a "Mission:
Impossible"-meets-James Bond super cop of the future who jets around
after devious criminals. "Undercover Brother," due May 31, is an
"Austin Powers Goes to Harlem" blaxploitation Bond spoof with Eddie
Griffin as a secret agent whose eight-track car stereo shoots
missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's a Tom Clancy thriller, "The Sum of All Fears" (May
31), and a Robert Ludlum spy drama, "The Bourne Identity" (June 14),
whose Cold War showdowns and action-hero daredevilry owe a big debt
to 007-style super-sleuthery and pyrotechnics. The list goes on: When
Jennifer Lopez slips on her Navy Seal black tights and practices her
deadly array of kick-boxing moves in "Enough," due May 24, she looks
for all the world like a slinky Bond temptress right out of
"Thunderball."</TE>
<TE>   So why this obsession with neo-007-ism? Sweeping conclusions are
probably not in order. Most movie trends are the product of fluke and
happenstance. But you could argue that summer movies are the ultimate
altar for Bond worship. If you're making movies aimed at teenage
boys--far and away the most active summer moviegoer--a super spy with
lots of hip, high-tech gear, played for real or for laughs, is the
ideal adolescent fantasy hero. It also offers filmmakers the
opportunity to use the full range of their thrill-ride arsenal,
arming characters with futuristic gadgetry, mind-blowing special
effects and lots--and lots--of cool cars, rockets and explosions.</TE>
<TE>   So what are the most hotly anticipated movies of the summer?
Instead of asking the usual suspects, movie industry executives, I
went right to the target audience: a group of teen fans. I showed
them a dozen trailers for upcoming movies, and asked them to discuss
and rate them in terms of how much the trailers made them want to see
the films. We chose films that would potentially appeal, one way or
another, to the teen summer audience--I didn't think the latest
Merchant-Ivory movie would get this group's heart pumping--although
we did include some more adult-oriented films, including "The Sum of
All Fears" and M. Night Shyamalan's extraterrestrial thriller
"Signs."</TE>
<TE>   It was a very informal focus group, made up of four teenage boys
and two girls, all friends of Gabe, my 15-year-old neighbor. These
kids--I call them my Summer Movie Posse--are incredibly opinionated
and media savvy, and go to a movie nearly every week in the summer,
which is why studios make so many films from their favorite
genres--special-effects thrillers and lowbrow comedies.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their fondness for splashy special effects, the most
eagerly anticipated movie (among girls and boys) was the film that
cost the least money to make and has no real stars: "Jackass: The
Movie," a film-length version of the legendarily lowbrow MTV show
devoted to stupid and dangerous stunts. The trailer only ran 30
seconds, half of which was devoted to a cautionary scroll warning not
to imitate any of the stunts, which got almost as big a laugh as the
stunts themselves. The next three top-rated trailers, ranking No. 2
through No. 4, all were movies with African American stars--Chris
Rock, Eddie Griffin and Will Smith ("Men in Black II").</TE>
<TE>   Tom Cruise didn't go over big in "Minority Report"--the kids
thought the trailer looked too much like a "Mission: Impossible"
knockoff. "The Sum of All Fears" star Ben Affleck also got a lukewarm
reaction. And Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr., co-stars
of "Scooby-Doo," were practically hooted off the screen.</TE>
<TE>   The big favorites were "XXX's" Vin Diesel, clearly the role model
of the moment for 15-year-old boys, and older actors like "Sum of All
Fears" co-star Morgan Freeman and "Bad Company" co-star Anthony
Hopkins, who both have near-mythic stature with the Movie Posse.</TE>
<TE>   There's no guarantee that these opinions will be an accurate
prognostication of box office success. But four of the top five
trailers chosen by last year's Movie Posse turned out to be
$100-million hits ("American Pie 2," "Pearl Harbor," "The Fast and
the Furious" and "The Mummy Returns" ). On the other hand, last
year's lowest-rated trailer was "Shrek," which was a blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some highlights from our screening:</TE>
<TE>   "Jackass." Gabe: "Watching people destroy themselves is so funny
that a movie with 90 minutes of that will be absolute heaven. When I
come out of the theater, I bet I'll have been laughing so much that
I'll need a new pair of pants."</TE>
<TE>   Daniel: "I'm definitely going opening weekend. I'm just trying to
imagine what they can't show."</TE>
<TE>   "Bad Company." Cassandra: "I love Anthony Hopkins, because he's
been in so many classic movies, and I love Chris Rock, so it's a
great concept--a really funny comedian and a great actor together.
I'm definitely excited about seeing it."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew: "It was a great idea to have Chris Rock play the part. If
he wasn't in it, I'm not sure I'd want to see it. It might just be
another routine spy movie."</TE>
<TE>   "Undercover Brother." Gabe: "I hadn't even heard about this movie
yet, but Eddie Griffin was so funny in 'Double Take' and 'Deuce
Bigalow' that I'd go see him in anything."</TE>
<TE>   "Men in Black II." Ta: "Oh my God, I have to see that movie. I
love Will Smith."</TE>
<TE>   Cassandra: "I really liked the first movie, and it's good to see
the original cast. I hate it in sequels when they can't get the
original actors and use terrible replacements. It usually means
they've ruined the movie."</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Deeds." Cassandra: "Adam Sandler is an amazing comic actor.
If he weren't in the movie, I don't think I'd go. It's his humor that
makes it work."</TE>
<TE>   Riccardo: "I used to like Sandler too, but 'Little Nicky' was
really bad and I think he's going downhill. There isn't enough in
this to make me all that interested."</TE>
<TE>   "Signs." Gabe: "The idea behind the movie matters a lot more to me
than Mel Gibson. The trailer makes you feel like you've got to see
the movie to find out what happens."</TE>
<TE>   "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones." Andrew: "I didn't
like 'Episode I' very much, and this trailer really didn't do too
much for me. It's lucky that I'd probably go to any movie where you
just write out the name 'Star Wars.'"</TE>
<TE>   Ta: "It really felt boring. It needs to have something else
besides laser beams for me."</TE>
<TE>   "Eight Legged Freaks." Daniel: "It reminded me of 'Starship
Troopers' and the oversized bugs, except with a stupid comic twist.
The idea's been used before."</TE>
<TE>   Cassandra: "Is it a scary sci-fi movie or is it a comedy? It
should be one or the other."</TE>
<TE>   "Scooby-Doo." Riccardo: "Can you give this a negative grade?
''Doo' was such a cool cartoon, and this is the worst interpretation
possible. They should've left the original alone."</TE>
<TE>   Gabe: "Having Freddie Prinze Jr. playing Fred is the worst idea in
the world, and the second-worst idea is having Sarah Michelle Gellar
in the movie at all."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rating the Trailers</TE>
<TE>   Here's how the Summer Movie Posse rated 14 of the most anticipated
youth-oriented summer movies. Each of the six kids gave the movies a
score from 1 to 10 based on how much the trailers made them want to
see the films. The highest possible score is 60. Several key movies
were not included: "Spider-Man" (everyone had seen the trailer and
wanted to see the movie); "Austin Powers in Goldmember" and "Blue
Crush" did not have finished trailers available.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I've been listening to the music of Fermin Muguruza, but I don't
understand what his songs are saying. He's from Spain, but he doesn't
sing in Spanish. That's a cultural statement in itself.</LD>
<LD>   Muguruza, who just turned 39, was born in Basque country during
the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco. At the time, the
Spanish government violently suppressed the border region's culture
and language, called Euskara, believed to be the oldest tongue in
Europe. Fighting back meant keeping the dying idiom alive, at the
peril of persecution.</LD>
<LD>   So that's the first thing that comes through without translation:
Muguruza's fighting spirit.</LD>
<TE>   Actually, it's more than that. His sound telegraphs the urgency of
survival. His voice is as raw as a street brawl, nasal at times. His
tone is edgy, mocking, insistent. Backup chorus lines sometimes
convey the menace of a war chant.</TE>
<TE>   The music sounds riotous and subversive too.</TE>
<TE>   Horns blare their introductions with the drama of arriving Roman
legions. Cymbals and drum skins sizzle like rattlesnakes. Here and
there, we hear the sound effects of disorder: voices on bullhorns, a
Morse code of distress, an alarming siren.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, rhythmic reggae chords and muscular bass riffs push
you to get out of your chair, stand up to something, say no to how
things are.</TE>
<TE>   Or say yes, and just get up and dance. Join Muguruza and the
raucous, multiethnic party illustrated on the cover of "Brigadistak
Sound System," the 1999 album recently released in the U.S. on the
German label Piranha through Harmonia Mundi. The illustration is a
joyous jumble of people, smiling, twirling, celebrating. Only
Muguruza is looking straight at you, a clenched fist on his
sweatshirt but a smile on his lips. His arm is outstretched, palm
open in a universal sign of friendship, fingers extended as if trying
to touch you.</TE>
<TE>   He touched me, without a word. I had never heard of this
compelling performer until now. Although his two solo
albums--"Brigadistak" and "FM 99.00 Dub Manifest"--were released much
earlier in Spain, this is the first time both works have been widely
available in North America. (The much less interesting "Dub Manifest"
was released here last summer.)</TE>
<TE>   Partly, it was the singer's commanding pose in that cover drawing
that drew my attention, as if he was saying, "Hold on, don't let this
album get lost in the muddle of commercial music."</TE>
<TE>   Then I noticed my surname echoes his. That's probably because my
heritage is also Basque; my father's origins trace back to the 19th
century, to a town in the Pyrenees on the French-Spanish border.</TE>
<TE>   Though I've never been there, I feel that mysterious tug of
ancestral roots in Muguruza's work. Maybe that defiant, stubborn
streak is in the blood.</TE>
<TE>   But his work also appeals to me as a Chicano, a charged term
applied in the 1960s to the politicized children of Mexican
immigrants. We also live a border experience, on the edge of
acceptance and expulsion. The whole idea of the Chicano movement was
the reclaiming of culture and language, including native Mexican
tongues, which were in danger of being lost through assimilation.
Like Muguruza, who was taught only in Spanish and had to learn the
Basque language later, Chicanos also felt compelled to recover
Spanish, or at least Spanglish, and appreciate Mexican art, music and
dance.</TE>
<TE>   Among the fruits of that resistance was Los Lobos, the acclaimed
Chicano rock band from East L.A., and a zillion ballet folklorico
troupes across the Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   Many older Mexican Americans recall being punished for speaking
Spanish in school, just as Basque children once were. Euskara--which,
mysteriously, shows no resemblance to languages in neighboring
countries--was officially forbidden by the Franco dictatorship, which
ruled for four decades until his death in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   So it's not surprising to find the radical Chicano band Aztlan
Underground collaborating with Muguruza on a track from
"Brigadistak." His lyrics to "Nazio Ibiltaria Naiz" (I'm a Wandering
Nation) could have been an anthem for the Chicano movement, a
declaration that "I'm decolonizing my head."</TE>
<TE>   Aztlan, after all, is the mythical homeland of the Aztec nation,
said to be located in the Southwestern U.S. Like the Basques and the
Palestinians, Chicanos cultivate long memories about land colonized
in the name of a religious idea, like Manifest Destiny, the divine
excuse for the United States' territorial war with Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Not coincidentally, Muguruza popped up in the West Bank last month
at the start of the Israeli siege. The singer was part of a European
contingent protesting the occupation, but his plans to hold concerts
in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Ramallah fell through.</TE>
<TE>   In Spain, Muguruza's controversial politics keep him well out of
the mainstream record industry, although his concerts in Madrid and
other Spanish cities draw thousands. As the vocalist of two prized
groups, Kortatu and Negu Gorriak (Red Winter) in the early 1980s,
Muguruza infused traditional Basque music with punk aggression,
inspired by groups such as the Clash. But critics continue to
denounce him for what they brand as political extremism.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., there's a parallel in the backlash against gangsta
rap pioneers N.W.A or rap activists Public Enemy, which Muguruza
admires. You don't have to condone violence, and I certainly don't,
to understand the impact of their artistic statements.</TE>
<TE>   For all his nationalism, Muguruza makes many musical alliances
around the globe, especially on "Brigadistak," which has lyrics
translated into English, French and Spanish. Joining him on various
tracks are members of Cuba's Los Van Van, Venezuela's furious ska
band Desorden Publico (Public Disorder), Mexico's punk rockers
Tijuana No!, and fellow rebel in Spanish rock, Manu Chao.</TE>
<TE>   Muguruza espouses musical internationalism, and embraces a range
of styles such as reggae, dub and electronica. But he has not wavered
in his anti-capitalist message, an admirable stance in an era when
all values seem to stem from the idolatry of the free market.</TE>
<TE>   As Chevy Chase used to deadpan on "Saturday Night Live,"
Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead. But thankfully, Fermin
Muguruza and his music are still alive and as powerful as ever.</TE>

<KH>Summer Sneaks</KH>
<HD>Older, Wiser, Easier</HD>
<DH>The resumes were intimidating, not the stars--much to
younger directors' surprise.</DH>

<LD>Think of them as long-distance runners surrounded by sprinters. In a
business in which most movie stars count themselves lucky if they can
last 10 years at the top, Paul Newman, Al Pacino and Ellen Burstyn
are going strong decades after learning their craft from the Method
acting school of Lee Strasberg in the '50s and '60s.</LD>
<LD>   The trio's track record speaks for itself: Collectively, they've
made about 150 films, and have played lawyers, losers, drug addicts,
cops, thugs, cowboys, rebels and most everything else while picking
up 22 Oscar acting nominations (and three wins) along the way.</LD>
<LD>   By a strange twist of fate, these actors will be teaming up this
summer with younger directors in three of the season's most
anticipated films for adults:</LD>
<TE>   * In DreamWorks' "Road to Perdition" (July 12), directed by
Oscar-winner Sam Mendes ("American Beauty"), Newman portrays a
Depression-era crime boss named John Rooney and adoptive father to a
conflicted hit man, played by Tom Hanks.</TE>
<TE>   * Warner Bros.' psychological thriller "Insomnia" (May 24), from
"Memento" director Christopher Nolan, has Pacino as a sleep-deprived
homicide detective trying to crack a case in a tiny Alaska town.</TE>
<TE>   * And in Warner Bros.' cross-generational relationship dramedy
"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood" (June 7), Burstyn stars
under the guidance of first-time director Callie Khouri (best known
for writing "Thelma &amp; Louise") as a flamboyant Southerner trying to
make peace with her angry daughter.</TE>
<TE>   The staying power of all three stars is certainly remarkable.
Newman's breakthrough performance came in 1958 with "Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof." Pacino debuted on screen in 1969 with "Me, Natalie." Burstyn
first became known through her work in 1971's "The Last Picture
Show." And they're still capable of attracting A-list collaborators.</TE>
<TE>   But there's something more, according to the directors of their
summer films: Newman, Pacino and Burstyn are insightful enough to
leave their laurels at the door. What becomes a legend most? Not
acting like one, except when the camera's rolling.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul Newman is extremely skillful in defusing any kind of hero
worship, and he can do it within five minutes," Mendes said. "When
you've been that famous for that long, I think it's probably a bore
for him to deal with people who are in any way idolatrous."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Newman, 77, is as likely to carry on about global warming
and the migration habits of geese in New England as he is about his
place in the acting pantheon. Unprompted, he'll take a poke at his
own profession, gleefully quoting Hunter S. Thompson: "The
entertainment industry is a cruel and shallow money trench," he said
during a recent phone interview, "a long plastic hallway where
thieves and pimps run free and good men die like dogs. There is also
a negative side."</TE>
<TE>   Newman laughs heartily. "That's a lovely quote, isn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   But ask the man about his legacy as an actor and Newman responds
with a long silence before finally deflecting attention to Mendes. "I
don't think that's the issue here," he says. "The issue is whether
the guy knows what he's doing."</TE>
<TE>   What motivated Newman to pick "Perdition"? Hanks? The script?
Mendes? "It was a choice invitation," he replies. "Listen, I'll just
say one thing. Most guys know a little bit about what they're doing.
Some guys know about half. A very few guys know three-quarters of
what they're doing. But Mendes--that guy knows what he's doing. To
have a clear picture of what you want and to be able to convey that
in a way that an actor can understand, that's a real gift and he has
it."</TE>
<TE>   Newman admired British stage director Mendes' artful work on
"American Beauty" and found David Self's "Perdition" script
intriguing. But before committing, he wanted to meet Mendes. "People
talk about actors auditioning," Mendes explained, "but I think
sometimes directors have to audition as well. It doesn't get much
more surreal than going to see Paul Newman, because I grew up along
with everyone else in the world with 'Cool Hand Luke' and Fast Eddie
and Butch Cassidy."</TE>
<TE>   Mendes recalls ringing the bell at Newman's apartment overlooking
Central Park. "As I walked in the door, the first thing he said, with
genuine horror in his voice, was 'Jesus Christ you're young!'" the
36-year-old Mendes says with a laugh. "He was just checking me out. I
think if you're Paul Newman, you've earned the right to say, 'I'm
only going to make one picture a year, kid; I don't want you
[messing] it up.'</TE>
<TE>   "So you've got to go in there and say, 'Look, here's the film I
want to make and do you want to be a part of it? There were a couple
of times when we got into intense debates about what should or
shouldn't happen to the character, but that's how trust develops,
because he knows I'm going to speak my mind."</TE>
<TE>   After two weeks of pre-production rehearsal, Mendes began to think
of Newman as a workaday collaborator. "So you're trotting along
thinking he's just another actor and, of course, the first day he
turns up on set you realize he's 'Paul Newman.' I remember the
frisson that spread across the set was remarkable, even for Tom
[Hanks].</TE>
<TE>   "At one point, Newman flashed him a look and Tom came over and
said, 'Man, he just looked at me with those eyes!' and it all came
flooding back, same for Tom as it was for me.... It just makes the
hair stand up on the back of your neck."</TE>
<TE>   But a director cannot afford to be awestruck, so when it came to
getting performances on film, Mendes says he treated Newman just like
any other actor.</TE>
<TE>   "I did find myself pushing Paul very hard, take after take,
telling him, 'I think you can get it one notch up.' Occasionally he'd
tease me: 'There's only one other way I could do this now and that's
by standing on my head,' that kind of thing, but he still did it."</TE>
<TE>   Newman has directed six films, including the Oscar-nominated
"Rachel, Rachel" in 1968, but he wouldn't dream of trying to mentor
Mendes. "I would rather be shot dead than to do that!" he says.</TE>
<TE>   Newman may downplay his star power on the set, but Mendes hopes
the actor's screen persona will add dramatic subtext to the story.
"With Paul Newman, there's a point at which the iconography of the
man mixes with the iconography of the role," he says. "In
'Perdition,' he appears at first as the Paul that we know: mellow,
avuncular, charming, with the twinkle. And then he is gradually
revealed to have immense depths of darkness beneath the surface. Mr.
Rooney has lived a bad life and he knows it, and that gradually comes
back to haunt him during the course of the picture."</TE>
<TE>   For "Insomnia," Christopher Nolan needed his big-city detective
Will Dormer to radiate authority from the moment he stepped off the
plane to take over a murder investigation implicating an eccentric
novelist (Robin Williams). The catch: Dormer has secrets of his own
to hide, and there's no one he can confide in. How to convey the
character's turmoil without dialogue? For Nolan, the solution was
obvious: cast Pacino.</TE>
<TE>   "When I met Al Pacino in New York to try and convince him to sign
on for 'Insomnia,' I was very nervous, but he immediately put me at
my ease and we had this conversation that went on hours longer than
it was supposed to," recalls the 31-year-old Nolan. "I can't remember
the exact phrase he used, but the question I felt I was getting was,
'Why do you need me for this part?' And my answer was I needed an
actor who clearly projects moral intelligence and can make that
visible to the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "In retrospect, I don't know how I could have done that without
Pacino because he can put so much into one look, one expression.
Those dilemmas the character is struggling with, that he can't talk
about, they have to come across just through the eyes."</TE>
<TE>   The "Insomnia" cast did not rehearse before the 54-day shoot in
Vancouver, Canada; Nolan developed the Dormer character through
lengthy conversations beforehand with his 62-year-old star (the film
is a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name).</TE>
<TE>   So when filming began, Nolan for the first time witnessed Pacino's
extraordinary presence as a performer.</TE>
<TE>   "He has some kind of ability to focus all this intense energy
straight down the barrel of a camera. I don't use a monitor; I sit by
the camera and watch the actors with my eye. You get moments with Al
where it ceases to be acting and becomes completely real to you,
three feet away. Pacino can do that so often, so powerfully--it's
very hard to pin down, but that is what makes Pacino not just a great
actor, but also a movie star."</TE>
<TE>   He jokes, "It probably spoiled me. God help the next set of actors
I work with. I'll probably be there shouting, 'Take 50.'"</TE>
<TE>   Callie Khouri wrote the 1991 hit "Thelma &amp; Louise," which she
desperately wanted to direct. Those honors instead went to Ridley
Scott--and the film became a sensation. In 1995, she tried to film
her script for "Something to Talk About," but Lasse Hallstrom got
that assignment.</TE>
<TE>   So even though "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood" marks her
directorial debut, Khouri was more than ready to get behind the
wheel. "It's kind of like walking in to get your driver's license
when you're 16 and they go, 'OK, here's your Testarossa,'" she says,
referring to the film's high-powered cast. Besides Burstyn, the
ensemble includes Maggie Smith, Ashley Judd and Sandra Bullock.</TE>
<TE>   Burstyn, 69, was the first actress Khouri cast once she'd
completed her adaptation of the 1996 novel by Rebecca Wells. As fans
of the best-seller know, Vivian Abbott Walker (Burstyn) is the
larger-than-life, hard-drinking Alabama matriarch whose stormy
relationship with daughter Siddalee (Bullock) is examined through a
series of flashbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "From the time I saw 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore' and 'A
Dream of Passion,' a film she did [in 1978] that absolutely blew my
mind, I've always felt that Ellen's vulnerability is so present in
almost every character I've seen her do, and I felt like that was the
absolutely ideal quality for Vivi," says the 44-year-old Khouri.</TE>
<TE>   Khouri met Burstyn at a Los Angeles coffee shop to talk about the
role. "In her very gracious and diplomatic way, I think she was
seeing if I was up to the task," Khouri says. "I was not burdened
with huge doubts about myself. I've waited a very long time [to
direct], and I wasn't going to let insecurities be a part of the
equation."</TE>
<TE>   Burstyn had no hesitation about putting herself in the hands of a
first-time director. "I've worked with many directors who were making
their second film," she said. "'Alice Doesn't Live Here' was Marty
Scorsese's second film, 'Requiem for a Dream' was Darren Aronofsky's
second. So I've had a lot of experience with directors whose talents
are still young and fresh, who are still finding their way, and I
prefer that, actually, to someone who has already answered all of the
questions successfully." She laughs. "You know what I mean? Where
they're kind of relying on old solutions."</TE>
<TE>   When filming began on "Divine Secrets" last summer in North
Carolina, Burstyn showed up "in the zone," as Khouri describes it. "I
realized, it will be my job to not knock her out of it." Which, for a
Method actor like Burstyn, required some delicacy, Khouri admits.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a couple of times when I'd go up to her and say,
'Ellen, I was thinking maybe if we could do such and such,' and she'd
say, 'I don't know what you're talking about, I can't even think
about it like that, I have no idea what you're saying,' and I'd just
be like, 'Well OK, let's just try it.' And then she would do it
exactly.</TE>
<TE>   "Or I'd go, 'Ellen, when you say that line, I just want you to
glance back that way a little bit. And I could tell she'd just look
at me, like, 'Shut up, get away.' But then she would do it so
perfectly. And I was just like, 'Thank you!'"</TE>
<TE>   Burstyn, who grew up in Detroit, modeled her character's
Southern-style theatrics in part on women she observed in Texas,
where she had once worked as a waitress. But there was a more
universal component to the character as well.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt Vivi was like many women that I know, whose aspiration is
greater than what they've fulfilled in their lives," Burstyn says.
"There's all this creative energy that never got organized, so Vivi
just kind of killed it off with booze. And that's been my experience
in life: If you have creative energy and you don't use it, you have
to do something with it, so you kill it."</TE>
<TE>   For Burstyn, as with Newman and Pacino, preparation is essential
to creating a believable person on screen. But the real life of a
film doesn't begin to take shape until the other actors show up on
the set. For Burstyn, as with the other acting legends who last the
longest, there's simply no time like the present.</TE>
<TE>   "Each project is a brand new thing," Burstyn concludes. "You don't
want to solve the problem the way you solved it before.... It's a
brand new character, story, life on the set, all of it. But the fact
that you've made a few movies is helpful."</TE>

<LD>Recent evidence of the L.A. Times' continuing leftist political bias
is irrefutable.</LD>
<LD>   Coming on the heels of the recent Times boycott by those
protesting your paper's obvious (leftist) pro-Palestinian bias, the
front page of the April 28 Calendar section provides yet another
glaring example of this bias with its leftist characterization of the
1992 Los Angeles riots.</LD>
<LD>   The headline "Flames of Inspiration," subtitled with a reference
to the riots as a "civic upheaval," and a mural depicting African
Americans as victims used as a background, borders on the absurd.
Given this extreme leftist perspective, it is not too difficult to
understand your paper's ability to portray Palestinian terrorists as
victims.</LD>

"Talk to Me--Listening Between the Lines," is also vital for anyone
who would assume any of the various thrones we allow in this country,
many contrary to the wishes of the people.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's incisive commentary, holding us accountable for those
"safe houses of identity" we may inhabit, urges a change without
beating the point mercilessly. If only the officers who attacked
Rodney King had used such an approach, and those whose violent,
graceless acts preceded and still follow.</TE>

<LD>To those contemplating the purchase of architecturally important
homes, Times architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff tenders this
warning: Just because your name is going on the deed and the mortgage
and the mailbox, don't think you can start acting like you own the
place ("There Goes Our History," Perspective, April 28).</LD>
<LD>   Ouroussoff cites the efforts of a "relatively tiny cultural elite"
but says "the majority of homeowners are less enlightened."
Nevertheless, he feels government may legitimately compel those who
own and occupy a piece of property to defer to those rarefied
elitists who simply like to look at it the way it is. If somebody
famous built your house with too few bedrooms for your triplets or
your widowed granny, how dare you even think about overriding his
decision.</LD>
<LD>   I used to think Ellsworth Toohey from "The Fountainhead" was
arrogant, but Ouroussoff could give him lessons.</LD>

<TE>   Here in Southern California, many aficionados of architecture
identify themselves as being Schindler or Neutra people, the id and
superego, respectively, of the local Modernist tradition. It's a
boring discussion, facile because it is usually based on personality
and not on issues.</TE>
<TE>   The "debate" becomes particularly uninteresting now that both
Schindler's Wolfe House, a series of volumes that elegantly hurled
itself down a hill into the sea, and Neutra's Maslon House, a house
that knew exactly how to stir a better martini--and faster--than
anyone else at the country club, are gone. It's not enough to rely on
rich celebrities pursuing collectibles.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is that Modernism is for dumb clucks we've never heard
of--us. We, all of us, must somehow get the point that these are
terribly important houses because of the questions they raise and the
way these architects answered them: Can we live richer lives in
houses that pull off a generic language that precisely fits
individual needs? Can we live more intimately with nature yet with
technologies that speak to our time? Can we live more gracefully,
more artfully, in smaller, not bigger, houses? Yes, our local boys
said, sometimes not getting it right, but yes we can.</TE>
<TE>   Every time we lose an example that speaks to these values, we lose
a witness to a different way of living.</TE>

<LD>Dean Paulos apparently participated in the excesses of the '70s, as
little else could allow him to assert that Yes' ascension to the top
of the rock universe was done without hype and record label-generated
publicity (Letters, April 28).</LD>
<LD>   Granted, the band still survives on its signature sound, but there
were plenty of magazine covers, meaningless chronicling of the band's
road-warrior exploits, and the de rigueur testosterone-filled quotes
from its members during the band's heyday. Or did Paulos write merely
to remind us that another group of '70s rock gods has "returned to
its roots" performing at the local pub, instead of a nearby stadium?</LD>

<LD>I consider myself one of the lucky few who did see the original
"Merrily We Roll Along" by Stephen Sondheim when I was living in New
York in the early '80s ("Putting Him Together," by Patrick Pacheco,
April 28).</LD>
<LD>   I thought the critics were harsh, since it had some of the most
enduring lyrics ever and, of course, the complex Sondheim music.
Times have changed since 1981 and the musical may fit the current
mood better. I hope the Ahmanson director takes notice and brings
this overlooked musical to Los Angeles.</LD>

<HD>What Will Scooby Do?</HD>
<DH>Warner Bros. hopes a big-screen version of the sleuthing
Great Dane and his Mystery Inc. pals will draw three generations of
fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL MALLORY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You have to give Warner Bros. points for bravery. First it took
"Harry Potter," one of the most popular kids' book series in the
world, and dared to give it a definitive look, hoping it would live
up to the expectations of millions of readers. Now it's taking a
cartoon character that has been known and loved by three generations
of kids and putting him into live action ... sort of.</LD>
<LD>   The big-screen, big-budget ($80 million-plus) "Scooby-Doo," which
opens June 14, renders the cowardly, lovable ghostbusting Great Dane
in quasi-realistic computer animation in a live-action setting.
Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Linda Cardellini and
Matthew Lillard play Scooby's human pals: stalwart Fred Jones,
beautiful Daphne Blake, brainy Velma Dinkley and grungy Shaggy
Rogers, respectively. Although the formula of digital cartooning with
live action has been used before for 1995's "Casper," which was a
commercial hit, and 2000's "The Adventures of Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle,"
which wasn't, the studio contends that comparisons with other films
are irrelevant.</LD>
<LD>   Why? Because there's just something about Scooby.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody grew up with Scooby-Doo," says Charles Roven, who
produced the film with partner Richard Suckle. "I grew up with
Scooby-Doo. My daughter, who is 15, grew up with Scooby-Doo, and I
know a lot of 6-, 7- and 8-year-olds who grew up with Scooby-Doo."</TE>
<TE>   For the benefit of those who might have managed to grow up without
him, Scooby debuted in 1969 in the Saturday-morning series
"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!," which was created and produced by
Hanna-Barbera. Each week, Scooby and the gang--known collectively as
Mystery Inc.--traveled around in a flower-power van dubbed the
Mystery Machine. They followed clues, solved cases, chased ghosts and
monsters, and invariably revealed them to be disguised human
criminals who would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those
meddling kids.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next three decades, Scooby was featured in a record 18
spinoff series (including one that paired the gang with guest stars
such as Sonny &amp; Cher and the Harlem Globetrotters), four TV movies
and three video features, making him among the most durable cartoon
characters.</TE>
<TE>   Roven became interested in developing a live-action treatment of
Scooby in 1994, four years before Time Warner acquired Turner, which
owned Hanna-Barbera, and identified Scooby as one of the animation
company's most marketable characters. Mike Myers was briefly attached
to the project, hoping to play Scooby's best bud, Shaggy. By decade's
end, the combination of Scooby's popularity on the Cartoon Network,
by then a Time Warner company; the delivery of an acceptable script;
and technological advancements that for the first time made a
digitally animated Scooby viable, put the project on the fast track.
Filming began in February 2001 at Warner Roadshow Studios in
Queensland, Australia.</TE>
<TE>   The PG-rated film is aimed at every generation of Scooby-watchers,
including those who weren't even born when its development began.
"Our primary audience are kids 6 to 12 and their parents," says Dawn
Taubin, president of domestic marketing for Warner Bros. Pictures,
"but all of our information shows us that there is a large group of
[teens] and even college students who have a strong affection for
Scooby."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Lorenzo di Bonaventura, president of worldwide production:
"Unlike a lot of Saturday-morning television, I think 'Scooby' has a
hipper, cooler vibe to it. Hanna-Barbera instilled it with something
that everybody up through high school enjoys." The filmmakers were
eager to run with that vibe, tweaking the characters for a more
sophisticated kid audience than the one of 30 years ago. "The
[original] series painted very specific characteristics onto each
character, but it did not get behind their struggle to either
overcome or accentuate those," Di Bonaventura says. "We get behind
them either to make fun of them, accentuate them or get emotionally
involved in them."</TE>
<TE>   Scripted by James Gunn and directed by Raja Gosnell, "Scooby-Doo"
finds the gang investigating weird goings-on at Spooky Island, a
tropical spring break hangout for teens run by a man named
Mondavarious (played by Rowan Atkinson of "Mr. Bean" fame). To anyone
familiar with "Scooby-Doo," the story line sounds like deja vu all
over again. But there is a twist: Long-simmering resentments and
personality conflicts, particularly between Fred and Daphne, have
torn the group apart (and hipper "Scooby" fans know the joke is that
Prinze and Gellar, who play Fred and Daphne, are engaged). Before
they can hope to catch the villain, the former friends first have to
resolve their conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   While Fred, Daphne, Velma and Shaggy reveal more complex human
emotions, Scooby has likewise found his inner dog. "In certain cases,
he does exhibit more natural characteristics that a [real] dog might
exhibit," Roven says, "but whatever Scooby does, we wanted to make
sure he did it with his Scooby-ness."</TE>
<TE>   All of the 375 or so shots of Scooby, as well as a few incidental
creature characters, were created digitally by the L.A. digital
effects shop Rhythm &amp; Hues. No animatronic elements were used.
Effectively transposing the character from a two-dimensional cartoon
to something that would fit inside a real-world setting was anything
but easy, according to visual effects supervisor Peter Crosman.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of the computer-generated imaging, getting the final
look that everyone will come to believe in was nothing short of
rocket science," he says. "We debated quite a long time during
production to visualize a comfortable hybrid between the
characteristics of a real Great Dane and Scooby-Doo, the cartoon
behemoth that is completely his own entity." The final result is a
Scooby that closely resembles his ink-and-paint self, but with
realistic weight and texturing.</TE>
<TE>   The animators immersed themselves in tapes of the original 1969-70
series, which Crosman says revealed the character information and
charm they were looking for, as well as the more recent video
features, "Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island," "Scooby-Doo and the Witch's
Ghost" and "Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase," which spun the
characters into more modern treatments of action and horror, and
toyed with the self-spoofing quality that the filmmakers adopted.</TE>
<TE>   The movie "is really more fun for somebody who knows the old
series and understands the joke of matching these people to the real
world than for somebody who's completely brand new to it," Crosman
says--raising the possibility that there is someone under a year old
who could be brand new to Scooby-Doo.</TE>
<TE>   "Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!" was initially created as the antidote
to the kind of action that today is all but required to attract an
audience. Saturday-morning adventure cartoons were starting to come
under fire in the late 1960s from watchdog groups. Fred Silverman,
then head of children's programming for CBS, responded by asking Bill
Hanna and Joe Barbera, at that time the kings of TV animation, to do
a mystery series featuring teenagers, something along the lines of
the old "I Love a Mystery" radio show.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I did was 'House of Mystery,' which was too
bland," Barbera recalls. "We went back and forth on the pitches, and
sometimes they'd say, 'Oh, you're getting too scary here.'"
Everything fell into place when the core group of teens expanded to
include a dog. "The talking dog was what made it a hit," Barbera
continues. "The kids all picked up that voice: 'Scooby-dooby-doooo!'"</TE>
<TE>   (Incidentally, the original cartoonists refuted persistent rumors
that they deliberately intended the perpetually hungry Shaggy and
Scooby to be taken as a couple of stoners, as well as the bizarre
urban legend from the Boston area that Fred, Velma, Daphne and Shaggy
were purposely designed to represent a stereotypical student from
each of four local universities. It does, however, illustrate how
much viewers have identified with these characters and taken them to
heart.)</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Barbera is gratified by Scooby's longevity. "It's
been many, many years and the characters are still here," he says.
None of the company's other 1969 offerings have proved as durable. A
sampling: "The Perils of Penelope Pitstop," "Motormouth and Autocat,"
"Dastardly and Muttly," "Around the World in 80 Days."</TE>
<TE>   Australian actor Neil Fanning, who spent days on the set feeding
off-camera lines to the cast, provided the final dialogue track for
Scooby-Doo, re-creating the consonant-challenged voice originally
provided by the late Don Messick. One would expect a sound-alike
Scooby in the feature film, but what is surprising is how closely
Prinze and Lillard duplicate the vocal patterns of their forebears,
voice actors Frank Welker and Casey Kasem.</TE>
<TE>   Roven says the link to tradition was deliberate. "We wanted to
make sure it was very easy for 'Scooby' fans to flow right into the
movie, so when you first meet the characters, they look, sound and
are dressed like the characters you remember from the cartoon."</TE>
<TE>   While it seems reasonable to assume that "Scooby-Doo" is likely to
spawn a litter of live-action sequels, Di Bonaventura says any
discussion of a franchise is premature. "I always chuckle a little
bit when people talk about launching a franchise, because it doesn't
work that way," he says.</TE>
<TE>   For example, "Godzilla" offers a glaring illustration of what can
happen when studios attempt to force-feed audiences a franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "In the case of Scooby, both the filmmakers and the studio really
loved what we were doing," Di Bonaventura says. "It was not, 'How do
we create a franchise?' The point of view was, 'We love Scooby,
wouldn't it be fun to make a Scooby movie?'"</TE>
<TE>   In a summer packed with family films, including DreamWorks'
"Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron," Disney's "Lilo &amp; Stitch," Sony's
"Stuart Little 2" and Warner Bros.' "The Powerpuff Girls," Scooby
still has to find his legs--two or four--at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by what it calls positive response to test screenings,
however, Warner Bros. is confident it has a top dog. "We bring a vast
and loyal audience base to the table," Di Bonaventura says, "and I
think that gives us a great leg up over some of the big movies that
are coming."</TE>
<TE>   Only in Hollywood could a Great Dane with a leg up be perceived as
good news.</TE>

<HD>She's Gotta Surf It</HD>
<DH>Director John Stockwell is giving the long dormant beach
movie genre a try with 'Blue Crush.' His new wave idea: put female
surfers front and center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PETRIKIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>KAHUKU, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>Director John Stockwell moves calmly through a crowd of surfers,
groupies and other locals who have gathered, on a drizzly Saturday
night in late January, for a big blowout at a notorious beach house
on Oahu's North Shore. With his sun-streaked hair, sea-salted face,
T-shirt, board shorts and flip-flops, Stockwell blends right in: just
another mainland water nut turned surf yogi. His mellow vibe belies
the time pressures he and his crew are under as they set up a scene
for Stockwell's latest directorial outing, a genre-bending surf girl
adventure titled "Blue Crush."</LD>
<LD>   "You might want to go get something to eat and come back,"
Stockwell tells a bystander as he glances at the makeshift buffet
table. "I doubt you'll miss anything."</LD>
<LD>   It's almost 8 p.m. and, because of the steadily falling rain,
Stockwell has had to nix using a skateboard half pipe as part of this
scene, in which the film's star, Kate Bosworth, tries to pry her
unruly 14-year-old sister away from the house's leering surf studs.</LD>
<TE>   The house they're using (or "the G-spot of North Shore
debauchery," as a local called it) is one of several along the North
Shore's seven miles of intense waterline that are rented or owned by
companies that sponsor professional board riders. Stockwell and
others said the key to shooting here without incident (especially
during prime big-wave season, October through April) is showing
respect for surfing and the local culture.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Stockwell headed off a potential problem after
an overzealous crew member decided to give Billabong--the film's surf
wear promotional partner--extensive exposure throughout the house
owned by Volcom, a rival known for its rebellious philosophy and
athletes. Stockwell was nervous that the Volcom surfers might bar
them from shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the rain, everyone has taken cover in the house or on
its deck, so the crew has to work around the 100 or so young and
increasingly bored extras to set up the cameras, lights and other
equipment. Stockwell knows that if he doesn't get some footage before
they break for lunch, he could lose a majority of these extras if
they decide the Hollywood spotlight isn't as much fun as it sounded
and ditch the faux bash for real parties. He also has to film
14-year-old Mika Boorem, who plays the younger sister, before her
regulated workday runs out.</TE>
<TE>   Once the rain-mandated adjustments are made, the party scene
proceeds smoothly, with a manageable number of defections and without
breaking child labor laws. The night's filming is a relief for
Stockwell and his crew. The uncooperative weather was nothing
compared to the capriciousness of the North Shore waves they've
chased since production began in December 2001 on Oahu's southwest
coast and since moving north in January. Slaves to the whims of wind
and waves, the filmmakers have had to adopt a Zen-like approach,
incorporating unparalleled flexibility into their shooting schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "Movie productions are not built to wait around," Stockwell says.
"The traditional way of solving a problem is to throw money at the
problem, but that wouldn't work here, with our budget. So we tried to
stay small and flexible and keep a water crew on standby in case we
needed to chase the surf."</TE>
<TE>   Stockwell, who often hits the waves during breaks in shooting, has
had a decade-long affair with surfing. As a writer and director
(HBO's "Cheaters" and last year's "crazy/beautiful"), he has an
affinity for stories about subcultures and teens. But on "Blue
Crush," the actor-turned-filmmaker is showing signs of a masochistic
bent.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that water-based features are the most ulcer-inducing to
produce--think "Titanic" and "Waterworld"--Stockwell took on a film
in which nearly half the action takes place in the water.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he's taking on a genre--the youth-oriented surf
adventure-romance--that has been so lamely represented in the past
that its archetypes are Sandra Dee as Gidget, Annette Funicello in
"Beach Party" and Sean Penn's pot-addled Jeff Spicoli in "Fast Times
at Ridgemont High." As if that wasn't enough to alter his stomach
chemistry, Stockwell is turning tradition on its ear by focusing on
female surfers and thrusting the men to the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Masochist? Possibly. But there's demographic and economic evidence
that the stars might be aligning for this feature.</TE>
<TE>   One way Imagine Entertainment and Universal Pictures attempted to
hedge against an out-of-control water film was to keep the budget
lower than the studio average. "Blue Crush" cost around $30 million,
before tax incentives from the Hawaiian government were subtracted.
The filmmakers also cast relative unknowns, including actors who
could surf and a few surfers who could act.</TE>
<TE>   "We resisted hiring actresses that looked good but could never
surf," says producer Brian Grazer, another avid surfer. "They had to
get in the water and try to surf, and you could tell right off
whether they were going to be able to or not."</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen-year-old Bosworth, an accomplished equestrian who made
her feature debut in Robert Redford's "The Horse Whisperer," won the
lead role. She plays Hawaiian transplant Anne Marie, a young woman
who gets up every morning at dawn to surf. Bosworth took surf lessons
weeks before she tried out. "I was afraid that they might not want to
cast me because I had never surfed before, so I just wanted to show
them how serious I was."</TE>
<TE>   Joining Bosworth in the film's central surf girl triumvirate are
"Girlfight" and "The Fast and the Furious" actress Michelle Rodriguez
as Eden, a surfboard shaper and hellcat on a Jet Ski; and model and
film novice Sanoe Lake as Lena, a swimwear designer hopeful. The
three girls--along with Anne Marie's little sister Penny
(Boorem)--live in a ramshackle surf house and support themselves by
working as maids at the nearby luxury resort, where some football
players are staying.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three actresses, Lake, a Hawaii native and lifelong surfer,
was the most accomplished in the water. Stockwell had pushed to cast
her because she added authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was a different story. Two months into the shoot, she
still wasn't entirely comfortable on a surfboard: "I don't know about
surfing, man; I'm from New Jersey. Just give me something with an
engine and I'm cool."</TE>
<TE>   The actresses were sent to Hawaii a month before filming to train
with noted waterman Brian Keaulana, who taught them how to surf and
stay safe (and, in the case of Rodriguez, how to operate a Jet Ski to
tow surfers into the largest waves). Rodriguez got proficient enough
that she did the shot of her character towing Anne Marie (pro surfer
Rochelle Ballard, who doubled for Bosworth) into a giant wave.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Ballard, Stockwell brought aboard several
top-ranked women surfers, including Megan Abudo, who doubled for
Rodriguez; and Keala Kennelly, Layne Beachley and Kate Skarratt, who
appear as themselves.</TE>
<TE>   To bolster the film's authenticity and to ensure the production
would not be disrupted by surfers ruffled by a film crew cutting into
their water time, Stockwell hired locals as actors, including Chris
Taloa (one of the world's premier bodyboarders, who competes as Chris
Won Ton) and Ruben Tejada.</TE>
<TE>   The inspiration for the story came from an Outside magazine
article, "The Surf Girls of Maui," written by Susan Orlean. Grazer
says he had wanted to make a surf-related film for 10 years but never
found a premise he liked until he "stumbled across this little story
that was not about an individual but about the tribe, or subculture,
of surfing from the point of view of surf girls.... They were really
poor girls, growing up in a kind of obscure place in Hawaii, who were
searching for identity ... and ultimately achieving it without men."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to switching the location from Maui to Oahu (mainly
for the more dramatic surf conditions), the filmmakers introduced a
romance between Bosworth's character and a quarterback ("Legally
Blonde's" Matthew Davis) with a heart of gold and an arm that has
brought him to Hawaii to play in the NFL Pro Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The first two acts follow Anne Marie's preparations to take on
elite women surfers in the Pipeline Masters. All the while, she's
trying to overcome psychic baggage from nearly drowning at the
dangerous Pipeline surf break, and her usually laser-focused
determination is thrown off balance after she falls for Davis'
character.</TE>
<TE>   That's the basic story, but the filmmakers and studio are pushing
the action, and Grazer boasts, "What the tornado was in 'Twister,'
the waves will be in this film."</TE>
<TE>   No artistic license was needed to portray Pipeline as one of the
most dangerous surf spots in the world. Huge, powerful waves break in
water as shallow as 2 feet, on a reef that can feel like concrete
when a body slams into it.</TE>
<TE>   On the first day of filming on the North Shore, the cast and crew
witnessed some drama unrelated to their film when Tom Carroll, one of
the top professional surfers in the world, went head-first into the
reef. Luckily, Carroll--who was wearing a helmet, an increasingly
common accessory--suffered only a cut around an eye.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, the girls are watching it and saying, 'OK, here's the
world champion and he comes out with his face cut open,'" Stockwell
says. "The next day we're shooting there, and a body-boarder is
paralyzed, and we're still taking her [Bosworth] out. It's not like
staging a fight on land or putting air bags in. There's no padding;
there's no seat belts; it's very dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   In training the actresses, Keaulana didn't have time to work them
up gradually from the small waves at Waikiki to the monsters of the
North Shore. "If we had done that, their learning curve would be so
great, and they would risk themselves more when they got in the water
here. So we took them to Waimea, where some of the waves had, like,
20-foot faces."</TE>
<TE>   Although the actresses didn't suffer any injuries, professional
surfer Ballard gave everybody a scare when she collided with a male
surfer while filming a scene. Ballard, who had gone limp in the
water, was rushed to a hospital. "We thought it was a major spinal
injury," Keaulana says. "She's OK; she's moving, but it was pretty
emotional for her at the time, especially when she went numb."</TE>
<TE>   While Stockwell had access to the latest technology, particularly
a gyroscopic camera that could shoot up and around the waves, he
found that the best way to film realistically and safely was to go
low-tech. Assisting in this was a crew of experienced water
cameramen, including Don King (second unit camera for "Cast Away")
and world champion bodyboarder Mike Stewart, who used a camera
mounted on a boogie board.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have on this movie is an attempt to get inside the
experience of the surfer," Stockwell says. "Technology is good and
bad. But if you get the right guys who know how to work on the water,
and keep the equipment as simple as possible, that's the best way."</TE>
<TE>   A woman surfing Pipeline is almost unknown. This is partly because
of sexism in the sport and this area in particular, and partly
because the waves are challenging for even the strongest male
surfers.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the attitude toward women surfers at Pipeline, Kala
Alexander, a local surfer hired as an actor in the film, says, "It's
just not known at the Pipe.... It's like 60 guys in this takeoff zone
that ain't very big, and they're all fighting each other. It's hard
enough for a guy."</TE>
<TE>   But during production of "Blue Crush," some of the professionals
did their parts to break through the liquid ceiling. One day, when
the waves were particularly fierce, some of the Pipeline regulars who
had never seen a woman surf the break before watched in awe as
Skarratt charged the waves.</TE>
<TE>   "When they saw Kate Skarratt out there and drop in [on a wave],
the whole beach's mouths dropped," Stockwell says. "I think even
Brian's guys were a little skeptical at first ... but I think they're
digging the fact that we're incorporating so much of the real world
into the movie."</TE>
<TE>   Whether "Blue Crush" can similarly alter perceptions of
Hollywood's portrayal of surfing will be judged after its July 12
opening.</TE>
<TE>   In earlier surfing movies, the action on the water rarely
resembled the real thing, but the films did accurately reflect the
chauvinism of the sport. Women were relegated to little more than
beach-bound cheerleaders for their surfer boyfriends. This was a far
cry from the time surfing was first witnessed in the Pacific by white
explorers, who noted, in the words of one cultural anthropologist, an
"equality and sexual freedom [that] added zest to the sport and were
important to its widespread popularity." The sport's later chauvinism
was mainly born out of the settling of Hawaii by white missionaries
in the 18th and 19th centuries.</TE>
<TE>   Though the sport may have taken longer to welcome women into its
lineup than newer extreme sports like snowboarding, women are no
longer willing to be exiled to the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Surfing is reported to be the second-fastest-growing sport for
women (behind golf), and magazines like Surfing Girl are devoted
solely to female surfers. However, the number of women in the top
tier of the Assn. of Surfing Professionals' World Championship Tour
pales in comparison to the number of men (17 women and 46 men), as do
sponsorship opportunities and prize money (purses at the major men's
events average around $250,000, while the women's average $60,000).</TE>
<TE>   Even having fewer opportunities to travel and make big money
hasn't stopped a surge of women from taking to the waves in recent
years. One reason is that it offers women a lifestyle as well as a
chance to use their gym-hardened muscles.</TE>
<TE>   "Women like to take care of themselves, body and soul," says
Isabelle "Izzy" Tihanyi, founder and co-owner of Surf Diva, a La
Jolla surfing school that was started in 1996 to teach women to surf.
"Just going to the gym every day is good for your body, but what does
it do for your soul? Surfing is an amazing workout, and there's
definitely an adrenaline rush that you can't get in the gym."</TE>
<TE>   Tihanyi says the number of lessons taught at Surf Diva has doubled
every year since the school was started, and she estimates that her
instructors will teach about 4,000 women--ages 6 to 68--this year.</TE>
<TE>   Another way to gauge women's interest in surfing is the popularity
of surfing-related apparel and gear. According to Board-Trac Inc., an
Orange County company that tracks lifestyle and purchasing habits of
people 12 to 24 who participate in board sports, the percentage of
girls who surf every day has risen from 5% in 1999 to 11% in 2001;
girls also make up at least 25% of the total market for surf-oriented
"soft goods" like T-shirts and sandals.</TE>
<TE>   Quicksilver, one of the giants of surf apparel, saw a 34.4%
increase in net sales in the U.S. last year from its women's lines
(including Roxy), while sales in the men's categories gained 8.3%.</TE>
<TE>   So there's an expectation that surfing's popularity with women
will have some bearing on the success of "Blue Crush," and vice
versa.</TE>
<TE>   Universal has proved a sure-footed marketer of youth-targeted fare
in recent years, raising the bar for contemporary teen comedies with
"American Pie," and surprising most observers with the success of
last year's drag-racing adventure, "The Fast and the Furious."</TE>
<TE>   Less optimistic projections might label "Blue Crush" a nice little
summer "counter-programmer." On the other hand, "Blue Crush" could
also be one of those rare cultural totems that captures the current
zeitgeist, in this case catching the attention of a huge population
of Gen-Y kids who are more ethnically diverse, less concerned about
gender politics and fascinated by hip-hop and extreme sports.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Stockwell, back in L.A., says that after watching
the completed footage, he is most surprised by "the totality of the
potential danger and risks that we exposed our actors to. And I'm
just so happy that this is unlike the other surf films, where the
dialogue is hokey and the beach looks like Lake Michigan and they use
stock footage for the surfing."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Who in the music world is most likely to need help with substance
abuse problems?</LD>
<LD>   Singers in rock bands with alcohol or heroin addictions are the
most prevalent, according to breakdowns of people helped into
treatment programs by the Musicians Assistance Program, which is
marking its 10th anniversary.</LD>
<LD>   That's no surprise, given rock singers' issues with ego and the
pressures of the spotlight.</LD>
<TE>   Of the more than 250 people who turned to MAP in 2001, 36% were in
rock bands, 23% were singers and 34% listed alcohol as their primary
drug of choice, with heroin right behind at 31%.</TE>
<TE>   The surprise may be who was next on the list behind vocalists. It
wasn't musicians at all, but people working in the music
business--record company executives and staffers, managers, agents,
promoters, producers, engineers and journalists, among
them--accounting for nearly 20% of the people put into treatment by
MAP last year.</TE>
<TE>   That statistic caught even MAP founders Buddy Arnold and Carole
Fields-Arnold off guard.</TE>
<TE>   "I was startled when I saw the number," says Fields-Arnold,
sitting with her husband in the organization's small office suite in
the American Federation of Musicians' Hollywood headquarters. "I knew
we'd helped the odd agent or lighting person along the way."</TE>
<TE>   Says Arnold, "But 49 people last year? Wow!"</TE>
<TE>   They don't believe that the statistic reflects an increase of
non-artist music professionals developing addictions. The music
business--with easy access to the same vices in which the artists
indulge--has always been fertile ground for substance problems. But
it does mean that more music business personnel have been seeking
help from MAP.</TE>
<TE>   "We're finding that more [non-musicians in the business] will come
here, even if they have insurance and funds that would get them
access to other treatment," Fields-Arnold says. "There's a support
group here. We have representatives in other cities, peer
networking."</TE>
<TE>   MAP board member David Adelson, executive editor of the trade
weekly Hits magazine and music producer and correspondent for E!
Television, says that in this case, success breeds success.</TE>
<TE>   "Musicians have been more forthcoming and more willing to deal
with their problems. It may have been a motivating force for others
in the music industry to take action to help themselves," Adelson
says.</TE>
<TE>   There's another arresting MAP statistic: 59% of the more than
1,000 people treated in the 10-year span--the vast majority in
residential treatment facilities--have remained sober, Arnold says.
In Alcoholics Anonymous, "you hear figures as low as 12%."</TE>
<TE>   The Arnolds started MAP in 1992 out of their condominium, with
eight people helped the first year. Arnold was a jazz saxophonist who
had been a heroin addict for 31 years before getting clean in 1981
during a prison stint (for impersonating a doctor in order to write
prescriptions for fake patients). He initiated the organization
simply to address the specific needs of addicted musicians.</TE>
<TE>   "When we started, it was musicians, because that's all I cared
about," Arnold says.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-'90s, Kurt Cobain's failed addiction treatment and
ultimate suicide and the overdose deaths of Blind Melon's Shannon
Hoon, Sublime's Bradley Nowell and others brought more attention to
the issue of addiction among musicians and led to increased referrals
to MAP.</TE>
<TE>   It also brought music business funding for the shoestring
operation, including a seven-figure grant from the Recording Industry
Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, artists such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Neil
Young, the Foo Fighters and Bonnie Raitt participated in benefit
concerts and fund-raising events. However, with the music business'
attention elsewhere now, MAP is back on the shoestring, existing
basically as a mom-and-pop operation with the Arnolds and their small
staff. They spend more of their time "begging for money" than they
care to, Fields-Arnold says. With Arnold about to turn 76, they are
concerned about the program's future.</TE>
<TE>   They're grooming L.A. musician Bob Forrest as a successor.
Forrest, who has frequently discussed his addiction and recovery in
the press, has long been active in MAP, helping with interventions
for musicians in trouble and with the day-to-day operation. He's
currently studying to become a licensed counselor. Forrest will be
the recipient of MAP's annual Buddy Award at an event planned for
November.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the MAP statistics? After singers and music business
personnel come drummers (17%), guitarists (16%), bassists (10%),
keyboard players (7%), writers/composers (5%), and reed and brass
players (1% each). Broken down by style of music, rock was followed
by performers from pop (19%), jazz (8%), blues/R&amp;B (7%), country
(6%), classical and Latin (1% each), with 2% unspecified.</TE>

<LD>   TOM WAITS</LD>
<LD>   "Alice" and "Blood Money"</LD>
<TE>   Anti</TE>
<TE>   The title track of "Alice," one of the two Tom Waits albums coming
out Tuesday, raises the curtain on a familiar scene: brushed drums,
sleepy sax and muted trumpet, the heartbreak lyric, raspy voice and
languid tempo--it's the wee-hours jazz-joint wind-down that was
Waits' habitat early in his career.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of "Alice" and the companion album "Blood Money" serve up
more of the musical signatures Waits has established in his
three-decade oeuvre: Weimar Republic cabaret to bluesy scrap yard
symphonies, sentimental, nostalgic parlor ballads to clattering
cartoon soundtracks.</TE>
<TE>   In these two records, though, Waits, co-writer Kathleen Brennan
and their musicians bring to bear a new level of authority and
ambition, corralling the often obstreperous music in two thematic
frameworks.</TE>
<TE>   Each album is a set of songs written for an opera. "Alice"
premiered in Germany in 1992 and "Blood Money" in Denmark in 2000,
both directed by avant-garde hero Robert Wilson. Waits' gifts for
character and storytelling really flower in the context of a
narrative, even ones as fragmented as these sometimes are.</TE>
<TE>   "Alice," whose story is inspired by Lewis Carroll's fixation on
young Alice Liddell, begins as a straightforward look at unrequited
obsession and drifts into a disquieting dreamscape, where a man born
without a body becomes a popular entertainer named Table Top Joe,
where a man is tormented by a face on the back of his head, and
images of death and decomposition sink and resurface.</TE>
<TE>   The music, wheezing like a woozy klezmer band, favors violins and
other strings. Clarinets and percussion tend to dominate "Blood
Money," a more extroverted and theatrical album based on "Woyzeck," a
cheery 19th century play by Georg Buchner about exploitation, murder
and suicide. (The opera will appear as part of UCLA Live's 2002-03
season.)</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Waits and Brennan manage to make this bleak view of the
human condition pretty amusing. "All the good in the world/you can
put inside a thimble/and still have room for you and me," he sings in
"Misery Is the River of the World," a snappy opener that sets the
album's bright, almost garish tone.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in his career, Waits' raspy, toneless voice appeared to be
a detriment, but over the years he's discovered how to give it a wide
range of shadings and modulations.</TE>
<TE>   He now chooses a character's vocal persona like a master craftsman
selecting from a case of precisely designed tools, shifting voices
from the old-dog croon that prevails in "Alice" to the gruff,
staccato bark of "Blood Money's" sinister ringmaster.</TE>
<TE>   Although the two pieces don't provide clear-cut happy endings, it
all somehow comes full circle. Given the rigors of the journey, that
proves to be reward enough.</TE>

<TE>   KENNY CHESNEY</TE>
<TE>   "No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems"</TE>
<TE>   BNA</TE>
<TE>   If the Harlequin Romance folks ever decide to start a record
label, Kenny Chesney's their boy.</TE>
<TE>   This Tennessean has quietly become a big name over the last eight
years mostly on the strength of his
I'll-do-or-sacrifice-anything-for-love romanticism, a niche that puts
him in the same country corner with Tim McGraw (who duets on one
tune) and John Michael Montgomery. The beefcake album photos further
exploit his pinup appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The songs on his first studio album in three years, which entered
the national sales chart at No. 1 last week, tint several love
stories with a reflective melancholy. Yet when he's recalling missed
opportunities, the scenarios remain highly idealized, pulled more
from a volume of archetypal memories than directly from any real
lives.</TE>
<TE>   The Bill Anderson-Dean Dillon meditation on regret, "A Lot of
Things Different," is the album's most interesting track, and Chesney
sing-talks it with a honeysuckle-sweet Southern drawl that makes him
a vocal dead ringer for Rodney Crowell.</TE>
<TE>   To keep his male fans from tuning out, he leans on the Jimmy
Buffett-like attitude of the title tune and the Springsteen-esque
rocker "Young," a rather diluted replay of "Glory Days."</TE>
<TE>   He also turns in a carbon-copy version of Springsteen's own "One
Step Up" that pays respectful tribute to the Boss without adding
anything.</TE>
<TE>   The mere attempt makes the album one step up from silly novelty
hits such as "She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy," but he's still got room
to try plowing a bit deeper.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Fatboy Slim, "Live at Brighton Beach," Ministry of Sound. By
opening his first mix CD (in stores Tuesday) with Underworld's
classic "Born Slippy," Fatboy Slim sends an immediate message--he's
reaching for the masses. Bless him for it. Whereas most mix CDs go
with the esoteric, Slim unapologetically fills "Live at Brighton
Beach" with recognizable songs from the likes of Leftfield and, yes,
Fatboy Slim. In his world, there's nothing wrong with having a smile
on your face as you hit the dance floor. Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   *** Naughty by Nature, "iicons," TVT. Even though its lineup is
down to just rappers Treach and Vinnie, Naughty by Nature shows no
signs of slowdown on its fifth album. The departure of silky smooth
producer KayGee, the man behind "O.P.P." and other NBN hits, doesn't
do any damage as a slew of new beatsmiths makes muscular music for
the group's hearty, party-oriented lyricists. Grimy club music rarely
sounds this accessible. Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   **1/2 Brazzaville, "Rouge on Pockmarked Cheeks," South China Sea.
The L.A. group's third album (due Tuesday) blends wide-ranging
styles--bossa nova, moody jazz, Tom Waits starkness, folk-rock,
etc.--into a sophisticated pop that sometimes recalls the sprightlier
numbers on Beck's "Mutations" (which isn't surprising, as various
Brazzaville members have worked with Waits, Beck and Ozomatli). If
singer-songwriter David Brown's spare, melancholy poetry isn't always
as compelling as the sonic variations, he shifts engagingly from
just-outside-the-window portraits to global concerns. The group plays
Thursday at the Knitting Factory Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   *** Blackalicious, "Blazing Arrow," MCA. The rapper known as the
Gift of Gab and producer Chief Xcel helped spur the Bay Area's
underground hip-hop movement in the mid-1990s, and their
forward-thinking tendencies continue on their group's inventive
major-label debut. Xcel incorporates crisp drums, heavy piano and
moody keyboards into his beats, while Gab's abstract ruminations on
life are often thought-provoking. Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   * Luis Enrique, "Transparente," Chazz/Warner Music. This
Nicaraguan singer-percussionist was among the more interesting of the
dreary 1980s salsa romantica crowd. But this album shows that squishy
salsa has a short shelf life. Not even skilled musicians and polished
production, partly by Sergio George, can save this lame collection of
cliched love songs. Sample translated lyric: "Sometimes it feels like
I'm dreaming/When I see you by my side/I'm lucky/I can wake up with
you." Mercifully, the rest of us were put to sleep. Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are already
released unless otherwise noted.</TE>

<DH>'Spirit: Wild Stallion of the Cimarron' and 'Lilo &amp; Stitch'
head a spate of animated films that rely more on the human touch than
computers. Is it a trend or a last gasp?</DH>

<LD>This summer, animation takes a giant step away from the futuristic
world of computerized images to the traditional landscape of
drawings.</LD>
<LD>   With DreamWorks' "Spirit: Wild Stallion of the Cimarron" (opening
May 24) and Disney's "Lilo &amp; Stitch" (June 21), the two premier
animation studios are hoping to breathe new life into an art form
that is older than the movies. Later this year, audiences will get to
see more drawn animation with Disney's "Treasure Planet," Klasky
Csupo's "The Wild Thornberrys Movie" and the award-winning Japanese
film "Spirited Away," which will be released by Disney. The success
or failure of these films may well determine whether traditional
animation has much of a future.</LD>
<LD>   The runaway success of the computer animated "Shrek," "Monsters,
Inc." and "Ice Age" (and before that the "Toy Story" movies), coupled
with the disappointing performances of recent drawn features, have
led some to proclaim the imminent demise of traditional animation.
Despite the call for last rites, drawn animation remains alive,
though clearly in need of new energy.</LD>
<TE>   Children have come to expect the hyper-realistic look of computer
animation in feature films. Endless tracking shots in depth, vehicles
that move in perfect perspective and landscapes filled with
meticulously rendered leaves, flowers, clouds and water have become
standard elements in the computer-animated vocabulary.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional animators need to remind audiences of the special
magic only hand-drawn characters possess: They may look less
realistic, but their warmth and humanity remain unmatched. That may
be an uphill fight.</TE>
<TE>   "The Little Mermaid" (1989) launched an unprecedented string of
drawn, or 2-D, animated hits from the Walt Disney Studios that
climaxed in 1994 with "The Lion King." Commentators spoke of a new
golden age, and other studios attempted to duplicate Disney's
success. But in recent years, drawn animation hasn't fared as well at
the box office: "The Emperor's New Groove" ($89.3 million),
"Atlantis" ($84 million), "The Road to El Dorado" ($50.9 million),
"Osmosis Jones" ($13.6 million). By comparison, "Aladdin" grossed
$215 million in 1992--with lower ticket prices.</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, who headed up animation
at Disney during the studio's recent golden age, dismisses the
tendency to blame the medium for the disappointing returns: "I don't
think the movies have been very good. All of us making 2-D films in
the past several years have relied too much on formulaic ideas.
There's a cookie-cutter feeling to these movies; they're no longer
exceptional and surprising.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't done a very good job of picking stories," Katzenberg
adds, "and we've told the stories in ways we've used before. It's not
that the technique is flawed. I would argue that hand-drawn animation
still much more effectively fulfills the definition of 'animate': to
bring life to. There is something beautiful and intimate and personal
about a line an artist draws by hand, just as a personal note conveys
emotions in ways an e-mail doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Schumacher, president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, is
also a defender of traditional animation. "I don't think it's true
that CG [computer-generated animation] has always beaten drawn
animation," he says. "'Tarzan' did bigger box office than 'A Bug's
Life' [$171.1 million versus $162.8 million]. You have the four
back-to-back hits 'Toy Story 2,' 'Shrek,' 'Monsters, Inc.' and 'Ice
Age,' but 'Atlantis' and 'New Groove' out-grossed the CG film 'Final
Fantasy.'"</TE>
<TE>   In the animation community, the consensus is that the success of
recent computer-animated films has more to do with the stories and
storytelling than with the medium itself, and they complain about
executives and critics who confuse technique with content. Eric
Goldberg, who left Disney to direct a CG feature based on Maurice
Sendak's "Where the Wild things Are" at Universal, notes, "It still
comes down to whether or not you have a great story and great
characters that determines whether or not these films reach an
audience."</TE>
<TE>   Katzenberg hopes to begin the reversal of fortune for drawn
animation with "Spirit: Wild Stallion of the Cimarron," which he
describes as "an adventure story about a horse going out into a
changing world and confronting the challenges that civilization puts
in his path."</TE>
<TE>   For animators, the challenge was more down to earth but no less
daunting: drawing believable-looking horses that capture equine power
and grace.</TE>
<TE>   "Horses are notoriously difficult to draw, and a lot of people
know how they look and move, so it's obvious if you make a mistake,"
says James Baxter, supervising animator of the title stallion.
"Trying to create some of the actions in the movie and give them
enough power was tricky."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the challenge of drawing horses accurately, the animators
had to create a horse who could communicate with the audience through
expressions and body language, as the title character doesn't speak.
Animators have usually avoided horse characters because the distance
between their eyes and mouths makes their expressions hard to read.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a real challenge to give Spirit a face that could display
readable emotions," Baxter says. "We did some design tricks, shifting
his eyes a little further forward on the head, so you can see both
eyes more readily, which makes his expressions easier to read. And we
gave him nice big eyebrows--which horses don't have."</TE>
<TE>   Previewed footage of "Spirit" has a lush grandeur that suggests
Aaron Copland's "Appalachian Spring," and a celebration of the
American West as the embodiment of untamed freedom may play well to
post-Sept. 11 audiences.</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks will follow "Spirit" with the hand-drawn "Sinbad" in
2003, which Katzenberg calls "an extraordinary adventure of gods and
monsters: the storytelling, the drama, the love story and the
characterizations are very sophisticated, closer to what you would
see in an Indiana Jones movie than in a typical 'cartoon.'"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Disney's "Lilo &amp; Stitch" has generated more excitement
in the animation industry than any film in recent memory. In
previewed footage "Lilo," the story of a renegade alien who crashes
on Earth and is adopted by a lonely Hawaiian girl, displays two
qualities many recent drawn features have lacked: warmth and charm.
It carries the timely message that some people are born into families
while others have to create them, but the offbeat humor keeps the
film from feeling sanctimonious or manipulative.</TE>
<TE>   Co-director Chris Sanders, who came up with the idea for "Lilo,"
says, "We looked at the simplicity and warmth of films like 'Dumbo'
and 'Bambi' and the way the characters interacted. Instead of placing
our emphasis on technical marvels, we wanted to slow the world down a
bit and focus on character development and relationships."</TE>
<TE>   Disney will follow "Lilo &amp; Stitch" with "Treasure Planet" in
November, a retelling of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic tale, but
set in outer space. The lavish adventure boasts elaborate special
effects to evoke a feeling of space as the high seas of the future.</TE>
<TE>   For all of their differences in content and style, all four of
this year's major 2-D features share one quality: They're really
combinations of drawn and CG animation.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with the clockwork interior of Big Ben in Disney's "The
Great Mouse Detective" (1986), traditional animators have
incorporated computer-generated imagery into their work. The new
technology lets them employ more sophisticated cinematography (the
craning shot at the end of the prologue in "The Prince of Egypt") and
effects (the wildebeest stampede in "The Lion King") that would be
impossible to achieve using only drawings.</TE>
<TE>   "In today's world, nobody can make a 2-D movie without using 3-D
CG camera moves and 3-D CG hardware and software--you can't do it,"
says Terry Thoren, head of Klasky Csupo, which produced the "Rugrats"
movies. In addition to a third "Rugrats" movie due out next year, the
Klasky Csupo artists are working on a 2-D movie based on the writings
of Charles Bukowski. (That film, targeted at an adult audience, will
be released through the studio's new Global Tantrum division.)</TE>
<TE>   At one point in "Spirit," the stallion flees a forest fire caused
by a crashing steam locomotive in a complex sequence involving drawn
and CG imagery. "We're now at a place where we can combine elements
into a world in which you can't tell where one medium stops and the
other picks up," Katzenberg says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's given us the opportunity to reinvent and preserve what's
best and most beautiful about traditional animated movies, but to
give an audience the rich, immersive experience they now demand."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the vast Western landscapes in "Spirit," "Lilo &amp;
Stitch" features watercolor backgrounds that suggest distance, rather
than depict it literally. Although the look recalls the classic
Disney films of the '30s and '40s, many of the backgrounds were
executed with computer paint programs, rather than with paper and
brushes.</TE>
<TE>   "Treasure Planet" pushes the media blending even further: In place
of a wooden leg, Long John Silver sports a robotic arm. Animator Glen
Keane is drawing most of the character; CG artist Eric Daniels is
supervising the computer elements.</TE>
<TE>   "The quest for dimensionality in the look of a movie goes back to
Walt's day--look at 'Bambi' and 'Pinocchio,'" Schumacher says. "The
question is: What technique do we use to achieve it? In the case of
'Lilo,' there's great sense of depth in the watercolor backgrounds.
It's not the trompe l'oeil effect of CG, but one you couldn't see in
any other medium; it makes you want to reach out and be part of the
image on the screen."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the number of 2-D films scheduled for release this year,
many traditional animators have expressed concern about the future of
the art in the face of layoffs and restructuring at the studios.
Disney recently announced it was laying off 260 artists, raising
doubts in the industry about the studio's long-term commitment to
drawn animation. Some traditional animators have begun training in CG
to become "ambidextrous." Others have moved from feature production
to television animation, live-action, illustration, toys and computer
games. A few have even retired.</TE>
<TE>   But the majority are hoping that one or more of this year's
releases will score a big enough hit to generate a renewed interest
in 2-D films.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's any doubt that the animation industry is in
crisis right now, as we're in a major transition," says Kevin Koch,
president of the Motion Picture Screen Cartoonists Local No. 839.</TE>
<TE>   "The layoffs and reconfiguring at Disney are emblematic of what's
happening everywhere," he continues. "The sad part is that a few
years from now, we'll see the industry has lost some real talent: Not
everyone wants to try CG and they won't be able to wait for an upturn
in traditional projects.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we'll look back on this period as the catastrophe that
spurred the birth of new studios, independent projects and
innovations that would never have been tried at the big studios."</TE>

<TE>   Maurizio Pollini, piano</TE>
<TE>   Deutsche Grammophon</TE>
<TE>   His father, Gino Pollini, was a Milanese Modernist architect. His
uncle, Fausto Melotti, a Modernist sculptor. And more than any other
pianist, Maurizio Pollini is a builder.</TE>
<TE>   Everything he plays--visionary Beethoven, poetic Schumann,
crystalline Debussy or coolly calculated Boulez--sounds constructed
from the bottom up, the interpretations built layer upon imposing
layer. Pollini shapes his performances out of a piano tone so solid
that it feels as if it were physical substance. He grounds himself so
thoroughly in the music that he inhabits it; he doesn't take
listeners along for a ride, as does, say, Martha Argerich, so much as
invite them into it with him.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Pollini turned 60, and to celebrate that milestone,
Deutsche Grammophon has produced a 13-CD survey from his 30 years of
recordings with the company, ranging from Mozart to Giacomo Manzoni
(born in 1932 and the youngest composer Pollini has recorded). Along
with it, the label has released two new Pollini CDs of solo music by
Robert Schumann. Pollini isn't everyone's kind of pianist, and these
recordings are not to all tastes. But rare is the knowledgeable music
lover who does not, at the very least, hold the Italian pianist in
awe. By any reasonable standard, he is--and the records he makes
are--legendary.</TE>
<TE>   The usual objection to Pollini's playing is that his Apollonian
objectivity, his obsessive observance of a composer's wishes, his
persistent rationality flush emotion out of his performances. His
detractors feel that he takes the Modernist sculptural idea too far
and turns a living, changeable art into unyielding stone or steel;
that he is that exceptional Italian without sensuality.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that Pollini never gives anything less than an
intensely considered performance. With a penetrating intellect, he is
a perfectionist who focuses with almost frightening concentration on
every musical detail. Empowered with a superman's technique, he has
the means with which to solve musical problems in any way he wishes,
which only enhances his reputation for being analytical. Meanwhile,
his reticence to give interviews--and on the exceptional occasions
that he does, his refusal to discuss his personal life--makes some
think him standoffish.</TE>
<TE>   But none of this need imply that his playing lacks humanity or
warmth. Just to watch Pollini briskly walk on stage, with sheepish
smile, raring to go (he habitually downs a dozen cups of espresso
before a performance), is to see a highly appealing, unpretentious
performer. He is elegant in a way that seems inborn among the
sophisticated Milanese, yet he may forget to comb his hair and also
look endearingly frumpy.</TE>
<TE>   Pollini seems to have arrived on the scene fully formed. His
career was launched in 1960 when he took first place at the Frederic
Chopin Competition in Warsaw, and the judges declared that the
18-year-old played better than any of them. A bonus CD in the
"Pollini Edition" includes the first commercial release of his
winning competition performance of Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 1, and
the clean-textured, alert, exquisitely shaped, technically brilliant
playing already displays Pollini's hallmarks.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to make a similar studio recording for EMI, but his
perfectionism was so well ingrained that though the public was ready
for him, he was not yet ready for it. Instead, he spent most of the
'60s out of the limelight--practicing, expanding his repertory,
exploring 20th century music, joining other intellectuals and artists
in left-wing Italian political causes.</TE>
<TE>   When Pollini did reemerge, he was a mature artist. In 1971, he
made his first Deutsche Grammophon recording, which contained a
spectacular performance of Stravinsky's Three Movements from
"Petrushka." It caused a sensation when released the next year and
still astounds today for its speed, precision and clarity.</TE>
<TE>   That was followed by a Chopin disc, in which the Etudes sounded so
perfectly formed that many of us felt we were hearing these cherished
pieces for the first time. The Chopin recording cemented Pollini's
reputation as the most exciting pianist of his generation, and one of
the most satisfying, illuminating and all-around impressive pianists
of any generation.</TE>
<TE>   The "Pollini Edition" is evidence that the pianist lived up to
that promise. Throughout these recordings there is a remarkable
consistency over a wide range of repertory and over three decades.
The sound of the Chopin from 30 years ago and of his latest
recordings is surprising similar. He is consistent in his choice of
colleagues as well--concertos by Beethoven, Schumann, Brahms,
Schoenberg and Bartok are all conducted by his close friend of 40
years, Claudio Abbado.</TE>
<TE>   Still, changes inevitably occur in any musician, however objective
he may try to be. In the latest edition of the New Grove Dictionary
of Musicians, British critic David Fanning writes that in the late
'80s, "the nervous intensity of [Pollini's] playing began to show an
increasing rigidity of phrasing and tendency to clip rhythms." The
set and new releases allow an opportunity to gauge that in recordings
of Schumann over the years.</TE>
<TE>   The bonus CD includes a performance of Schumann's Piano Concerto
with Herbert von Karajan leading the Vienna Philharmonic taped during
a concert at the 1974 Salzburg Festival. Fifteen years later, Pollini
made a live recording of the work with Abbado and the Berlin
Philharmonic. There is a 28-year spread between Pollini's first solo
Schumann recording, the Fantasy, made in his favorite Munich hall in
1973, and the new recording of "Kreisleriana" made last year in the
same venue. And yes, his playing has indeed become sharper-edged.</TE>
<TE>   In the Karajan recording of the concerto, a young soloist appears
with the world's smoothest orchestra led by Mr. Smoothy himself at a
festival run by the control-freak conductor. Pollini fits right in
with impressively fleet, sterling playing polished to perfectly
reflect the Karajan shine. Years later, with the more collegial
Abbado in Berlin, Pollini takes a monumental approach; he and the
orchestra act as equals. There is a new boldness, power, authority
and magnificence in his playing for which "rigid" is far too rigid an
adjective. The verve of the younger Pollini is replaced by a greater
degree of richness, of wanting every note to stand for something. But
the exhilarating Pollini virtuosity, the speed and surety of his
fingers, remains.</TE>
<TE>   Again, a similar contrast can be found between the early Schumann
solo recordings and the latest. On first hearing, the new recording
of "Kreisleriana" does not sound as supple as performances by other
pianists. Pollini's reveals a violence and harshness, as if stripping
away the last shred of beguilement from his pianism. In fact, what he
is stripping away is interpretive excess in a search for musical
essence.</TE>
<TE>   In doing so, he restores to "Kreisleriana" the character of the
E.T.A. Hoffmann stories that inspired Schumann to write the work. The
impatient, perfectionist pianist reflects the spiritualist German
writer's frustrations with humankind's lack of imagination, which
were underscored by a nervously intense composer. In Pollini's hands,
this music's mysteries are not found on the surface.</TE>
<TE>   That Pollini simply embodies the piano can be heard over and over
again in these recordings. He brings severe fervor to Bartok's piano
concertos, and he exposes a rationalism so profound that it becomes
transcendent in his playing of late Beethoven sonatas. Transcendent
too is his explosive virtuosity, which makes Debussy's Etudes and
Boulez's Second Sonata light up the skies. The concentrated long
lines in his Schubert and Schoenberg become the epitome of lyricism.
Pollini was the first and only pianist to inspire Luigi Nono to write
for the piano, and "...sofferte onde serene..." for piano and tape is
like taking a musical submarine into the depths of Pollini pianistic
persona, a place of unfathomable wonder.</TE>
<TE>   As much as Deutsche Grammophon's Pollini overview has to offer, it
actually might have provided more. The 12 discs of reissued
recordings make satisfying, repackaged individual programs, yet it is
hard to think that anyone who would invest in the complete set
doesn't already own many of them. The bonus disc of the early live
Chopin and Schumann recordings is hardly a compensation. When the
label gets around to releasing the discs individually at mid-price,
however, they will be bargains.</TE>
<TE>   Most disappointing is that the label has not paid tribute to the
breadth of Pollini's interests or repertory. His discography, wide as
it is, still lacks the extremes of the music he plays in concert;
there is no Bach, Stockhausen or Sciarrino. In recent years, he has
curated venturesome series at the Salzburg Festival and Carnegie
Hall, where Renaissance choral music might rub shoulders with new
works by today's Italian and Austrian composers. Live recordings of
these concerts, which have included the likes of the Emerson Quartet,
would be of great value.</TE>
<TE>   And what about releasing on disc the lecture the pianist once gave
at a Beethoven symposium sponsored by Carnegie Hall? Not only did
Pollini prove more illuminating than any of the big-time academics on
hand, he was also the most charming--a sly sense of humor is one of
his secret weapons.</TE>
<TE>   We live in a golden age of pianists that includes the hot-tempered
Argerich, the poetic Murray Perahia, the vibrant Mitsuko Uchida, the
boldly venturesome Marc-Andre-Hamelin, the profound Peter Serkin.
Such young pianists as Arcadi Volodos and Marino Formenti, players
who astonish with fingers, ideas, individuality and overwhelming
charisma, give cause to jump for joy.</TE>
<TE>   And yet Maurizio Pollini's combination of gifts and devotion to
musical ideals keeps him in a class of his own. What he builds is
built to last.</TE>

<HD>Bugged, but Not Bothered</HD>
<DH>Retailers want to know what we think. I'd give up privacy
to tell them, even if I had to talk into the heel of a shoe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many of my friends find it creepy. Not me. I think it's about time
retail executives showed a little more interest in what we think.</LD>
<LD>   You may have read the dispatch from Times correspondent Stephanie
Simon about this latest happening in retailing: A decoy storefront
has opened in Minneapolis. Inside is a corporate surveillance
operation. Everything shoppers say is recorded by hidden microphones.
Their every move, their every facial expression, is filmed by
remote-control video cameras.</LD>
<LD>   These tapes are then studied. Manufacturers and retailers hope to
learn a few things by watching us.</LD>
<TE>   I guess we could call it "reality TV goes shopping."</TE>
<TE>   Better late than never.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, I've listened to the cynical, knee-jerk objections. Big
Business looms as Big Brother, yikes. But that's beside the point. We
gave up our privacy as shoppers long ago. Hidden cameras and
undercover detectives are ubiquitous already. Retailers regard anyone
who walks in the door as a suspect, and who can blame them?</TE>
<TE>   This is different. These tape and video recorders are deployed
because the people who make and sell goods, at last, want to know
what we think, spontaneously, unrehearsed and honestly. In the
executive suites, they care so much that they are willing to pay
$100,000 to play Peeping Tom on the jury deliberations on American
consumerism. A raised eyebrow, Simon reported, is carefully studied
for its implications for future sales.</TE>
<TE>   For one, I'll give up my privacy for the chance to be heard. What
could be sweeter than a pipeline to the top dogs?</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the other day I walked into one of those famous
chain bookstores that get roughed up so often by smug literary
elitists. I don't think it's such a bad chain. I often buy books
there. I was, in fact, working on a column in its defense. Then I
watched the customer in front of me buy $72 worth of books on a
credit card and ask for telephone change for a $1 bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry, we can't open the register on a credit card sale," says
clerk to customer. "You could try Starbucks next door."</TE>
<TE>   Since I was still living in the past, I had no choice but to
summon the manager and explain my own quaint theories about customer
relations, even though we both knew he was powerless to buck
corporate policy about opening the cash register. I did note,
however, that the manager failed to check his pocket to see if he
happened to have change for a buck.</TE>
<TE>   But in the new wired world, I could just stroll over to the
store's true crime section, arch my eyebrow and speak into a book:
"Ah, dude: I know you're listening back there in New York, so I
wanted you to understand why you won't be reading any tributes from
me right away.... "</TE>
<TE>   For the last couple of days, I've been contemplating the terrific
opportunities we'll have in this brave new world.</TE>
<TE>   Shopper to a bag of corn chips: "Nice try, but I know you're
putting fewer chips in this bag and charging the same. So I'm going
back to raisins."</TE>
<TE>   Shopper to a display case: "I came here to buy a blender. If only
there was someone to help. But perhaps you can pan your camera over
there and see that your young sales clerk is breaking up with his
girlfriend on the phone ... bye."</TE>
<TE>   These are not exactly the reactions that the marketing department
is seeking. As I understand it, companies are more interested in
discovering whether we will pay $70 for a household air freshener.
Well, I'm happy to answer those kinds of questions too. "No. Never.
Not for half the price. Are you out of your minds?"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, I'm going to look at the fine print on the signs
outside retail stores. When I find the words "test mode" or some
other subtle warning that the merchandise has been bugged, that's
where I intend to shop.</TE>
<TE>   Forget those complaint letters to the customer relations
department. I never get an answer anyway. Now, I'll be able to say it
right into the heel of a size 10 shoe: "Seventy-one styles you sell,
but there's nothing in my size, 11? And no, I won't be happy to order
online."</TE>
<TE>   With both eyebrows arched, I can address a halibut filet at the
grocery store: "How come we get nutritional information about breath
mints but not about you? And not about the poultry, meat, cheese and
vegetables, either?"</TE>
<TE>   Now if only the airlines would put microphones in coach.</TE>

<AU>STEVEN B. JACOBS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the great influences in my life has been the reconciliation of
Germany and Israel after the Holocaust. It has stood as a model for
people overcoming the need for revenge and transcending hatred.</LD>
<LD>   Now my hopes for an intelligent and fruitful discussion about how
Muslims, Christians and Jews might navigate the challenges of the
Middle East have been torn asunder.</LD>
<LD>   The distrust in the Middle East, as well as the hopelessness and
fear there, has found its way into the once-hopeful Muslim-Jewish
Dialogue here. The meeting rooms in Los Angeles have become tense and
accusatory. The total assault on Israel as the aggressor and the
accusations of genocide and Hitlerism have produced a chasm too deep
to navigate goodwill. It is a reminder of the famous hoax of
hatred--the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion.</LD>
<TE>   Before any truths were rooted out or any investigation conducted,
Israel was singly blamed for the atrocities in Jenin. Condemnation
was immediate. Issues of justice mattered not.</TE>
<TE>   I attended a local rally on behalf of Palestinians where I saw
large signs with a picture of the Star of David next to a swastika. I
attended a rally on behalf of Israel where Jewish teenagers equated
Yasser Arafat with Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   I have been a loving critic of Israel. With other left-leaning
rabbis, I have been outspoken in support of a Palestinian state. We
advocated ending the 35-year occupation and have spoken in favor of,
if not dismantling the settlements on the West Bank, certainly ending
their growth. Our vision was, and continues to be, a dream that
someday Arabs and Jews would coexist in those settlements instead of
dismantling all of them. These dreams will continue.</TE>
<TE>   But, as the intifada has grown, so have anger and hatred in both
the Jewish and Muslim communities locally and across the United
States. I thought things would be different here. They are not. Some
of my colleagues have left the Muslim-Jewish Dialogue, fearing
futility. Now I too must leave. The war is not only in the Middle
East; it is here, and sadly so.</TE>
<TE>   The lessons of reconciliation and the so-called lessons of history
have been lost on those of us who work daily for justice and an end
to violence. We have stopped seeing the humanity of the other.</TE>
<TE>   What I felt was important in our local dialogue was an
understanding of one another's suffering. Arabs have been victimized.
Israelis' identity in large part comes from the Holocaust; they feel
victimized on a never-ending scale. We viciously compete with one
another now over who has suffered the most and whose cause is the
more just.</TE>
<TE>   For a long time, I believed that we on the political left
understood oppression and could steer the way in these turbulent
times. But I now must admit that with all the hatred and cruelty we
have lost our compass.</TE>
<TE>   Once, we interfaith dialoguers protested injustice and strove
passionately toward shared goals. We stood up for life and against
bloodshed. Now we just blame one another continually.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, our contributions are diminished.</TE>
<TE>   Dialogue and movement would be possible if each of us assumed
responsibility for our side's atrocities. The blame game is now the
modus operandi. It is a betrayal of everything our faiths have taught
us to believe about God and humanity as we continue on this road of
religious destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone in the Jewish world or the Muslim world who cannot see the
desperate weighing of needs, fears and bleeding of both sides truly
breaches everything we teach our children about fairness and
another's pain. If Yasser Arafat and Ariel Sharon have failed there,
we have failed here. These are the circumstances that pull even the
best of friends apart.</TE>
<TE>   Israel and Palestine are multilateral lands. They are sacred to
Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Visions of justice, peace and love
were born there. A rabbi--and dear friend--wrote: "This once
beautiful land, through the unremitting violence of Israelis, and
Palestinians, has become stained with the blood of the innocent. Each
day has brought its own fearful symmetry of revenge."</TE>
<TE>   I shudder to think that our visions of peace and justice can be
lost here. We must break our own symmetry of revenge before it is too
late.</TE>

<LD>"Can I go get my textbook? It's like in my locker," said Monica.</LD>
<LD>   "Where is it really?" I asked her.</LD>
<LD>   Anyone who spends much time with teenagers has noticed their
unfortunate use of the word "like" outside the parameters of
affection or comparison. As a high school teacher, I probably hear
more than 100 superfluous "likes" a day.</LD>
<TE>   For instance: "Do you have like a pencil I can borrow?" Craig
asked me. I handed him a ballpoint pen. "But I need a pencil!" he
exclaimed. "You asked for something like a pencil," I replied.</TE>
<TE>   Feeling duty-bound to correct this embarrassing linguistic lapse,
I tried to humorously illustrate to students how silly they sound
when they, like, speak this way. My approach didn't work. Consider
the response I got from Jessica, who described her family's trip to
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "My favorite part was when we went to see, like, the Supreme
Court," Jessica said. "I thought you saw the real Supreme Court," I
chided. Jessica stared, puzzled. "That's what I said," she retorted.</TE>
<TE>   So I decided to up the ante with some of my sophomores, who seem
especially grammatically challenged. I offered to award 10 extra
points each to their final exam scores if they could make it until
the end of the term without more than 10 extra-grammatical "likes."</TE>
<TE>   Drew, pessimistic about the group's chances but eager for the
extra credit, instantly devised a strategy to get the points. "Nobody
say anything from now on!" he ordered his classmates, who broke out
in laughter.</TE>
<TE>   They agreed to try, though. That day I noticed Tiffani stop and
furrow her brow as she thought through a sentence before speaking.
"What do we have for homework this week?" Tiffani asked slowly, in
possibly the most grammatical sentence she's spoken this term. Then
she sighed in relief and cried, "That was so hard!"</TE>
<TE>   Our resident wiseacre, Harris, tried his best to set off my alarm.
"I like ... that video we watched, Mr. Jo," he said with a smirk.
"Not bad," I told him. But they didn't win the points. Some students
quickly forgot the challenge and slipped back into old habits, and
others sabotaged the experiment for a joke. "Like, we're never gonna
make it!" cracked John.</TE>
<TE>   They needed to last 15 days until the fall semester ended. They
reached their 10th "like" on the first day in about 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   I was sorry they didn't at least make it interesting and offered
to let them try again with more favorable rules. "Forget it, Mr. Jo,"
said one. "It's like impossible."</TE>

<HD>An Odious Roadblock to History</HD>
<DH>Presidential papers belong to the American people. They
must not be locked away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A fight is brewing in Washington that may produce a perfect
constitutional storm.</LD>
<LD>   An executive order from President Bush has all three branches of
government colliding over the question of who controls access to
presidential papers. The outcome of this fight may redefine aspects
of executive privilege as well as core principles of open government.</LD>
<LD>   With this order, the president is not simply on the wrong side of
history, he stands squarely in its path.</LD>
<TE>   This order potentially could deprive history of some of its most
important records. Trying to understand our history without reading
presidential records is like trying to understand the Bible without
reading Genesis.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of this developing debate is a rather innocuous
figure: the archivist of the United States. Bush became familiar with
this position when the archivist sent him a notice that he was
preparing to release the papers of President Reagan on Jan. 20, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   This was done under the 1978 Presidential Records Act, which
mandates the release of unclassified records 12 years after a
president leaves office. Not only do some of these documents involve
President Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, but they also involve more
than a dozen current high-ranking administration officials, including
Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Historians are particularly interested in the material to shed
further light on the Iran-Contra scandal, as well as other
controversies that led to the criminal convictions of some Reagan
administration officials.</TE>
<TE>   After reviewing the material, Bush responded with the executive
order that effectively rewrote the Presidential Records Act,
converting it from a measure guaranteeing public access to one that
blocks it. The order strips the archivist of authority to give the
public access to these papers and lets a former president
indefinitely delay their release. The issuance of the order from the
executive branch brought the judicial branch into the mix. A federal
court is now reviewing the constitutionality of the order, which is
much in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the legislative branch will enter the fray with a bill
in the House that would nullify the Bush order and reassert the
authority of the legislative branch over these documents as public
property. Not only is such a move relatively rare, but this fight is
headed by leading Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   A brief glance at the order explains why both Democrats and
Republicans are so outraged. Under one of the order's more freakish
provisions, a former president can transfer the right to invoke
executive privilege to anyone of his choosing.</TE>
<TE>   The order would also extend the privilege beyond the death of a
former president, allowing the privilege to be passed on to anyone of
his choosing: a half-wit nephew or a drinking buddy. It would even
allow a former president to transfer his executive privilege
authority to a foreign citizen.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush order is not simply unconstitutional, it is insulting to
anyone who cherishes our constitutional structure. The order would
convert a core presidential power into a matter of probate, like some

<TE>   Currently, Richard M. Nixon's daughters are in court because they
cannot agree on the running of the Nixon library. Imagine how we
would determine which daughter was favored by Daddy to exercise his
presidential power.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush order would even allow family members to go to court to
declare a former president incompetent or disabled. They could then
appoint a person or "group" to exercise executive privilege regarding
presidential papers over the objections of a "disabled" former
president.</TE>
<TE>   James Madison once wrote that "[a] popular Government, without
popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue
to a Farce or a Tragedy; or perhaps both." Before the Bush order, the
citizens were assured that they would eventually be able to review
actions taken in their name. Likewise, government officials knew that
their conduct would ultimately be judged by history.</TE>
<TE>   No president relishes the moment on some cold January morning when
he is transformed from a history maker to a subject of history.
However, it is important for presidents to understand that, in the
end, they are all mere players in the making of their own legacy.</TE>

<HD>Seeking Aliens on the Extraterrestrial Highway</HD>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>RACHEL, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Aliens led Pat Travis to this tiny desert outpost along the lonely
Extraterrestrial Highway. She says she's even seen some, though they
were in the form of tourists.</LD>
<LD>   Here at the Little A'Le'Inn bar, cafe and motel, smack dab in the
middle of nowhere, Travis' story is not only believed, it's welcomed.</LD>
<LD>   "I've had people tell me they've been abducted in one of my
rooms," the owner says, pouring a glass of orange juice for a
customer. "I watched a craft for 20 minutes one night."</LD>
<TE>   The 65 residents and the many tourists who have found their way to
this oddity of a town near the Area 51 military base on the dry Groom
Lake bed say they've seen UFOs, aliens and otherworldly occurrences.</TE>
<TE>   Beams of light? Resident Charles Clark has seen them. Orange
glows? Yep, someone's seen them too. Little green men? Not yet, but
the night is still young.</TE>
<TE>   Locals and visitors--even those not of this world--find a rhythm
here in a quaint, friendly place where tall tales are swapped over
cold beers and $3.75 alien burgers.</TE>
<TE>   "You can talk about aliens. You can talk about abductions," Travis
says. "It makes it a totally different place."</TE>
<TE>   Residents say the UFO talk began years ago when a Nevada Test Site
worker claimed that he saw alien ships at nearby Area 51, the
supersecret base whose existence the military only recently
acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Word got around, and the stories haven't stopped. Even the state
got in on the UFO lore, officially naming a 98-mile stretch of Nevada
Route 375 the Extraterrestrial Highway in 1996 and erecting green
highway signs with images of spaceships.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 miles north of Las Vegas, across miles of empty desert
speckled with Joshua trees and sagebrush, Rachel is the only town
along the alien highway.</TE>
<TE>   It's really just a collection of trailers resting on gravel near
the mountain backdrop, but the Little A'Le'Inn beckons curious and
thirsty tourists from the monotonous drive.</TE>
<TE>   "Welcome earthlings and/or aliens. Please specify planet," reads a
sign on the white trailer with faded blue trim.</TE>
<TE>   Here, cows have the right of way and the residents seem a bit more
peculiar than most folks.</TE>
<TE>   There's Clark, an astrophotographer whose idea of a good time is
to drive to the boundary of Area 51 and pester the guards.</TE>
<TE>   "The majority of people who have lived here at one point or
another have seen things that are beyond explanation," he says,
taking his seat at the bar.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's Travis, a former Las Vegas casino cook who moved
to Rachel 14 years ago from Las Vegas with her husband, Joe, to take
over the town's only bar. "You gotta be nuts," friends told the
couple.</TE>
<TE>   They remodeled the trailer and called it the Little A'Le'Inn.
Along with serving homemade meals, the couple filled the bar with
flying saucer pictures and alien souvenirs: key chains, shot glasses,
bumper stickers, Area 51 fake ID cards, alien slime in a tube, gooey
aliens in a jar.</TE>
<TE>   "Every business needs a gimmick," she likes to say.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be just what tourists wanted. They come from all
over, enduring hours of highway boredom to sample a most unusual
world where strangers are always welcome. Even military personnel
working on the nearby ranges stop by, but they rarely say much.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the patrons entertain the idea of extraterrestrial
visitors. "I think it's a possibility," tourist George Zoukee of
Newbury, N.H., says of UFO sightings. "Even if it isn't, it's a
little fun."</TE>
<TE>   Grover Shegrud of Seattle shuffles in the back of the cafe,
sorting through Area 51 T-shirts. He hasn't had much luck witnessing
the paranormal. "Just dust devils," he mumbles.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Little A'Le'Inn, tourists usually make their way to
the border of Area 51, which consists of a no-trespassing sign, a
surveillance camera and an armed guard on a hill. UFO and conspiracy
enthusiasts believe alien technology is hidden at the remote base,
about 20 miles southwest of Rachel.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the black mailbox, which is actually white. It's a
rancher's mailbox along the highway that has become a landmark to
stop and see Area 51 from afar. It was repainted years ago, but it's
still called the black mailbox around these parts.</TE>
<TE>   The front door of the Little A'Le'Inn swings open again and Bonny
Barry, Rachel's newest resident, enters. She moved here two weeks ago
to work at the cafe, making her resident No. 65.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not egotistical enough as to think that God would only create
us," she says.</TE>
<TE>   A few tourists nod.</TE>
<TE>   Travis, 58, says she's met three aliens in her bar, though she
didn't know it until later. They were tourists, and one left a note:
"I am not of your world."</TE>
<TE>   "How can we say things like this don't happen?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   A few more guests trickle in, but by 10 p.m. residents have
returned to their trailers and visitors to their travels or their
rooms. The Little A'Le'Inn closes as the darkness of the desert sky
descends.</TE>

<AU>MICHELLE LOCKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ARCATA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Sixteen years ago, Kevin L. Hoover chanced across a newspaper item
about someone stuffing cheese into the ears and nose of a statue of
President McKinley in the Arcata town square.</LD>
<LD>   Hoover was intrigued on two counts: that a small town with a
square and a statue actually existed outside of TV, and that someone
would feel moved to coat it with cheddar.</LD>
<LD>   With three days to kill, he came up for a visit and "just totally
fell in love" with Arcata, an old logging town of about 16,000 in the
coastal redwoods of Northern California.</LD>
<TE>   He quit his job near San Francisco, where he had been working in
"let's just say retail," and took a job at the Arcata Union
newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   There he worked as a production assistant until the day a harried
editor made a fateful decision. She asked Hoover to do the police log
for the day.</TE>
<TE>   Hoover looked at a police account of a car full of drunks
(toasted) which crashed (coasted) and a poem suggested itself.
Shrugging off the straitjacket of conventional journalism, he wrote
it.</TE>
<TE>   "I started kind of chiseling away at the seriousness of it. I
mean, how can you not? This town is so wacky," says Hoover of Arcata,
a nuclear-free zone that for a while had the distinction of a Green
Party majority on its City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen years later, Hoover is Arcata's master of rhymes and
misdemeanors, the writer of a newspaper police blotter so good it's
criminal.</TE>
<TE>   Like other crime reporters, Hoover gets his raw material from the
daily bulletins filed by police in stern, telegraphic prose. The
difference is what he does with it.</TE>
<TE>   A report of a stolen bike becomes wistful: "That nice green
21-speed on Austin Way is just a memory now."</TE>
<TE>   An out-of-towner's drunk-driving arrest gets the folksy treatment:
"Possession of marijuana, possession of alcohol, possession of a
driving-impairing liquor buzz. These are things that make an Arcata
police officer grow a big ol' frown. Being from Visalia is somewhat
excusable."</TE>
<TE>   A case of shoplifted steak becomes a sizzling slice of life:
"Equipped with opposing thumb and forefinger, an ingrained
hunter-gatherer species tradition and a crazy dream, a man entered a
24-hour supermarket and, say police, stuffed some animal parts under
his jacket and fled the store."</TE>
<TE>   Some police business isn't remotely amusing, of course, and Hoover
knows it. "If there's a family problem or ... any kind of real
violence, obviously that's not very funny."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the fellows who decided to trick-or-treat sans
costumes--any costumes--last Halloween were simply begging to be
limericked:</TE>
<TE>   A half-dozen near-naked dudes</TE>
<TE>   Were out trick-or-treating all nude.</TE>
<TE>   A cop found the lads</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat scantily clad</TE>
<TE>   And sent them away freshly clued.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, the Union went under. So Hoover, working with not much
more than his desktop computer, started the Eye. The weekly
newspaper's police log is a devious delight, not only for Arcatans
but also for the many out-of-towners who follow it by Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "Every once in a while, there's that jewel in there. You go, 'Wow!
This is great!'" says local businessman Bruce Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   Names are withheld to protect the presumed innocent, but
occasionally the Eye gets an angry letter from someone who has
recognized his or her most embarrassing moment. Hoover, the Eye's
editor and publisher, figures some people don't like seeing their
pratfalls in print, with or without laughs, so "I might as well bring
out the humor."</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Arcata policeman Bob Murphy calls Hoover's column "cool."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy, the hero of a recent item, "Stoned souls harvested by the
Grim Ranger," doesn't mind a bit if people are laughing as they're
learning about the doings of the ranger program, a relatively new
police park-cleanup initiative.</TE>
<TE>   "It's neat to see it publicized," Murphy says.</TE>
<TE>   The log has its own lexicon.</TE>
<TE>   The county jail in nearby Eureka is painted pink, meaning
miscreants go to the Pink House or simply get Pinked.</TE>
<TE>   Skipping out on a restaurant bill is a scarf-n-scram; doing
something similar at the gas station is a fill-n-flee.</TE>
<TE>   Arcata isn't exactly a crime capital. There were no murders and
only one attempted homicide last year. But there was plenty of log
fodder.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to let the items tell themselves," Hoover says. "My
favorite ones are just the anecdotes where there was some little
interaction between people, people with all their mixed-up ideas
about the way things should work.''</TE>
<TE>   Thumbing through a stack of recent reports in the tidy lobby of
Arcata's police station, he pauses at an item about a woman reporting
that magnetic forces from space are controlling her mind--"Do I make
this stuff up or what?"--and then skims on.</TE>
<TE>   At some point before his 7 a.m. Monday deadline, Hoover sits down
at his computer with a mission to inform and entertain.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, he gently scolds:</TE>
<TE>   "In retrospect, it would have [been] better for the bicyclist to
have actually, you know, stopped at the Eighth and G streets stop
sign."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes only a haiku will do.</TE>
<TE>   "I try never to repeat myself," he says. "I'll sit there ... for
20 minutes saying, 'No, I can't say that. No, that's too easy.' It
forces you into more and more abstruse types of expression. But then
you still have to exercise that discipline of reporting it clearly
enough so people can understand it."</TE>
<TE>   Most readers catch on, he hopes.</TE>
<TE>   "I am," says Hoover, "celebrating the ridiculous."</TE>

<AU>BECKY BOHRER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HAVRE, Mont.</DL>
<LD>Mike Williams hasn't sold a big $100,000 farm tractor or combine in
three years; his implement dealership used to sell from four to nine
a year. It's been more than a year and a half since he's even taken
home a paycheck.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, now living off his savings, has whittled down his
inventory, laid off workers and asked himself, at the end of a long
day, if he'd be better off just walking away.</LD>
<LD>   "Some days I look out the window and wonder, 'Is it worth it?'" he
said. It's become a matter of survival for small-business owners like
Williams and countless others across drought-stricken north-central
Montana. The farmers and ranchers who once loyally bought cars,
combines and chemicals now are holding tight to what money they
have--or seeking better deals in bigger cities.</LD>
<TE>   Implement and feed dealers and the farmers they support are
feeling the effects of four years of drought and a reeling
agricultural economy. And another drought year is taking shape.</TE>
<TE>   Once optimistic, many farmers seem resigned to another terribly
dry year. Recent snowstorms have helped some but promise no immediate
end to dry conditions. Rivers and reservoirs hold less water than
normal, wells and springs have gone dry, mountain snowpack is
lagging, and dry Montana soil is being blown away.</TE>
<TE>   So, as farmers survey wheat fields of dust and ranchers walk
pastures grazed to the nubs, difficult choices are being made. Some
have sold out, purging cattle herds built up over generations. Others
are trying to diversify, a risky move rich with debt. Still others
are preparing to head for the fields, aiming for another year in
business and praying for rain in a state just declared a drought
disaster area, once again.</TE>
<TE>   "I can hang on for a while. The question is, do I want to?" asked
37-year-old wheat farmer Pat Dailey of Chester, Mont. In the region's
towns, there are vacant storefronts, quiet Main Streets, seemingly
constant chatter about rain--or at least the hope of rain. Sometimes,
hometown service is provided with a forced smile.</TE>
<TE>   Local leaders are seeking ways to diversify their towns'
agriculture-driven economies. But, as Havre Mayor Bob Rice said, "The
problem here is, we've lived on agriculture so long, the way the
farmers and ranchers go is the way the city goes. And that's not good
right now."</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of Fort Benton's businesses are agriculture related,
officials said. The town and Chouteau County watched its last
implement dealer close last spring, leaving farmers and ranchers to
drive 40 to 100 miles for parts or equipment. Chester, across the
county line, lost its dealer last fall. Roger Axtman, whose family
ran Axtman Farm Equipment Inc. at Fort Benton, said the business lost
about 60% of its customer base over five years.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't taking home any wages," said Axtman, who now works at
a real estate agency. "When you have no money coming in, it's better
to be working for somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   At Power Motors, one of two dealers of new and used cars and
trucks at Fort Benton, sales are slow and loyal customers are
thinning, said office manager Cecilia Dostal.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people would order new vehicles every year or so, and no
longer," she said. "We used to have loyal customers. Now, they go to
six or seven places for deals."</TE>
<TE>   Fewer customers come through Ed Lehman's hardware store in Fort
Benton. They spend less than they once did, forcing him to reduce
inventories of frying pans and hammers or simply eliminate items. He
has opted to diversify in hopes of drawing in customers, adding paint
and plumbing supplies, appliances and furniture. It's a gamble.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we won't have to close it," Lehman said. "The bank might
close it."</TE>
<TE>   Customers prowl aisles of cards, souvenirs and crafts while
awaiting their prescriptions at the Benton Pharmacy, the only one
left in Chouteau County. On a recent Monday evening, the dinner rush
at Bob's Riverfront consisted of six diners.</TE>
<TE>   "People are uptight, stressed. We still have bills to pay," owner
Robert Knox said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Novak does not foresee imminent layoffs at his Chester travel
center--a grocery, gas station and Subway sandwich shop. But the
prospect keeps him awake some nights. For many of his 30 employees,
work there is the only family income.</TE>
<TE>   "You get sick in the stomach to know your business could fail,"
Novak said. But, "there are a lot of circumstances beyond people's
control. They just need to realize they have to do the best they
can."</TE>
<TE>   Farmers' efforts to reduce expenses has exerted a strain on local
businesses, said Michael Walstad, a vice president at Heritage Bank
at Chester. Loans are available. But, unlike farmers themselves,
"there are no disaster payments."</TE>
<TE>   United Agri Products in Havre has had to expand its coverage area
to find new customers, creating new expenses, said manager Arleen
Rice. Chemical tanks stand on the lot, reminding Rice of her concerns
with weeds or undernourished soil as farmers cut any possible corners
to reduce expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time to deal with harsh realities," she said.</TE>

<HD>Only Gamble Is Picking the Right Client</HD>
<DH>Commerce: Independent contractors offer players private
jets, lavish suites. If the high rollers bet big, the casino pays
big--and picks up the perks.</DH>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>It's just before midnight and Steve Cyr sits sipping $125 shots of
King Louis XIII cognac with a man who just lost $4,000 at Binion's
Horseshoe Club casino.</LD>
<LD>   But the gambler doesn't seem upset. In fact, he's buying the
drinks.</LD>
<LD>   It's been an expensive night, but the key is whether he had fun.
He did, thanks to Cyr.</LD>
<TE>   The 38-year-old Cyr is a host--an independent contractor whose job
is to bring the big gamblers into the casinos that hire him.</TE>
<TE>   More than that, he's a high-roller hunter, always looking for
"whales," casino lingo for the biggest gamblers, those willing to
risk thousands--even millions--of dollars. The high rollers drive
casino profits, and they can assure a big payday for Cyr too.</TE>
<TE>   He earns a six-figure income each year through a salary from the
casinos and commissions based on how much gamblers bet and how long
they play.</TE>
<TE>   Hosts like Cyr (pronounced "seer") offer gamblers private jets,
Super Bowl tickets, lavish suites and lots of booze--all so the high
rollers bet big money. If the gamblers play big, the casino pays the
perks.</TE>
<TE>   Cyr boasts of his connections around the country, with ticket
brokers, for example. "You can call me Super Bowl Sunday and sit on
the 50-yard line," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He hosts about 300 gamblers from all over the country--California,
Texas, New Jersey. Of those, 70 are high rollers who risk at least
$50,000 a trip; 14 are whales willing to bet half a million dollars
on an outing.</TE>
<TE>   The rest are small-time players who are good networkers for Cyr.
They own restaurants, bars, fishing-lure companies or hold product
patents.</TE>
<TE>   John Aspinwall waits in his suite at the Hard Rock hotel-casino
for Cyr to arrive. He and his friends feast on shrimp with their
cocktails and beers, courtesy of the casino.</TE>
<TE>   Owner of a chain of car washes, Aspinwall is one of Cyr's most
loyal players. They've known each other for years, and Aspinwall will
go to any casino Cyr takes him.</TE>
<TE>   "He takes care of people," says Aspinwall, who lives in Madison,
Wis. "It's fun when you can just place a call and he just takes care
of it."</TE>
<TE>   Clean-cut and sharply dressed, Cyr arrives with his girlfriend,
Tanya Chiodini, and a few gamblers. He summons two limousines and the
group is off to a steak dinner hosted by Binion's downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Casino owner Becky Behnen stops by to greet Cyr and his guests.
Cyr entertains with a few silly card tricks, and the group toasts to
a good night. Cyr listens for buzz words in the conversation like
"private jet" or "marker," clues that tell him someone is a big
player he should get to know.</TE>
<TE>   Aspinwall, 45, isn't a whale, but does play thousands of dollars
each time he comes to town.</TE>
<TE>   He visits so often and has such great connections to other players
that it's worth it to Cyr to spend time with him. Plus, Cyr likes
Aspinwall, and they have a good time together.</TE>
<TE>   Cyr gets Aspinwall and his other players things like concert
tickets, shopping sprees, leather jackets. Once he gave an $85,000
Dodge Viper to a player who lost millions of dollars, and he took
another group to Greece in a private plane--all paid for by the
casino.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, the gamblers have to play a certain amount. How much
they bet defines how they'll be treated.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't look at it as whether I win or lose," Aspinwall says. "I
look at whether I had fun. If I lose $10,000, I lose $10,000."</TE>
<TE>   The dinner tab is $869 for the group of 13. Aspinwall and his
friends leave a $340 tip before heading to the casino.</TE>
<TE>   While Aspinwall hits a blackjack table, Cyr eyes the gamblers.
Binion's is a crowded, smoky joint that doesn't look like a high
roller's haven, but they can play anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   How a big gambler does at the tables can determine whether a
casino wins or loses that day.</TE>
<TE>   "[High rollers] drive business. They drive revenues. They drive
profits," says Jason Ader, a gambling analyst with Bear Stearns.</TE>
<TE>   And that means they get the outrageous rewards.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just obscene," says Anthony Curtis, a casino expert and
publisher of Las Vegas-based Huntington Press. "It's just a whole
other world that most people can't conceive of. It's crazy what the
casino has gotten itself into."</TE>
<TE>   But, Curtis says, it's a necessity. "Hosts are responsible for
bringing in the money that the house needs to survive."</TE>
<TE>   Casinos are always upping the ante, looking for ways to court the
best players. State gambling regulators recently approved new rules
allowing casinos to create private gambling salons for big bettors.</TE>
<TE>   Cyr spends hours on the phone luring gamblers and arranging their
trips. His cell phone rings 40 to 50 times a day. It's all about
networking--finding out who's in town, who's coming and how much
they're willing to bet. He broke into the business by going to the
airport and looking for limousine drivers holding up arrival signs
for hotel guests. Then he'd call the hotels and ask for the guests.</TE>
<TE>   He befriended golf-course workers and asked who was betting on the
course. That could be a sign they'd bet in the casinos too.</TE>
<TE>   What Cyr doesn't want is winners. He wants losers--the kind who
will bet a lot and keep betting, even when they're down.</TE>
<TE>   "People think my high rollers are doctors and lawyers. Those guys
are stiffs. I'd rather have the construction worker that'll give me a
shot at $50,000. I want risk-takers," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Gamblers who make bad decisions and play when they're down get
most of his attention, and they're usually the ones who get the
suites.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of rich people are so dumb, I don't know how they made
their money," Cyr says.</TE>
<TE>   To gain credit at a casino, a players must give a birth date and
Social Security number. That's all Cyr needs to check a financial
history and find out if there's money to cover any losses.</TE>
<TE>   He knows the gamblers' bank account balances, how much they play,
their strategies, how much they owe the casino and--more
important--how much they're willing to risk.</TE>
<TE>   Even as he's the charming buddy at the tables, Cyr will easily
"zap" the bank account of someone who hasn't settled up with the
casino.</TE>
<TE>   A player who borrows from the casino signs a marker agreeing to
repay the money. It's essentially a check to the casino, and if the
gambler doesn't pay, Cyr sends the check to the bank.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more important to a lot of wealthy people than their banker,"
says Cyr, who is featured in a book on high rollers that will be out
this summer.</TE>
<TE>   He's been fired seven times. Mostly, he says, because he can't
keep his mouth shut. But he always lands another job as
host--sometimes from the same casino that fired him. When Cyr and
other hosts leave a casino, they usually take more than their pink
slips. "If you don't hire me, I'm going to steal all your customers,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Back at Binion's Horseshoe, Cyr spies a guy in a red shirt playing
craps. The casino pit boss tells him the man already has lost
$400,000.</TE>
<TE>   Cyr passes the gambler by because he's supposed to be teaching
this casino's marketing staff how to land high rollers, not trying to
steal them away. Still, it bugs him. "I'm wishing," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, Cyr meets Aspinwall again. He has invited 23
players to watch the Super Bowl at a private party at Ellis Island, a
tiny casino behind the Strip most tourists don't know exists.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Cyr's players have never been here either, but they show
up because Cyr is here. They have a free meal and some drinks, then
know it's time to gamble.</TE>
<TE>   "Look how loyal they are to me. We're in the middle of nowhere,"
Cyr boasts, calling them all "degenerates." The players don't seem to
mind.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the best in Vegas," says Michael Angelo, a gambler from
Springfield, N.J. "He knows how to treat a guy like nobody else.
Liquor keeps me happy. It's all good."</TE>
<TE>   Angelo, who owns a marketing firm, says he once lost $700,000 in
four days, But he's won a lot too, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Win or lose, for gamblers like Angelo, it's all about the host.</TE>
<TE>   "It's everything to a gambler," he says, playing a hand of
blackjack. "You want to go where somebody knows your name. Everybody
likes something for nothing, even though you got to lose a lot to get
it."</TE>

<HD>An Oft-Overlooked Figure in Lewis, Clark Saga</HD>
<DH>History: Sacagawea's son was born during the expedition and
lived in Europe for a time. Little is known of his life, which ended
in the West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Sacagawea carried her infant son on her back when she trudged along
with Lewis and Clark on their Voyage of Discovery to the Pacific.</LD>
<LD>   Jean Baptiste Charbonneau was 55 days old when the explorers left
Ft. Mandan in present-day North Dakota in 1805 and headed west into
the unknown.</LD>
<LD>   "This was the first child this woman had boarn and as is common in
such cases, her labor was tedious and the pain violent," Meriwether
Lewis wrote in his journal.</LD>
<TE>   Interpreter Rene Jessaume suggested a folk remedy--a rattlesnake
rattle crumbled in water. Sacagawea drank it, and because of it, or
in spite of it, Jean Baptiste entered the world 10 minutes later on
Feb. 11, 1805.</TE>
<TE>   When he left it 61 years later at an obscure ranch in Oregon's
southeastern corner, he had lived in a German castle and toured
Europe and Africa with a prince, learned several languages, lived
among the elite mountain men and worked as a trapper, a gold miner, a
scout and an interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   As the Lewis and Clark bicentennial nears, historians would like
to know more about Jean Baptiste.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of his life is somewhat documented, but there are places
where he does disappear," said Jeremy Skinner of the special
collections department at Portland's Lewis and Clark College, the
largest collection of printed material on the 1803-1806 expedition.</TE>
<TE>   He said much material has been lost. "There's a chance that
there's more information out there, but so far nobody has found
much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Once back from Europe, Jean Baptiste vanished, only to pop up now
and again in the memoirs and diaries of other trappers and explorers.
He left no known memoirs. Only two samples of his handwriting are
known to exist.</TE>
<TE>   His father was Toussaint Charbonneau, a French-Canadian trapper
whose life also is spotty. Charbonneau won Sacagawea, one of his
wives, as a gambling prize.</TE>
<TE>   Sacagawea, a Shoshone, was captured by the Hidatsa when she was
about 12. She, Charbonneau and their newborn son were living at the
Mandan village when the Corps of Discovery wintered there in
1804-1805.</TE>
<TE>   The explorers hired Charbonneau as an interpreter. Sacagawea and
her baby were part of the deal. While Sacagawea has been described as
a guide, most of the route to the Pacific was as new to her as it was
to Lewis and Clark.</TE>
<TE>   William Clark took a shine to the infant, whom he called "Pomp,"
and "My little dancing boy," apparently because of the infant's
animated nature. When the expedition returned to Ft. Mandan in 1806,
on the way home, it released the trio but Clark offered to educate
and raise Jean Baptiste.</TE>
<TE>   About 1810, Toussaint Charbonneau and Sacagawea left their son and
an infant daughter with Clark in St. Louis. The daughter may not have
survived childhood.</TE>
<TE>   Records show Clark paying tuition, room and board for Jean
Baptiste at Catholic and Protestant schools.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Wilhelm, the Duke of Wuerttemberg, visited the frontier in
1822 and hired Jean Baptiste as a guide and interpreter. He took him
back with him to Germany the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Historians say Jean Baptiste traveled around Europe and northern
Africa. His experiences there are largely speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Historian Stephen Ambrose tells of unverified accounts that he was
a favorite of European royalty and played duets with Beethoven at
court. But Ambrose quickly adds that the record is so flimsy it is
best left to a historical novelist to embellish, not a historian to
record.</TE>
<TE>   Others are even more skeptical. "There is no evidence that the
prince educated Charbonneau, saw him as an equal ... or treated him
as anything better than as an exotic specimen," retired history
professor Albert Furtwangler wrote in the Oregon Historical
Quarterly.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Baptiste fathered a child while in Europe, Furtwangler said.
A search of parish records by a German researcher, Maria Firla,
showed that the child died in infancy, said Furtwangler.</TE>
<TE>   Sacagawea's son stayed in Europe until 1829, and when he came home
he returned to his roots--the still-wild West.</TE>
<TE>   He guided the Mormon Battalion as it headed to California to put
down Mexican uprisings.</TE>
<TE>   Battalion leader Col. Phillip St. George Cook recalled him as
"humanity in confusion," and "near gentleman, near animal, but above
all capable, loyal and a most valued asset."</TE>
<TE>   But another acquaintance referred to him as "a treacherous man who
liked his firewater and used it often."</TE>
<TE>   "He at once insinuated himself into the good graces of listeners
and commanded their admiration and respect," diarist Rufus Sage noted
after meeting Charbonneau on the Platte River in 1842.</TE>
<TE>   He turned up as the magistrate of San Luis Rey in California in
1847 but was replaced by residents who objected to his favorable
treatment of Indians.</TE>
<TE>   He went to the gold fields in 1849 but found little. The year 1861
found him working as a hotel clerk in Auburn, Calif. In 1866, he and
friends headed for the Montana gold fields.</TE>
<TE>   As they crossed the icy Owyhee River in southeastern Oregon he
caught pneumonia. He died at Inskip's Ranch on May 16 and was buried
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Two contemporary obituaries made no mention of his trip across the
wilderness on his mother's back.</TE>
<TE>   The Owyhee Avalanche newspaper got much of it wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "We have received a note (don't know who from) dated May 16 '66
requesting publication of the following:</TE>
<TE>   "At Inskip's Ranche, Cow Creek, in Jordan Valley, J.B.
Charbonneau, aged 63, of pneumonia. Was born at St. Louis, one of the
oldest trappers and pioneers. He piloted the Mormon Brigade from
Lower Mexico in '46. Came to California in '49 and has resided since
that time mostly in Placer Co. Was en route to Montana."</TE>
<TE>   An obituary in the Placer County Herald said, in part:</TE>
<TE>   "Our information is very meager of the history of the deceased, a
fact we much regret as he was of a class that for years lived among
stirring and eventful scenes."</TE>

<LD>Some teachers at Mount Vernon Middle School in the Crenshaw District
of Los Angeles are fighting for their "right" to wear comfy T-shirts,
jeans and puffy cross-trainers to work. They don't want to bother
with collared shirts, ties, dresses, pantsuits, stockings or
leather-soled shoes. But what spells comfort to them sends a
different message to students: Anything goes.</LD>
<LD>   The teachers must give up their jeans by July as part of Los
Angeles schools Supt. Roy Romer's plan to encourage a more
professional culture at 10 failing schools singled out by state
auditors for their continued abysmal academic performance.</LD>
<LD>   The dress code isn't the only thing changing at Mount Vernon. A
new principal took charge this year. The school will switch from a
year-round calendar to a traditional two-semester schedule. Most
important, the school's teachers must commit to using teaching
methods that have boosted scores at a group of schools that were once
among the worst in the Los Angeles Unified School District.</LD>
<TE>   They also must agree in writing to be punctual, show up regularly,
work collegially with other teachers, maintain high expectations for
students and attend 20 days of mandatory training sessions, for which
they will be paid, and all required meetings. If these changes don't
raise test scores in 18 months, the state could take over the school.</TE>
<TE>   The shocking thing about these agreements is that they have to be
put in writing. If some teachers have to be told to show up on time
and cooperate, it hardly supports their union's demands that they be
treated as professionals and have ironclad job protections.</TE>
<TE>   John Perez, the strident president-elect of United Teachers-Los
Angeles, has likened the teacher commitment agreements to McCarthyist
loyalty oaths. That sort of scorched-earth categorization only
encourages teachers not to change, not to grow.</TE>
<TE>   The staff commitment forms originated with the Ten Schools
Program, which was set up about 15 years ago to raise achievement at
troubled schools in Watts and South-Central L.A. The program has
since been expanded to other schools south of the Santa Monica
Freeway. Teachers at participating schools say the dress code in the
commitment, which some Mount Vernon teachers so strongly protest, has
brought them greater student respect.</TE>
<TE>   Mount Vernon's students have a lot of catching up to do, which
will require major improvements. And yes, respectably dressed
teachers is one of them.</TE>

<LD>The test of homeland defense is its ability to detect and prevent
terrorist attacks from any quarter and in any form. Unfortunately,
the Bush administration is flunking. Though Thomas J. Ridge's Office
of Homeland Security has asked for $27billion and produced a blizzard
of disjointed initiatives, it lacks a strategy for safeguarding the
country from further attacks. The administration needs to focus on
protecting vital infrastructure such as roads, bridges, key buildings
and power plants.</LD>
<LD>   The foundation of homeland security is good intelligence. Until
the government can determine how its intelligence system failed to
prevent Sept. 11, it will have trouble figuring out how to prevent
large-scale terrorism in the future.</LD>
<LD>   Yet FBI Director Robert Mueller, in an April 19 speech to the
Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, offered an extended
rationalization of those failures. Mueller noted that the hijackers
left no paper trail, avoided big cash transactions and may have been
planning their attacks for up to five years. But it remains that two
of the hijackers entered the U.S. despite being on an FBI watch list
and that suspected "20th hijacker" Zacarias Moussaoui was detained
well before Sept. 11 when he acted suspiciously at a flight school.</LD>
<TE>   Congress' efforts to investigate were jolted by the resignation
last week of former CIA official L. Britt Snider, who was leading the
congressional inquiry into the failure of the spy agencies. Snider's
replacement must, unlike Snider, be willing to question the records
of all the intelligence agencies aggressively. The Bush
administration also should pressure the CIA and FBI to cooperate
fully with congressional investigators instead of hiding behind
national security to protect their turf.</TE>
<TE>   If better intelligence is the key to blocking terrorism, a major
new study by the Brookings Institution also points out that the Bush
administration needs to stop "fighting the last war." Terrorists are
not likely to commandeer an airplane again. What we should fear are
the new methods they might be planning.</TE>
<TE>   We obsess over weapons of mass destruction--nuclear, radiological,
chemical and biological--but conventional hazardous materials such as
dynamite need at least as much attention. To begin with, hazardous
materials should be transported in trucks that have anti-tampering
features. The Homeland Security Office should pay more attention to
the nation's electricity grid, water and food supplies and the Postal
Service. Start with more security personnel, better fencing and
monitoring devices. In addition, the nation's 500 or so skyscrapers
should be outfitted with better filter and sensor systems that would
detect and clean up contaminants released into air intake systems.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Brookings report recommends establishing a federal
border agency enfolding the Coast Guard, the Customs Service and the
new Transportation Security Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge needs far more clout to effectively carry out these
measures. President Bush should recognize that Ridge's office needs
Cabinet rank, and its chief should be subject to Senate confirmation.
Until then, domestic security will be as weak as Ridge himself.</TE>

<LD>Besides vampires and Hells Angels, rats may be the most public
relations-challenged species of all time. Think about it. What are
these pointy-nosed, pointy-tailed creatures good for? Chewing walls
and wires, gnawing attic treasures, housing fleas and spreading the
plague.</LD>
<LD>   So, how surprising to learn the other day that doctors in New York
(not the surprising part) have wired rats to obey human commands. No,
not to walk into rat traps. The doctors stuck three little wires into
rat brains. One tickles the rat's left whiskers (we're not making
this up). Another tickles the right whiskers. Lacking contact lenses
and flashlights, rats use whiskers for navigating tight places like
cats. The third wire stimulates the rat's pleasure center as a
reward.</LD>
<LD>   By combining these little shocks, a human with a computer keyboard
and radio can steer a rat wherever desired, which is nice, because
most rats were bored with the old maze routine.</LD>
<TE>   Send a rat patrol into a mine where lethal gas might lurk. Send
rescue rats into rubble to seek survivors. (Suggestion: Put a big Red
Cross on those guys.) Physically fit rats--and have you ever seen a
slob rat, despite their junk-food diet?--can carry little television
cameras, perhaps to infiltrate a hostage situation or a hostile
teenager's messy room. A rat battalion could be sent across
minefields once or twice.</TE>
<TE>   The professed application is medical, to design ways to help human
brains order disabled bodies to do what they can't at the moment. Of
less importance but some interest, rats have never received adequate
credit for testing cancer treatments, trying on makeup chemicals,
gulping cola drinks and smoking cigarettes. So this research may do
wonders for the image of rodents, beyond even Mickey's achievements.</TE>
<TE>   And think of the potentially useful applications for wiring the
brains of humans. Imagine what you could have the drivers ahead of
you do on Interstate 5 every Friday afternoon. How you could make a
long restaurant line vanish. A grumpy child do chores. Or even a
family cat snuggle. Never mind ethics; we could wire the worrywarts'
brains too.</TE>
<TE>   The opportunities in wired brains are endless. Theoretically, we
could wire vampires to go after Hells Angels. Or motorcycle gang
members to collect Barbie dolls. Already-wired brains explain
Starbucks' success and maybe those 25 women chasing the Bachelor on
TV recently.</TE>
<TE>   Wired brains could prevent voter indecision. By wiring brains,
Nielsen wouldn't have to study TV viewership--just have everyone
watch whatever show paid Nielsen the most. Same for movies, for
buying cereal and cars, clothing and books. Or, wait a minute,
newspapers. Maybe every wired brain would want several copies
delivered each morning.</TE>
<TE>   So, you see, this business of wiring brains and turning rats and
humans into robots is a really great idea great idea great idea.</TE>

<HD>Mired in Bad Debt, Asia Faces Further Struggle</HD>
<DH>Economy: The region may eventually pay with taxpayer
bailouts, lost jobs and more strain on wobbly democracies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL and MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MANILA</DL>
<LD>Ron Fullerton and his wife, Lita, found out from the morning radio
news that Manila-based Urban Bank had collapsed, taking with it their
dreams and about $140,000 in savings.</LD>
<LD>   But the loss reverberated far beyond their family. The savings
account funded their life's work: an orphanage called the Chosen
Village Foundation that housed more than 70 disabled children in the
mountains south of the capital. For months they barely got by and
were forced to sharply limit the number of additional children they
could help.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a shock," Ron Fullerton said. "That money was the
children's future."</LD>
<TE>   Two years later, the Fullertons have recovered only a fraction of
their loss from the bank's failure. Investigators blame the
bankruptcy on slipshod accounting and corrupt lending practices that
favor bankers' cronies, practices that have helped create mountains
of unfunded and unredeemable debt.</TE>
<TE>   Across Asia, from the tip of Northern Japan to the southernmost
island of Indonesia, bad debt is far more than the corpses of defunct
financial institutions or the huge numbers on the balance sheets of
those banks struggling to keep above the rising flood. It's a scourge
that diminishes the lives of millions of ordinary people even as it
threatens to stoke political instability and halt the region's three
decades of economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Bad bank debt lacks the headline-grabbing qualities of an
earthquake or an airline crash. But once out of hand, as it clearly
is in Asia, its destructive power is far greater. Today it's
destroying jobs in Indonesia, breaking apart families in Thailand,
spurring suicides in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Add up the pieces and Asia has a $2-trillion bad-debt problem.
That's equivalent to the combined annual economic output of
California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and
Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   "Asia's biggest danger is in its nonperforming loans," said Jose
de Venecia, speaker of the Philippines House of Representatives and a
former presidential candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Bad debt, essentially money that lending institutions have lost
all or part of due to borrowers' inability to repay, leaves some
banks so weak they fail, while others that survive often have no
money to finance new growth.</TE>
<TE>   On the face of it, the problems are strikingly similar from
country to country. Loans with no hope of being repaid are
overwhelming borrowers who feel as though they'll never get ahead.
Lending practices are irresponsible at best and criminal at worst.
Governments deny the scope of the problem in the vain hope an
economic miracle around the corner will make it all go away.</TE>
<TE>   However, economic, cultural and political differences, the
public's appetite for pain and the mettle of individual leaders will
greatly affect the approach each country takes and the number of
years or decades it will need to craft a solution.</TE>
<TE>   As governments continue to look for a painless way out, most
economists insist there will be no free lunch. Eventually, someone
will have to pay in the form of expensive taxpayer bailouts,
restructurings that ultimately will cause thousands of bankruptcies,
millions of lost jobs and more strain on wobbly democracies.</TE>
<TE>   And as is so often the case, a disproportionate share of the pain
is expected to fall on the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Asian Development Bank economist Jean-Pierre A. Verbiest estimates
the loan problem will shave as much as 2 percentage points off annual
output--in a region that has long depended on prosperity to paper
over internal and external tensions. This in turn will leave the
global economy further dependent on the United States, which has been
the only consistent engine over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Far and away the largest splotch on the regional radar screen is
Japan, which accounts for an estimated $1.3 trillion in bad debt, or
about two-thirds of Asia's total.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is that a nation that led millions of Asians out of
poverty by pioneering export-led "miracle" economic growth is now a
leader in reverse.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan is a horrible model," said Bill Belchere, Singapore-based
regional economist with Merrill Lynch. "Unfortunately, what Japan's
demonstrated for the region is that you can put off dealing with
banking-sector problems indefinitely to protect the status quo.
Others can look at Japan and say, 'Why should we do anything?'"</TE>
<TE>   Economists say Japan promises to be among the last economies in
the region to overcome its debt morass, with pessimists arguing that
the world's second-largest economy could see another decade lost to
recession.</TE>
<TE>   Even under conservative government estimates, bad debt in Japan
amounts to 8% of gross domestic output compared with the 3% for the
U.S. at the depths of its savings and loan crisis. And official
statistics have been notoriously suspect, as with most Asian nations.</TE>
<TE>   Japan has studied the U.S. and Swedish bank recovery models in
excruciating detail, knows all the latest theories and what it
arguably must do. "Every time I talk to Japanese, they know more
about our S&amp;L crisis than we do," said U.S. Ambassador Howard H.
Baker Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Finding the political will to do it, however, is another story.
Although no nation likes to throw people out of work, shutter
inefficient factories and alter cherished beliefs, Japan's
long-standing emphasis on social cohesion, its enormous wealth
cushion and its general distrust of bold policy have left it with a
sumo-wrestler-size problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan's tendency to postpone is at the root of this current
mess," said Michiyasu Hirao, director of global studies with Mitsui
Research Institute. "Losses end up just getting bigger and bigger and
bigger."</TE>
<TE>   Japan, China and South Korea also differ from the rest of Asia in
the type of institutions they're trying to protect, namely large,
inefficient conglomerates with cozy ties to bureaucrats and
politicians.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   China's Leadership May Recognize Problem</TE>
<TE>   China, second-worst-off in the region with bad debts officially
pegged at about $400 billion and other estimates placing it much
higher, has certain advantages and disadvantages in its bad-debt
battle relative to its neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Although most other economies watched their bad debts balloon over
the last half a decade because of systemic flaws in their
interpretations of capitalism, Communist China never made much
pretense of allocating labor or capital for other than political
purposes. The transition to a more market-driven economy, however,
now leaves banks struggling to pursue the contradictory goals of
central planning and rampant capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   Though China's economic progress is impressive, far exceeding
expectations, China's banking problems in close concert with
dinosaur-like state-owned companies are equally impressive. Recent
worker revolts as wages have gone unpaid are a hint of the problems
Beijing is juggling, partly because of the need to cope with debt.</TE>
<TE>   Working in China's favor is a top leadership that appears to
recognize the problem and one that doesn't face elections, which
gives it the luxury of taking tough actions that are politically
unpopular. There are signs, for instance, that new bank loans are
going to high-growth industries, unlike the case of Japan where
they're all too often used to prop up obsolete industries.</TE>
<TE>   Bank oversight and senior personnel decisions also have been
shifted from provincial to central government control to cut down on
meddling.</TE>
<TE>   "The leadership isn't in denial as the Japanese are," said Fred
Hu, a Hong Kong-based executive director at Goldman Sachs. "They
recognize this as a big problem."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, China's recent entry in the World Trade Organization
should sharply expand foreign competition, thereby aiding leaders in
their drive for internal change.</TE>
<TE>   Still, China's outlook is hampered by a fundamental problem faced
by generations of Chinese leaders: Policy emanating from Beijing
often is ignored by corrupt, lazy or defiant local officials.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Korea Moved Quickly at Brink of Bankruptcy</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts give South Korea the best marks in the region,
helped by a relatively strong political will and a national consensus
for reform. President Kim Dae Jung pushed hard early in his
administration as billions in bad loans were sold off at a fraction
of their face value, bank managers were replaced and giant chaebol
conglomerates allowed to fail. A slimmed-down banking industry now
employs 97,000 people, down from 144,000 four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea also had less choice than the others after a
near-death experience in 1997 when the country found itself just days
from bankruptcy and was forced to take the bitter medicine handed
down by the International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Koreans cite another key factor: a culture that favors moving
quickly and decisively during difficult periods, rather than
following the more cautious approach seen in neighboring Japan and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Korea survived 5,000 years sandwiched between the oceanic power
of Japan and the land power of China," said Kim Cheon Hong, executive
director of Korea Asset Management Corp., charged with selling off
the bulk of South Korea's distressed assets. "If it's time to change,
in the law of the jungle you change."</TE>
<TE>   Although Korea did a lot of backsliding once the immediate crisis
was over, analysts say, it has the best chance of growing its way out
of trouble during the next economic upturn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philippines Could Avoid Problems of Indonesia</TE>
<TE>   Farther south, the Philippines is a country at the crossroads,
analysts say. It could see steady improvement with the right policies
or deteriorate further like giant Indonesia to the south.</TE>
<TE>   The Philippines never enjoyed as vibrant an economic fest as many
of its neighbors in Southeast Asia did during the late 1980s and
early 1990s. And its banking problems are more closely associated
with outright crooks and cronies than some of its neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The percentage of bad loans has crept up during the last year to
more than 18%, but calls recently have grown louder for creation of
the nation's first privately funded asset management companies
charged with buying distressed bank debt and injecting new capital
into the system.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to jump-start the economy," said Leonilo Coronel,
executive director of the Bankers Assn. of the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing up the rear and the furthest from a solution in most
analysts' minds is Indonesia. Other countries struggle to find a
political mandate for tough restructuring moves, but Indonesia has
its sights set on a far more basic goal: crafting a working political
system.</TE>
<TE>   Collecting bank debts in Indonesia from borrowers perfectly able
to repay often is next to impossible because of the political climate
and the weak legal system. Some of the biggest debtors are sitting in
parliament.</TE>
<TE>   One Jakarta-based foreign banker who asked not to be identified
recalls the simple, one-word answer he received after advising a
client to pay off a bad loan: "Why?"</TE>
<TE>   The role of bad debts in dragging down economic growth has
particular resonance in Indonesia, said Raden Pardede, chief
researcher at Jakarta's Danareksa Research Institute. The economy
needs to grow at twice its current 3.5%-to-4% rate just to absorb the
estimated 2.7 million job seekers entering the market annually.</TE>
<TE>   "If conditions don't improve, I think there will be a social
explosion within five years," Pardede said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'The Ordinary Taxpayer Pays the Price'</TE>
<TE>   Banks and bankers rarely are loved in any country, particularly
when tales of abuses hit the headlines. Asia's respect for tradition
and hierarchy makes it culturally difficult to force out elites
running the banks, government agencies and companies no matter how
great the malfeasance.</TE>
<TE>   Well-run banking systems and efficient capital markets are the
lifeblood of any modern economy. And cleaning up after well-heeled
financiers may be a necessary price for the additional jobs, new
opportunities and reduced angst that follow, economists say.</TE>
<TE>   "Ultimately, it's always the same story in every country," said
Jack Rodman, Tokyo-based partner with Ernst &amp; Young Consulting. "It's
the ordinary taxpayer who pays the price."</TE>
<TE>   As Western developed nations pressure Asian nations to improve
their oversight, bolster their accounting systems, protect small
shareholders over powerful financiers and end cozy deals among
politicians, bankers and corporate titans, one word comes up
repeatedly: Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The energy giant collapsed in a matter of weeks after accounting
problems were publicly disclosed, says Merrill Lynch's Belchere. Its
top executives were paraded before Congress and a roaring debate got
underway on overhauling the accounting system and reforming political
fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   "As respected a company as Enron was, it was shut down," Belchere
said. "Enron has probably happened 1,000 times out here in Asia and
no one's ever done anything about it."</TE>
<TE>   Back in Manila, meanwhile, the Fullertons are trying to put their
life together even as the sordid details of the Urban Bank failure
seep out.</TE>
<TE>   A World Bank report found that rampant insider lending, few
controls and little transparency led to the institution's downfall,
which affected about 5,000 depositors and creditors with the
equivalent of more than $250 million tied up in the bank when it went
under in April 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Fullerton's sense of disbelief at the crumbling house of cards
was even greater because he had been friends with several of the
bank's executives through a local Rotary Club, including one who
acted as a trustee to the orphanage.</TE>
<TE>   For the first several months after the collapse, the Fullertons
and the orphans lived on petty cash and donations. The orphanage also
was forced to stop taking in additional children.</TE>
<TE>   But a front-page article in a Manila newspaper on their plight
generated gifts of food, clothing and money, which helped keep the
orphanage going through the summer months when donations
traditionally dry up.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a year, they lived hand-to-mouth. Then, last summer,
the government approved a bank restructuring plan that allowed
depositors and creditors to withdraw as much as $10,000 of their lost
money, with promises of more later. That has allowed the Fullertons
to start accepting children again.</TE>
<TE>   "Theoretically, we may get everything back," Ron Fullerton said.
"But of course, that depends on whether the new bank survives."</TE>

<HD>Conglomerates Still Cast a Giant Shadow</HD>
<DH>The multifaceted, multinational business model continues to
confound critics and attract investors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The troubles at General Electric Co., Tyco International Ltd.,
Vivendi Universal and other diversified companies, coupled with Wall
Street's new distrust of corporations with intricate accounting, have
prompted talk that the conglomerate is passe.</LD>
<LD>   Not only are GE and the others suffering lackluster growth and
sinking stock prices, they're also being criticized for being what
they are: complicated. In the aftermath of Enron Corp. and Arthur
Andersen, investors are demanding simplicity and raising eyebrows at
multifaceted, multinational behemoths.</LD>
<LD>   They want businesses that are easy to understand and that carry
transparent balance sheets devoid of financial chicanery. To their
critics, GE, Tyco and Vivendi--with their unrelated operations--prove
that the conglomerate no longer works, or at least doesn't provide
enough value to warrant its complexity.</LD>
<TE>   Sound familiar? It should. Over the last three decades, the
conglomerate has been chastised, ridiculed and declared dead. Many
conglomerates have been broken apart or merged into other companies
because their formulas for success stopped working and they suffered
a crisis of confidence among investors. Huge companies such as ITT
Corp. and Teledyne Inc., which once were stellar players on Wall
Street and employed tens of thousands of workers, no longer exist.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the conglomerate endures, and in good part because GE and some
others keep proving that it usually works under good management. GE
excelled at making its disparate pieces work together to deliver
years of steady gains in sales and profit.</TE>
<TE>   But without the help of the strong economy of the late 1990s, the
company was forced to warn investors last month that it had stopped
growing. First-quarter revenue fell at its aircraft-engines,
plastics, lighting and GE Capital units. Its power-systems group
enjoyed strong growth in the quarter, but GE and analysts agree that
its sales are peaking, and there's concern as to how quickly GE's
other divisions can offset the power group's slowdown by bouncing
back themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how soon GE and the others recover, or whether they
will require radical changes to adapt to the skeptical mood among
investors, "the conglomerate will survive," said William Fiala, an
analyst with brokerage firm Edward Jones &amp; Co. who follows GE, Tyco
and others. "The concept of a conglomerate is still very valid."</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because many executives believe in the business model and
potential profit that conglomerates provide: namely that a hodgepodge
of businesses smooth out economic cycles, eliminating the risk that a
single-purpose company will get whipsawed if demand for its one
product or service suddenly shifts.</TE>
<TE>   GE, for example, knows that at various points in the economy's
cycle its aircraft engines and turbine-power systems will flourish,
picking up any slack in its appliances and medical systems' groups.
When the economy shifts, the reverse happens.</TE>
<TE>   Another "critical piece of the equation" depends on having pieces
that work with each other even if they're in different industries,
said David Morrison, vice chairman of Mercer Management Consulting
Inc. For instance, GE Capital helps customers finance equipment they
buy from GE's other divisions, which in turn helps those divisions
lock in sales, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor that keeps some conglomerates in investors' favor
is the company's chief executive, said James O'Toole, a USC business
professor who has written extensively about conglomerates.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the lessons learned about conglomerates ... is that a lot
of their success is dependent on their leader," O'Toole said. "Look
at Berkshire Hathaway," he said, referring to the holding company of
famed investor Warren Buffett. "They [investors] have confidence in
the guy running that company."</TE>
<TE>   And for all of Wall Street's snarling about conglomerates these
days, many investors can't resist the notion that conglomerates'
diversity reduces risk; it's the same reason investors buy mutual
funds. So they keep acquiring stocks of conglomerates that they
believe are soundly managed.</TE>
<TE>   The shares of several other conglomerates are advancing nicely
this year. Berkshire Hathaway, Fortune Brands Inc., Sara Lee Corp.
and SPX Corp. have outperformed the 14% drop of the benchmark
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index over the last 12 months.</TE>
<TE>   For outfits such as Tyco and Vivendi, the issue seems to be not
that the companies are conglomerates but that they no longer are able
to fulfill the conglomerate's promise. It boils down to execution,
and whether management can make the model work.</TE>
<TE>   Many have failed that test over the years, even if they envisioned
perfect synergy in which each division would send business and added
profits to the others. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. tried to peddle brokerage
services and insurance through its stores in the 1980s, and
ultimately gave up. That same decade, United Airlines--now a unit of
UAL Corp.--bought hotels and rental cars to create travel
conglomerate Allegis Corp., and it flopped as well.</TE>
<TE>   Others went through wrenching restructurings to survive. One of
the best-known conglomerate executives, Harold Geneen, used hundreds
of acquisitions in the 1960s and '70s to build ITT into a powerhouse
that did everything from selling international telephone service to
baking Wonder bread.</TE>
<TE>   With each acquisition ITT's stock price would rise, giving Geneen
a more valuable currency to buy more properties. The cycle repeated
itself. But when Geneen retired in 1979 and was succeeded by Rand
Araskog, ITT became a different firm in investors' eyes. Suddenly
they saw a patchwork company burdened with debt from Geneen's reign,
and Araskog went on a massive divestiture program--shedding more than
250 operations--to maintain the company's value on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   ITT eventually broke into three companies in 1995, and that's just
what Tyco's aggressive chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, planned
to do with his company earlier this year. The idea: The combined
stock prices of Tyco's parts--which include electronics, medical
products, security systems and financial services--would be worth
more than the stock of Tyco as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   But Tyco's plan backfired. Its stock has slumped since the breakup
was announced, and last month Kozlowski said the idea was a "mistake"
and Tyco would stay mostly intact. That didn't appease investors, and
the stock continued to drop. However, "Tyco's issues go much deeper
than the fact that they're a conglomerate," said Fiala, pointing to
investors' skittishness about Tyco's flip-flop strategy, heavy debt
and lingering worries about its accounting methods.</TE>
<TE>   The same applies to Vivendi. Its chief executive, Jean-Marie
Messier, took his French water and sewage-treatment company on a
$50-billion takeover binge, gobbling up Universal Studios and
Europe's largest pay-television operator along the way. But now
Vivendi is being criticized as a multi-headed monster with big
losses, a huge debt load, unclear strategy and plunging stock price.</TE>
<TE>   "Vivendi is too complicated, too diversified and too much of a
conglomerate," said Marco Blasi, a money manager at HSBC Republic in
Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, GE remains the bellwether for a conglomerate that
works, though perhaps not as well as it once did. Under former CEO
John F. "Jack" Welch Jr., the Fairfield, Conn.-based giant delivered
remarkably steady growth during the 1980s and '90s by massively
buying and selling assets and demanding that its divisions be No. 1
or 2 in their industries.</TE>
<TE>   GE also exploited new technology and fervent cost-cutting to make
itself more efficient, and built up GE Capital to the point where the
subsidiary--itself a financial services conglomerate--now accounts
for more than 40% of GE's revenue and profit.</TE>
<TE>   "Welch did a wonderful job of creating a management discipline and
culture that was shared across all of its business units," said
Morrison of Mercer Management.</TE>
<TE>   But even GE ran headlong into the investor skepticism that was
spawned by the collapse of Enron and Andersen this year. Questions
arose about GE's uncanny ability to keep reporting double-digit
earnings growth, and whether GE relied too much on acquisitions to
fuel that growth.</TE>
<TE>   Then GE dropped its own bomb last month, saying overall revenue
isn't growing because of the sluggish economy. And although GE vows
that both revenue and profit will pick up as the economy rebounds
during the rest of 2002, many investors and Wall Street analysts
aren't so sure. GE's stock has tumbled as a result, although the
company's total stock market value of $308 billion still is the
highest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   That's putting pressure on Jeffrey Immelt, who succeeded Welch as
CEO eight months ago. Immelt said, "I hate where our stock is," and
he acknowledged at GE's annual meeting last month that "we live in a
new age. Performance is not enough."</TE>
<TE>   But even in this new age, few are suggesting that the GE
conglomerate is broken. "GE continues to execute very well in a
difficult economy," and the drop in its stock was "unwarranted,"
analyst Jeffrey Sprague of Salomon Smith Barney said in a recent
report.</TE>
<TE>   GE remains a top player in most of its markets but faces stiff
competition. In aircraft engines, for instance, it's still the
world's top seller over Rolls-Royce and United Technologies Corp.'
Pratt &amp; Whitney unit, but in locomotives it's in a tight race for
highest market share with GE's Electro-Motive division.</TE>
<TE>   In power systems, GE claims to be No. 1 but it's constantly
battling the likes of Siemens' Westinghouse unit for new sales. And
in major household appliances, GE is trailing in worldwide market
share behind Whirlpool Corp. and Maytag Corp., according to research
firm Freedonia Group Inc. Its NBC unit, meanwhile, leads in the
prime-time ratings that advertisers care most about, and is the most
profitable network.</TE>
<TE>   GE rakes in an overall profit of $37.5 million every day, and not
just because it's a huge company. Last year it earned a respectable
11 cents per dollar of revenue--during a recession--and GE now earns
50% more than it did three years ago. (GE's profit last year was
$13.7 billion on revenue of $126 billion.)</TE>
<TE>   But to keep GE on a growth track, Immelt could be forced to
shuffle its assets. There's speculation that GE might shed its
appliances group, which earned only 6 cents per dollar of sales in
this year's first quarter, compared with double-digit profit margins
at most of GE's other lines.</TE>
<TE>   NBC also is rumored to be a potential divestiture. Though still on
top, the network is being pinched by the downturn in advertising
revenue as its expenses are rising to keep hit shows such as
"Friends" and "Frasier" on the air.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, GE always has been about shedding languishing assets
and acquiring new businesses with stronger growth prospects. History
shows that the turmoil facing GE is nothing new. Welch had to deal
with a string of setbacks during his 20-year tenure.</TE>
<TE>   GE's sales fell in 1992 when the economy tanked. And again in
1993. The company twice pleaded guilty to felonies concerning defense
matters in the 1980s. And brokerage firm Kidder Peabody became a
debacle for Welch; he finally unloaded it in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's Immelt's turn, and he'll have to overcome this set of
obstacles and once again prove GE to Wall Street and the rest of the
world, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Immelt and his team "need a certain amount of time to get their
bearings, and for the outside world to feel comfortable" with GE's
progress, said Roger Kenny, co-founder of Boardroom Consultants in
New York. "I remember some really rocky times with GE's stock in the
past under Jack [Welch]. So you have to take the long-term view."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I am writing in response to "Hospitals Seek Cures for Nurses
Shortage," April 21. The answer is simple. Pay us what we are worth.</LD>
<LD>   I have been a nurse for 20 years. I have seen many changes over
the years, and most are not for the better. Even with the years of
experience that I have, I make less money than an entry-level
computer programmer.</LD>
<LD>   I have been spit on, bled on, vomited and urinated on. I have been
called every name in the book by my "beloved patients."</LD>
<TE>   My husband is a newer nurse, with only three years of experience.
He entered this field so we could travel. We are currently working in
sunny California. His hourly wage in California is one-third his rate
in Massachusetts. It is also the rate that he was making 10 years ago
when he worked as an auto mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   So tell me, where is the incentive? We are taking care of people,
not cars.</TE>

<HD>Don't Waste Any More Time and Energy on Enron Shares</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I understand that I can write off up to $3,000 of stock
losses against my ordinary income. However, I also have heard that a
person can take an even bigger deduction if he is the victim of theft
or fraud. Does this deduction apply to the losses I have had from
Enron?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Now that's creative thinking. And you can imagine how much
the IRS hates creative thinking.</LD>
<LD>   Your best bet is to forget what's known as the casualty and loss
deduction, and write off your Enron shares the conventional way.
Because Enron is still, inexplicably, being traded in the
over-the-counter market, you can sell the shares you have and follow
the usual rules for a stock-loss deduction. These rules require you
to offset your losses with any gains before using up to $3,000 of the
remaining loss as a deduction against your ordinary income. Any
remaining losses can be used in future years, although again you're
limited to $3,000 a year.</LD>
<TE>   You also could wait until the Enron bankruptcy case is finished
and take a worthless stock deduction, but there's no real advantage
to waiting. You might as well get rid of your shares and start
writing off your losses now.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Entrust Retirement to Financial Planner</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am in my early 60s and any thoughts of early retirement
crashed with the market. I think it's time to finally get serious
about getting some help managing my modest (and growing more modest
every day) assets. I'm not sure how to select a financial planner, or
even find one who wants to deal with me. I only have about $500,000
in a 403(b) retirement account, IRAs and stocks, and not a lot of
planners want to even bother with that small amount. I could use some
of your common sense advice, please.</TE>
<TE>   A: It's sad that $500,000 is considered small potatoes in the
financial planning world, but you're right that many financial
planners have higher minimums.</TE>
<TE>   Don't give up, though. You can find someone to help you.</TE>
<TE>   You can find a lot of information about how to choose a financial
planner at www.latimes.com/money. Professional groups such as the
Financial Planning Assn. at (800) 282-PLAN and the National Assn. of
Personal Financial Advisors at (888) FEE-ONLY can provide you with
information and checklists, as well as referrals.</TE>
<TE>   You'll want someone who has, at a minimum, one of the accepted
credentials for financial planning, such as the Certified Financial
Planner mark (CFP), the Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC)
designation or the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountant's Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   You'll need to do your research, interview several candidates and
ensure that you've found someone with whom you're comfortable
revealing the financial details of your life. You'll want to be
confident that the person is working in your best interest and is
upfront about how he or she is compensated (commissions, fees or
both).</TE>
<TE>   Once you've found someone you like, you'll need to do even more
due diligence. Check the planner's disciplinary history with state
and federal authorities, and with the group that offers the
designation the planner claims.</TE>
<TE>   This all takes work on your part, but your retirement is at stake.
It's worth it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hard Work, Honesty Pay Off in the End</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am a retired police officer, age 54, who is fortunate enough
not to have to work again thanks to a great pension, some very lucky
real estate transactions in the past and old-fashioned penny
pinching.</TE>
<TE>   I'm a regular reader of your column, and I particularly like the
way you "straighten out" some of these knuckle-heads who write you
with some ludicrous schemes for avoiding taxes or bailing out on
debts.</TE>
<TE>   There are many of us out here who pay taxes, save money and pay
our debts and who see you as a breath of fresh air when it seems we
are surrounded by crazy ideas and crazier people. Keep it up!</TE>
<TE>   A: Thanks for the kind words.</TE>
<TE>   It's human nature to look for the short cut and to be tempted by
the get-rich-quick scheme.</TE>
<TE>   It's much harder work to avoid debt, pay taxes and get rich
slowly. But that, as you've found, is the path that ultimately pays
off in the end.</TE>

<HD>Dogs Not Homeowner Insurers' Best Friends</HD>

<LD>A steep rise in dog-bite incidents--including the notorious San
Francisco case in which a lacrosse coach was killed by her neighbor's
dogs--has spurred homeowner insurers to reconsider how they cover
canines.</LD>
<LD>   Mercury Casualty Co., citing higher claims costs for households
with dogs, recently began offering a 10% discount on homeowners
insurance for families that don't own a dog or are willing to take
their dog off their homeowner policy.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based Mercury is the latest insurer to change the way
it writes liability coverage for dog owners. Over the last several
years, many insurers have implemented rules aimed at limiting their
exposure to dog-bite claims.</LD>
<TE>   That's mainly because dog bites have become a $310-million annual
claim problem, accounting for about one-third of liability losses on
homeowners insurance, said Loretta Waters, a spokeswoman for the
Insurance Information Institute in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last three or four years, we have had an increase in dog
bites across the country," said Nanci Kramer, a spokeswoman for the
California Department of Insurance. "All too often, it's the same
breeds too. And we're not looking at little bites. These are
maulings."</TE>
<TE>   Those attacks often lead to lawsuits against the dog owner--and to
a liability claim against the owner's insurance company.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies are certainly reevaluating the dog liability issues
this last year," said Candy Miller, a spokeswoman for the Insurance
Information Network in California. "But the way different companies
handle it is all over the board."</TE>
<TE>   Some insurers focus on dog breeds when deciding on coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the dog attack statistics, you see that certain
breeds present a very significantly increased risk of death or injury
to people and other animals," said John Millen, vice president of
communications at Nationwide Mutual Insurance in Columbus, Ohio,
which won't cover homeowners who own certain breeds of dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide will not insure households that have Rottweilers,
Doberman pinschers, pit bulls, Presa Canarios, chows or breeds that
are part wolf, he said. It was two Presa Canarios that killed San
Francisco lacrosse coach Diane Whipple.</TE>
<TE>   "Those folks are just ineligible for coverage with us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other insurers don't take a hard line by specific breeds, but do
take a look at individual dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of our underwriting involves asking whether there are dogs
in the house and if there's been a history of bites," said Bill
Sirola, a spokesman for State Farm Insurance. "If there has been a
bite history, we would ask that the offending dog be removed from the
premises, or we would not be able to offer coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Farmers Insurance Group also imposes dog-by-dog restrictions and
has a no-tolerance policy for bites.</TE>
<TE>   "If they have a vicious animal, we would either exclude the pet
from the policy or we would not write the policy at all," said Mary
Flynn, a Farmers spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Prospective policyholders are asked to report whether they have a
"vicious animal" on the premises, which leaves some discretion to the
homeowner. But once there's a claim, the pet gets bounced from the
policy--specifically excluded from coverage, just like expensive furs
and office equipment--even if it's restrained, muzzled or caged,
Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   The company also won't take new business from people who have had
dog-bite claims in the last three years--even if the family no longer
owns the pet.</TE>
<TE>   Other insurers frequently charge higher premiums, suggest the
homeowner get rid of the pet or exclude the dog from coverage once a
dog has shown a propensity to bite, Waters added.</TE>
<TE>   Some will cover a pet if the homeowner takes the dog to classes
aimed at modifying its behavior, or if the dog is restrained with a
muzzle, chain or cage, said Waters.</TE>
<TE>   Other insurers are less focused on troublesome canines, but those
companies are becoming increasingly rare.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more companies are looking to breed now," said Waters.
"The statistics indicate that certain breeds are having more and more
problems."</TE>
<TE>   But the message to homeowners is clear: Pay attention to the pet
or be ready to pay.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people seem to have a view that they should use dogs for
security purposes, when that's more of a detriment to them than
anything else," Waters said. "A good alarm system would serve you
much better than the potential liability of an aggressive dog."</TE>
<TE>   Just as consumers are well-advised to look at crash statistics
when buying a car, insurers advise that they look at bite statistics
before buying a dog.</TE>
<TE>   "We recommend--and some veterinarians do too--that you try to find
out about the history of the dog and the breed before you adopt,"
said Nationwide's Millen. "A family pet affects so many areas of your
life. That history can give you an idea of what to expect before it
becomes a problem."</TE>

<HD>West Coast Ports Brace for a Storm of Labor Negotiations</HD>
<DH>Unions: Anticipating disruptions, some nervous importers
are accelerating shipments or trying to line up alternate routes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND and LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>West Coast dockworkers and shipping lines are gearing up for a nasty
contract fight that could disrupt international trade and drain
millions of dollars from the U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   The talks pit one of the nation's strongest labor organizations,
the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, against the Pacific
Maritime Assn., a powerful group of shipping carriers and cargo
distributors that appears determined to extract concessions from the
union.</LD>
<LD>   Backed by a $200-million line of credit, the group of 100
businesses has threatened a lockout if the union stages a work
slowdown, as shippers claim happened in each of the last two contract
negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   A shutdown of the major West Coast ports--Los Angeles and Long
Beach; Oakland; Portland, Ore.; and Seattle and Tacoma, Wash.--could
be devastating, economists say. The ports support nearly 4 million
jobs in the U.S., generating $723 billion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations are set to begin May 13 in San Francisco, home to
both organizations. The current three-year contract, which covers
10,500 union members, expires June 30.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting pretty tense. A strike, or lockout, is definitely on
people's radar screens right now," said Jack Kyser, chief economist
for the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn. says the union must accept new
equipment and work rules that will make the ports more efficient.
"The only thing we are interested in is introducing technology with
[the union's] support," said Joe Miniace, the association's
president.</TE>
<TE>   The PMA seeks to implement several money-saving changes, including
new communications systems that could minimize gate check-in times
for truckers; electronic cargo-tracking systems; and automated union
dispatch halls.</TE>
<TE>   It also wants to implement new security measures at the ports,
including identification systems that the union fears could lead to
invasions of worker privacy.</TE>
<TE>   With trade between the U.S. and Asia expected to double within 10
years, productivity at the ports is a pressing concern.
Inefficiencies cost the maritime industry as much as $1 billion
annually, said Michael Nacht of the Goldman School of Public Policy
at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the introduction of available technological advances,
congestion, environmental degradation and supply-chain disruptions
will result in increased costs and diversion of cargo away from U.S.
ports," Nacht said in a report.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said they are open to new technology and work
rules, as long as members perform the work, the changes do not make
jobs more onerous and members share in the wealth created by
productivity gains. "What we're saying is let's negotiate how it's
done according to those three principles," said ILWU spokesman Steve
Stallone.</TE>
<TE>   The ILWU says the shippers want to severely weaken the union,
which boasts some of the best wages and benefits in U.S. organized
labor. Average wages last year, including premiums and overtime, were
$80,000 for longshore workers and $158,000 for foremen, according to
the PMA.</TE>
<TE>   In the event of a strike or lockout, the Bush administration could
declare the action a "peril to national health or safety" and order
workers back to the docks for an 80-day cooling-off period. However,
it could not force a settlement in the contract dispute.</TE>
<TE>   There has been only one strike in the union's 68-year history, and
that was an unsanctioned walkout in 1971 sparked by stalled contract
negotiations. Otherwise, the ILWU has been known as a relatively
cooperative labor organization, working with management as the ports
modernized and shifted to the use of containers.</TE>
<TE>   But since the mid-1990s, when the PMA's new leadership began
pushing for greater flexibility in technology and work rules,
management-labor relations have grown increasingly tense. The last
several years have been marked by unsuccessful lawsuits against the
union and complaints against the PMA filed by the union with the
National Labor Relations Board.</TE>
<TE>   In a message to members in February, ILWU President James Spinosa
indicated he was preparing for the worst in the upcoming round of
talks. He said he has received pledges of solidarity from other
unions, including international maritime unions. He also urged
members to stay united and "get your individual financial house in
order."</TE>
<TE>   The ILWU recently signed an alliance with the International
Longshoremen's Assn., representing dockworkers on the East Coast, and
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents many
truckers who carry containers from the port.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working very closely together," said Ron Carver, national
campaign coordinator for the Teamsters' port division. "We're
committed to assisting and aiding them in any way we can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Importers May Seek Alternate Routes</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating disruptions, some nervous importers are accelerating
shipments to arrive before early July, the start of the Christmas
shipping season. "I'm watching the contract talks very carefully, and
I see things getting a little bit nasty," said Charlie Woo, president
of Megatoys, a Los Angeles-based toy importer. "So I'm making sure we
don't have products arriving during the first few weeks of July."</TE>
<TE>   Others are scrambling to line up alternate shipping routes that
would bypass West Coast ports, including the 15,000-acre Los
Angeles-Long Beach harbor complex--the nation's busiest.</TE>
<TE>   But there are few options: The Panama Canal cannot accommodate
many of the massive container ships calling on mega-ports such as Los
Angeles-Long Beach, nor can ports in Mexico. And although covered by
a different contract, dockworkers in Vancouver, Canada, also are ILWU
members and probably would be sympathetic to any job action.</TE>
<TE>   Such limitations have long worked in the ILWU's favor, giving it a
strength far beyond its size. With only 60,000 members, including
those in industries as far afield as health care and retail sales,
the union wields considerable political and economic clout.</TE>
<TE>   When the previous contract expired three years ago, work slowdowns
spread along the West Coast and reduced the flow of cargo by at least
half, according to the PMA. A contract was settled two weeks later,
but the association failed to gain many of the concessions it sought.</TE>
<TE>   "Work stoppages in a just-in-time-delivery environment can be
devastating," said Jon Gold, director of international trade policy
for the International Mass Retail Assn. But he added, "Our folks are
supporting PMA. They intend to stand firm this time around."</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials say they have no choice. "We are telling PMA to
stand tough," said Robin Lanier, executive director of the West Coast
Waterfront Coalition, which represents major importers and exporters.
"In the past we said, 'Avoid a strike at any cost.' This time, we're
saying 'We don't want a strike but we don't want to avoid one at any
cost.'"</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the long-term costs will be enormous if we can't bring
in the latest information technology to deal with congestion and work
rules dating back to the 1940s," she said. "The fact that PMA plans
to play harder ball than in the past, from our perspective, is not a
bad thing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lockout Could Threaten International Markets</TE>
<TE>   Stallone, the ILWU spokesman, said the preservation of well-paying
union jobs--not technology or work practices--is what is really at
stake. "What we have already seen is employers using the introduction
of technology to take work that is contractually the work of ILWU
members and have others do it."</TE>
<TE>   Miniace said the PMA is "not interested in busting the union or
weakening it." But he added that he would not hesitate to lock out
union members if he detects a work slowdown during the talks. "We
actually lose more money during a work slowdown than during a strike,
so we'd be better off just shutting down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Such an action could pose "an instantaneous threat to insecure
international financial markets," said Stephen S. Cohen, a professor
of regional planning at UC Berkeley. He said struggling Asian
economies are more dependent than ever on massive volumes of exports
to the U.S. Giant American retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and
Target Corp. rely on imported merchandise. And financial markets are
extremely sensitive to disruptions of those flows.</TE>
<TE>   He estimated a five-day shutdown would cost the national economy
about $4.7 billion, and federal, state and local tax receipts would
be reduced by nearly $115million. A stoppage of 20 days, he said,
would cost the national economy $48.6 billion and vaporize $1.8
billion of federal, state and local tax revenues.</TE>
<TE>   "A shutdown should, therefore, be treated not only as a labor
relations problem with serious and rapidly cumulating impacts on the
economy," he said, "but as a threat to ... international financial
markets."</TE>
<TE>   Union officials dismissed talk of a lockout as posturing. To move
cargo, Stallone said, shippers would have to turn to hundreds of
nonunion workers who may not have the training required to operated
sophisticated and dangerous equipment. And once unloaded, the cargo
would have to be moved by truck or rail, which could be problematic
given the ILWU's agreements with the Teamsters and other unions.</TE>

<LD>Jobless Rate Jumps to Near 8-Year High</LD>
<LD>   The nation's unemployment rate jumped to a near eight-year high of
6% last month, adding to signs that full economic recovery may be
longer in coming and slower to help the jobless than previously
thought.</LD>
<LD>   The April rate unexpectedly climbed 0.3 of a point from March's
5.7% pace as Americans flooded into the work force at a far faster
pace than the economy created jobs, the Labor Department said. More
than half a million people entered the job market, pushing the
nation's labor force to a record 142.6 million, according to
department statistics.</LD>
<TE>   But employers added only 43,000 new jobs in April. And even that
skimpy figure was suspect as the government revised away
earlier-reported job gains for February and March.</TE>
<TE>   The 6% jobless rate was the highest since July 1994 and
represented a substantial turnabout from the record low 3.9% rate the
country enjoyed only 18 months ago. By now, 8.6 million Americans are
unemployed, 3.1 million more than when the country hit its
unemployment low in October 2000.</TE>

<TE>   WorldCom CEO Resigns Under Fire</TE>
<TE>   Bernard J. Ebbers resigned as chief executive and president of
WorldCom Inc., a telecom giant ensnarled in massive debt, declining
revenue and questionable accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers was succeeded by John Sidgmore, the company's vice
chairman, who immediately vowed to restructure the company.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers' departure, which came amid growing pressure from company
board members, makes him the highest-profile casualty thus far in a
telecommunications bust so relentless that it has vaporized
$2trillion in shareholders' money over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers, a former basketball coach and hotel manager, had built
WorldCom through a series of mergers that included the acquisition of
MCI in 1998.</TE>

<TE>   Hewlett-Packard Completes Compaq Deal</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett-Packard Co. on Friday completed its acquisition of Compaq
Computer Corp., a step made possible after a judge earlier in the
week ruled that HP did not mislead shareholders or engage in vote
buying to win shareholder support for the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Following the ruling, Walter Hewlett, the dissident director who
challenged the shareholder vote in Delaware's Chancery Court, said he
wouldn't appeal the ruling and dropped his challenge of the vote
count.</TE>
<TE>   Trading of Compaq stock will be suspended Monday. Shortly
afterward, HP will begin trading under the new NYSE symbol, HPQ. The
official launch of the new company will take place Tuesday.</TE>

<TE>   Venture Capital Investments Up</TE>
<TE>   Led by the telecom and biotech industries, total venture capital
investment in Southern California companies rose in the first quarter
from the previous quarter, bucking the national trend, a study found.</TE>
<TE>   Venture investors committed $819.6 million to Southland companies
in the quarter, up from $711million invested in regional firms in the
previous quarter, according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers/Venture
Economics/National Venture Capital Assn. quarterly MoneyTree survey.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, venture investment nationwide fell to a four-year low
of $6.2 billion in the first quarter from $8 billion in the fourth
quarter, the survey showed. Total venture investing peaked at $29
billion in the first quarter of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Report Says Gasoline Supplies Manipulated</TE>
<TE>   The gasoline business is dominated by a handful of oil companies
that can manipulate supplies to increase prices and profits, and
California is a prime spot for such maneuvers, congressional
investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   A 396-page report by the Democratic staff of the Senate permanent
investigations subcommittee did not accuse oil companies of violating
federal antitrust laws, but noted that when only a few players
control supply, then those companies have enormous power to control
prices. The problem is worsened by the closure of dozens of
refineries during the last 20 years, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   In several instances, refiners have sought to increase prices by
reducing supplies, said the report, commissioned in June by Sen. Carl
Levin (D-Mich.), who chairs the subcommittee. The report, citing
internal oil company documents from the 1990s, contended that
refiners employ a variety of strategies to boost prices, including
reducing refinery production and exporting supplies to other
countries.</TE>

<TE>   ABC Television President Resigns</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co.'s troubled ABC network continued its revolving
door of top executives, announcing that ABC Television President
Steven M. Bornstein would resign after nearly a year in that
position.</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives said Bornstein, 50, who spent most of the last
two decades helping mold ESPN into a cable TV sports powerhouse, was
leaving "to pursue other interests."</TE>
<TE>   Bornstein's responsibilities had included oversight of ABC's
television stations, the revamping of the cable channel ABC
Family--which Disney acquired and renamed last year--and the ABC-TV
network. But ABC has struggled through a dismal season and is in
fourth place in prime-time ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Bornstein's resignation follows statements by Disney President
Robert Iger that he intends to become more involved in ABC's
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Television industry sources and media analysts have long said that
ABC is top-heavy in management and that the responsibilities of
senior management are ill-defined.</TE>

<TE>   Grammy President Quits Amid Controversy</TE>
<TE>   The music industry was abuzz over the sudden resignation of C.
Michael Greene as president of the Grammy organization and about the
future direction of the influential industry group.</TE>
<TE>   The controversial Grammy chief abruptly resigned in an emergency
board meeting arranged by Grammy Chairman Garth Fundis to present the
findings of a sexual harassment investigation to the group's board.</TE>
<TE>   Greene, 52, had three years left on his employment contract and
will be paid as much as $8 million as part of a severance package,
sources said.</TE>

<TE>   Northrop Gets Contract for Stealth Ship</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman Corp. won a $2.9-billion contract to begin
designing a new generation of destroyers, beating out archrival
General Dynamics Co. for what Pentagon officials described as one of
the most significant Navy programs in decades.</TE>
<TE>   By winning the contract, Century City-based Northrop and its
partner, Raytheon Corp., not only will design the new warship, dubbed
DDX, but will give the team a leg up in garnering future contracts
for other surface ships that analysts believe could represent an
additional business valued at $60 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy wants a destroyer that would be stealthy, operate with
about a third of the crew now required for similar class ships and
have technologies that would be the foundation for future generations
of warships. The proposed design released publicly by Northrop
depicts a ship riding low in the water. It is devoid of many of the
features of current destroyers and bears some resemblance to Civil
War-era ironclads.</TE>
<TE>   The Northrop win surprised analysts, however, because General
Dynamics, along with partner Lockheed Martin Corp., was considered
the favorite because it has dominated surface ship construction for
the Navy in recent decades. Lockheed, for instance, has been the
system integrator for a significant portion of the Navy's fleet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cable Firms Agree to Add Digital TV</TE>
<TE>   The country's 10 largest cable television companies pledged to add
high-definition digital TV to their lineups by next year.</TE>
<TE>   The cable companies, including AT&amp;T Broadband, AOL Time Warner
Inc. and Adelphia Communications Corp., didn't specify when they
would make HDTV available to their customers. But they committed to
offering free space in their channel lineups by Jan. 1 to as many as
five broadcasters or cable networks that air significant amounts of
HDTV.</TE>
<TE>   The pledge marks the first significant progress for the troubled
transition to digital TV, which the Federal Communications Commission
mandated in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The switch from analog to digital promises clearer pictures,
better sound and more sophisticated services, but it forces
broadcasters to invest millions of dollars in new equipment and
consumers to buy digital TVs.</TE>
<TE>   Yet cable operators were reluctant to set a date for rolling out
the services. And their commitment left several disputes among the
cable operators, set manufacturers and broadcasters still to be
resolved.</TE>

<TE>   Allstate Granted Large Hikes in Insurance Rates</TE>
<TE>   State regulators granted Allstate Corp. hefty increases in auto
and homeowners insurance premiums--more bad news for California
consumers already grappling with rising premiums and diminishing
options.</TE>
<TE>   Allstate, California's third-largest insurer, asked for a 22.3%
increase for homeowners policies and was granted 18.5%. For auto
coverage, it requested 20.1% and was granted 8.9%.</TE>
<TE>   The decision by the state Department of Insurance came on the
heels of several other rate increases, including a hike of more than
14% for State Farm homeowners in two steps late last year and early
this year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, State Farm General Insurance Co. said it will stop
writing new homeowner policies in California because of rising
losses.</TE>

<TE>   Markets Decline Amid Profit Doubts</TE>
<TE>   U.S. stocks ended the week on a down note as the highest jobless
rate since 1994 and slower-than-expected growth in service industries
cast doubt on the strength of a rebound in profits.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.3%. It has lost 6.5% this
year. The Nasdaq fell 3.1%, bringing its decline for the year to 17%.
The Dow gained 1%, boosted by better-than-expected sales from General
Motors Corp. It's off 0.2% this year.</TE>

<HD>Scandals Pave Way for Wall St. Reforms</HD>
<DH>Probes: Government investigators and plaintiffs' attorneys
are pursuing investigations on three fronts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The stock market crash of 1929 spurred the creation of the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   A rash of insider trading in the 1980s culminated in junk bond
king Michael Milken's guilty pleas to fraud charges in 1990, and in
the bankruptcy of Drexel Burnham Lambert.</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, a dramatic clampdown by the federal government put an end
to bid-rigging by Nasdaq stock dealers that had inflated investors'
trading costs for decades.</LD>
<TE>   Wall Street's history has had a certain rhythm: bull market, then
bear market, then--almost without exception--scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Many episodes of fraud and chicanery have been so minor that they
have come and gone without much effect on the overall financial
system. But there are times when the magnitude of the abuses is so
large, and investors' loss of faith in the system so undeniable, that
the government steps in to force massive change.</TE>
<TE>   The debate today is whether Wall Street's intensifying crop of
scandals stemming from the 1990s boom years will launch such
far-reaching reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and state regulators now are investigating a wide array of
alleged Wall Street wrongdoing, ranging from the conduct of stock
analysts to the handling of hot stock offerings to the role of
investment banks in the collapse of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   And as the list of perceived abuses grows longer, a public that
lost trillions of dollars in the stock market's plunge has grown
increasingly agitated, distrustful and hungry for vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not the kind of once-in-100-year scandal that we saw in
the 1930s. But this is the largest crisis in a quarter-century as far
as the industry's reputation for integrity," said John Coffee, a
Columbia University securities law expert.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts say that may lead to genuine change, both in the form
of new government regulations as well as heightened internal policing
by Wall Street itself, to clean up securities markets and limit the
potential for large-scale fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very good chance that over the next two or three years
a broad series of changes will strengthen and improve the markets
quite significantly, and hopefully public confidence with it," said
Richard Breeden, a former SEC chairman.</TE>
<TE>   But that sentiment is far from universal, and some doubters worry
that only moderate changes will emerge.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics say regulators were long aware of some institutionalized
deceitful practices by the financial industry but failed to corral
them.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, disputes between state and federal regulators, and
between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, threaten to slow the
reform process.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Investigators Pursuing Three Main Probes</TE>
<TE>   One of the first major Enron-related reform bills proposed in
Congress was panned by some for ordering relatively modest changes in
regulatory oversight.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody has the stomach, even in a post-Enron
environment, for restructuring Wall Street," said Donald Langevoort,
a Georgetown University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, regulators' efforts to effect change so far lack the
spectacle of 1987--when accused insider traders at big-name
brokerages were led from their offices in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of so many lives on Wall Street on Sept. 11 has almost
certainly dimmed prosecutors' appetite for those kinds of theatrics
as well as for the most punitive measures against the financial
industry, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, government investigators and private plaintiffs'
attorneys are pursuing three main probes of Wall Street conduct that
have the potential to generate significant penalties--and reforms--if
evidence of fraud is overwhelming:</TE>
<TE>   * The brightest spotlight is trained on brokerage research
analysts, as state and federal regulators focus on whether analysts
intentionally misled investors with their stock recommendations in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The key concern is that analysts talked up stocks primarily to
flatter the subject companies and lure fee-rich investment banking
business to their firms--not because they believed in the companies
they touted.</TE>
<TE>   The analyst controversy first surfaced a year ago as Congress
began rooting around for villains in the aftermath of the worst stock
market decline in a generation. But the issue hit a boiling point
only last month, when New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer released a
series of revealing e-mails written by Merrill Lynch Internet-stock
analysts in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In the private e-mails Spitzer obtained by subpoena, Merrill
analysts brutally criticized stocks they covered--deriding some as
"junk" and "crap"--while recommending them to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Many observers view the missives as a smoking gun that provides
the strongest proof that serious fraud permeates brokerage practices.
Spitzer has broadened his probe of analysts to include other major
brokerages, and the SEC has since launched its own formal inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can establish that the opinions given by these investment
banks were not bona fide, that becomes potentially one of the biggest
securities frauds in Wall Street history in magnitude," Langevoort
said.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch initially lashed out at Spitzer and his charges, but
became conciliatory as the uproar grew. The firm is attempting to
negotiate a settlement with Spitzer, but the attorney general is
pushing for a large restitution fund to compensate investors, and the
guarantee of reforms that would ensure that analysts are honest and
objective in their advice to investors.</TE>
<TE>   * The SEC and National Assn. of Securities Dealers are conducting
wide-ranging investigations of Wall Street's handling of initial
public stock offerings in the bull market's heyday.</TE>
<TE>   Brokerage giant Credit Suisse First Boston agreed in January to
pay $100 million to settle twin civil investigations of how it
allocated IPO shares to investors. The probes delved into whether the
firm charged excessive IPO commissions that amounted to kickbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Now regulators are in a second, and potentially more serious, leg
of the investigation: They are examining whether numerous brokerages
tied IPO allocations to promises by clients to buy more shares in the
open market.</TE>
<TE>   That raises the specter of outright market manipulation, if
prearranged buying caused artificial price spikes. If the allegations
are borne out, small investors could have a strong case that they
were cheated if they bought IPOs on their first trading day, often at
exorbitant prices.</TE>
<TE>   The IPO controversy has spawned 310 class-action lawsuits naming
about 45 brokerages.</TE>
<TE>   But some Wall Street critics were disappointed last fall when the
Justice Department declined to pursue a criminal case against CSFB in
the IPO matter.</TE>
<TE>   And many experts say that reforming the IPO-allocation process is
one of the most vexing challenges facing regulators.</TE>
<TE>   * Perhaps the biggest wild card for Wall Street is whether its
involvement with Enron will be shown to have abetted the company's
alleged frauds in financial reporting.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators and others are studying whether
investment banks helped Enron mislead investors by devising its
controversial partnerships that hid debt from the company's
investors, work for which the banks earned juicy advisory fees. The
House Energy and Commerce committee sent a team of investigators back
to New York last week to gather additional data.</TE>
<TE>   Though the probe is not yet done, "some of the transactions under
investigation certainly have raised a lot of eyebrows around here,"
committee spokesman Ken Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Investment banks argue that they were victims of Enron, and
several are among Enron's largest creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
But in court, some rival creditors accuse the banks of contributing
to Enron's downfall. A group of insurance companies has lodged such
claims in an almost $1-billion legal dispute against J.P. Morgan
Chase &amp; Co. If bankers are shown to have known of the company's
alleged efforts to conceal its true financial condition, they could
be held partly responsible for the biggest bankruptcy in U.S.
history.</TE>
<TE>   In all three of these investigations, prosecutors and plaintiffs'
attorneys bear the burden of proving wrongdoing in what can be fuzzy
areas of securities fraud laws.</TE>
<TE>   But the public's disgust over the accusations is clearly
registering in Wall Street executive suites.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare concession, Merrill Lynch's chief executive, David
Komansky, called the e-mails "embarrassing" and apologized for them.</TE>
<TE>   Komansky defended the firm in a television interview last week as
having integrity and following "a very strong set of compliance
rules." But he acknowledged that Merrill and others may have to take
significant measures to reestablish good reputations with investors.</TE>
<TE>   "We as a firm and as an industry have to do something to get
investor confidence back the way it was," Komansky said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Market Experts Caution Against Overreaction</TE>
<TE>   They'll have to work hard to reclaim investors such as Marilyn
Barrett.</TE>
<TE>   "When an individual investor listens to an expert, you have to
appreciate the fact that sometimes they will make an error. But to
know that they were not even trying to act in your best interest,"
said Barrett, a Los Angeles attorney. "I trust them a lot less than I
used to."</TE>
<TE>   Yet some market experts caution against overreaction.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to reform anything in a roaring bull market because
everybody's making money," said Wall Street historian John Steele
Gordon. "But then when the bull market suddenly ends, you need
scapegoats. People start looking and finding all kinds of things that
are wrong."</TE>
<TE>   He believes that, from as to fairness to investors, "Wall Street
is an awful lot better today than it was in the 1970s ... and a whole
lot better than it was in the 1920s."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the reform process is rolling. Regulators already have
proposed some changes to rebuild public confidence.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD and the New York Stock Exchange have proposed banning
brokerages from tying research analysts' compensation to specific
investment banking deals. Regulators also want brokerages to boost
disclosure of potential conflicts of interests in their stock
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC will vote on the NASD/NYSE plan Wednesday, even as the
agency pursues its investigation of analyst conduct.</TE>
<TE>   But some experts say the proposal doesn't go far enough. It would
"fall short," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   To some skeptics, the stock analyst controversy shows how tough it
will be to achieve real reform: Analyst conflicts were well-known in
the financial industry in the 1990s, and were tacitly accepted by
regulators, critics say.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC issued a report last year showing that many analysts
bought stocks for their personal accounts at low prices before
pitching them to investors. Congress held high-profile hearings on
the issue last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the SEC launched a full investigation only in the days after
Spitzer's revelations last month.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone on Wall Street knew there were conflicts of interest
involving analysts," said Coffee of Columbia University. "Even at the
SEC, the attitude when these allegations first started surfacing was
a little like the French inspector in the film "Casablanca" who was
'shocked, shocked' to find there was gambling going on in the
casino."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer concurs. Before his release of the Merrill e-mails, he
said last week, "It was abundantly clear that no serious reforms were
occurring."</TE>
<TE>   The House passed a bill late last month that encompassed
analyst-reform issues, but critics blasted it as weak. The Senate
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee is working on a bill
that is expected to be much tougher than the House version.</TE>
<TE>   For example, it contains an "anti-retaliatory" provision that
would bar brokerages from penalizing analysts whose stock downgrades
damage an investment-banking relationship, said one person involved
in the process.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Threat of Prosecution Could Prompt Change</TE>
<TE>   Most observers say some reforms involving analysts' roles are
inevitable. "You can't support a large stable of analysts who no one
believes," Coffee said. "You've got to adopt reforms that make
analysts credible.''</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether the reforms would make a practical
difference.</TE>
<TE>   For example, analysts are sure to become more upfront in
disclosing certain conflicts of interest, such as when they're
writing a report about an investment-banking client. Merrill Lynch,
in a partial settlement with Spitzer, has begun to do that.</TE>
<TE>   But "with investment banks regularly seeking business from anybody
who has a deal to, [disclosure] is going to become very routine and
boilerplate," Langevoort said.</TE>
<TE>   The most important reforms of Wall Street practices may spring not
from new laws, but from market forces--and fear of criminal
prosecution, some experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of prosecution could prompt changes in firms' conduct
if executives fear that they or their companies could be criminally
liable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Investigations Strike Fear Among Analysts</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has said he could charge Merrill with criminal fraud
violations under state law.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department, though cautioning that it is not
conducting a blanket probe of analysts, also is examining the issue
for criminal liability.</TE>
<TE>   "The Department of Justice could have an unprecedented impact on
how the financial markets operate in the future," Washington
securities lawyer Jacob Frenkel said.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond any penalties on Wall Street that the government
investigations may lead to, "It strikes fear because it raises the
hairs on the heads of all the plaintiffs' class-action lawyers who
see this as another way to milk the golden cow," said one defense
attorney involved in stock analyst, IPO and Enron cases.</TE>
<TE>   "They're [brokerages] terribly exposed with these class-action
lawsuits" to high financial costs if government probes prove
wrongdoing.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stock Analyst Honesty</LD>
<LD>   * The allegations: Analysts routinely tout stocks to curry favor
with companies they cover, in the hope of winning investment banking
business for their firms. New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer has
leveled the harshest charges, accusing Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analysts
of privately disparaging certain stocks while pushing them to
investors. The firm has denied wrongdoing, but is in settlement talks
with Spitzer.</LD>
<LD>   * Who's investigating: State and federal regulators, including
Spitzer, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers and the New York
Stock Exchange. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched a
probe of at least 10 major brokerages in late April.</LD>
<TE>   * Reform proposals: The SEC will vote Wednesday on a package
proposed by the NASD and NYSE. It includes a ban on analysts
reporting to investment bankers and a requirement that analysts give
investors extensive detail about their stock-rating systems. Some
experts have praised the plan, but Spitzer and others say it falls
short of what is needed. Some firms have instituted reforms on their
own, such as barring analysts from owning stocks they follow.</TE>
<TE>   * Private lawsuits: Investors filed several suits last year
against Morgan Stanley analyst Mary Meeker, but the suits were
quickly thrown out by a federal judge. Merrill Lynch, however, agreed
to pay a New York investor $400,000 to settle his arbitration claim
against the brokerage firm and former analyst Henry Blodget. After
Spitzer's release of the Merrill e-mails, attorneys alleging IPO
violations against major brokerages amended many of their claims to
include new charges against analysts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IPOs</TE>
<TE>   * The allegations:  Major brokerages committed abuses in their
handling of initial public stock offerings in the late 1990s.
Investigators are studying whether some investment banks charged
excessive commissions that amounted to illegal kickbacks. They're
also studying whether firms required some IPO investors to buy more
shares once trading began, which may have manipulated the market.</TE>
<TE>   * Who's investigating: The SEC and NASD. However, the U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan decided last year against pursuing a
criminal case against Credit Suisse First Boston.</TE>
<TE>   * Reform proposals: CSFB agreed to pay $100 million to settle a
probe of the firm by the SEC and NASD. The firm was alleged to have
committed bookkeeping violations and to have improperly shared in the
profits of its customers.</TE>
<TE>   * Private lawsuits: Small investors have filed 310 consolidated
class-action suits in federal court in New York against about 45
investment banks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wall St. and Enron</TE>
<TE>   * The allegations: Investment banks helped Enron Corp. dupe
investors by concocting the murky partnerships that plunged the
energy company into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   * Who's investigating: The House Energy and Commerce Committee is
conducting an intensive probe. The SEC is looking into aspects of
Enron's relationship with Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   * Reform proposals: Among a battery of Enron-related legislation,
the House passed a bill last month that would mandate moderate
accounting and corporate financial reporting reforms. It would
require the SEC to set up a disciplinary board to oversee auditors. A
Senate committee is working on a tougher bill. A separate Senate
committee approved a bill that would make it easier to prosecute
securities fraud.</TE>
<TE>   * Private lawsuits: Enron shareholders have sued nine major
investment banks, saying they helped Enron conceal its poor finances.
Some Enron creditors also have attacked Citigroup and J.P. Morgan
Chase &amp; Co. over their Enron involvement. The banks have denied
wrongdoing. J.P. Morgan also is involved in an almost $1-billion
dispute with 11 insurance companies over Enron claims.</TE>

<LD>In "U.S. Takes Russia for Granted at Its Peril" (Commentary, May 1),
Katrina vanden Heuvel and Stephen Cohen's statement is absolutely
correct: "Sept. 11 notwithstanding, the post-Cold War nuclear world
is more dangerous than the Cold War period itself. The main reason is
the instability of Russia's nuclear infrastructure." We continue to
include Russia on our watch list of targets due to its economic and
military instability and have established our military presence to
stabilize former Soviet republics to help maintain their own autonomy
from Moscow and to defend their own nuclear stockpiles.</LD>
<LD>   Moscow's fear of military encirclement is real, but with China as
its big problem. Open letters from retired generals accuse President
Vladimir Putin of betraying national security interests with an
alliance with the U.S. But why not ally with the U.S.? Simply put,
the Russians still have a bankrupt economy and Putin is banking on
the U.S. to bail them out again.</LD>
<LD>   The accusation that the Bush administration's policy of treating
Russia not as a real partner but merely as a helper when it suits
U.S. purposes has been Russia's modus operandi with the U.S. for
decades. Where does it say that this is wrong? Better, who cares? By
our actions, we certainly do not take Russia for granted, especially
at our own peril.</LD>
<TE>   Donald Dickey</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vanden Heuvel and Cohen lament that the "chance to establish a
truly cooperative relationship with post-Communist Russia . . . has
been gravely endangered by Bush's own policies." They argue that
Russia has received little in exchange for its support of the U.S.
war on terrorism, but they overlook a key concession from the Bush
administration: its 180-degree shift in policy on Russian activity in
Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Before the post-Sept. 11 partnership, Russia was conducting a
campaign of terror on the people of that region. Now the U.S. views
Russia as conducting a campaign of counter-terrorism in Chechnya.
This exercise in doublespeak should be well appreciated in the nation
that was once the prototypical Orwellian society.</TE>

<HD>Mass Media: Guilty as Sexually Charged</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Going Past 'Just Say No,'" editorial, April 29: When a society
expects its children to behave in a certain way, they behave that
way. I submit that our society doesn't expect its children to become
sexually active prior to marriage; the problem, however, is that the
entertainment media push it and--as they have free rein in this
country, with virtually no checks and balances--our children have
gradually come to adopt premarital sexual activity as that which our
society wishes for them.</LD>
<LD>   You conclude that abstinence-only training "may be doing nothing
to cut teenage pregnancies." Another conclusion that makes a whole
lot more sense to me: The numbers are better than they would have
been without the abstinence-only message that is now being offered.</LD>
<LD>   Parents slept in separate beds and four-letter words were unheard
of on television and in the movies 50 years ago when I was a kid. So
it was not hard to promote abstinence-only in conversations in the
home in those days. Today it's extraordinarily difficult because the
media have taken advantage of our free society and legal system to
turn things around 180 degrees. We are not the better for it. Your
editorial has now become another small part of a very large problem.
You have an opportunity to rethink it and become part of the
solution.</LD>

<HD>Without Conservation, We're All in Hot Water</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>What a great pity that in "Oasis Not Making Anyone Thirsty" (April
30), on the festivities at the Department of Water and Power's
Japanese Garden in Van Nuys, the major focus was the undrinkability
of the water used in the garden. The Japanese Garden was never
conceived as even a forerunner to the concept of "toilet to tap." The
purpose of the garden is to show what can be done with reclaimed
water; how it can be used to create a beautiful, serene and green
area where people can go to relax, enjoy and contemplate nature. It
is meant to serve as a restful retreat from our "hustle-bustle" daily
lives.</LD>
<LD>   It also serves as a teaching tool, demonstrating what can be
accomplished when science applies itself to solving sewage-disposal
problems in an environmentally sound way. Too bad you chose instead
to concentrate on what engenders a reader's emotional response rather
than on what is important and makes good environmental sense.</LD>

<TE>   Low-flow shower heads and low-capacity toilets are fine in
conserving water, but there is something else that I have not seen
addressed yet. When you turn on the hot-water faucet in your home and
wait more than five to eight seconds for hot water, you are wasting
water. The enormous amount of water being wasted daily, going down
the drain, is a conservation disaster.</TE>
<TE>   What do we need to do to get home builders to install systems in
new houses to eliminate or minimize this very wasteful practice?
There should not be too much extra cost in plumbing a new house to
run an additional pipe for hot-water circulation. This type of system
would make hot water almost instantaneous at any faucet. A small pump
located near the water heater could accomplish a lot. There are
systems now on the market that can be retrofitted to existing houses
that offer this type of solution. We need to get more serious about
conserving water. There isn't an abundance of it.</TE>

<LD>The plan to require teachers at some Los Angeles schools to dress
formally and sign an oath that they will do so is an insult not only
to these hard-working, underpaid professionals but to every taxpayer
in the LAUSD area ("Teachers Protest Dress Code," May 1). With test
scores dropping, criminal behavior all too common among students,
racial tension between blacks and Hispanics and class sizes actually
going up, Supt. Roy Romer thinks ties and pantyhose are the solution?
This is like attacking a burning building by painting the bathrooms
in pastels while the structure collapses around you.</LD>
<LD>   Teachers should be comfortable with their outfits so they can
remain energetic and enthusiastic, and Romer and his staff should be
addressing real issues like class size, teacher training, parental
involvement and mental health and learning-disability issues. I fully
support the teachers who refuse to follow Romer's ridiculous
directive.</LD>

<LD>Much to my dismay, "AIDS Scare at Tiny College Shakes Town" (April
30) basically put the blame on the community for the actions of one
person. Huron, S.D., is a small town, but anyone who has actually
been here would know right away that there are not farm machinery
outlets up and down the town. There are places for the people who are
of drinking age to go to besides the American Legion and Veterans of
Foreign Wars clubs.</LD>
<LD>   The community of Huron is strong, and it will make it through this
problem. Yeah, there may not be a lot to do in Huron, but I do not
feel that is a reasonable excuse for what happened. The point is that
this male got HIV and had sexual intercourse with women without
informing them, not that Huron is a bad community that is to blame
for this epidemic.</LD>

<LD>Re "U.S. Tilts to Israel for Good Reason," Commentary, May 2: Norah
Vincent's columns are like a game: How quickly can you spot the
logical error? In this case she says the U.S. favors the Israelis
because, quite simply, "They don't murder children." But the rash of
suicide bombings is only a year old. How does she rationalize our
support of Israeli oppression from 1967 to 2001? In the 19th century,
Vincent would've exhorted the U.S. Army to exterminate the Indians
who fought back and sometimes harmed "innocent" settlers.</LD>

<TE>   The Times was correct to point out that there was risk in the U.S.
keeping silent about the U.N. Security Council's resolution to
investigate what happened in Jenin (editorial, May 2). The U.S.
should have loudly demanded an explanation as to why one of those
chosen to investigate Israel's actions was Cornelio Sommaruga. As
former head of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
Sommaruga made sure that Israel was the only nation on Earth to be
refused admission. "If we're going to have the Shield of David," he
said, "why would we not have to accept the swastika?"</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. should also demand an investigation into where support
for terrorism comes from and why the U.N. has historically voted
against Israel but never against those nations that support
atrocities committed against it.</TE>

represent, that question has been amply answered.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Glaring Omission From Legacy of the Riots--Apologies," May 1:
May I be the first to agree that Steve Lopez is naive. I am even more
so, in that I would expect two guys to be charged with responsibility
[for the 1992 riots]: Tom Bradley and Daryl Gates. It's called
accountability. There is no doubt that the event and actions were
insane, self-defeating and directed at innocent parties; nonetheless,
they were understandable.</LD>
<LD>   The glaring omission is not apologies; it is the lack of civic
awareness of root causes and of changes to the system that brought
forth the chaos. Does anyone remember the French Revolution? If we
don't awaken soon, it can only become worse.</LD>
<LD>   John Kertisz</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you, Steve Lopez, for your column questioning the Rev. Cecil
"Chip" Murray's statement that criminal acts committed during the
1992 riots were "understandable." As Lopez suggests, it is never
understandable or acceptable to commit theft and arson. The Rev.
Murray is providing a miserable moral compass for his flock by
tacitly condoning the destruction of other people's property.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Roy Williams states ("Placing Courage in Social Context," letter, May
2) that "the bravery of a suicide bomber is no more in doubt than the
bravery of a Sept. 11 hero." This is an insult to the truly brave.</LD>
<LD>   Suicide is simply an escape--from real or imagined suffering, from
responsibility, from self-loathing or from prosecution for one's
actions. It's also forbidden by both the Bible and the Koran. As
Williams correctly notes, intentional killing of unarmed,
noncombatant civilians is "evil" and considered both a crime and
unethical throughout much of the world.</LD>
<LD>   Suicide bombers kill innocents to make a point and simultaneously
ensure their own cowardly escape from responsibility and punishment.
Real bravery would be to stay home and defend family, friends and
community from military attack, risking capture or death by their
enemy's hands, not by their own.</LD>

<LD>   Their past, with all its wisdom, songs, laws and values, ceased on
that day. And the present closed in around them in a swarm of real
estate developers, lawyers and politicians.</LD>
<LD>   The land these Native Americans had occupied for 3,000 years, and
which had been officially granted to them as wild desert in 1891 by
the government of the United States, came to be known as Palm
Springs. And their 30,000 acres came to be worth a fortune.</LD>
<TE>   Fifty-one years and innumerable legal and political battles after
Patencio's declaration, the tribe is set to break ground on an
ambitious museum that will preserve what precious little remains of
the old ways. Moreover, the planned 100,000-square-foot, $37-million
Agua Caliente Cultural Museum will honor the tribe's history of
survival--in the harsh desert climate and on the brutal battleground
of the 20th century Palm Springs real estate market.</TE>
<TE>   "We call the museum our 'tribal elder,'" says Ray Patencio,
Albert's grandnephew and son of the tribe's last ceremonial singer,
Joseph. Patencio, who previously served on the tribal council for 26
years and is gaming commissioner for the tribe's two casinos, says
his decade-long involvement on the museum board has been a profound
personal learning experience: "There's so much I didn't know about my
own culture. This place is our history."</TE>
<TE>   The museum will also have modern relevance, with exhibits focusing
on land and water rights, and sovereignty issues. "Everyone still
thinks of us as Indians in feathers. Everyone wants to hear about our
traditions and 'Do we live in tepees?'" says Mildred Browne, the
wildly energetic 50-something chairwoman of the museum board. "For
people to take us seriously, they need to see us as who we are now,
what we've accomplished and what we've had to fight for." Then she
laughs and adds, "Everything!"</TE>
<TE>   The 357 members of the Agua Caliente Band--or tribe--are part of
the Cahuilla Nation (pronounced ku-WEE-yah). The 2,500 members make
up seven distinct tribes on 10 California Indian reservations between
Morongo and the Salton Sea. The Agua Caliente Band's reservation is
within the city limits of Palm Springs, a geographical stroke of good
luck that has allowed it to build a significant empire of assorted
real estate holdings, casinos, hotels and a bank. But it came the
hard way.</TE>
<TE>   For several thousand years, the Cahuilla Indians thrived in this
area, fishing in the now-dry Lake Cahuilla, gathering acorns and
other seeds, hunting on the steep slopes of the San Bernardino
Mountains. When the Spanish arrived in 1776, the Cahuilla proved
adept traders. "They were extremely competent at dealing with
outsiders," says Lowell Bean, professor emeritus at Cal State Hayward
and the author of several books on the Cahuilla. "Their leaders were
good managers and could work well outside of their own culture."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the tribe converted to Catholicism but still maintained
their traditional religious beliefs and rituals. The 1848 Gold Rush
brought the white man and his laws, which were variously brutal,
paternalistic and opportunistic. In 1891, a congressional act legally
established numerous Indian reservations throughout the country. In
the case of the Agua Caliente Band, every square mile or so of Indian
land alternated with a square mile of what was then railroad land,
creating a checkerboard of 30,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   At the turn of the century, various advocate groups urged--and
forced--Indian children to attend English-speaking schools far from
their reservations and their cultures. The aim was assimilation and
education but the consequence was the near annihilation of many
indigenous cultures. The layout of the Agua Caliente Band's
reservation meant that its assimilation was all the more thorough, as
the tribe lived side by side with a growing Anglo community.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Albert Patencio set fire to the ceremonial house, a
simple wooden structure where the tribe's sacred ceremonies and
social meetings were held, only a handful of tribe members could
speak Cahuilla. Fewer still knew the complex, lengthy songs that told
of creation and also served as the tribe's legal guidelines and
genealogical records. The songs required years of dedication to
learn. They needed to be sung exactly or, they believe, the singer
risked bringing disaster to the tribe.</TE>
<TE>   "When my father died [in 1979] he took all the songs with him,"
Ray Patencio says. "You couldn't get anything out of him, he didn't
want to talk about it." Several thousand years of tribal memory was
gone. "As a child I would go with my father and sit and listen to him
sing," Patencio says, "but I didn't speak the language, so it meant
nothing to me. I'd rather have been going to a movie or playing
outside on the street with the other kids."</TE>
<TE>   Patencio, who, like most of the tribe, is Catholic, doesn't
challenge the wisdom of his elders in refusing to pass on their
knowledge. "They did what they felt was right," he says. "Why?
Because there was no interest in the old ways? To protect the
children? Because the old ways had no application in modern society?
I don't know. If they put a stop to it, they had their reasons."</TE>
<TE>   "They agreed that in order to go forward they wouldn't pass on the
language," Browne says of her parents. "They had to understand the
politics and laws that had been thrown at them. They couldn't change
but they knew their kids could. They knew we had to adapt."</TE>
<TE>   Browne and Patencio's generation focused its energy on building a
financially solvent, politically sovereign tribe against significant
odds. In the first half of the century, the tribe had battled for
water and land against a powerful ranching fraternity. And, then, in
1959 came the Equalization Act. This forced the tribe to allocate
most of its land to individual members, ostensibly to ensure that
each member got an equal share. The small, personal allotments were
easier for developers to purchase or tie up in cheap, long-term
leases at a time when Palm Springs real estate values had begun to
skyrocket.</TE>
<TE>   The act also required the appointment of guardians for tribe
minors and "conservators" for adults deemed by the court as unable to
manage their own affairs. Ninety-two of the band's 104 members were
so deemed. Many conservators sold their charges' land well under
market value (often to friends) and levied tribe members with
quasi-legal management fees. One 13-year-old boy, dying of a spinal
tumor in the early 1960s, was charged $20,000 in fees by his
guardian, out of his $23,000 estate.</TE>
<TE>   Patencio and Browne, who were newlyweds in 1965 with a baby (they
have since divorced but remain good friends), were forced to pay more
than $45,000 in various fees to their conservator. After a federal
investigation, Congress changed the law in 1968, though no money was
returned. The tribal council has since repurchased the 1,800 acres
lost during those years.</TE>
<TE>   "In those days the cultural aspect of our tribe was not high on
our list of priorities," Patencio says with an understated smile. "We
had to develop sophistication. We had to learn how to protect
ourselves. Even now you can't sit back, you have to constantly be
aware of litigation in Congress, legislation and political attitudes,
not just what affects us but all tribes of the Indian Nation."</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1980s, the tribe had consolidated its fiscal and legal
status, says Patencio, "And we began to look at other areas where we
could focus our attention. We thought, 'Why aren't we preserving our
history and culture?'"</TE>
<TE>   Initially, a storage facility for artifacts was planned. But as
the tribe's enthusiasm for the project grew, so did its ambition. In
1991, a nonprofit corporation independent of the tribe was
formed--the Agua Caliente Cultural Museum. With the support of the
tribal council and with funds raised at events such as the annual
Agua Caliente Heritage Festival, in 1995 the nonprofit built a small,
temporary museum in the city center.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, plans continued for a permanent site at Indian Canyons,
seven miles south of downtown Palm Springs. The square footage
allotted in the original plans has since quadrupled and an executive
director was hired. The architect's very eco-friendly plans are due
in September and the serious fund-raising is about to begin. Browne
is sharpening her scissors for the ribbon-cutting in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The "tribal elder" will tell the tribe's history through a series
of exhibits that feature photographs, videotaped testimonies and
other cultural artifacts. There will be an auditorium, space for
traveling exhibits, and an expansion of the current museum's
education programs in language, singing and crafts. The focus of the
museum, says Browne, is on the tribe's empowerment, not its
victimization. "This is what we are proud of, this is who we are."</TE>
<TE>   What remains of the past is very much part of the present. Older
Cahuillas still sing and teach the few remembered songs to the young.
The language class is well attended. And the tribal identity of
members, so bound to the land they have fought to keep, is stronger
than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of it as a loss," Browne says of all that has been
irretrievably forgotten. "Because we're not those Indians in a glass
case." The tribe is moving on. She tells a story of going up into the
mountains to gather acorns in a traditional manner. "It was hard
work, I tell you. I had those acorns drying on a blanket by the pool
and I knew I was supposed to grind them up and I kept looking and
looking at those acorns. In the end, I just thought, 'I've got so
many other things I want to do besides grinding acorns!'"</TE>
<TE>   Like creating a museum.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a freelance journalist for newspapers and magazines, I was
intrigued to read that former L.A. mayor Richard Riordan is planning
to fire up a new newspaper that will "respect its readers" ("His News
Will Be Fit to Print, Says Riordan," April 26).</LD>
<LD>   Too bad he doesn't respect his potential freelance writers.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to use a lot of freelancers," Riordan says. "There
are many good writers in Los Angeles, particularly in the movie
industry, and many of them would work for low rates to see their
stuff in print."</LD>
<TE>   Mr. Riordan, will your ad sales people be working for
less-than-reasonable wages? Will you be looking for that low-ball
offer from a printer who can cut a few corners and save you a few
bucks? Are you going to find some high-school kid with a camera to
take your photos? (Heck, maybe he can deliver the papers while he's
out and about. Such a deal!)</TE>
<TE>   Words are the backbone of a reputable paper, Mr. Riordan. It's a
professional's job to get them right. If you plan to sign on writers
with so little backbone or experience that they will gladly "work for
low rates to see their stuff in print," you have already told the
people of Los Angeles exactly how much respect you have for them.</TE>
<TE>   KATHY SENA</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I see that Richard Riordan plans to start another L.A. paper and,
in the process, will carry on a long, California tradition--the
exploitation of cheap labor. Good luck to Mr. Riordan in his quest
for "good writers in Los Angeles" who are willing to "work for low
rates to see their stuff in print." Quality writers, critical to the
success of any publication, deserve and require competitive wages.</TE>

sparked protests and angry phone calls to A&amp;F's corporate office to
pull the shirts off the shelves. Quite frankly, I don't understand
what all the fuss is about. I am a first-generation Chinese immigrant
myself, and I found those shirts hilariously funny. Those Asian
students need to worry more about their studies than protesting
something as trivial as this! I was bummed that I couldn't buy one; I
would have loved to wear it. People need to lighten up about these
things.</LD>

<TE>   I would like to thank Ms. Banks for pointing out something that
has bothered me for quite a while. I have chosen not to purchase
clothing from Abercrombie &amp; Fitch since a catalog came to our house
unsolicited, containing pages of drinking games and mixed-drink
recipes. I was not in high school yet. Even then, there was no
diversity among the models--they were everything I would never be:
blond, tan and white. As a mixed-race child, I would never fit that
image.</TE>
<TE>   Now, I hear Abercrombie &amp; Fitch is using "humor" to disguise the
racial and ethnic stereotyping that never really left us. I don't
understand how anyone can think it good business to make ethnic
stereotypes the focus of a marketing campaign. Some, unaware of my
mixed race, have said aloud that Asians are being overly sensitive or
trying to be troublemakers. Others want to know why we can't take a
joke. I can take a joke, but this isn't funny. This is the
continuation of the same attitudes that prevailed in the 1800s and
kept Asian immigrants from citizenship rights up to the 1950s. But I
suppose that would not be as "fun" to put on a T-shirt.</TE>

<TE>   Pulling its line of T-shirts that depict racist caricatures of
Asian Americans is not enough.</TE>
<TE>   The CEO of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch should publicly apologize for the
company's insensitive and racist depiction of Asian Americans and
make sure that no merchandise is to be designed in the future to
ridicule, stereotype or demean any particular race or group.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding the barrier at the end of Via Del Rey in South Pasadena, Al
Martinez makes it sound like the Berlin Wall ("A Barrier to Better
Living," April 29). It is nothing of the sort, just a bunch of
concrete blocks at the juncture of two streets, one in Los Angeles,
the other in South Pasadena. The only things blocked are cars and
trucks. People can freely walk, bike, or skate back and forth to
their heart's content, kids from both neighborhoods can play freely
together, and adults can "meld" as much as they want.</LD>
<LD>   The most important item Al conveniently neglected to mention is
that there is an elementary school on Via Del Rey, about a block from
the barrier, and the reduction in traffic affords a tremendous
measure of safety for the schoolchildren.</LD>
<LD>   Because other streets are open for vehicular traffic between the
two neighborhoods, Al's position that people are being kept out does
not hold water. I believe that because Al wrote on this as a racist
issue, it became one. Had he looked at it as a safety issue, and the
barrier as an impediment to car traffic only, he might have dropped
the subject.</LD>

<HD>Haute Vegan, With a Twist</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAWN HUBLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LARKSPUR, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Midweek, and they're elbow-to-elbow at Roxanne Klein's new
restaurant--people in suits, in caftans, in a huff in the
spice-fragrant doorway, muttering, "Why are we standing? Is there a
reason we're still standing? Is there a reason we can't sit while we
wait for our table to open up?"</LD>
<LD>   As a matter of fact, there is a reason. Every seat in the house is
taken. Even the barstools are full, from the nook where a balding man
with a self-help book wants asparagus soup to the wall where Alice
Waters' former personal assistant sits tete-a-tete with Klein's
organic gardener. It has been like this for weeks--the blinking phone
lines, the jostling in-crowds, the office manager telling foodie
after foodie that she's sorry, but Roxanne's is booked a month in
advance now.</LD>
<LD>   This, for a place where the specialty is uncooked fruits, nuts and
veggies.</LD>
<TE>   "The other day we came in, and there were 100 messages on the
answering machine," the incredulous chef-owner sighed.</TE>
<TE>   Who knew that the buzz of the West Coast fine-dining sector would
turn to a haute cuisine version of a regimen that even hard-core
vegetarians view as extreme? Tucked into the main street of this
leafy Marin County suburb, the 5-month-old Roxanne's has been packing
'em in, to competitors' amazement, with all-organic, all-vegan "raw"
foods--no meat, no fish, no eggs, no dairy and, above all, no stove
in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing is heated beyond 118 degrees, dehydrators and sunlight are
used instead of ovens, produce is just-picked and meals--presented on
her favorite high-end Bernardaud china, feature such ingredients as
"cheese" made from cashews and young coconut "noodles." It's a
concept that, attempted by other restaurateurs, has shown all the
mainstream appeal of a high colonic. Klein, however, has critics
raving.</TE>
<TE>   "Complex and voluptuous," said Food &amp; Wine magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't be surprised if some of these ideas start showing up on
other menus," said the Wine Spectator.</TE>
<TE>   "You may find it hard to suppress a gasp of delight," wrote
Michael Bauer, the San Francisco Chronicle's notoriously tough
restaurant critic, lauding the "miracle" of Klein's yellow curry
winter vegetables and whipped parsnips and her nut-milk ice creams,
which are "as good as those made with cream." The review--which set
off a veritable Bay Area stampede to the restaurant--gave Roxanne's a
rare 3 1/2 out of 4 stars.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a dizzying ascent for Klein, a 38-year-old mother and
stepmother to four, whose career has progressed in fits and starts
for more than 12 years. As recently as 1990, she was dropping out of
the California Culinary Academy just shy of graduation to have her
first baby; she would complete her degree four years later.</TE>
<TE>   Now Charlie Trotter, the Chicago chef, is writing a cookbook and
demonstrating techniques at major food industry shows with her. Ron
Siegel, who last year reopened San Francisco's classic French
stalwart, Masa's, says Roxanne's is not only "well-conceived" but
"more unique than I've seen in a long time." Even Marion Cunningham,
the culinary grand dame and friend of Chez Panisse's Waters, says she
is "anxious to eat there."</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's talking about it," Cunningham said, "and from what I
understand, it's a great surprise--people say it's really that good."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that's just the on-the-record part of what people are
saying. The other part has to do with the restaurant's unorthodox
business plan. Six years ago, the former Roxanne Sohns, the daughter
of Central Valley schoolteachers, married Michael Klein, a wealthy
environmental activist; they have announced that any profit she makes
will go to charities and environmental causes.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need the money, she says, walking through the garden
behind her new five-bedroom mansion and guest house, which are made
entirely of rammed Earth and recycled materials. "We're happy where
we're at, and so it gives us no greater joy than to give back to the
planet."</TE>
<TE>   That approach, praised by some, has confounded a whole other set
of critics--competitors who say that Klein's deep pockets make it
impossible to fairly compare her acclaim with that of restaurateurs
whose backers demand a return on their investments.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike others in the Bay Area's recession-strained restaurant
sector, they say, Klein has been able to afford top-quality
ingredients, moderate menu prices, decor that is both sumptuous and
ecologically friendly, time-consuming preparation methods and a staff
that reads like a roster of restaurant industry all-stars. Her chef
de cuisine is Stephanie Valentine, a former chef at Charlie
Trotter's. Michael Judge, her restaurant manager, opened three of the
Bay Area's highest-ranked destination restaurants--Masa's, Aqua and
Gary Danko. Her wine list was designed by Larry Stone of Rubicon, the
oenophiles' mecca in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Before opening, Klein and her husband researched their menu by
commissioning nine-course tasting menus from chefs across the nation,
including such luminaries as Trotter and the French Laundry's Thomas
Keller.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't pass real-world judgment on what she's doing," carped a
staffer at one top-tier restaurant who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Added another: "Comparing her to everybody else is like having a
race where one guy has a Porsche and everybody else has to ride a
bicycle. What they're doing is definitely interesting, but it's more
like philanthropy than running a restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   That observer, a chef, also wondered whether Klein would stick
with the grind of the business, given the fact that, financially, she
doesn't have to: "Have you ever worked in a kitchen 16 hours a day,
day after day after day after day?"</TE>
<TE>   In the health-food world, meanwhile, hard-core raw-food fans are
debating her essential raw-ness.</TE>
<TE>   "Her limit is 118 degrees?" sniffed Don Kidson of the Living
Lighthouse, a Santa Monica raw-food collective that hosts support
groups and living-foods potlucks. "How long is something going to
live at 118 degrees? Here, the dehydrators are set no higher than
105. She might as well be serving cooked food."</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention her inclusion of wine, which, Klein says, is
technically raw because the grapes aren't heated. "Alcohol kills
brain cells," Kidson noted. "I mean, need I say more?"</TE>
<TE>   Even Klein's fans aren't sure whether the project falls under the
category of "shockingly delicious" or whether the peg should be
"deliciously shocking."</TE>
<TE>   "No one can quite figure it out," says chef and Napa Valley winery
owner Maria Helm Sinskey, whose 1999 Sinskey Los Carneros Merlot is
on the extensive wine list. "They've created this working model to
work within luxury dining, and everyone who goes comes back saying
it's like an otherworldly experience. But the question is, where are
they going with it? What's their motive? Is this just one big dinner
party for their friends or is it a revolution?</TE>
<TE>   "It's just amazing, how young this restaurant is and how
controversial it's already become."</TE>
<TE>   Klein says she isn't sure how to feel about the attention. A tiny,
thin woman with the sort of porcelain skin and preternaturally clear
irises that imply a seriously toxin-free diet, she says she just
wants "to share my enthusiasm for organic produce and to express my
creativity."</TE>
<TE>   Her dream of opening a restaurant, she says, is anything but a
vanity project. Rather, it dates to her childhood, when she watched
Julia Child on TV instead of cartoons and was able, as a 4-year-old,
to sit through a two-hour meal in France during a family vacation.
She didn't become a vegetarian until she entered UC Santa Cruz, she
says. Even then, her commitment was on-and-off, particularly during
her culinary training. "I'm not doing this to be dogmatic," she said,
noting that she's not above the occasional finishing touch of
forbidden cocoa, maple syrup or 100-year-old balsamic vinegar. "This
is just my take on the most exciting, sensual way to prepare seasonal
food. I think of this as a fine-dining restaurant first."</TE>
<TE>   Klein's interest in raw food began about a year after she met her
current husband. Like her, he was a vegan when they were introduced
by a mutual friend in 1995. She was the divorced mother of a
4-year-old and had gotten her degree, interning at Stars in San
Francisco and apprenticing in kitchens in Provence. She was at a
crossroads, she says, weighing a move to Paris against a return to
California.</TE>
<TE>   "I had set my daughter up to go to school in France, but we were
back [in Marin County] for a visit with her father," she remembered.
"Some friends were trying to convince me to stay. I told them if they
found me a place with a big organic garden, I'd consider it."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly thereafter, she was introduced to Michael Klein, a retired
tech entrepreneur whose garden--on the former Corte Madera estate of
Bill Graham, the late music producer--covered three acres. Having
sworn after the sale of his last telecommunications company "never
again to work on something I didn't love," as he put it, Michael
Klein was serving on the board of the Rainforest Action Network and
running a guitar company founded by his friend, Grateful Dead
guitarist Bob Weir.</TE>
<TE>   "We went to a Grateful Dead concert, my first one," Roxanne Klein
recalled, laughing. The two were married a year later. Michael Klein
said they began talking almost immediately about a restaurant, but
the idea didn't take shape until 1996, during a trip with Weir and
actor Woody Harrelson to a spa in Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   "We were eating these curries," Roxanne Klein said, "and Woody
just kept having these green papaya salads. When I asked why he ate
that way, he said, 'Why don't you try it?'" The Kleins spent a month
on a raw-food diet, she said, "and when it ended, I couldn't believe
how great I felt. I needed two or three fewer hours of sleep a night,
I had so much energy."</TE>
<TE>   The experiment rekindled a childhood passion for garden-fresh
food, she said. "I'm a fifth-generation Californian," she said, "and
my grandparents were organic farmers--it was years and years before I
realized that some people bought food from stores. My grandpa used to
take me outside and say, 'What do you smell today?' And I'd say,
'Strawberries and peaches.' And he'd say 'OK, then. That's what's
ready to harvest.' And that sensual experience, of taking the peach
from the tree, and eating it fresh, and the perfume and the
juices--it all came back to me," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Though she was writing a book on vegetarian tasting menus at the
time, she says, she shelved the project in favor of restaurant
research, this time with a focus on raw--or as advocates call them,
"living"--foods. The regimen has moved in and out of fashion in the
health-food world, and was last in vogue in the mid-1990s. Raw-food
fans believe that crucial enzymes are destroyed if food is heated
past 118 degrees. (Conventional nutritionists say heat makes little
difference, though raw food is an important source of fiber and
nutrients.)</TE>
<TE>   Klein says she put herself on a sort of extended tutorial,
beginning at a San Francisco restaurant her sister had told her about
called Raw. Run by a then-24-year-old chef named Juliano Brotman who
wore his long blond hair in a topknot, the place featured standard
hippie-shack salads and smoothies, but also offered such unusual
dishes as "pizza" fashioned from sun-dried sprouted buckwheat. The
reviews--like those of most vegetarian eateries--were as tepid as the
"mock salmon" Brotman made from seawater and the dregs of juiced
carrots, but critics praised his innovation.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to blow my own horn, but before I got out there, there was
nothing but hummus and wheat grass," says Brotman, who now lives in
Santa Monica, where he hosts raw-food "raves." He runs a raw-food
delivery service and plans to open a raw-food restaurant in August.</TE>
<TE>   Klein says she paid Brotman to introduce her to the complex food
processing and dehydrating techniques that now characterize her
kitchen. Then she moved on to consult with more widely known chefs
such as Trotter, at whose restaurant Michael Klein had been a regular
for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "They came first for vegetarian food, then for vegan food, then
for raw food," Trotter said. When they requested a tasting menu from
him, he said, "it became an exciting intellectual challenge to come
up with all these possibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Over time, he said, he and Roxanne Klein exchanged ideas, and he
became convinced that her methods will become the next food wave.
Their book is scheduled for publication in January by Ten Speed
Press. Trotter says that, because Klein's food is as delicious as
food in any upscale restaurant, she will do for raw cuisine what
visionaries such as Waters did for organic produce. "Every once in a
while, people come along and what they do ends up not only being
embraced by the public, but copied by chefs around the country," said
Trotter. "That's what Roxanne is doing, whether or not she realizes
it."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone agrees. Siegel of Masa's says he has had "very
little" demand for raw food in his restaurants. And, he says, raw
preparation is vastly different from conventional techniques: "I
don't know if you're going to find a lot of restaurants who can
afford to do what they do."</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, however, there is Klein's food, which, in fact, is
extraordinary, from her take on pad thai--so complex and
mouthwatering that, on that midweek night, diners were trading
forkfuls of it in amazement--to her desserts, which taste the way
desserts did in childhood. Even Siegel, who prefers his food cooked,
is unsurprised by the rush to Roxanne's.</TE>
<TE>   "The public," he said, "is basically getting to benefit from her
situation. And the food really is good."</TE>

<LD>It surfaced, he says, as a "physical yearning," the year after his
lover died of AIDS. He needed to parent someone, to raise a child, to
create a family. His gay friends "thought I'd gone crazy" when he
began exploring adoption options. After all, he'd been diagnosed four
years earlier with HIV, and early death was then considered a
certainty.</LD>
<LD>   But he felt "like I just had to be a father," he says. So he
brushed off accusations of selfishness and concerns about longevity
and signed on as a foster parent with Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't care about gender or ethnicity or degree of health,"
says Robert, who is white and, at 52, still has the healthy good
looks of a man who is winning his battle with HIV. "I knew there was
no way I was going to be stealing a kid who was behind a white picket
fence with two parents, two cars, a dog and cat. I knew the odds were
I'd get a child that a lot of people didn't want." Two years later,
in 1995, Tina arrived.</LD>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine her today as a child that "a lot of people
wouldn't want." At 7, she is lively and beautiful, a rambunctious
girl with cocoa-colored skin, big dark eyes, a gentle manner and
incandescent smile. At her birth -- to a drug-addicted mother -- she
weighed less than 3 pounds and required a month in an incubator. When
she came to live with Robert as a foster child, she was 5 months old,
unsmiling, listless and withdrawn. He fell immediately in love.</TE>
<TE>   "There was never any agonizing," he recalls. "It was 'OK, great,
I've got a baby.'" He read baby books, went to parenting classes,
relied on his instincts for nurturing and on all he'd learned during
years spent caring for friends rendered helpless by AIDS. When he
applied to adopt Tina, officials marveled at how much progress she
had made.</TE>
<TE>   But the adoption was challenged by Tina's family, who objected,
Robert said, "to this white man raising their black child." Yet, her
mother had visited just one time in two years and none of her
relatives was able to take her; some because they were already
raising her siblings. So after months of hearings, home visits and
psychological tests, a judge ruled--just before Tina's third
birthday--that she should remain with Robert, and the adoption was
finalized.</TE>
<TE>   "By that time, there was no way I could have given her up," Robert
says now, as we watch Tina turn somersaults on his bed. "I was her
father. This was my child."</TE>
<TE>   Robert knows that their relationship is a sort of Rorschach test
for observers, one that breaks almost every taboo about parent and
child. He's a single, older, white, gay man who is HIV-positive; his
daughter is unmistakably black.</TE>
<TE>   For some, their pairing is an endorsement of gay adoption, and
Robert is the hero who rescued Tina from dysfunction and poverty. For
others, it is an indictment of a welfare system that parcels kids out
to suit political agendas, and Tina is being set up for a life of
confusion and grief.</TE>
<TE>   But the reality of their life is much simpler. "There's really
nothing exotic about us," Robert says, as Tina grabs a photo album
from his dresser and plops down on his lap to leaf through it.</TE>
<TE>   He drives carpool and makes macaroni and cheese for dinner. He
worries about the violence in Tina's favorite cartoons. He's learned
to braid hair and dress dolls. And when their cat needed stomach
surgery, to remove the remnants of a Barbie's chewed-off hand, Robert
spent $1,000 he couldn't afford "because I couldn't stand Tina's
tears when she asked 'Daddy, is the kitten going to die?'"</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, Tina is the quintessential, much-indulged, only
child of a doting single parent. The walls of their comfortable
apartment are covered with her drawings. The shelves in her bedroom
are lined with books, games and stuffed animals. Her bed has a frilly
comforter with matching pillows and pictures of pretty brown girls on
the walls. She has traveled around the country with her father, an
actor. At home, she takes gymnastics and swimming lessons.</TE>
<TE>   She does well in school, though her teachers say she sometimes has
trouble paying attention. Is that because of exposure to her mother's
drugs or the influence of her hyperactive dad? Robert smiles and
shrugs.</TE>
<TE>   "She's extremely strong-willed, controlling and restless. But then
so am I," he says. "She's loud, I'm loud. She's opinionated, I'm
opinionated. She's funny, I'm funny. We're cut from the same cloth.
And ultimately, we understand each other."</TE>
<TE>   There is something captivating about his obvious affection for
this child, and something endearing about the simplicity of her love
for him. And yet it is hard not to ask the question: Is this really
the best life Tina could have, with a single man whose lifestyle
draws disapproval in some quarters, a father with an illness that may
take his life?</TE>
<TE>   Robert wrestles with that question himself, as he struggles to
answer questions most fathers never face: Why can't I have a mom? Why
do you take all those medicines every day? If you're my dad, why
aren't I half white?</TE>
<TE>   "Do I think it would be better if Tina was in a family where there
was a mother and a father? Probably yes," he says. "But what was the
likelihood of that? ... And what constitutes the perfect family?"</TE>
<TE>   Tina understands that her dad is gay, that there is no mommy in
their future, that her mother was sick because of drugs and wasn't
able to care for her. Robert, who is in good health, has not yet
explained about adoption or HIV. And yes, he worries about dying,
about leaving Tina, about complicating his daughter's
already-unconventional life. "I think about it every single day. I'm
not guilt-free. I agonize."</TE>
<TE>   But he does not apologize. "I guess people will just have to say
I'm selfish. I'll cop to that," he says. "But she had a huge question
mark hanging over her when she came into the world. Many worse
scenarios could have confronted her than the possibility that we
don't get as long [together] as we wish we had. No parent knows how
long they'll be here. I could get hit by a car tomorrow. So could
you."</TE>
<TE>   He has made provisions for her in the event of his death, but life
right now is his main concern. "I know I'm not perfect, but I think
I'm a pretty good parent. And I know she's a wonderful kid," he says,
as Tina lies in bed watching Pokemon cartoons, sucking her thumb,
twisting a strand of hair. "The ultimate thing is I keep her safe, I
love her, I feed her, I don't let her down, I teach her right from
wrong, good from bad.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how she'll feel when she's older. I'm sure there'll
be a period, 10 years or so from now, when she resents me, when she
says 'Why'd you do this to me?' I know that because I did that to my
parents.</TE>
<TE>   "By the time she comes through that, I probably won't be alive.
But I think she'll go 'Wow, look at the life we had, how interesting
it was.' And eventually she'll reconcile it....That's the part of me
that believes this was a good thing.''</TE>
<TE>   That like him, she'll have no regrets.</TE>

<LD>When a glass toppled from a waiter's tray at last week's star-studded
fete for Army Archerd, it was the guest of honor who rushed to pick
up the pieces. Those Eagle Scout manners have been the Hollywood
columnist's stock in trade since he started writing for Daily Variety
in 1953. "Army still gets more excited about a scoop than reporters
half his age. He's the lord of the zings and he always gets it
right," said Variety editor Peter Bart in his tribute to the man
whose three-dot column is as much a part of Tinseltown history as the
Oscar.</LD>
<LD>   The scene on the Beverly Hilton's red carpet was a paparazzi
paradise as many of the stars Archerd has chronicled for five decades
arrived for the black-tie dinner and show, which raised more than $1
million for his favorite charity, the Kayne-Eras Center, a Culver
City-based educational facility for developmentally impaired children
and adults. Southern California Children's Varieties donated a van to
the center on behalf of Army and his wife, Selma.</LD>
<TE>   The evening event, held April 26 and sponsored by the
Entertainment Industry Foundation, Mercedes-Benz and Harry Winston,
drew a packed house. Guests included Julie Andrews, Ed Begley Jr.,
Jacqueline Bisset, Garth Brooks, Red Buttons, Tony Danza, Peter Falk,
Larry Gelbart, Merv Griffin, Quincy Jones, Joe Mantegna, Reba
McEntire, Sidney Poitier, Carl Reiner, Tom Selleck, Rod Steiger, Jack
Valenti, Jon Voight, Dennis Weaver, Esther Williams, Michael York.
Regis Philbin came from New York to emcee the event, which was
co-chaired by Charlie Koones, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Tom Sherak and
Bart, who surprised Archerd with the keys to a new Mercedes.</TE>
<TE>   Columnists Liz Smith, Bob Osborne and Cindy Adams sent their
messages via video: "I steal from Army almost every day," Smith said.
"He's always first with everything; it's absolutely infuriating."
Julie Andrews crooned her tribute, "We've Grown Accustomed to His
Space."</TE>
<TE>   But, it was Archerd who made eyes misty with his adaptation of
"Thanks for the Memory": For 50 years of friends through all those
fashion trends; starting out with boxer shorts and ending in Depends;
for the gifted ones, the lifted ones, for friends both straight and
gay and gods with feet of clay. Thank you so much.</TE>

<TE>   Library Awards</TE>
<TE>   Americans can take heart, author David McCullough told the
gathering at the Los Angeles Public Library: There are still many
more libraries in this country than there are McDonald's. And he
added, "What better symbol is there of our independence?"</TE>
<TE>   The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer was on hand to receive the
library's annual Literary Award. His longtime friend, John F. Cooke,
chairman of the library foundation, presented McCullough the Tiffany
crystal sculpture in front of a sold-out crowd at the library's
seventh annual awards dinner April 23 at the downtown Central
Library. McCullough joins a distinguished roster of past honorees:
E.L. Doctorow, Louise Erdrich, Seamus Heaney, John Updike, Doris
Kearns Goodwin and Carlos Fuentes.</TE>
<TE>   Also honored at the event was Joni Smith, founding president of
the Council of the Library Foundation, which has raised more than $3
million since it was launched in 1995. Smith was presented the Light
of Learning Award by city librarian Susan Kent. The library's
Corporate Philanthropy award was presented to Farmers Insurance
Group, which has been a major sponsor of the library since 1993.
Martin D. Feinstein, chief executive of Farmers, accepted the award
from Lucy McCoy, president of the board of library commissioners.</TE>
<TE>   After the ceremonies, more than 300 guests dined on Peggy Dark's
bill of fare at tables arranged on levels of the library's
eight-story atrium. Kathleen Brown chaired the dinner, which raised
$230,000, to be shared by the 67 branches citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Among library supporters assembled were Flora L. Thornton, Jane
Ackerman, Nancy and Michael Harahan, Anissa and Paul Balson, Evelyn
Hoffman, Laura and Robert Chick, Mickey and Gordon Bodek, Tory and
Bob Brant, Sandra and Ralph Casillas, Robert Cotten, Teri and Dan
Floyd, Tom and Rose Ann Frank, Howard Gould, Anne and Jeff Grausam,
Dean Hansell, Maidee and Arnold Kirkeby, Rita and Klaus Liebelt and
Celeste and Thomas McLain.</TE>

<TE>   Geffen, Backstage</TE>
<TE>   From Bruce Vilanch's encounter with Tallulah Bankhead's gastric
distress, to George Segal's tale of George C. Scott's onstage
"spitting," to Peter Falk's ill-starred campaign for an Oscar, the
stars shared their professional peaks and peccadilloes at "Backstage
at the Geffen," the Westwood theater's inaugural fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Alexander and Annette Bening served as honorary co-chairs of
the April 22 event, which began with Tanino's alfresco buffet
followed by a string of anecdotes and dramatizations. David Hyde
Pierce offered a tribute to his former Geffen co-star Uta Hagen; Neil
Simon told of a frustrating ordeal with a ham actor; Alexander and
Bening teamed up on an excerpt from David Ives' "All in the Timing."
Alfre Woodard, Martin Short, Rita Wilson, Dana Delany and Peter
Bonerz brought down the house with a scene from Christopher Durang's
"The Actor's Nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   Others on the bill included Richard Benjamin, Kevin Kilner, Amy
Pietz and Kevin Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Gil Cates produced and David Pence and Pamela Robinson co-chaired
the event, which raised $165,000.</TE>

<TE>   Laughs by Leno</TE>
<TE>   Tossing out irreverent one-liners as fast as the audience could
catch them, comedian Jay Leno made his premiere appearance at the
Orange County Performing Arts Center during a benefit for its
education fund.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what we can do about Osama bin Laden--send over Anna
Nicole Smith; she'll get his money and he'll be dead in a week," Leno
quipped, as he began his stand-up routine in Segerstrom Hall in front
of a 2,500-strong crowd. In an 80-minute show laced with the
late-night TV talk show host's trademark deadpans, Leno railed
against new airline security measures ("They take my nose clippers;
anyone who has seen terrorists knows they don't use nose clippers")
to automobile innovations ("They're talking about installing
microwaves; can't you see someone [on their cell] yelling, "Gotta go!
My souffle's burning!") to health-care costs ("You think it's
expensive? Wait till it's free!").</TE>
<TE>   After the show, donors to the center who paid $3,000 per couple,
schmoozed onstage with Leno before enjoying a buffet supper and
dancing to a jazz quartet. Proceeds of about $79,000 from the April
27 event will go toward the center's arts education programs, said
center President Jerry Mandel.</TE>

<TE>   Human Options</TE>
<TE>   In a reminder of the reason they had gathered, guests at a benefit
to raise funds for victims of domestic violence watched a performance
by the Stop Gap drama company on the life stages of abuse victims.
More than 400 supporters gathered for the benefit, which raised
$225,000 for Human Options, a nonprofit providing housing and
counseling for abused women and children in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Honored at the April 27 event at the Four Seasons in Newport Beach
were the builders of the organization's Safe House for Kids and Moms:
Costain Homes, HomeAid Orange County, Lennar Homes, Shea Homes and
Steton Construction.</TE>
<TE>   The benefit was co-chaired by Steve and Susan Giusto.</TE>

profession and their communities. Net proceeds of $92,000 from the
April 25 event will go toward the organization's programs in the
areas of hate-crime and anti-bias, and anti-prejudice education. The

<LD>Erik was staying with Grandma and Grandpa at their farm and one
morning he helped feed the animals. "Grandpa, can I have a pet for my
own?"</LD>
<LD>   "If you find an animal that needs you," Grandpa said as they
passed the brown cow brushing her calf with her tongue.</LD>
<LD>   "That's easy," Erik said, and he ran to the henhouse. A black hen
walked around with 12 fuzzy yellow chicks. Erik leaped toward them.</LD>
<TE>   The black hen squawked and the chicks ran underneath her. Erik
caught one chick and held it to his cheek. "Cheep, cheep, cheep." It
struggled.</TE>
<TE>   Its mother spread her wings and ran toward him. "Craw, craw,
CRAW." He put down the chick and ran.</TE>
<TE>   Erik then went to the rabbit hutch. A big white rabbit lay sunning
herself. Her baby bunnies walked around her. Erik offered the mother
a piece of clover. She twitched her nose and took it. Then he opened
the hutch. The bunnies ran to the corner. Erik grabbed a fuzzy brown
bunny that wiggled and screamed, "Keeee!" Its mother turned tail to
Erik and kicked him. Erik let go and closed the hutch. Didn't any
animal want him?</TE>
<TE>   "They would want me if it weren't for their mothers," Erik told
Grandpa.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you're right," Grandpa nodded. "Let's get hay for the cow."</TE>
<TE>   When Grandpa opened the barn door Erik heard a "baa, baa."</TE>
<TE>   Two little lambs--a black one and a white one--came running to
him.</TE>
<TE>   He held out his hand. The black one took his finger and started
sucking. "They're hungry, Grandpa."</TE>
<TE>   "Go ask Grandma for their breakfast."</TE>
<TE>   Grandma gave Erik two plastic soda bottles filled with milk and
with rubber nipples on them. The lambs came running eagerly. After
Erik finished feeding them they followed him and poked him with their
black noses.</TE>
<TE>   "Grandpa, they need me. They want to be my pets!" Then Erik said,
"Won't their mothers mind?"</TE>
<TE>   "They lost their mothers, Erik, and need you to take care of
them."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll take good care of them!" Erik rubbed one fuzzy white head
and put his arm around the woolly black neck of the other.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to call one Salt and the other one Pepper."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Author's note: Springtime is when new baby animals are born on the
farm. Sometimes a ewe dies and humans must feed and take care of her
lambs just as Erik does in this story.</TE>

<AU>WILLIAM M. ARKIN</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a senior fellow at the Johns
Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and an
adjunct professor at the U.S. Air Force School of Advanced Airpower
Studies. He is also a consultant to a number of nongovernmental
organizations.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Just before plans for military action against Iraq began issuing from
the Bush administration last month in a shower of leaks, the Defense
Intelligence Agency (DIA) produced a place-mat-size volume laying out
the most up-to-date information on Saddam Hussein's capabilities.</LD>
<LD>   The classified study, "Iraq--An Operational Support Study," is a
gold mine of maps and data on geography, roads, refineries,
communications facilities, security organizations and military
deployments. Even after 11 years of sanctions and fairly regular U.S.
bombing in the no-fly zones, the document paints an impressive
picture of Iraq's assets. Though the DIA study is not a target list,
it does present a huge menu of potential targets. "The target list in
Iraq is humongous, some would say egregious," said a senior naval
intelligence officer who has worked in the Saudi-based Combined Air
Operations Center.</LD>
<LD>   The DIA report clearly presents toppling Hussein's regime as a
challenge so formidable that only tremendous military resources could
accomplish it. Not surprisingly, that analysis exactly fits the war
plan emerging from Gen. Tommy Franks' U.S. Central Command (CentCom)
in Florida: The plan assumes the worst for the United States and
posits a massive ground invasion by the Army's "heavy" tank and
mechanized infantry divisions.</LD>
<TE>   Predictably, Franks' proposal has sparked criticism among the
other armed services. But what is at stake goes beyond traditional
interservice rivalry. How a war against Iraq is fought will affect
how it ends, and what the near- and long-term costs are for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, some senior officials say, ignores the 21st century
reality of the U.S. military and misreads what happened during the
1991 Gulf War. Those expressing reservations include some senior
Defense Department officials, civilians who are not tied to any
individual service. In recent days, even a senior Army officer has
begun raising questions about the size of the anticipated ground
force.</TE>
<TE>   When a prospective Iraq war strategy first circulated within a
tight circle in CentCom earlier this year, it called for a full-scale
ground campaign with the goal of "regime change" in Baghdad. That was
to be achieved by a combination of brute force and a hoped-for rising
up of the Iraqi people and military commanders against Saddam.</TE>
<TE>   The plan, which seemed not to consider America's advantages and
Baghdad's accumulated weaknesses, struck critics as simplistic and
myopic. Three of the four subordinate commands within CentCom--the
Air Force, the Navy and the Marines--took the unprecedented step of
expressing alarm at a CentCom meeting at Ramstein Air Base in Germany
last month.</TE>
<TE>   The first version of the plan emerged in February of this year
when Franks and the Army commander at CentCom, Lt. Gen. Paul
Mikolashek, presented a briefing during a secure video
teleconference. Mikolashek is commander of the U.S. Third Army, which
is currently responsible for all conventional and special operations
forces on the ground in Afghanistan and would take the lead against
Iraq under the Franks plan.</TE>
<TE>   The plan presented by Franks and Mikolashek envisioned five
divisions (some 150,000 troops) and five aircraft carriers launching
simultaneous ground and air attacks into southern Iraq. According to
senior officers in the initial briefings, the plan rested on two
major assumptions: that the war would be predominantly an armor
battle with aircraft supporting land forces; and that Saudi Arabia
would not let U.S. forces use bases on its soil. Hence the plan
largely excluded land-based air forces.</TE>
<TE>   Launching ground and air attacks simultaneously--instead of
leading off with a substantial air assault first to soften up Iraqi
defenses--would produce shock and awe in enemy forces, according to
early briefing documents. "It was a lead-with-your-chin, ground-only
war," a senior officer not in the Army said. But, he added, "The only
shock and awe inspired was the 'you gotta be [kidding] me' look" it
evoked in critics.</TE>
<TE>   The Franks plan clearly ignored successful elements of the last
three major U.S. military campaigns: Iraq in 1991, Kosovo and
Afghanistan. The heart of all those engagements was exploiting
"asymmetrical advantages." That is, making maximum use of fighting
capabilities in which the United States is strong and the enemy weak.
In Iraq, Kosovo and Afghanistan, that meant using air power and
high-tech weaponry to attack key "strategic" targets while also using
bombs and ground troops to attack enemy forces directly.</TE>
<TE>   As initially presented, the Iraq attack plan not only excluded
initial bombing to soften Iraqi defenses; it also did not consider
alternate strategies to destroy suspected weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   After the unveiling, Franks was quizzed about the practicalities:
How could short-range aircraft from carriers sustain the necessary
operations? How could a campaign of such magnitude be waged without
land-based aerial refueling? How would persistent reconnaissance and
surveillance of Iraq be provided without significant Air Force assets
on the ground?</TE>
<TE>   The assumption that Saudi Arabia would not allow the U.S. to use
bases there was also questioned. To many officers, and to senior
Defense Department officials, it is inconceivable that the White
House would assault Iraq without Saudi Arabia at least acquiescing.
At a minimum, that would include using Saudi bases for such support
operations as aerial refueling, surveillance and air defense. What is
more, some were baffled by CentCom's disregard of air assets already
on the ground in Kuwait, in Gulf states such as Qatar and Oman, in
Turkey and in the Indian Ocean region.</TE>
<TE>   Still, advocacy of the basic plan, with its reliance on "heavy"
ground forces, has persisted. By March, Franks had been persuaded to
open the campaign with an air assault. But he limited such an assault
to 60 hours. AC-130 gunships and a handful of A-10s operating from
Kuwait were also incorporated into the plan in order to offer close
air support for ground troops, "on a very short and tight tether
controlled by the Army," a senior officer said.</TE>
<TE>   As planning continued into April, the internal questioning
continued too. "How can you have shock and awe and deploy such a
massive ground force at the same time?" one officer asked. Though the
Army has positioned tanks and armored vehicles in Kuwait and Qatar,
deployment of large numbers of troops could not be kept secret and
might well provoke an Iraqi response.</TE>
<TE>   Officers and civilian officials also are stymied by the close
relationship Franks has developed with Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld. One effect of the Rumsfeld-Franks relationship is that Air
Force Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
is excluded from much discussion. And the service chiefs, ostensibly
the senior military advisors for the Defense secretary and the
president, have less opportunity to provide input.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, sources say, the emerging Iraq plan was never officially
brought into "the tank," the Joint Chiefs' super-secure meeting room,
for a discussion among the heads of all the services.</TE>
<TE>   Many uncertainties remain. One central idea of the plan, for
example, is that as they work their way northward on the ground,
"indigenous forces" will rise to support the invaders. But the plan's
critics wonder what will happen if they do not rise, or if they prove
ineffective. Would that, a senior Defense Department official asked
in raising some of the nightmarish possibilities, mean "grinding
urban warfare? Attacks with chemicals or biological agents?" "If
these are truly concerns, one might want to construct a war strategy
to minimize those eventualities, not one that plays into them, even
encourages them to emerge," this official said.</TE>
<TE>   If there's a silver lining to the parochialism and lack of
imagination in the Franks/Mikolashek plan, it is the search it has
provoked for creative alternatives. "If placement of a U.S. corps in
Kuwait provokes the Republican Guards to deploy to the desert and
prepare the defense of Basra, I say, great, come on down," a senior
Air Force officer said, noting that then 21st century airpower could
once again be employed to bomb a hapless army stuck in 20th century
trenches.</TE>
<TE>   Another alternative would be to use Special Forces and air power
to pinpoint Iraqi military and other assets and destroy them one by
one. That, some believe, could force the Iraqi army to choose between
continued support for Hussein and its own survival. Faced with such a
choice, Republican Guards and other army units might bring about a
regime change themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Franks plan, there is no credible notion of how regime
change occurs, making any war's likely ultimate destination urban
fighting in the Baghdad megalopolis. The final objective would be
U.S. occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Would occupation be such a terrible outcome? In reality, it might
be the only way to guarantee removal of weapons of mass destruction
and avoid a worse-than-Saddam outcome. But in the world of military
planning, such an eventuality is not even conceived.</TE>
<TE>   Preoccupied with divisions marching here and there--against an
overrated foe--Franks and his planners do not make the connection
between how the United States fights and what the outcome might be.</TE>

<KH>MIDDLE EAST</KH>
<HD>The New Comeback Kid</HD>
<DH>After years on the outside, Sharon shines brightly in
Bush's Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY ARONSON</AU>
<BD>Geoffrey Aronson is director of the Foundation for
Middle East Peace.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- For many years after his forced resignation as defense
minister for his role in the massacre of Palestinians at the Lebanese
refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila, Ariel Sharon was persona non
grata in the halls of American power. He and the first President
Bush's secretary of State, James A. Baker III, shared a particular
antagonism. Even as Baker urged Israel to "give up the dream of a
'Greater Israel,'" Sharon, then minister of housing and construction
in the government of Yitzhak Shamir, instigated and supervised the
construction of additional Israeli settlements in the occupied West
Bank.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon's rehabilitation in Washington began with his appointment
as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's foreign minister. In November
1997, he met with President Clinton's national security advisor,
Samuel R. "Sandy" Berger, at the White House. With his ubiquitous
maps in tow, Sharon acknowledged that a Palestinian state was
inevitable and tried to win the Clinton administration to his plan
for such a state in approximately half of the West Bank and most of
the Gaza Strip.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli daily Haaretz, quoting "a senior Clinton
administration official," reported Nov. 28, 1997, that Berger was
"impressed by the meeting. Sharon appeared pragmatic and moderate."</LD>
<TE>   Sharon's star, however, has never shone more brightly than it does
in George W. Bush's Washington in the spring of 2002. Along with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Sharon is one of the U.S.
president's most ardent proponents of the war on terrorism and the
associated antipathy toward the "axis of evil" residing in Baghdad,
Tehran and Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   Recollection of the problems that Sharon has created for
Washington over the years is absent from both the institutional and
personal memories of those who rule, and those who advise them. Bush
has given every indication that he is content to see Sharon mold the
agenda of the post-Oslo era according to his preferences, just as
Clinton deferred to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's vision at Oslo in
1993. Even after Sharon deployed 75,000 soldiers in the West Bank, an
action resulting in unprecedented ruin there, the utterly improbable
word from Bush was: "I do believe Ariel Sharon is a man of peace."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, in contrast, long
ago exhausted what little goodwill remained toward him in the U.S.
capital. Arafat "never earned my trust," Bush declared April 6,
"because he hasn't performed." Arafat's irredeemable predicament in
Washington goes far deeper than a simple failure to accommodate
Bush's preferences.</TE>
<TE>   Notwithstanding the Bush administration's efforts to free him from
his virtual imprisonment in Ramallah, Arafat is still an object of
the kind of reflexive derision reserved only for leaders considered
political pariahs. The 1994 Nobel Peace Prize winner is neither
respected nor feared. Discussion centers on his well-deserved
political demise, not through the ballot box--where he remains more
popular than ever--but by American or Israeli fiat, because he is no
longer able to contribute to the "peace process."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat suffers from his association with the Oslo peace process,
which the leading defense and strategic thinkers in the Bush
administration have long derided because of their opposition to
Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories. As the most
frequent foreign visitor to the Clinton White House, Arafat is
further compromised by his association with what the Bush people
regard as Clinton's squandering of the powers of the presidency in
his unsuccessful pursuit of an Israeli-Arab peace. Even as they
excoriate the Oslo process for its tilt against Israel, they view
Arafat's refusal of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's "generous
offer" during the July 2000-January 2001 period as indicative of the
diplomatic dead end that any negotiation with him promises.</TE>
<TE>   On the grander strategic horizon now dominated by the war on
terrorism and the impending rematch against Iraq's Saddam Hussein,
the Palestinians, and to a greater degree than ever the Arab world as
a whole, have at best a minor, supporting role to play. Among those
Bush administration officials who matter, Arafat and his cohorts
could never be "partners" on a par with their Israeli antagonists in
this campaign.</TE>
<TE>   At best, Arafat, faced with the stark choice of joining or
opposing Washington, must be neutralized as a contributor to regional
instability, in the Palestinian territories and throughout the
region. At worst, Washington might conclude, as Sharon has, that
Arafat and the institutions he represents are beyond redemption and
therefore dispensable. The Bush administration came close to such a
decision in January 2002, after Israel's interception of an
arms-laden ship established a connection between the Palestinian
leadership and Tehran. U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's
visit to the region in early April was viewed by an audience as
diverse as former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and the
clutch of young advisors around Arafat as America giving Arafat a
last chance to accommodate the president's demand to condemn terror.</TE>
<TE>   When Bush strategists look at a map of the Middle East today,
their eyes are drawn to the Persian Gulf. Only reluctantly can they
be compelled to focus on the Palestinian area and its interminably
warring parties, not because they have any hopes for rapprochement
between Sharon and Arafat but because of their concern that the
violence between Israel and the Palestinians will spill over and
engage Iraq and Jordan as well as Syria and Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   For the administration, even as it plans an international peace
conference, the Arab-Israeli conflict is a black hole of frustrated
expectations. Indeed, the ongoing conflict between Israel and the
Palestinians is viewed by many in the Bush administration as a
distraction, a strategic sideshow to the main event that will
determine the region's future: the fall of Hussein. They are more
than happy to dump this time-consuming, exhausting and thankless
portfolio into the lap of a reluctant Powell, who on Afghanistan and
Iraq has been a voice of relative moderation, while they attend to
the successful application of U.S. military power around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   Powell appears to understand the stakes of the contest Israel is
waging with the Palestinians. He has steered the Bush administration
in the direction of acknowledging the advantages of Palestinian
independence, one decade after the first Bush administration
promised, in its "letters of assurance" to the government of Yitzhak
Shamir, that it opposed the creation of such a state.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Powell is contending with two aged leaders who detest each
other, who are merciless in pursuit of their objectives and who are
determined to squeeze every centimeter of advantage out of their
antagonists. He is trapped not only by the deference Sharon enjoys in
Washington but also by the Israeli view that the partnership with
Arafat, sealed at Oslo, is at an end.</TE>
<TE>   And if this were not enough, Powell must also deal with a
commander in chief and a domestic political culture whose most
authentic sentiments favor Sharon's war against Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's benevolent attitude toward the Sharon
government has been extraordinary even when measured against the
history of close cooperation and friendship between the U.S. and
Israel. Over the last year it has watched with detached interest as
Sharon dismantled the basic foundations of the Oslo process--in which
the U.S. is involved as a signatory and key benefactor.</TE>
<TE>   The concern prompting Powell's sudden departure to the region in
April was not Israel's destruction of the Palestinian Authority,
which the U.S. had long observed with relative magnanimity, but the
threat that Sharon's assault would trigger regional deterioration.</TE>
<TE>   "Within two or three days after [the Israeli] incursions began,"
explained Powell on April 9, "the [U.S.] embassies started making us
aware of how this was affecting the street and how it was affecting
the leaders in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw things that we had never, ever expected to see--the car
burnings in Bahrain, half a million people [rallying] in Morocco,
demonstrations in Egypt. Again, today, there were demonstrations.
These things cause us concern [because] this was no longer just a
clash between two parties in the occupied territories but something
that was spilling way outside that caldron, and affecting not only
U.S. interests but Israeli interests, and in rather permanent ways in
the long term."</TE>
<TE>   Powell has so far succeeded in preventing a wider conflict between
Israel and the Arabs. In this effort, he was aided by a charter
member of the axis of evil--Iran--which counseled restraint along
Israel's northern frontier to its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah. Sharon
and Arafat, on the other hand, refused to act according to U.S.
preferences, which depend on a framework of relations that the two
leaders have conspired to destroy.</TE>
<TE>   All sides are prepared to grasp at the convening of the
international conference, not so much because anyone believes that it
will produce peace between Israel and its Arab antagonists but rather
because it solves other, more immediate problems. The Sharon
government views the parley as reducing pressure to engage the
Palestinians directly in substantive diplomacy. Arafat is eager to
reaffirm that he remains the interlocutor for Palestinian interests.
The Bush administration and the Saudis are keen to be seen as doing
something to keep the conflict from plunging the entire region into a
maelstrom of violence and discontent. The proposed conference may
well achieve all these aims without Israel and the Palestinians
addressing the issues at the heart of their bloody contest.</TE>

<DH>With police morale and numbers down, L.A. gangs have a free
pass--and they know it. The result is a big increase in homicides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CELESTE FREMON</AU>
<BD>Celeste Fremon is the author of "Father Greg and the
Homeboys."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In this season where much attention is focused on counting the dead
in far-off places like Israel, the West Bank and Afghanistan--all
important reckonings, to be sure--perhaps it is time that we also
begin to consider the dead closer to home, where there is an alarming
spike in gang homicides.</LD>
<LD>   Since January 2000--when the murder toll really began to
climb--through March of this year, we have buried 780 victims of gang
violence in the city of Los Angeles, most of them young. If the trend
continues, the figure will hit 1,000 for the three-year period ending
in December 2002--a 100% increase over the previous three-year
period.</LD>
<TE>   Among the reasons that have been cited for this rash of deaths are
the breakdown of gang truces in South Los Angeles and disarray in the
leadership of the Mexican Mafia, which once exerted control over most
Eastside gangs. Those who work directly with at-risk youth believe
that the reasons are far more fundamental. Ending gang violence, they
say, involves a tri-pronged approach of prevention, intervention and
suppression. Prevention means giving the younger kids alternatives so
that they never join gangs in the first place. Intervention involves
helping gang members redirect their lives using strategies like jobs,
education and mentoring programs. Suppression, the task of law
enforcement, ideally keeps everyone involved alive until the other
two approaches can kick in.</TE>
<TE>   Father Gregory Boyle, executive director of Jobs for a Future and
Homeboy Industries, simplifies the equation even further: "You need
heat and light." Light comes from organizations like Boyle's that
specialize in providing hope for kids to whom hope is foreign. Heat
is a respectful, dignified vigilance provided by appropriate
policing.</TE>
<TE>   Of late, the necessary "light" has gotten harder and harder to
come by. The aftermath of Sept. 11 ate up donations to most nonprofit
gang-intervention programs at the same time California's economy took
a nosedive. Unemployment figures began to climb, with joblessness for
inner-city youth climbing the highest. Yet, if we are experiencing a
crisis of light--which experts like Boyle say we are--the crisis in
the heat department is of even more calamitous proportions.</TE>
<TE>   A quick example: The Hollenbeck Division of the LAPD serves a
15.2-square-mile area of East L.A. that, over the last decade, has
seen the highest level of gang activity in the city. Under normal
circumstances, according to division insiders, Hollenbeck operates
with a baseline of about 150 officers. After the Rampart scandal
broke, officers weary of being painted with the Rampart brush fled to
outlying police forces like those of Montebello, Santa Ana, Burbank
and Anaheim, leaving Hollenbeck, its staff reports, with only 86
officers. Officially, the LAPD contends that the number is far
higher. But privately, officers say official numbers are inflated by
such methods as counting officers on permanent sick or disability
leave.</TE>
<TE>   Anecdotal observations from residents in the Hollenbeck area and
others in L.A.'s poorest and most crime-ridden communities support
the officers' assertion that the department has a huge staffing
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be you'd drive down the street and you'd see a car
every few minutes," said Jose Corrales, 24, a former homeboy who
currently attends Rio Hondo College. "These days you hardly see a
car, and you never see them in the housing projects. A lot of my
homeboys who are still out on the street are glad at the lack of
police presence. But I'm the father of two little kids now, so I want
enough officers out there to protect and serve."</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the drop in policing can be best quantified by
comparing Hollenbeck's murder rate with that of unincorporated East
Los Angeles, an area with around half the population (128,000 to
Hollenbeck's nearly 200,000) but virtually the same demographics. The
main difference is that unincorporated East L.A. is served by the
L.A. County Sheriff's Department, which is operating with a full
complement of officers in all units. Overall, countyside East L.A.
had five homicides last year, while Hollenbeck had 38--or nearly five
times the murder rate per capita.</TE>
<TE>   Matters are exacerbated by the intensified demands made on the
department since Sept. 11 and by recent city budget cuts. "So now,
when things get bad, cops don't roll out the way they used to because
there's so little money for overtime," said one detective. He
recalled a day last year when there were four homicides in one
division. "On two of them, paramedics had to be called to remove the
bodies because we didn't have enough officers to protect the crime
scenes."</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, officers on the street have become reluctant to
intercede in gang-related affairs. "Right now there is almost no
proactive enforcement," said Mary Ridgway, gang consultant and
probation supervisor for the L.A. County Probation Department. "For
one thing, morale is terrible because, after Rampart, Chief [Bernard
C.] Parks set up a complaint system that didn't distinguish between
bogus complaints and real ones." Officers across the board complain
that post-Rampart discipline has become chaotic and arbitrary. It is,
officers say, as if Parks admitted that the department had cancer but
instead of surgically removing the malignancy he gave the entire rank
and file chemotherapy--then wondered why everybody got sick.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD is an organization that relies on pride and esprit de
corps," said Ridgway. "And that's completely broken down. As a
result, there are whole numbers of cops that rarely make arrests,
rarely make stops. They just ride around and wave at people. It's
really gotten that bad."</TE>
<TE>   This is not to suggest that the LAPD should return to the awful
old days when Rafael Perez and company were planting guns on suspects
and beating the living daylights out of homeboys. However, when the
underregulated anti-gang CRASH units were dismantled, it was widely
hoped they'd be replaced by a system that involved seasoned officers
who got to know the neighborhoods they served. Instead, Ridgway said,
"when the new gang unit was formed, the selection criterion was such
that it all but eliminated officers with prior gang experience. So
suddenly you had no knowledgeable cops working gangs, no one who knew
the players and relationships."</TE>
<TE>   "With gang policing, knowing the players makes all the
difference," Boyle says. An emblematic example of this principle was
demonstrated at 8 p.m. March 5 when Cesar Gomez, 21, was shot four
times in the chest, once through the heart, in the doorway of the
Aliso Pico Recreation Center in front of 100 kids and parents who had
gathered to watch a girls basketball tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez was shot by two rival gang members who had been seen by
various residents loitering uneasily in nearby Pecan Park throughout
much of the day. Experts like Ridgway contend that an officer who
knew the players would probably have seen those two homeboys in the
park, known they didn't belong there and asked them to leave--or
better yet, searched them and found that they were carrying guns.
That same hypothetical officer also might have stopped by the
basketball game and realized that Gomez was an active gang member
conspicuously in enemy territory and thus a dangerously provocative
target, especially in a gym packed with moms, dads and kids. But if
there were officers patrolling the Pico Aliso housing project that
day, they did not know to do any of the above.</TE>
<TE>   "And it's going to get worse," said Ridgway, "because when Parks
formed the new gang unit, he stipulated that officers can only be in
it for three years." Since most officers on the unit joined in the
spring of 2000, come next March or April their time will be up. "And
we'll be back to square one again."</TE>
<TE>   Light and heat. Remove either and the cost becomes unacceptably
high--as in the case of Ronny Brock, whose older brother joined a
gang, while Ronny, 19, did not. Instead, he worked through most of
his school years in Boyle's office, graduated from Roosevelt High
School, then went straight to the Marines and was sent to Afghanistan
right after basic training.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of February of this year, Ronny flew back to the
U.S. and was reassigned to Camp Pendleton. Before reporting for his
new duty, he returned home to his mother's house in Boyle Heights
where, on Saturday, Feb. 9, mom and son spent most of the day
talking. Ronny told her he wanted to seek out his father, a man he
hardly knew. "I want my dad to see what I've become," he said. That
night he went to visit his girlfriend. Then, at 1 a.m. Sunday, he was
walking home along Breed Street. Three guys approached him with the
ritualistic question that often precipitates violence: "Where're you
from?"</TE>
<TE>   Ronny was standing on the sidewalk outside his mother's bedroom
window when he answered. "I'm from nowhere," he said, his tone light
because he was still in a good mood. The three homeboys didn't
believe him and so pumped a stream of bullets, like a flock of tiny
mean birds, into his body. He died on the sidewalk before his mother
or the paramedics could reach him.</TE>
<TE>   Heat and light. Ronny Brock had entered the light. The boys who
shot him hadn't. Would more heat on the street that night have saved
him? There is no actual way of knowing. But the question haunts.</TE>

<HD>Stumping Is a Risk for Bush</HD>
<DH>Bush could end up losing further ground for his party in a
Senate the Democrats now hold by a single seat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK W. GERMOND</AU>
<BD>Jack W. Germond is a political writer in Washington,
D.C.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In 1986, President Ronald Reagan, then two years from retirement,
embarked on what he called "my last campaign"--a determined effort to
retain control of the Senate for the Republican Party. Reagan focused
on trying to save several first-term Republicans who had ridden in on
his coattails in 1980--most notably Jeremiah Denton of Alabama, Mack
Mattingly of Georgia and Paula Hawkins of Florida--along with a
handful of other incumbents who appeared potentially vulnerable.</LD>
<LD>   Reagan's task was difficult. Some of the Republicans had been
given what might charitably be called "mixed reviews" for their
records of conservatism tinged by eccentricity. Hawkins, for example,
had proposed fighting drug trafficking by ordering the Treasury
Department to stop printing the $100 bill. And Denton, also marching
to a different drummer, had tried to legislate chastity in teenagers.
But Reagan forged ahead, visiting each state to ask his final favor
of the electorate in the most direct terms. He was rebuffed in each
case. Despite the president's strength, the Democrats regained the
Senate by defeating, among others, Hawkins, Denton and Mattingly.</LD>
<TE>   This bit of history is worth recalling as President Bush makes a
deepening commitment to campaigning for Republicans in an attempt to
retake the Senate this year. The lesson in Reagan's experience is
that even extremely popular presidents cannot tell the voters whom to
choose. And what this means, in turn, is that the White House is
taking a significant political risk by putting presidential stature
so clearly on the line.</TE>
<TE>   Bush could end up losing further ground for his party in a Senate
the Democrats now hold by a single seat. He could also nourish doubts
among his fellow Republicans that he can be valuable to them the next
time around. No president likes muttering in the ranks of his own
party. Quite beyond the Republican attitude, any sign of weakness on
Bush's part might embolden the Democrats who have been so intimidated
by the president's popularity. Their fear of being accused of
unpatriotic behavior would dissipate pretty quickly if they were to
smell weakness--or whatever aroma arose from the Republicans' use of
patriotism as the final defense.</TE>
<TE>   Why the White House is willing to take the risk is puzzling. Long
study of election patterns makes it plain that voters don't often
make two-step decisions in casting a vote. They don't support one
candidate because they like another except in rare cases. They choose
the person they think is best for the office rather than casting a
vote that simply sends a message.</TE>
<TE>   There have been, of course, some congressional elections
nationalized by voter anger at least to the point that some clear
line of popular reaction could be identified as making a difference
in close House districts and Senate contests.</TE>
<TE>   That was the case, for example, in the "Watergate landslide" of
1974, when enmity toward the disgraced Richard M. Nixon was clearly a
special burden for the Republicans. And it was also the case in 1994,
when voters reacted against the insularity of the Democratic
leadership of Congress and against President Bill Clinton and his
clumsy handling of the health-care financing issue. The Democrats in
1974 and the Republicans in 1994 gained more than 50 seats in the
House of Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   If public opinion polls are accurate, Bush remains extremely
popular. His approval rating has slipped from close to 90% to about
70%, but that is still a gaudy figure. There are, however, some signs
in the polling data that suggest that many voters are making a
distinction between supporting their president in time of war and
giving him high marks for his performance in office. Americans do
understand the difference between standing up to Osama bin Laden and
setting policy on the economy, the environment and education.</TE>
<TE>   And, whatever the poll numbers, what is lacking is any reason to
believe that the voters in South Dakota think their support for the
president requires them to throw out Sen. Tim Johnson, the Democrat
most recently targeted by Bush. Would the election of Republican Rep.
John Thune strengthen the war against terrorism? Or make Bush more
effective in dealing with the Middle East?</TE>
<TE>   In political terms, the president's greatest value right now lies
in his ability to raise money for his party and its candidates and to
call attention to the John Thunes of the 2002 campaign. But in terms
of his own prestige, Bush has much at risk and little to gain. This
campaign is not a referendum on the war against terrorism. Everyone's
on the same side of that one.</TE>

<KH>PLAYA VISTA</KH>
<HD>Just How Much Gas Flows Below?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. WILLIAM GIBSON</AU>
<BD>J. William Gibson is a professor of sociology at Cal
State Long Beach and author of "Warrior Dreams: Violence and Manhood
in Post- Vietnam America."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playa Vista's first tenants have moved in. If any of them worried
that the ground below them contained methane gas, they were reassured
by leasing agents that, yes, there's gas, but meters and alarms
provide advance notice of any leaks.</LD>
<LD>   The city of Los Angeles has been similarly soothing. Last spring,
a report released by the city's chief legislative analyst said the
methane under Playa Vista's proposed buildings could easily be
mitigated. Shortly afterward, the City Council approved issuing the
first $135-million installment of $428 million in tax-exempt
"community facilities" (or Mello-Roos) bonds to build its
infrastructure. But documents recently obtained by the Santa Monica
Bay-Keeper from the State Lands Commission point to a more
complicated and troubling situation.</LD>
<LD>   In 1993, the environmental impact report done by Playa Vista's
then-developer said there were only small amounts of methane on the
property.</LD>
<TE>   By 1999, however, critics charged that the problem was far more
serious. In response, the city Department of Building and Safety
hired Houston-based Exploration Technologies Inc. (ETI) to conduct
new methane studies and act as "peer reviewer" of others already
completed.</TE>
<TE>   In April 2000, the company issued its preliminary findings. ETI
found methane seeps much larger than any previously reported, one
about 1,000 feet long, and a second slightly smaller, in the area
east of Lincoln Boulevard and south of Jefferson Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   The company's president, Victor Jones, hypothesized that methane
was flowing to the surface via a fault running westward under Lincoln
and that the gas was coming from deep underground leaks in the
Southern California Gas Co. storage facility at Playa del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   On the verge of issuing the Mello-Roos bonds, the City Council
instead asked the city legislative analyst to oversee a new round of
studies done by Playa Capital Co.'s original consultants.</TE>
<TE>   ETI was retained to conduct additional studies of its own, as well
as serve as peer reviewer for the work done by Playa Capital's team.
Then-council member Mike Feuer appointed Jones to serve on the
legislative analyst's review committee.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, the legislative analyst's office released its
conclusions. Jones' initial hypothesis, it said, was wrong. There is
no fault zone under Lincoln, and gas samples taken from the storage
facility at Playa del Rey did not match those taken from the big
seeps east of the boulevard. The report concluded that "no
significant fault is possible under the entire Playa Vista
development project site." The City Council then approved issuance of
the Mello-Roos bonds, generating funds needed by the developers.</TE>
<TE>   Although Jones sat on the review committee, he and his team
contributed almost nothing to the city legislative analyst's report.
He was never invited to any meetings, nor were due dates for reports
given to him or his team. When Jones volunteered to fly to Los
Angeles, at his own expense, to testify before the council acted on
the Mello-Roos bonds, he was told by the city legislative analyst to
stay put. At least two council members, Feuer and Cindy Miscikowski,
say they saw none of Jones' follow-up studies or hints that these
studies raised any new significant concerns.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Jones brought up a number of problems in his second
report. For example, although ETI acknowledged that there was no
fault below Lincoln Boulevard, it reported finding a new seismic
"disruption zone" directly under the large methane seeps.</TE>
<TE>   Paul A. Witherspoon, professor emeritus of petroleum engineering
at UC Berkeley and a member of the ETI team, explained that "there
are multiple faults beneath Playa Vista that are bringing gas to the
surface."</TE>
<TE>   This is because the Ballona Wetlands and surrounding land--what's
now becoming Playa Vista--were, until modern times, the mouth of the
Los Angeles River. Over eons, innumerable layers of sediment have
been deposited there. They have slumped in places, creating the fault
zone.</TE>
<TE>   The methane comes from the Pico Sands, a geological formation 500
to 3,000 feet underground that stretches along the coast for many
miles, according to ETI. Four and a half miles south of Playa Vista
lies the 80-acre El Segundo gas field. Wells dug into the Pico Sands
have produced more than 23 billion cubic feet of methane, and
chemical analysis shows that methane from the two places is similar.
It's not that the El Segundo field is leaking but rather that gas in
the whole geological formation is slowly migrating westward.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview, Witherspoon expressed concern that during
an earthquake the "large number of faults in the area could allow a
cloud of methane to come to the surface and overwhelm a building's
mitigation system."</TE>
<TE>   Citing research on the Los Angeles Basin published in the U.S.
Geological Survey, he said just because a fault had not been active
recently did not mean it could not again become active during an
earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   Witherspoon also emphasized just how much methane was at issue. In
January 2001, after rains had flooded much of the property between
Jefferson Boulevard and the Westchester Bluffs, he walked out on the
land and noticed big bubbles breaking the surface in many places. He
called for an observation well to be dug; it soon produced more than
nine liters of gas a minute. "It's the largest seep I've ever seen in
my whole career," he told me, big enough, he surmised, to be a
commercially viable gas field. Drilling a gas well into the Pico
Sands would help deplete methane to more manageable levels, he said,
and reduce the danger of a methane cloud rising in an earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   In his original report, Jones and his ETI colleagues recommended
not building on a 60-acre piece of Playa Vista that seemed to contain
most of the methane. When the city of Los Angeles and Playa Capital,
the developers, said this was not a viable option, Jones narrowed his
analysis. His second report--the one the city legislative analyst did
not mention--says that the most serious methane flows occur on about
1.5% of the total property, or about 16 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Data in the report cast doubt on the effectiveness of mitigation
systems planned for these areas, where apartments and condos will be
built. ETI reviewed the "logs" of 120 test wells, dug by another
firm, to evaluate the effectiveness of the mitigation systems. The
wells were designed to bleed off methane gas from a belt of sand and
gravel known as the 50-foot aquifer and to serve as mitigation
systems for structures to be built over the most active seeps.</TE>
<TE>   But ETI found that most of the test wells had failed because they
quickly filled with sediment or flooded with water, making accurate
measurement of gas impossible. This suggests that the wells might not
be suitable for mitigation purposes. ETI's report recommends
extensive testing of vent wells and monitoring devices to mitigate
leakage from the biggest seeps.</TE>
<TE>   What's needed now is full disclosure. Playa Capital and Los
Angeles should release all consultant reports, city staff reports and
correspondence concerning environmental studies on the Playa Vista
property.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, either the state or federal courts should hold an
evidentiary hearing to officially record the documents and ensure the
public's access to them. All consultants to the project should be
subpoenaed and required to testify under oath at the hearing. Only
then can they speak openly without fear of being sued by Playa
Capital.</TE>
<TE>   Many parties will benefit from such full disclosure. The city of
Los Angeles needs to know what liabilities it faces when it approves
construction and releases the Mello-Roos bonds. Insurance companies
need to review all the data, not just the city legislative analyst's
reports. Potential investors can be more secure in their financial
decisions if they have all relevant information in hand.</TE>
<TE>   State politicians and the nonprofit Trust for Public Land are
currently negotiating with Playa Capital to buy all the Playa Vista
land west of Lincoln and some to the east. More reliable information
might affect appraisals. And Playa Vista's prospective residents have
a right to know what's under them.</TE>

<AU>JONATHAN V. LAST</AU>
<BD>Jonathan V. Last is online editor at the Weekly
Standard.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>"On 9/11, when America was suffering a great deal," Gary Bauer
recently said on ABC's "Good Morning America," "there was dancing in
Jenin and some other areas in the Middle East. The Israelis lowered
their flag and declared a day of mourning. So, I think we need to
keep in mind whose side we're on, who stood with us."</LD>
<LD>   Surprisingly gentle words from a religious conservative unhappy
with the Bush administration's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict. Yet his "soft" criticism highlights the delicate dance that
Republicans must perform when they want to rebuke President Bush in
the hope of influencing his policy choices.</LD>
<LD>   All administrations want loyalty from party members. But by all
accounts, the Bush administration is preoccupied with it. "They have
a view of politics as warfare greater than other administrations,"
said one Republican strategist. "So they don't tolerate it at all
when conservatives criticize them."</LD>
<TE>   "In this White House, if you criticize the president, the White
House will put you on the list of 'outsiders,'" said another
prominent Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another GOP strategist said, "They're terrible on
this....[Bush political strategist Karl] Rove particularly--and the
president, really. If you are perceived as crossing them, they're
very unpleasant....They've reached out more to liberals than to
conservatives they feel have unduly debated with them."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's desire for party loyalty is comparable
to that sought by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M.
Nixon, according to one political historian. It falls short, however,
of the standard set by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who famously
demanded that his staff be willing to kiss his posterior in Macy's
window at high noon and tell him it smelled like roses.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Republican critics of Bush maintain that they are merely
trying to keep the Bush administration in line with its stated
principles and that they want to see him succeed, said Bauer.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a role for a loving critic," said Marshall Wittmann, a
senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank. "It may be that
you're taken off the White House Christmas-card list, but that's the
price to be paid."</TE>
<TE>   So, how do you criticize a president sensitive about loyalty?</TE>
<TE>   Carefully.</TE>
<TE>   One approach is to praise the president first, then talk about
what you wish he would do. "We're talking about lovers' quarrels,"
said Wittmann, "so, if you're going to be critical, you have to bring
candy and flowers at the same time." In other words, attack the
policy, not the man.</TE>
<TE>   This is the tack House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) adopted
in a speech at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., last month. He
said, "President Bush led boldly when he declared war against the
forces of international terrorism." Then he launched into a brief on
what American policy toward Israel should be, in part motivated by
the president's endorsement of a Palestinian state and his remarks
that Israel's response to suicide bombings was "not helpful." But
DeLay subsequently mentioned the president only once, and not by
name, in his embrace of Israel as an ally and symbol of freedom.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks at a recent pro-Israel solidarity rally held in
Washington, conservative commentator William J. Bennett avoided even
a single reference to the president while calling for the U.S. to let
Israel be Israel. "If we let Israel fight her war, we will be the
beneficiaries," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The other option is to criticize the president's advisors for
giving him poor guidance. "You never want to attack the emperor,"
advises one Republican. "You want to attack those in his court."</TE>
<TE>   These days, that generally means U.S. Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative radio commentator Rush Limbaugh, who almost never
mentions Bush by name when he disagrees with the president, regularly
uses Powell as his straw man.</TE>
<TE>   Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich prefers the first-person
plural. "What we're doing right now is trying to carry water on both
shoulders," he said recently in attacking Bush's Middle East policy.</TE>
<TE>   There's a third way to influence the president without raising the
loyalty question. Richard Norton Smith, director of the Robert J.
Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas, said, "You do
it in private....Presidents, like the rest of us, don't like to be
told in public that they're idiots."</TE>
<TE>   True, private counsel isn't always heeded. "Does anyone believe
that at the point of the [1964] Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Johnson
would have listened to critics in private?" Smith asked.</TE>
<TE>   But others disagree that private makes right. "There's no cheap
way to do it," said one prominent Republican. "People in an
administration want good press, so they tell people, 'Give it to us
privately, through back channels.' That's a lie. It's the public
criticism which shows you're serious."</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, for the administration, "being thin-skinned cuts both
ways," he said. "You get punished, but they also move toward you to
shut you up." And the person who moves them rarely gets any credit.</TE>
<TE>   So, perhaps the best way for Republican elites to criticize and
influence an administration sensitive to disapproval is to first go
to its members privately and then make the disagreement public.
Still, they shouldn't expect any cards come Christmastime.</TE>

<HD>The Colombia Quandary</HD>
<DH>To date, U.S. aid has done almost nothing to reduce the
flow of cocaine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK LEAHY</AU>
<BD>Patrick Leahy is a Democratic U.S. senator from Vermont
and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Operations of the
Appropriations Committee.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Before we rush to bring the war against international terrorism to
the jungles of Colombia--as the administration and some in Congress
now urge--we would do well to understand that country's feudal
history. We should also review what has been done with the nearly $2
billion we have appropriated for Colombia in the past two years.</LD>
<LD>   "Plan Colombia," devised by the Clinton administration and the
Colombian government to drastically curtail cocaine production in
Colombia, called for $7.5 billion. At the time, we were told that
Colombia would contribute $4 billion and the U.S. share was to be
$1.6 billion. Donations by other countries, mostly European, have not
materialized. The Colombian government's support has also fallen
short. Now the Bush administration seeks an additional $537 million
for fiscal year 2003.</LD>
<LD>   So far, U.S. tax dollars have paid for a fleet of aircraft to
spray chemical herbicide over large areas of the country planted in
coca, for combat helicopters to protect the planes from groundfire
and for training and equipment for counter-drug battalions. Funds
also went to economic programs to give coca farmers alternative
sources of income and to reform Colombia's dysfunctional justice
system.</LD>
<TE>   Because of the Colombian military's poor human rights record,
Congress conditioned aid on the prosecution of military officers
implicated in serious abuses and on the severing of the military's
links with illegal paramilitary groups. These groups, like the
guerrillas, have been designated by the administration as terrorist
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   By any objective measure, Plan Colombia's results have been
disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the State Department predicted a 30% reduction in coca
cultivation by the end of this year. Although nearly 85,000 hectares
were sprayed last year, coca cultivation in Colombia actually rose,
by at least 21,100 hectares. Other than raising questions about
possible adverse health and environmental effects, the spraying seems
to have produced few results. There has not been any significant
reduction in the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S., and virtually
no one in the administration thinks there will be.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, U.S.-funded economic programs have produced little in
the way of viable alternatives for farmers. It is dangerous and
difficult to implement successful programs in the conflict zones
where coca is grown, particularly without stronger support from the
Colombian government, which has not invested enough of its own money
in these areas and has done little to reform its sagging economy.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell certified that,
while additional improvement is important, Colombia has met the human
rights conditions on which further U.S. aid is contingent. But the
certification had more to do with the fact that U.S. aid was running
out than with Colombia's actually making sufficient progress on human
rights. Senior military officers who have been implicated in the
murders of civilians or who have abetted paramilitary violence and
drug trafficking have not been jailed. Many remain on active duty and
some have been promoted. Human rights investigators and prosecutors
have been threatened, killed or forced to flee the country. Although
some soldiers have been suspended, none have been prosecuted and some
have joined the paramilitary groups responsible for a large share of
targeted assassinations and gruesome attacks against unarmed
civilians. Like the guerrillas, the paramilitary groups are deeply
involved in drug trafficking. Yet some local military commanders
share airfields, intelligence and logistics with them.</TE>
<TE>   For a time, it seemed that President Andres Pastrana's brave
efforts to negotiate peace might pay off. Now, though, the talks have
collapsed. Violence has intensified, and the guerrillas, especially
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), have sharply
escalated kidnappings, assassinations and other terrorist acts. They
are unlikely to defeat the Colombian military, but they can lay siege
to cities by cutting off water and power supplies. Colombia's
generals are now asking the U.S. for additional aid to fight the war.</TE>
<TE>   Americans need to understand that Colombia is really two
"countries," a condition that is at the heart of its problems. The
thinly populated, impoverished eastern half, which the government has
ignored for generations, is mired in the 19th century, while the
sophisticated, urban west is edging toward the 21st. There are deeply
rooted social, economic and political reasons why Latin America's
oldest conflict is no closer to resolution, and why drug money,
corruption and lawlessness permeate Colombian society. These
problems, which ultimately only Colombians can solve, will not be
fixed by simply attacking the symptoms, and an all-out war against
the twin terrorist threats--guerrillas and paramilitaries--would cost
far more, take far longer and cause more havoc than anyone in
Washington has acknowledged so far.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, we have confined our aid to funding anti-drug measures.
But that may be changing. Earlier this year, the administration asked
Congress for an additional $98 million to protect 100 miles of an oil
pipeline that has been a frequent target of guerrilla attacks,
costing Colombia $500 million a year in oil revenues. A vote on the
funding is pending. The White House is also seeking broad new
counter-terrorism authority in an interim spending bill now pending
before Congress, opening the door to a deeper, open-ended U.S.
involvement in Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia is not Afghanistan, and no one has advocated sending U.S.
troops. But we should remember that the U.S. sent $5 billion to the
military of El Salvador, a country with 1/50th the land area of
Colombia and they could not defeat the guerrillas there. Are we and
the Colombian people--who currently spend a meager 3% of their GDP on
the army--prepared for a wider war, which would bring with it not
only economic costs but also many more displaced people and an
inevitable increase in civilian casualties?</TE>
<TE>   Before taking this path, we should consider alternatives. Should
we send an envoy of the caliber of Richard Holbrooke to push for a
cease-fire and actively support a much more inclusive negotiating
strategy than was pursued previously? What about attacking the
security problems that have given rise to paramilitary groups by
strengthening Colombia's National Police, which has a cleaner human
rights record and which may be more effective in responding to
kidnappings and other terrorist acts?</TE>
<TE>   We want to help Colombia, particularly as the FARC has evolved
from a rebel movement with a political ideology to a drug-financed
terrorist syndicate. But we and the Colombians need to be clear about
our goals and what it would take to achieve them. We should not rush
to commit ourselves to a costly and ambiguous policy. Continued U.S.
aid to the Colombian military must be tied to accountability for
abuses and to aggressively fighting the paramilitaries. Goal-setting
should also be coordinated, after the elections in May, with
Colombia's new president, who may favor an entirely different
approach.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, just as Colombians need to take far more responsibility
for their own problems, we need to understand that Colombia cannot
solve America's drug problem, nor is Columbia responsible for it. Our
meager attempts to reduce demand for drugs have failed, and unless we
devote far more effort to what we know works--education and
treatment--the drugs will keep coming and Americans will keep dying.</TE>

<KH>GOVERNOR'S RACE</KH>
<HD>State GOP Courting Political Disaster</HD>
<DH>More than Bill Simon's fate is at stake: His party could
fall into a deep hole.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY QUINN</AU>
<BD>Tony Quinn is co-editor of the California Target Book,
a nonpartisan analysis of legislative and congressional elections.</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Not since Gov. Earl Warren led the Republican sweep of 1946 has one
party swept all partisan offices in California. After 56 years, that
may be about to happen again, if a current Field Poll is to be
believed.</LD>
<LD>   Since the March 5 primary, Gov. Gray Davis has gone from a
two-point deficit against his GOP challenger, Bill Simon, to a
14-point lead. If the election for governor were held today among
Field Poll voters who have made up their minds, Davis would be
reelected by a margin of 60% to 40%, roughly the same as his
landslide election in 1998. He would probably carry the entire
Democratic ticket with him.</LD>
<LD>   What's more, Democrats would probably pick up a few more seats in
the Legislature, bringing themselves close to a two-thirds margin in
the Assembly and Senate, at which point Republicans would become
completely irrelevant in Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   A Davis landslide would have major implications for the 2004
presidential election. It would mean Democrats could probably count
on California's 55 electoral votes as secure for the Democratic
presidential nominee and spend their money in other states,
complicating President Bush's reelection. It would also make the
reelection of Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) much easier at a time
when winning the Boxer seat could be crucial to Republicans regaining
control of the U.S. Senate.</TE>
<TE>   With Davis so unpopular--the Field Poll that shows him 14 points
ahead of Simon also finds half the voters disapproving of his job
performance in office--it is remarkable that Republicans could be on
the brink of a total wipeout. But Republicans have failed to
acknowledge and to deal with the fundamental changes that have
occurred in the California electorate, and now they may be about to
pay the ultimate price.</TE>
<TE>   Simon ran as the "conservative Republican" in the primary, a
strategy that appealed to the small Republican primary electorate but
makes victory in the much larger general-election electorate all but
impossible. Simon's handlers seemed unaware that their primary
strategy virtually predestined defeat in November.</TE>
<TE>   That is the clear message of the latest Field Poll. At the time of
the March primary, Simon led the unloved Davis 44% to 42%. Davis'
numbers have not changed since; he is at 43% in the latest poll. But
Simon has fallen a whopping 15 points; he has lost one-third of his
potential support since the primary. Davis is holding 92% of
Democrats who have made up their minds and is currently pulling
nearly one-fifth of Republicans who have decided. Almost a quarter of
Republicans have moved to the undecided camp.</TE>
<TE>   GOP moderates now see Simon as a hard-core conservative and,
accordingly, have moved away from him. They will most likely stay
home, as many did in 1998 and 2000, thus sinking the entire
Republican ticket. In addition, Simon is getting few crossover
Democrats, and nonpartisan voters are breaking heavily for Davis.
This is a virtual repeat of the general-election vote in 1998 and
2000, in which Republican candidates attracted the party base but
little else.</TE>
<TE>   All this has occurred in the two months since the primary without
Davis having spent a dollar of his enormous war chest. Voters have
simply caught up with Simon's "conservative Republican" primary
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   It has been four election cycles now and Republicans still refuse
to admit reality: The conservative Reagan era is over; there are no
more conservative-swing Democrats, and many nonpartisan voters are
actually to the left of Democrats. The unpleasant reality is that a
conservative Republican cannot win statewide in California any more
than a liberal Democrat can win in Idaho, Wyoming or Texas. One has
to wonder why Simon ever let himself be so defined.</TE>
<TE>   The White House seemed to comprehend this when it chose former Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan as its candidate for governor. But it
failed to appreciate the nuances of the GOP electorate. Bush's
politicos should have cleared the field in the closed Republican
primary to ensure that there was no right-wing crusade against the
moderate-to-liberal Riordan, and they should have assured that
Riordan had professional management.</TE>
<TE>   The model for California Republicans should be the Massachusetts
Republican Party, which has controlled the governorship there for 12
years by running social libertarians who emphasize sound fiscal
management and staying clear of the issues favored by conservative
Republican activists. This has allowed Republicans to occupy the
political middle in liberal Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   California is now nearly as liberal as Massachusetts, and
conservative positions on such issues as abortion rights and gun
control are far outside the political mainstream. California
Republicans, on the other hand, act as though the changes brought
about by the enlarged Latino electorate, the GOP collapse in the
suburbs and the flight of wealthy women from Republican ranks are
mere inconveniences, rather than fundamental political problems.</TE>
<TE>   Simon could still turn the race around; it is six months until
November. But that would require him to repudiate many of the
conservative social positions he took in the primary. That has
happened before, and Simon seems to have had no position on social
issues before he decided to run for governor.</TE>
<TE>   But the GOP challenger's approach has been to pretend that his
conservative stands on social issues do not matter, so he won't talk
about them. That's not going to work. Davis has just launched a
"Simon Says" Web site to highlight the candidate's "proud"
conservative views by quoting Simon's primary-election statements.</TE>
<TE>   So, Simon has no choice on issues like a woman's right to choose
and gun control but to reshape his positions along the lines of the
mainstream, or await a merciless pounding from the Davis campaign
machine, which will paint him so far to the right that the April
Field Poll results will become the November reality.</TE>
<TE>   The issue in the November election is not only can Simon win, but
also can Republicans survive as a viable political party. It has been
56 years since one party was totally shut out of statewide office in
California. Could this be the year it happens again?</TE>

<HD>A Good Place to Park</HD>
<DH>A first-time buyer takes to his mobile home after initial
uncertainty. A garage and a garden help too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY PRICE-ROBINSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mitch Klapow was not enthusiastic when his mother handed him an ad
for the Oakridge Mobile Home Park in Sylmar, where he would
eventually buy his first home.</LD>
<LD>   It was late 2000, and Klapow, 30, was searching for a condominium
to rent. Looking at the mobile homes in the real estate magazine that
contained the ad, he thought: "There's no way I'm living in a
trailer."</LD>
<LD>   With the rent on his apartment increasing to more than $1,000 a
month, he decided to lease a condo, figuring he could pay $1,100 to
$1,200 a month.</LD>
<TE>   A condo rental in Granada Hills, near where he and his mother
operate two laundries and a small publishing company, would be a step
up from the various apartments he had rented since he left home at
18.</TE>
<TE>   Buying a place had not occurred to him. "I think of myself as a
renter."</TE>
<TE>   His mind changed when he toured Oakridge, a gated, 600-unit park
tucked against the San Gabriel Mountains in the far northern reaches
of the San Fernando Valley. With winding streets of well-kept
factory-manufactured homes that seem more like cottages than
trailers, the park offers a 15,000-square-foot clubhouse, two
Jacuzzis, a pool, tennis court and billiards room with five tables. A
family park, it is open to children, but the average age is 50.</TE>
<TE>   The prices appealed to Klapow. "You could lock one up for
$47,000," he said. "It's a joke. It's ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   While he would still pay rent for the lot (space rents range from
$520 to $720 a month, the current cap), he would also reap the tax
and equity-building advantages of owning a home.</TE>
<TE>   The higher-priced units sell for about $150,000, while a recent
open house featured a 2,500-square-foot home with Corian counters, a
built-in Jenn-Air range and a butler's pantry. At $189,000, it is the
park's highest asking price so far. The next phase breaks ground this
year for 68 homes starting at $125,000.</TE>
<TE>   Another feature that appealed to Klapow was the attentive on-site
management, led by park manager and real estate agent Ginny Harmon,
who moved to the park 23 years ago, two months after it opened. As
Klapow was to find out for himself, the park's tidiness is largely
Harmon's doing.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have chipped paint, you get a note from Ginny," he said.
"She's hard-core, and I like it."</TE>
<TE>   From early in 2001 to the close of escrow on Sept. 10, Klapow
looked at dozens of mobile homes in the park.</TE>
<TE>   "I drove those ladies crazy," he said of Harmon and the two other
licensed real estate agents who live and work in the park. The newer
homes Klapow declared "too white" with their neutral shades, while
the older ones were too brown with their prolific wood paneling.
Finally, he decided to buy an older "coach" and do an extensive
remodel.</TE>
<TE>   Klapow, who described himself as a "guy who likes to shop," knew
it would cost $25,000 for a remodel that would give him the slate
floors and upscale doors and fixtures he wanted. With the goal of a
monthly house payment/space rent total of about $1,200, he decided
that he would borrow a total of $90,000, leaving about $65,000 to
purchase a home.</TE>
<TE>   Through much of 2001, Klapow shopped for a suitable mobile home
and the features he wanted in a remodel. Even a year later, park
manager Harmon recalls Klapow's priorities: privacy, a garage and a
garden.</TE>
<TE>   It took months to find the right unit, but he finally made an
offer on a 1982 yellow-and-white, two-bedroom, two-bathroom home with
1,288 square feet, an added sun room and a two-car garage to hold his
pristine Corvette.</TE>
<TE>   Ending up with a carport instead of a garage would have been
disappointing to Klapow. "To me, that was the point of having a
house," he said. "I wanted a garage door. I wanted my own trash
cans."</TE>
<TE>   By the end of escrow, Klapow had lined up the materials and
workers to pull off the eight-week remodel. The biggest project was
pulling up the gray carpeting and replacing it with a new subfloor
and 1,200 square feet of slate flooring. To make sure the jacks
holding up the coach could handle the added weight, he called in a
contractor knowledgeable in mobile homes who suggested more jacks for
support.</TE>
<TE>   Another big project was cutting open the wall opposite the
kitchen, and adding sliding French doors that open to the side
garden. In a "privacy lot" such as this one, park rules prohibit the
owner of the adjacent unit installing windows that would overlook
Klapow's modest yard. Likewise, he cannot add windows that would
overlook the garden of the neighbor on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   A set of French doors was also added from the sun room at the back
of the coach connecting to the master bedroom. Thick moldings were
added around both doors to complement the crown moldings added
throughout the home.</TE>
<TE>   While Klapow got much of what he wanted in his coach, he did not
get "big luscious bathrooms." To approximate those, he added slate in
both bathrooms, along with a 6-foot-wide shower in one, and a deep
tub in the other. Much of the budget was spent on pricey Baldwin
hardware and Newport Brass fixtures.</TE>
<TE>   To give him the feeling of a luxurious home, Klapow tried to
upgrade all the things he would be touching--"counters, doors,
hardware and fixtures"--while leaving many of the existing kitchen
and bathroom cabinets in place. "There are certain issues where
budget takes over," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To bring color into the home, he painted the ceilings--a skill he
said he's "king of," calling it "decorator tip No. 1"--the same dark
tan as the walls in the living room/dining room/kitchen. The library
adjacent to the living room is green, and the master bathroom is
"where taupe meets gray." All trim is Navajo white. Lamps and
accessories came from Fabby and Zipper, both in Los Angeles, and
Restoration Hardware in Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Before the project was finished, the budget was used up. Klapow
still wants to add concrete steps from the sliding French door to the
garden, and to replace the old stove with a stainless-steel one. But
he feels he's got the features that make him feel he is living in a
luxury home.</TE>
<TE>   "How do I know that I'm 23 inches off the ground, that there are
jacks under there?" he asked. "You forget about it."</TE>
<TE>   But the house comes with a downside. "It makes me nervous living
in it. I'm afraid I'll break something," he said. "I've never had
this good of stuff of my own."</TE>
<TE>   While Klapow suggests the mobile home park to others, he does so
with a caveat. "They would be turned off by these places [as they
are]," he said. "You have to move in with the idea of redoing it."</TE>
<TE>   From his experience, Klapow said he has discovered "how to buy
your first home, how it can be fabulous and be under $100,000. People
can do it."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH RYON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This Montecito house was built to look like a Louis XV Parisian
chateau. Upon completing construction, the owners realized it was
going to be too big for them. "They were young enough to have fun
with it but old enough to know that they took on too much," said
listing agent Randy Solakian.</LD>
<LD>   About the home: The house looms large in Birnam Wood, a
guard-gated golf-club community. It contains period French marble
fireplaces; inlaid marble floors and antique crystal chandeliers.</LD>
<LD>   The facade is covered with handmade bricks from England. The
marble fountains are from Italy. A marble mosaic in the pool was
inspired by a Raphael painting. Even the maid's bathroom has
gold-plated fixtures.</LD>
<TE>   Asking price: $29,950,000</TE>
<TE>   Size: Six bedrooms in about 16,000 square feet, mostly on one
level, on 2.5 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The estate has three elevators: One leads to a wine room
and wine dining room with a fireplace, one is between two large
closets and one descends to a tunnel hallway opening to a guest
apartment. Other features are a cherrywood library, dome ceiling,
kitchen equipped for large-scale entertaining, iron doors that open
electronically and a full diesel-powered generator.</TE>

<LD>Arnold Schwarzenegger has purchased a newly built home in a
guard-gated Brentwood community for close to its $11.9-million asking
price, but the quarters are only temporary.</LD>
<LD>   The actor and his wife, NBC-TV reporter Maria Shriver, plan to
move with their four children to the home from their longtime Pacific
Palisades compound, which will undergo a major rehabilitation,
according to sources not involved in the transaction.</LD>
<LD>   Unable to find an acceptable home to lease during the remodeling,
the couple chose to buy. They had been considering properties with
leases as high as $70,000 a month, Westside Realtors said.</LD>
<TE>   Their interim Brentwood home, described as Argentinian Mission
Spanish in style, has five bedrooms and 11 bathrooms in 11,000 square
feet. It's on a six-acre knoll and has ocean views.</TE>
<TE>   Their Palisades compound includes four adjacent 5,000- to
6,000-square-foot houses on about 5.5 acres. They bought their first
house in 1986, the year they were married; their second house in 1993
from actor John Forsythe; and their third house in 1995 from "Hill
Street Blues" star Daniel J. Travanti. In February 2001, they bought
their fourth home from Jay Lustig, part owner of the Pittsburgh
Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   All of the houses in the compound were built in the early '80s.
One is being used for offices and a guest suite. The other houses
have a total of least 16 bedrooms. One house has a tennis court.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger had a leading role in the movie "Collateral
Damage," released in April, and he stars in "Terminator 3: The Rise
of the Machines," due out in 2003. The actor, 54, reportedly will
receive a salary of $30 million for "Terminator 3."</TE>
<TE>   Shriver is a contributing anchor to "Dateline NBC." She has
written a number of books, including "Ten Things I Wish I Had Known
Before I Went Out Into the Real World." Shriver, 46, is a member of
the Kennedy family.</TE>
<TE>   An active Republican, Schwarzenegger opted out of this year's race
for California governor but indicated that he was merely postponing a
plunge into politics until "some other time." In the meantime, he is
backing a November ballot measure to provide financing for
after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's temporary home was listed by Rick Hilton, Mauricio
Umansky and Christy Hilton of Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills, and
Rodrigo Iglesias of Coldwell Banker, Brentwood, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Bonaduce, one of the four hosts of "The Other Half" TV show,
and his wife, Gretchen, have purchased a Westside home for $2
million, and they have listed their former Hollywood Hills home at
just under $1.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Their new Mediterranean-style home was built in 1928 and has six
bedrooms plus a guest house in 4,500 square feet. The home also has a
pool and gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Their former home was newly built when they bought it in March
1999. It has five bedrooms in about 5,600 square feet and sits on a
knoll with city-to-ocean views. The four-level house also has an open
floor plan with soaring ceilings, an elevator, a media room, four
fireplaces and a master suite with a sitting room and his-and-hers
closets.</TE>
<TE>   The Bonaduces' new home is said to be more child-friendly with a
bigger yard. The couple have two children.</TE>
<TE>   Danny Bonaduce, also a co-host of the morning radio show "Jamie &amp;
Danny" on KYSR-FM (98.7), scored over former "Brady Bunch" star Barry
Williams in two rounds on Fox's "Celebrity Boxing," which aired in
March. Now 42, Bonaduce was a child star on the ABC-TV series "The
Partridge Family."</TE>
<TE>   The other hosts of "The Other Half," airing weekdays at noon on
KNBC-TV Channel 4 in L.A., are TV icon Dick Clark, Mario Lopez and
Dorian Gregory.</TE>
<TE>   Neal Baddin of Coldwell Banker, Sunset Strip, has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Peters, the producer who was once co-chairman of Columbia
Pictures, has sold his Beverly Hills area home for close to its
$10.9-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The buyer is concert promoter Irv Zuckerman. He was Clear Channel
Entertainment music division chief executive until mid-April when it
was announced that he and co-chief executive Rodney Eckerman would be
"vacating their positions" and possibly be "transitioned to new
posts."</TE>
<TE>   Peters, a producer of such movies as "Ali" (2001), "Wild Wild
West" (1999) and "Batman" (1989), has owned the home since it was
built in 1987. He has moved to a Beverly Hills-area home built in
1928 for legendary filmmaker King Vidor by architect Wallace Neff.
Peters bought the five-bedroom, 8,000-square-foot home, on five
acres, in 1996 and has been refurbishing and expanding it ever since.</TE>
<TE>   The three-story house he sold has seven bedrooms and 7.5 bathrooms
in about 12,000 square feet. The Georgian-style house is on about
five acres with koi ponds, pathways, a tennis court, a pool, a spa,
stables and city views.</TE>
<TE>   John Woodward of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills North, and Mary
and Andrew Woodward, both of Coldwell Banker in Hancock Park,
represented Zuckerman, sources said, and Joe Babajian and Kyle Grasso
of Prudential California Estates, Beverly Hills, had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo, almost a year into his first
job as an elected official, and his wife, Michelle, have purchased a
Hancock Park-area home from Casey Cole Ray, one of singer Nat King
Cole's five children and a younger sister of singer Natalie Cole.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney, 41, and his wife bought the home for less than $1
million.</TE>
<TE>   Ray plans to move to the East Coast to be closer to her twin
sister, Timolin Cole. They are partners in a public relations firm
that includes such clients as King Cole Productions, a family run
firm that handles Nat King Cole business.</TE>
<TE>   The house, which Ray had owned since 1992, was built in 1919 and
has five bedrooms in slightly more than 3,000 square feet. The
Southern Colonial-style house also has a library, an office/playroom
and a large backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Chadney, associate manager and estates director of
Prudential California Realty--a John Aaroe Division in Hancock Park,
represented the Delgadillos, and Rick Dergen, a ReMax regional
manager, had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Diego Serrano, who has appeared on "The Young and the Restless"
and "Another World," has purchased a three-bedroom, 3,800-square-foot
home in the Hollywood Hills for $545,000, according to public
records.</TE>
<TE>   The walled and gated Mediterranean-style home was built in 1923
and has a breakfast room and a guest quarters with a separate
entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Jory Burton of DBL, Beverly Hills, had the listing, and Dawn Ross
of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills, represented Serrano.</TE>
<TE>   A New York development team has reached out to Southland Realtors
to help sell condominiums priced from $1.5 million to $26 million.</TE>
<TE>   The 191 condos, at One Central Park, are being built from the 52nd
to 80th floors of two new towers overlooking the park, the Hudson
River and the Manhattan skyline. Lower floors will house the
headquarters of AOL Time Warner Inc. as well as restaurants, shops
and two auditoriums of the Jazz Performing Arts Center for Lincoln
Center. AOL Time Warner, the Related Companies and the Apollo Real
Estate Group are developing the towers, to be completed in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "When I moved here 23 years ago, I found that there was a
significant number of people in L.A. who have apartments in New
York," said Linda May, who represents the project with Joyce Rey at
Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills. Now there are considerably more
bicoastal people in entertainment and financial services, May said.</TE>

<HD>Life of Reilly: House, Boat, Memories</HD>
<DH>The multifaceted actor is happy to stay put in the two
favorite places that define his world.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH RYON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Nelson Reilly calls two places home: a house in Beverly Hills
and a 34-foot cabin cruiser in Marina del Rey.</LD>
<LD>   They're not far apart, and Reilly likes it that way.</LD>
<LD>   "Capricorns like to stay in one place," said the comic actor, who
turned 71 in January. "I have to go to work in places like New York,
but basically, I don't want to go anywhere.</LD>
<TE>   "One time I got a trip around the world for doing something on
television, and the travel agent was so excited, I gave her the
tickets."</TE>
<TE>   It sounds like a joke, but such is the life of Reilly, which is
also part of the name of his one-man play. "Save It for the Stage ...
The Life of Reilly" opens Thursday, with a preview Tuesday, at the
Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The show, which Reilly has performed in half a dozen places from
New York to San Francisco since 1999, is a mix of pathos and humor
about people Reilly has known.</TE>
<TE>   His homes, on land and in the marina, are filled with memorabilia
about them and others. Photos, signs and miscellaneous mementos cover
the walls in both places, revealing a wide variety of
acquaintances--few, however, as multifaceted as Reilly.</TE>
<TE>   Known broadly as a panelist on such TV game shows as "The Match
Game" (1973-79), he appeared 98 times, second only to Bob Hope, on
"The Tonight Show With Johnny Carson." But Reilly also was a
Tony-winning actor for his role in "How to Succeed in Business
Without Really Trying" (1962), he has been a director of such stage
plays as "The Belle of Amherst" (1976) with Julie Harris, and he is
an acting teacher who has worked with such stars as Liza Minnelli,
Lily Tomlin and Christine Lahti. A TV actor who created the part of
author Jose Chung in "The X Files" (1996), Reilly is also an opera
coach and a member of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary.</TE>
<TE>   The many faces of Reilly show up periodically among the hundreds
of framed photos in his house, where he has lived since the late
1960s. He bought the house "for $50,000 or something like that," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   He was first aware of having his picture taken when he went to his
prom in 1946 at Weaver High School in Hartford, Conn. "Totie Fields
and Norman Lear were classmates, but I went to the prom with Elsie
Terafino, and every time we danced, we went in front of a cameraman,
who took our picture," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Terafino's photo from that prom is on a wall near a picture of the
queen of England, whom Reilly met at the White House in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on the Yiddish he recalls from his boyhood days in the
Bronx, where he was born, Reilly calls his house and his boat
"ongepotchket," meaning cluttered or in disorder. He describes his
one-story house as "elegant bohemian or organized chaos."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the photos in his house, there are numerous signs such as
"Please do not bring food into the theater" and "Sardi's--Breakfast,
Lunch, Tea, Coffee, Brunch, Dinner." Reilly collects signs that mean
something to him, like the one on the inside of his front door that
says: "Do not use this door between 3 and 5:30 p.m. and 7 to 10 p.m."
It was a sign that was used during the PBS taping of "The Belle of
Amherst."</TE>
<TE>   Another reminder to him of his work with actress Harris is a
poster in his living room for the 1997 Broadway revival of the play
"The Gin Game," co-starring Harris and Charles Durning. Reilly was
the director.</TE>
<TE>   "Vincent Price gave me this," Reilly said, taking a small painting
off another wall. "It's probably worth a couple hundred [thousand
dollars], because he would come in and say, 'There is absolutely
nothing of value here.'"</TE>
<TE>   The late actor and art collector would have been wrong, though,
because there are gems among the clutter. One is a sample of artwork
created by Reilly's father, Charles Joseph Reilly, a graphic artist.</TE>
<TE>   "Walt Disney begged him to come to Hollywood," the actor said,
"but if my father had come, I would be sitting in a much bigger house
today."</TE>
<TE>   Reilly's house has three bedrooms--one is being used as a den--and
two baths in 1,874 square feet. Built in 1956, the house is on half
an acre in what is known as the Beverly Hills Post Office area.</TE>
<TE>   Rose bushes and birds of paradise decorate the front yard, covered
with ivy. A massive lemon tree that Reilly bought in 1969 when it was
a seedling in a tomato can is in back.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Hughes, a set decorator-dresser and Reilly's companion of
nearly 21 years, takes care of the 800 plants in the yard, but he's
going away when Reilly's play opens, and so the actor will need to
water the plants. "Because I was an only child, I don't like many
people around, and that's why I don't have any servants."</TE>
<TE>   That also might explain why he was drawn to the house when he
bought it. "It was all by itself," he said. "There are no neighbors,
and I have sugar, so I don't have to borrow any."</TE>
<TE>   Oliver and Cornelius--mixed-breed boxers/pit bulls he
affectionately calls "the kids"--guard the house, which also has a
pool, although Reilly says he hasn't been in it since the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "The fence went down, the chimney moved, and the pool cracked
during an earthquake," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The house has a fireplace, which he said he hasn't used in nine
years.</TE>
<TE>   When Reilly was 13, he was in the audience of a circus in Hartford
where a fire broke out that killed 168. Although he isn't afraid of
fire, he still can't stand being in an audience. He is now on a board
campaigning for a memorial to those who died at the circus in 1944.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had a fire, there is one thing I would save," he said: a
sign from comedian Chris Scott, one of his New York acting students
in 1979, that says, "I went to school for a long time, and you are
the first teacher I've had."</TE>
<TE>   There's only one sign he might cherish almost as much. It says:
"Gone Boating."</TE>
<TE>   These days his work schedule keeps him from boating as much as
he'd like, but he has gone often since he bought the cabin cruiser 25
years ago for about the same price as he paid for his house. The
boat, which costs $460 a month to moor, sleeps four and has a dining
salon and two cabins. As a surprise gift, Reilly's friend actor Burt
Reynolds had the dining salon redecorated.</TE>
<TE>   Reilly had Bernie Taupin, Elton John's writing partner, and
Taupin's grandmother on the boat the first time he was going to take
it out of the marina, but the engine wouldn't start. "So I called the
Coast Guard," Reilly said.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, it became routine for him to call the Coast Guard.
"Whenever I'd go out, the pin holding the prop to the motor would
break when I shifted gears," he recalled, "so I'd float over to a
fancy hotel and call the Coast Guard. They'd say, 'Are you lost at
sea?' And I'd say, 'I'm in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton or someplace
like that.'</TE>
<TE>   "I told my boating disaster tales on 'Johnny Carson,' and that led
to a film we made for the Coast Guard called 'Don't Let This Happen
to You.'" It's still shown as part of the Coast Guard's free safe
boating course, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reilly has many certificates of appreciation from the Coast Guard
in his boat, which also has pictures of friends and himself on the
walls alongside a photo of the Staten Island Ferry, which he once
piloted, and such signs as: "Eat, Sleep, Sail."</TE>
<TE>   The boat, which flies the Italian flag, is called La Boheme
because it was the first opera Reilly saw, in 1947; it was the first
opera he was in, as a tenor in the chorus; and it was the first of
several operas he directed.</TE>
<TE>   Five sopranos have been on the boat, he said, proudly listing
them, starting with Roberta Peters. Two of the five have sung the
part of Mimi in "La Boheme."</TE>
<TE>   Painted on the boat's stern under the name La Boheme is Milano.

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You are searching for a new apartment. You clip an ad and head off to
see the building. Nice lobby, you think, and it's convenient to
public transportation.</LD>
<LD>   You ask about amenities: pool, tennis court, fitness center and
party room. You ask the location of the nearest shopping area, bank,
restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   You walk through the unit, checking its condition, views and
square footage. You get information about the rent and other fees.</LD>
<TE>   Isn't there something missing from your list?</TE>
<TE>   You forgot to ask about crime.</TE>
<TE>   What you want to know is whether any crimes occurred at the
complex in the last two to three years--murders, rapes, assaults,
kidnappings, carjackings, robberies, drug busts, burglaries,
vandalism to cars.</TE>
<TE>   "Crime can occur anywhere--even in buildings in the best
neighborhoods and highest rent districts," said attorney John F.
Kennedy of Silver Spring, Md. "You can ask specific questions of the
leasing agent or management office person, and you should get very
specific answers.</TE>
<TE>   "By law, they do have to tell you--if you ask. If a leasing agent
or management employee fails to answer or specifically gives you
misleading or wrong answers with intent not to scare you away, they
have committed a fraud and your rental contract will not be valid."</TE>
<TE>   If you move in and then hear about assaults in the building and
become afraid, you are entitled to void the contract because it was a
material misrepresentation, Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   If you were to be assaulted in the building and there were
previous attacks that you should have been told about, you can sue
for fraud, personal injury and not being informed about a potential
ongoing problem, Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   But even if the building you choose is crime-free, something may
occur in the future. Management has an obligation to tell residents
as soon as feasible by putting fliers in hallways, under doors or
front desk boxes, or by a notice on the house cable station so that
tenants can be vigilant, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Renters are more likely than owners to have their cars stolen or
their homes burglarized, according to Jean O'Neil, director of
research for the Washington, D.C.-based National Crime Prevention
Council.</TE>
<TE>   Here are a few statistics she cites from the Department of
Justice's National Crime Victimization Survey for 1999:</TE>
<TE>   * Vehicles were stolen from 8.4 per 1,000 owned households versus
13 per 1,000 rented ones.</TE>
<TE>   * Burglaries occurred at 26.5 per 1,000 owned households versus
48.9 per 1,000 rented ones.</TE>
<TE>   * There were thefts from yards, halls and storage bins at 135.5
per 1,000 owned households versus 190 per 1,000 rented ones.</TE>
<TE>   Owned households included single-family dwellings and
condominiums, said O'Neil. Rented households included single-family
dwellings and apartments.</TE>
<TE>   You can make an apartment complex essentially as safe as a
neighborhood of single-family homes, said O'Neil, but it takes extra
effort to build a sense of community and mutual awareness.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Steven Jackson, a crime-prevention specialist with the
Washington, D.C., police department's Community Outreach Section,
offers the following tips for apartment dwellers.</TE>
<TE>   * The front door of your unit should have a deadbolt lock and a
peephole. A chain lock is not enough to keep out an intruder.</TE>
<TE>   * A sliding glass door to a balcony should have a wooden rod in
the track so it can't be opened, and pins in the overhead frame so
the door can't be lifted out.</TE>
<TE>   * Entry to the building should be tightly controlled. This could
mean having a doorman or a safety officer who oversees people
entering and leaving. It could be a lobby receptionist who beeps
visitors in through a locked front door. Or it could be an electronic
entrance system that lets you in with a code or card.</TE>
<TE>   * Keys to your unit should be protected. Management will expect a
set when you move in. Ask to be shown how they are secured and what
process is in place when a key is needed to enter your unit in an
emergency.</TE>
<TE>   * Walkways, entrances, parking areas, elevators, hallways,
stairways, laundry rooms and storage areas should be well lighted 24
hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   * Mailboxes should be in a well-traveled, well-lighted area. Use
only your last name on the box; do not indicate if you are a man or a
woman, living alone or with others. Make sure the lock is sturdy.</TE>
<TE>   * The door to the community laundry room should have a window. If
it doesn't, leave the door open at all times while you are there. Try
to schedule visits during hours when others are at home.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't leave your unit door open when going to the laundry,
picking up mail, taking out trash or waiting for a delivery.</TE>
<TE>   * Employees and contract employees on the property and workers in
units should wear ID provided by the apartment management, if they
don't already display a company badge.</TE>
<TE>   * The door to a community storage facility should be kept locked.
Tenants should not have keys except to their individual bins. The
storage room door key should be kept at the front desk or in the
office, and tenants should have to sign for it. The key should be
available only when someone is in the office or at the desk.</TE>
<TE>   * Telephones in elevators and in the garage should be tested
regularly. Ask management how often that is done.</TE>
<TE>   * Shrubs should be trimmed low at doorways throughout the complex
and at the windows outside basement- or ground-level units. Is there
enough room between the shrubs and the walls behind them for an
intruder to hide until an appropriate time to break in? If so,
consider removing the hedges.</TE>
<TE>   * Trash and garbage bags should not be allowed to pile up; such
things suggest to an intruder that no one cares about the property.</TE>
<TE>   * Newspapers should not be allowed to pile up outside unit doors;
they show no one is home.</TE>
<TE>   * Last but not least, get to know your neighbors. One of the best
ways is to volunteer to help management organize a social event.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Most Americans support the concept behind the Fair Housing Act, the
law that prohibits many types of housing discrimination, but many do
not fully grasp which activities are legal and which are not,
according to a report prepared by the Urban Institute and released by
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-eight percent of survey respondents were aware that it is
illegal to refuse to rent to a family because they have children, 81%
knew it was illegal to restrict the sale of a home to white buyers,
78% knew it was illegal to refuse to rent to a person based on
religion, and 67% said that they support existing laws that prohibit
homeowners from refusing to sell based on a buyer's race, religion or
nationality.</LD>
<LD>   Fourteen percent of respondents believe that they have been
subjected to housing discrimination.</LD>
<TE>   HUD undertook the survey to establish a baseline for future
studies.</TE>

<HD>Boost Bathroom Ventilation With an Exhaust Fan</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Odors, mildew, blistering paint, peeling wallpaper and desilvering
mirrors are a few of the conditions that result from poor bathroom
ventilation. Many well-intentioned homeowners just crack a window
while showering, but in most cases it simply isn't enough.</LD>
<LD>   One sure way to rid the bathroom of unwanted odors and excess
moisture is an exhaust fan. Fans are rated by cfms--cubic feet of air
moved each minute. When shopping for a bath fan, look for one with a
cfm at least 10% greater than the bathroom's floor area.</LD>
<LD>   Also, the noise produced by a fan is measured in sones: the lower
the sones, the quieter it is.</LD>

<HD>Lenders Keep Details on the Internet Sketchy for a Reason</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>Last of six parts</SE>
<AU>JACK GUTTENTAG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most single-lender Web sites provide sketchy coverage of mortgage
types and don't price many important market niches.</LD>
<LD>   Why is the coverage of products and market niches so incomplete?
Some lenders don't have the technology to provide more complete
coverage. The technology is readily available in the market, however.</LD>
<LD>   A second reason is that most lenders (like other merchants) do not
like being price shopped. They prefer to so dazzle consumers with
their sites, special features and blurbs about the service they
provide, that shoppers click on a "Submit Application" button without
looking anywhere else. They realize that shoppers expect to see some
prices on their Web sites but prefer to limit their scope.</LD>
<TE>   Lenders prefer to give personalized quotes on the telephone. They
know that a Web-based quote will be compared with others, whereas on
the phone they may be able to land a customer before comparisons are
made.</TE>
<TE>   As with other merchants, lenders want to put their best foot
forward. The lowest rates and points apply to the standard set of
"plain vanilla" features that are assumed in the absence of
information to the contrary.</TE>
<TE>   Web sites that allow borrowers to deviate from the standard
features by indicating, for example, that they are purchasing as an
investment rather than for occupancy, or can't document their income,
or have weak credit, will quote higher prices. The last thing a
lender wants is to have shoppers comparing their adjusted high prices
against unadjusted lower ones on other sites.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason Web sites limit the scope of their niche pricing is
that the further such pricing is pushed, the more questions must be
asked of borrowers. It is widely believed that borrowers on the Web
have short attention spans and little patience; that they don't
understand why so much information is needed and may suspect the
motives for asking; and that long questionnaires will cause them to
click off and go to a site that doesn't ask as much from them.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, there is considerable truth in this. One site I
have watched over the years at one time asked more questions (and
provided more complete pricing) than it does now. Finding that their
long questionnaire discouraged shoppers, they shortened it and found
that they had more success. I find the quality of the site has
deteriorated.</TE>
<TE>   Lenders make a mistake in designing sites that are too simplistic.
Consumers become disenchanted when they discover that the prices they
see on the site don't apply to them. Over time, furthermore, more
shoppers will become better educated and seek out the sites that
offer more information.</TE>
<TE>   But the principal argument against dumbing-down a site in order to
appeal to more consumers is that it isn't necessary. A well-designed
site can provide the information that sophisticated shoppers seek,
without losing the rest. The trick is to integrate the collection of
information from shoppers and the provision of information on prices
back to shoppers so that anyone can see how their answers to the
site's questions affect prices.</TE>
<TE>   Here are the sites reviewed in this series and their rankings:</TE>

<HD>A New Kind of Ming Dynasty</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: China's 7-foot-5 center is the top prospect
in upcoming NBA draft, but his country's red tape makes him a dicey
proposition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG LOGAN</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of all the potential first-round draft picks in NBA history, there
never has been one like Yao Ming. He's 7-foot-5, but he thinks it's
unsportsmanlike to dunk.</LD>
<LD>   He wants an NBA career as much as any American who leaves school
early, but when he was approached to defect last year to enter the
draft, he refused out of loyalty to his country.</LD>
<LD>   Yao is the most talented basketball player produced by China's
state-run sports schools, which should come as no surprise because
his parents were national icons in the sport. Now the prodigy bears
the weight of great historical and cultural expectations as he
attempts the delicate coupling of China's communist system with the
NBA's unbridled capitalism.</LD>
<TE>   There's no question Yao easily is the best big man in this year's
draft. No one is expecting the next coming of Wilt Chamberlain,
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Shaquille O'Neal. But Rle (pronounced AR-lee)
Nichols, who coached Yao four years ago on a tour of the U.S. high
school all-star circuit, said Yao's skills are "way ahead" of the
last true giant to make it, 7-6 Shawn Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Nichols said Yao responded well to the competition faced by the
Nike-sponsored High-Five America team. In one game, he went against
center Tyson Chandler, who was drafted straight out of high school by
the Chicago Bulls with the second pick last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Yao Ming took one of Chandler's stuffs and stuck it about 15 rows
in the stands," Nichols said. "At that time, he didn't have a
low-post game, but his turnaround jumper was not bad. His hands are
very good, and he really takes care of the defense because he's a
very good shot-blocker."</TE>
<TE>   There was just one cultural clash between Nichols and Yao. "'I had
to force him to dunk," Nichols said. "I'd make him run if he didn't.
He said, 'That's not respectful.'"</TE>
<TE>   Laughing at the mention of Yao's reluctance to dunk, a person
closely associated with him said: "That's right. He still agonizes
over the issue. He's a very clean player who rarely retaliates to
hard fouls. I think he should be more assertive, but he's definitely
playing a tougher game because he's such a prominent target in
China."</TE>
<TE>   As a likely top-two pick in the June 26 NBA draft, Yao's play has
been thoroughly analyzed by all 13 teams entered in the May 19 draft
lottery. Yao was to be under the microscope again Wednesday in his
only predraft workout in front of a bevy of executives, scouts and
media at Loyola University in Chicago. Former Knick coach Jeff Van
Gundy was expected to run the workout but was replaced by former
Warrior coach P.J. Carlesimo.</TE>
<TE>   But the questions most teams want answered have more to do with
politics than post moves. Yao comes with a lot of red tape.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese government recently issued regulations that would
require Yao to hand over more than 50 percent of his salary and
endorsement earnings to a variety of government and sports
authorities in China. The team drafting Yao also may be expected to
make a substantial payment to the Shanghai Sharks, whom he led to the
China Basketball Association title, and to develop a continuing
relationship through clinics and exhibition games.</TE>
<TE>   An Eastern Conference general manager who watched Yao play with
the Chinese national team in the Dallas summer league last year said:
"He's a good player with unique size and talent, and he's very
coordinated. It's going to take him a while to get used to the NBA
game, but he'll be good. ... He's better than all the American big
men, but you're going to have to know what all is involved if you
draft him."</TE>
<TE>   Details of the Chinese government's demands almost certainly are
negotiable because of its need to display a more open society after
being admitted to the World Trade Organization and winning the 2008
Olympics for Beijing. Still, Yao must perform a high-wire act
balancing his country's interests with those of his future team.</TE>
<TE>   "Yao Ming's sense of destiny and responsibility is very strong,"
said his close associate, who requested anonymity to avoid further
complicating matters in China. "A year ago, there were people trying
to entice him to defect. He flat-out refused and told me never to
contact that party again.</TE>
<TE>   "He takes his responsibility to the national team very seriously.
It's a great honor to represent his country. He never expressed any
hope for commercial benefit from basketball. He asks what I think of
his jump shot or tells me what NBA scouts said about his hook shot.
He knows whoever picks him is making a great investment in what is
perceived as a very large risk. He wants to do his best to make sure
they spend their money wisely."</TE>
<TE>   Much has been made of the interest a Shanghai Sharks official
expressed in steering Yao to New York, Chicago or Golden State in the
Bay Area, three large-market teams with substantial Asian
communities. The Bulls and Warriors each have a 22.5-percent chance
of winning the lottery, and the Knicks have only a 4.4-percent
chance. That means there's a 50.6-percent chance Yao will wind up
someplace else, such as Memphis, Denver, Houston or Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Yao's associate confirmed the Sharks' interest in the Bulls,
Warriors or Knicks, saying: "On the business side, the club hopes
that's the case, but this is not totally for the revenue they could
generate. Those three cities all have very large Chinese populations,
so they think the transition will be easier for Yao Ming. I have to
speak up for the club on that. Of course, this is a business, but
their primary concern is the welfare of the player. They know their
interests are tied to Yao Ming's performance in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "As for Yao Ming personally, I can say that he doesn't care. The
NBA is a paradise for him. I don't think he would make a strong
distinction between the cities he doesn't even know very well."</TE>
<TE>   Yao, who will turn 22 Sept. 12, has spent nearly all his time
since the age of 13 in a state-run sports school, preparing for this
moment. As his associate said: "He's been living, sleeping and
breathing basketball in a closed environment. ... Yao is definitely
someone with a lot of appreciation for the opportunity he's getting.
He's not one with a superstar mentality."</TE>
<TE>   In the past year, Yao spent barely a week with his parents because
of the demands of the Sharks and the national team. Both played for
China in the 1970s, and they understand his mission. His father once
played center for the Sharks, and his mother was national team
captain and was considered among the premier centers in the world.
Now, their only child is anxious to go them one better in
basketball's most competitive arena.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he will enjoy the United States," Yao's associate said.
"To be able to live free on his own will be big. It doesn't matter
where he is."</TE>
<TE>   When he visited Nike headquarters in Portland, Ore., Yao was
impressed by the clean air and water in Oregon. "When reporters asked
him what he thought of America," Nichols said, "he said, 'You have so
much room.'"</TE>
<TE>   As they toured America by van, the 17-year-old Yao's quiet sense
of mission impressed Nichols. "He didn't talk much about playing in
the NBA,' Nichols said. "His interest was in developing an NBA team
in China. He has a real pride in his country."</TE>
<TE>   Yao's league statistics are mind-boggling. He shot more than 70
percent from the field and better than 80 percent on free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever expectations most lottery picks have for themselves are
multiplied by 1.3 billion Chinese hoping for Yao's NBA success. "'Yao
Ming looks at this as a challenge," his associate said. "He knows
he's not the best in the world. He's far from being a polished
player, but he once told me his job is to win games.</TE>
<TE>   "The Nobel Prize will find its scientists; Oscar will find its
actors, but Yao's duty and responsibility is to win games for his
clubs and be the best that he can be to make his country proud. If he
feels the pressure, he probably welcomes it."</TE>

<HD>Figure Skating's Farce Should Cost It Olympics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHNETTE HOWARD</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before anyone sends the padded wagon, let me preface what I'm about
to say by acknowledging it will never happen. But I'm going to set
this down on paper anyway, perhaps wrap a fish in it tomorrow, and
file my notes away in some folder called, "Ideas Whose Time Have Not
Come."</LD>
<LD>   Because this needs to be said.</LD>
<LD>   Figure skating should be kicked out of the Olympics.</LD>
<TE>   If the International Skating Union's farcical two-day hearings in
Lausanne, Switzerland, on Monday and Tuesday proved anything, it's
that the figure skating racket--it's too corrupt to be called a
sport--is incapable or uninterested in policing itself.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently the ISU learned nothing from Sarah Hughes' legitimate
victory in the Olympic women's competition and the acclaim that
followed because the judges finally did the right thing--rewarding
the best skater that night with the biggest prize on the sport's most
important night of the year.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the now-infamous French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne
and her federation chief, Didier Gailhaguet, were suspended by the
ISU's executive council for three years for trying to fix the pairs
skating competition at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in
February. The International Skating Union's executive council
considered testimony from no fewer than 13 people, and found the
evidence persuasive.</TE>
<TE>   Which begs an obvious question: Why weren't Le Gougne and
Gailhauget banned for life?</TE>
<TE>   They should have been. Result-fixing is among the worst sins in
sports.</TE>
<TE>   Now, something figure skating used to be able to claim--that its
events were authentic competition among athletes who also excel at
being artists--has been shattered.</TE>
<TE>   Figure skaters are athletes, all right. Don't let anyone tell you
they're not.</TE>
<TE>   But if you rig results without regard to skaters' efforts or
abilities, then what they do is performance. It's not sport. The
essence of sport is authentic competition.</TE>
<TE>   Without it, figure skating is an exhibition, something no better
or different than pro wrestling. But at least the World Wresting
Federation admits its shows are scripted.</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating can't guarantee that its are not.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the same testimony the ISU used to punish Le Gougne and
Gailhaguet on Tuesday has illuminated how corrupt figure skating is.
In the course of the investigation, more spinoff stories have sprung
up about more vote-fixing or score-manipulating at other major events
dating back years. The demonstrated lack of concern among ISU
officials not only is appalling but crosses all national borders.</TE>
<TE>   Almost lost this week in all the words written about the
punishment to Le Gougne or Gailhaguet, or their overheated threats to
fight their sanctions, was an Associated Press report detailing how
two Americans, Olympic pairs referee Ron Pfenning and Jon Jackson, a
skating judge who testified that he witnessed a confession of
vote-fixing by Le Gougne, asked the ISU council to bar U.S. member
Claire Ferguson from the French duo's hearing this week.</TE>
<TE>   According to Pfenning and Jackson, Ferguson believed that Le
Gougne and Gailhaguet should not be punished or should receive only
light penalties. They said Ferguson told them last month at the world
championships in Japan that although she had not yet seen evidence
gathered by ISU investigators, she believed Gailhaguet acted the same
way dozens of other federation chiefs have in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Lovely.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than treat this like a cancer that needs to be cut out, the
ISU keeps treating it like a public-relations crisis that it wants to
go away. So the ISU seems to have decided that a containment policy
is the best strategy. They've chosen to spank one judge and one
crooked official, then wash their hands and declare, "Well, that was
annoying. How 'bout we all move on?"</TE>
<TE>   But it won't work, if only because what we're left with now is the
cheaters--Le Gougne and Gailhaguet--threatening to sing until they
spill every nefarious story they know. Which is just further proof
how badly the ISU blew it. By failing to go far enough with its
investigation, the ISU has left it to the cheaters to position
themselves as the conscience of the sport.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to kill a dog, you say it has rabies," Gailhaguet
said. "But watch out, the dog can turn into a wolf. I will not be
done in by Anglo-Saxon lobbying. ... What happened at the Olympic
Games has left me with a thirst for revenge."</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, why should the rest of the Olympics let figure
skating drag them down?</TE>
<TE>   Stop the music. Send 'em all slinking off to the kiss-and-cry
area. Kick them out.</TE>

<HD>Facing Next Chapter In Their Lives</HD>
<DH>Jurisprudence: Former basketball star Jayson Williams, his
family and friends prepare for what could be a tumultuous
manslaughter trial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ALEXANDER NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Tanya Williams is beautiful. Tall, black, with blond hair and
features worthy of a model, she has a gracious, elegant manner. She
does not give off the air of a woman who cries a lot, or worries that
her new husband will, say, spend years two through 30 of their
marriage in prison.</LD>
<LD>   This composure is not always easy to maintain. Last Wednesday, for
example, Tanya's husband, former NBA star and NBC commentator Jayson
Williams, was indicted by a New Jersey grand jury on charges of
aggravated manslaughter, reckless manslaughter, aggravated assault
and witness and evidence tampering. A companion was hit with two
tampering charges; another recently reached a plea agreement to
testify for the prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the indictments are not a surprise. On Feb. 25, prosecutors
filed charges against Williams stemming from the Feb. 14 shooting
death of a limousine driver at the Williamses' sprawling house in
rural New Jersey. And though the indictments carry stronger penalties
than the original charges, the day before they came down, Tanya was
relatively serene.</LD>
<TE>   "In the first couple of days, you cling to what you know, you
cling to what you know is real," said Tanya, a lawyer who only now is
starting to talk publicly about what the Williamses' lives have been
like since what they call "the accident."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, 34, is free on $270,000 bail and is operating under
legal advice not to speak at all. A date for his arraignment was not
immediately scheduled. Tanya, 33, is reticent to speak as well.
Neither she nor Williams wants to say or do anything that would
insult the family of Costas "Gus" Christofi, the driver who was
killed, but their lives do go on.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually, you have to let the pendulum swing back to normal,
even though you fully realize that normal will never be what it was
February 13th," Tanya says. A spiritual person, she doesn't think she
is in denial.</TE>
<TE>   "I just haven't had that night in the dark room with the door
closed, crying," she says. "You do think about it, you think about it
every day. But God has just granted us a state of peace."</TE>
<TE>   The shooting happened in their bedroom. It was around 2:30 a.m.,
already Valentine's Day, and Williams was at the house with four
members of the Harlem Globetrotters and a crew of friends, having
been driven home from a Globetrotters game by Christofi. Williams
didn't know Christofi well--he had been hired for the evening. But
Williams has a wide smile and a booming laugh, and he makes friends
easily. He invited Christofi, a sports fan, inside for a tour.
Christofi, 55, accepted.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a beautiful house," Tanya says of the estate Williams named
''Who Knew?'' in homage to his good fortune in signing an $86 million
guaranteed contract with the New Jersey Nets in January 1999. Two
months after the contract was signed, Williams suffered the first of
a series of leg injuries that eventually forced him to retire from
the NBA. His playing career was over, but the 40-room house he helped
his father's construction company build continued to be his
showpiece.</TE>
<TE>   That night, his tour led Christofi through the bedroom, where
prosecutors allege he began playfully handling one of the 12-gauge
shotguns he kept there. The gun went off and the shot lodged in
Christofi's chest. There has never been any contention that Williams
intentionally tried to kill Christofi. Still, the severity of the
indictment means the prosecution believes Williams acted with an
"extreme indifference to human life."</TE>
<TE>   The severity of Williams's charges partly rests on the
prosecutor's contention that his behavior was reckless, not merely
careless. Det. Lt. Daniel James, who has been leading the
investigation along with a detective from the New Jersey State
police, believes the distinction is clear. "You're not supposed to
throw bowling balls outside a window because there's a reasonable
expectation that if you do, someone is going to get hurt," he says.
"This is similar."</TE>
<TE>   Just as damning is what police believe happened next. After
shooting Christofi, Williams allegedly tried to portray the driver's
death as a suicide, wiping his own fingerprints from the gun and
pressing Christofi's limp hand to the trigger. The state believes
Williams then directed two of the other men in the house, Kent
Culuko, 29, and John Gordnick, 44, to get rid of Williams's
blood-splattered clothing and lie to investigators about it.</TE>
<TE>   This contention was supported last month when Gordnick's lawyer
provided acting prosecutor Steve Lember with the clothing Williams
allegedly was wearing at the time of the shooting, different clothing
than Williams had given Lember. Last week, Culuko pleaded guilty to
tampering charges, agreeing to testify against Williams and Gordnick.</TE>
<TE>   Lember acknowledges it is possible that Williams, having never
intended to shoot anyone, might have panicked at the sight of a dead
man on his floor, causing him to mislead the police. "But at some
point, in my opinion, panic becomes calculation," Lember said in a
recent interview at his office in Flemington, N.J. "I have no doubt
that when an unintended death occurs, there's panic. But at what
point do you step back and say, 'I have to do the right thing?'"</TE>
<TE>   Tanya will only say that she was out on the night of the shooting,
not where she was. She also will not say whether she and Williams
have returned to sleeping in their bedroom. She does grant, though,
that the police tape has been down for some time, and that the couple
feels wholly comfortable in their house, despite what happened there.
"It's what you share, inside the four walls, that make where you live
a home, and that hasn't changed for us at all," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She adds she is surprised by Culuko's plea bargain but doesn't
believe it will make the prosecution's case. "We're very comfortable
with the facts, I think when they come out, people will be satisfied
with them," she says. "We are innocent."</TE>
<TE>   She is hardly a flashy NBA wife although it is easy to see her
paired with Williams, long one of the league's more popular figures.
Smart and engaging, she is not practicing law but has a law degree
from Yeshiva University, a school she says she picked "just to get a
different perspective, keep learning." She and Williams go back to
their days as St. John's University undergraduates. Both basketball
players, they dated for a while, then went their separate ways after
leaving St. John's.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until a few years ago, after Williams built a career as
one of the best rebounders in the NBA, that a mutual friend
facilitated their reunion. "It was just like turning one page to the
other, like picking right up where we left off," she says. They were
married within two years. They started talking about having kids.
They never talked about the possibility of something like this.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they try to be normal under the most abnormal of
circumstances. They still talk about how many children they want,
plan vacations. They do not go to New York clubs or make appearances
at high-profile events the way they used to, but they do not feel
deprived. They know that among those involved in this case, others
are in much more pain.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, the other, calmer parts of their lives are still in
evidence; Williams and his father, who lives nearby, meet nearly
every morning to take care of the sheep, cattle, goats and horses
that populate the estate's farm. Williams still helps his father at
the construction company. Two weeks ago, he ran a basketball camp for
underprivileged children.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the kids knew little if anything about the shooting, and
while Tanya says she is not naive enough to think that some adults
may have kept their children away because of the incident, no one has
approached either her or Williams with an unkind word. "People have
been very supportive, and I would know," she says. "I'm out there. I
go to our grocery store, the Chinese restaurant. People have been
nice."</TE>
<TE>   It might help that the Williamses live in Hunterdon County, far
from the in-your-face rush of New York City. With 121,989 residents,
Hunterdon is one of the most financially well-off-parts of New
Jersey. The most recent set of crime statistics report two murders in
a 10-year stretch. When pressed, the only thing Lember can compare
the Williams case to is the Lindbergh trial, the 1935 proceedings
that sent Bruno Hauptmann to the electric chair for allegedly
kidnapping the baby of aviator Charles Lindbergh from his Hunterdon
County house.</TE>
<TE>   Lember knows the Williams case will be watched closely; this is
far from the first time Williams has been in trouble with either guns
or the law. In an autobiography published two years ago, Williams
describes an incident on his shooting range in which he accidentally
almost shot New York Jets wide receiver Wayne Chrebet. In 1994,
Williams was charged with firing an automatic pistol at an empty
security van outside the Nets' arena. A judge dropped the charges in
exchange for community service, but the prosecutor in the case was
outraged.</TE>
<TE>   If Williams goes to trial, Lember will bring up the 1994 case as
evidence that Williams knew that handling a gun playfully was wrong,
and if Lember is looking to paint Williams as a wild character, a
spate of other, less-serious incidents and alterations are on record.
Also on record are accounts of Williams's generosity. When he was 20,
he began raising the two children of his two sisters, both dying of
AIDS. He has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for charities.</TE>
<TE>   Since the shooting, though, neither portrayal of Williams may
solely fit.</TE>
<TE>   "You go through something like this, it changes you. All the
facades are pulled away," Tanya says. "For him, it was an awakening,
to see 'What is the lesson here? Where do you go from here?' I think
he's really gotten back in touch with the essence of who he is. And I
think he can look at himself and say, 'I'm still a good man.'</TE>
<TE>   "We know there are people who have been through much worse than
this, and there is a man who is dead, so you just try to have
perspective," Tanya says. She refuses to think of being in that big
house, alone, with Williams in prison. She refuses to crumble into a
scrap heap of worry. She smiles as she describes their nightly
routine, which is to pop in a tape of an old television show, "The
Jeffersons," before they go to sleep.</TE>
<TE>   "Jayson loves 'The Jeffersons.' He has every episode on tape and I
think he knows every word," she says, and, as she laughs, the charm
bracelet around her right wrist shakes. There is just one ornament on
it right now, a star of David.</TE>
<TE>   "David is my favorite story in the Bible," she says. "He was God's
favorite king, even though he was not a perfect man. He sinned, but
he was strong in his salvation. I like that."</TE>

<LD>With prices exceeding $3,000 per week at many of the United States'
top spas, a spa vacation can be anything but relaxing for the
budget-minded traveler--especially because expenses climb even higher
when the cost of specialized treatments, such as facials or massages,
is added.</LD>
<LD>   Cross the border, either north or south, and the picture is
different. In Canada, the Caribbean and Mexico, it's possible to
spend a vacation toning and trimming (or exfoliating and mud-bathing)
for less than $130 a day, including meals and activities. At many of
these across-the-border spas, individualized treatments are included
in the package.</LD>
<LD>   Rates are lowest in Mexico. A facility called Rio Caliente, for
example, charges $115 per person, per day in a double room, including
meals. Add $48 for a one-hour massage, $16 for a mud wrap.</LD>
<TE>   About an hour by taxi from the Guadalajara airport, Rio Caliente
is in a pine-forested valley and is known for its springs. Many
guests come to "take the waters" in one of four heavily salted and
mineral-rich (lithium and selenium) pools or in a natural steam room.
There are daily yoga and aerobics classes, guided hikes and a
vegetarian meal plan low in sodium and fat.</TE>
<TE>   The social program and setting at Rio Caliente are not what one
would find at a standard resort. Children are not admitted, and a
relaxed atmosphere prevails over the 30-acre facility. Request
bookings or brochures from Spa Vacations Ltd., P.O. Box 897,
Millbrae, CA 94030; (800) 200-2927, www.riocaliente.com, which
represents the spa in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The nearest Mexican equivalent to our luxury spas, the large (250
suites) and well-equipped Ixtapan Resort Hotel and Spa emphasizes its
thermal pools and Roman baths but also takes pains to limit its spa
guests to diet meals of 900 calories a day. On the all-inclusive,
seven-day spa-and-sports program, which costs $914 per person, double
occupancy, guests take a daily morning walk followed by a massage.
They then choose from a guided mountain bike ride, a tennis or golf
lesson, an aerobics class or sightseeing at La Estrella Caves or the
pre-Columbian Teotenango ruins (all covered by the initial price).
Don't confuse this location with Ixtapa on the Pacific Coast; this is
near Ixtapan de la Sal, south of Mexico City, and also near the
silver-producing city of Taxco. For brochures or bookings, call (800)
638-7950 or visit www.spamexico.com.</TE>
<TE>   For a West Indies vacation, the spot to pick is Le Grand Courlan
Resort and Spa, Tobago's first spa facility. A deluxe resort in the
high spring season, the Courlan is dropping its rates 56% to attract
visitors for summer and autumn. A nightly package, based on double
occupancy and a two-night minimum, will come to $124 per person,
including all meals, exercise classes and one spa treatment per
person. Among your choices are fresh-fruit facials, compression
massages, body wraps, hydrotherapy and aromatherapy. While the
on-site restaurants don't limit the menus to spa cuisine,
lower-calorie and vegetarian options are available on request. Add to
this a lovely beachfront setting and nightly entertainment. To get
these rates, contact Spa Finder at (800) ALL-SPAS (255-7727) or find
it on the Web at www.spafinder.com.</TE>
<TE>   North of the border, the Auberge du Parc, in the French-speaking
province of Quebec, is holding a sale.</TE>
<TE>   Seven-night stays, including three meals a day and three hours of
spa treatments per day, are going for $863--that's $123 per night
(U.S., not Canadian). The Auberge is a Victorian mansion with 32
guest rooms in a 17-acre wooded park. More for pampering than weight
loss, the spa's main focus is "thalassotherapy"--a water treatment
believed by many to be restorative and helpful for chronic muscular
pain.</TE>
<TE>   The spa also offers electrotherapy, lymphatic drainage massage,
algae wraps and reflexology massage. Auberge has a fitness center,
indoor and outdoor saltwater pools, a tennis court and a nine-hole
golf course. This package is offered by Spa Finders through June 15.</TE>

<HD>Princess' Star Ship Enterprise Makes Massive Just Seem--Big</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 109,000 tons and carrying 2,600 passengers, Princess Cruises' new
Star Princess is the largest passenger ship ever to cruise the
Pacific. The L.A.-based giant, built in Italy, had to cruise through
the Suez Canal and across the Pacific to arrive at its California
home port because, at 159 feet across, it is too wide for the Panama
Canal.</LD>
<LD>   We sailed on the Star Princess' inaugural round-trip cruise from
Los Angeles to the Mexican Riviera in mid-March, a seven-day
itinerary that will be offered from Sept. 21 to May 3, 2003. During
the summer, the ship will sail seven-day Gulf of Alaska itineraries
between Vancouver, Canada, and Seward, Alaska.</LD>
<LD>   Although the ship is enormous, we heard few passengers comment
about its size; indeed, the only time we were aware of its girth was
when we took an amidships or aft elevator to reach our forward cabin.
A walk down the corridor emphasized the vessel's 935 feet.</LD>
<TE>   On the top five decks are the nightclub and its glass-enclosed
moving sidewalk suspended 150 feet above the sea, open decks and
swimming pools, the children's and teen areas, gym, spa, sports areas
and 24-hour food court. You'll also find a swim-against-the-tide lap
pool, a nine-hole putting green and a pair of golf simulators that
allow you to "play" one of the world's top courses for $20 for half
an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Decks 8 through 12 house cabins, many with private verandas.</TE>
<TE>   The major indoor public areas, on Decks 5, 6 and 7, include the
show lounge, casino and bars, library, card room, shops, dining rooms
and photo and art galleries. A large 24-hour Internet cafe was not
working during our voyage. On Deck 7 are a small wedding chapel and
two specialty restaurants: Tequila's, with Southwestern cuisine and a
surcharge of $8 (which includes a margarita), and Sabatini's, with
all-you-can eat Italian food or a caviar and seafood brunch on days
at sea for a $15 charge.</TE>
<TE>   Families will appreciate the enlarged spa areas as well as
children's play areas, both much bigger than those on sister ships
Grand Princess and Golden Princess. Operated by Steiners, the new
Lotus Spa emphasizes Asian and Pacific treatments, including chakra
stone therapy, a 90-minute massage with oils and heated stones that
costs $158.</TE>
<TE>   The children's area was popular during our March 16 sailing, which
had 200 kids aboard. Divided by age--2- to 5-year-olds, 6- and
7-year-olds, 8- to 12-year-olds and 13- to 17-year-olds--each group
has its own activity and social area; small children also have a
swimming pool and an enclosed outdoor play area.</TE>
<TE>   In the gym, the 11 treadmills have sign-up sheets for
reservations. The best time to get to the equipment, we found, was
early mornings or on days in port.</TE>
<TE>   The entertainment aboard was excellent, with two production shows
presented during the week, along with several variety acts such as
comedians, jugglers and magicians, and live music in six lounges
during the evening.</TE>
<TE>   The smallest inside cabins measure 160 square feet, standard
outsides are up to 210 feet, balcony cabins are from 215 to 325
square feet and suites are from 515 square feet. Each contains two
lower beds that convert to one queen-size bed; a mini-refrigerator;
generous closet space; personal safe; TV; and bath with shower.
Mini-suites and suites also include a tub in the bathroom as well as
a seating area, desk/dresser, two TVs and a walk-in closet.</TE>
<TE>   Princess veterans will notice a new cost-conscious attitude
aboard. Instead of finding bathrobes, bowls of fruit and shower caps
in the cabins, passengers will need to order them from the
housekeeping department; there is no extra charge. Caviar did not
show up on the regular dining room menus during our sailing except in
Sabatini's, one of the alternative restaurants, and a daily fax
printout of the news is no longer distributed.</TE>
<TE>   Princess offers two dining options: "personal choice," which
allows passengers to dine when and wherever they choose, and
traditional dining, in which passengers are assigned a particular
dining room, table and time, with the same waiters and table
companions nightly. Passengers on the traditional schedule are
encouraged to take off one or more evenings to sample open-seating
dining. Dining room and cabin service tips are automatically added
onto the individual's shipboard account ($10 per person per day). The
Mexican Riviera cruise sails Saturday afternoons from Los Angeles,
spends two days at sea on the way to Puerto Vallarta, then calls in
Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas before spending one day at sea on the
return to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Fares begin at $1,039 per person, double occupancy, plus
government fees and taxes of $25.64. Port charges are included.</TE>
<TE>   In Alaska, Star Princess will sail Saturdays beginning May 11
between Vancouver and Seward, calling at the Alaskan ports of
Ketchikan, Juneau and Skagway and sailing College Fjord, Glacier Bay
and the Inside Passage. Brochure fares begin at $1,099 per person,
double occupancy, plus $26.76 in government fees and taxes, but most
travel agents can negotiate lower ticket prices with early booking
discounts.</TE>
<TE>   Shore excursions director James Eaton advises passengers to go
online at www.princesscruises.com to book excursions as early as
possible, because some sell out quickly. The tours are not paid for
in advance and may be canceled without penalty after boarding the
ship. Booking on the Internet, Eaton says, enables passengers to get
immediate confirmation for space on the selected tour. Among the most
popular new excursions on the Mexican Riviera itinerary are a dolphin
encounter ($75) and a swim with the dolphins ($130) in Puerto
Vallarta.</TE>

Cruises at (800) PRINCESS (774-6237), www.princesscruises.com.</TE>

Resort puts itself on sale in summer. Sure, it's hot (triple-digit

relax in poolside cabanas. One-bedroom suites start at $99 from May
24 to early September; the price then increases to $169. Children 18

<HD>Technology, Attacks Leave Courier Travel Up in the Air</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Times staff</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, a person who had flexible travel plans and the
ability to cram a week's worth of gear into a carry-on bag could save
up to half off international air fares acting as a shipping company
courier, considered one of the great travel bargains. But the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the subsequent travel industry
downturn, changes in customs regulations and increased security
measures have dealt a near knockout punch to courier travel.</LD>
<LD>   "It's effectively dead," says Kelly Monaghan, author of several
books on discount travel, including "Air Courier Bargains: How to
Travel World-Wide for Next to Nothing." "I am not even tracking it
anymore."</LD>
<LD>   A few routes with decent fares remain, mostly to the Far East, but
they often are not much cheaper than discounted consolidator prices,
Monaghan says.</LD>
<TE>   Delivery companies use couriers when they need to get shipments
between international cities. In the past, shipments often cleared
customs faster as checked baggage than as cargo, an incentive for
companies to use couriers to accompany their shipments. In return for
low-priced round-trip seats, couriers usually gave up their baggage
allowance and were limited to a carry-on.</TE>
<TE>   But computers have streamlined some customs clearance procedures,
so companies may not save much time by buying a passenger seat.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Causey, president of the International Assn. of Air Travel
Couriers (www.courier.org) in Florida, still sees consumer interest
in courier travel, but "there are not as many good deals out there."
Though many companies have gone out of business, the market is
rebounding, he says, with more flights out of the West Coast than
from New York.</TE>
<TE>   The dwindling number of companies offering courier fares and
routes has forced the Air Courier Assn. (www.aircourier.org), based
in Golden, Colo., to look for other ways to help its dues-paying
members save on air fares by offering a combination of courier,
consolidator and space-available fares. It offers half a dozen
courier routes, down from 15 a year ago, says Nat Stein, its
president. "We're positioning ourselves for the budget-minded"
traveler, he says.</TE>

<HD>Getting Into the Spirit of Lindbergh's Feat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Times staff</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In these days of four-hour transatlantic flights, it may be difficult
to imagine the enormity of Charles Lindbergh's feat. His landmark New
York-to-Paris solo flight, which departed May 20, 1927, took 331/2
hours and made him an international hero.</LD>
<LD>   The Missouri History Museum, in Forest Park about 10 minutes from
the center of St. Louis, will celebrate the aviator's life and legend
in its 75th anniversary exhibit, "Lindbergh," which continues through
Jan. 5. Memorabilia will include his flight suit, aviation gear,
medals and awards, letters and telegrams. The plane Lindbergh flew on

<LD>More trips. More family. More concern about having enough time to do
it all. Those are among the findings of a survey of 1,351 leisure
travelers by Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp; Brown, an Orlando, Fla.-based
marketing, advertising and public relations firm specializing in
travel.</LD>
<LD>   Among leisure travelers, 36% say they will travel more this year,
according to Peter C. Yesawich, president and CEO of the firm. If
those plans work out, that would translate into 6% more leisure
trips.</LD>
<LD>   The "gray cloud" that has hung over the travel industry since the
Sept. 11 attacks "has dissipated," said Yesawich, who presented
results of the 2002 National Leisure Travel Monitor at a news
conference last week in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<TE>   The number of people who went to see family and friends increased
by 17%, a result of fears generated by the terrorist attacks. But
Americans still don't think they have enough time for vacation; 55%
said their time off isn't sufficient, and more than a quarter say
they would trade a raise for more vacation time.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-eight percent surveyed cited California as a prime vacation
spot among states, second only to Florida (40%), followed by Colorado
and Hawaii (tied at 19%) and Arizona (18%).</TE>

<LD>The State Department recently issued a new warning on Peru, urging
U.S. citizens to be alert to terrorist activity by Sendero Luminoso
and other groups, particularly in the weeks before and after May 17,
an anniversary for such groups. The advisory said there are
indications that terrorist organizations are planning actions against
Americans and asked U.S. citizens to avoid crowds, especially areas
that draw Americans. The State Department also updated information on
the Philippines, noting that there have been armed attacks, slayings,
bombings and other violent incidents against foreigners. For updates,

<HD>Oh, the Tales They Tell in Coronado</HD>
<DH>Walking tour of the San Diego island reveals 460 years of
history in a few easy steps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRAIG NAKANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CORONADO, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The tour guide held up a 1901 photo that was instantly recognizable
but nonetheless befuddling. Surely that was the Hotel del Coronado in
the distance, its unmistakable Victorian cupolas rising above the
Pacific shore.</LD>
<LD>   But in the foreground, where 15-story condominium towers now cast
a shadow toward the Hotel Del's red-roofed whimsy, the grainy picture
showed something different: Tent City.</LD>
<LD>   For $4.50 per week, the oceanfront view came with all the basics a
vacationer needed: canvas roof and walls, bed, dresser, washbasin and
flush toilets. Never mind that the sewer drained right offshore.</LD>
<TE>   And never mind the Hotel Del and its guest list of the rich and
famous. For the vacationing masses--more than 10,000 guests a year at
its peak--Tent City defined the Coronado experience from 1900 to
1939. Before the town welcomed the likes of Charlie Chaplin, Marilyn
Monroe and "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" author L. Frank Baum, this
emerald city looked a lot like sixth-grade camp.</TE>
<TE>   My education on Coronado's past began with a walking tour last
fall. With the help of an entertaining guide and some historic
photos, the town's story came into sharper focus. It's a tale of
entrepreneurs seeking riches, royals chasing love and a construction
crew so intent on building the West's most magnificent resort in
record time that they didn't bother with blueprints.</TE>
<TE>   I arrived one Friday night with sketchy plans of my own, lured by
a good deal at the Coronado Island Marriott Resort. I checked in
late, just in time for a full night's rest. That proved important
since the next day started with my sole planned activity, a tour de
force named Nancy Cobb.</TE>
<TE>   Cobb leads a 90-minute walking tour of Coronado at 11 a.m.
Tuesdays and Saturdays (reservations, [619] 435-5993). On Thursdays a
colleague gives the same tour, which begins at the 100-room Glorietta
Bay Inn, the former mansion of John D. Spreckels, son of sugar baron
Claus Spreckels.</TE>
<TE>   The chatty Cobb blitzed through 460 years of Coronado history for
me and nine others, starting with the day Spanish explorer Juan
Rodriguez Cabrillo anchored in San Diego Bay in 1542 and ending with
her commentary on the recently completed $55-million restoration of
the Hotel Del. In between we heard some fact, some fiction and a
whole lot of gossip.</TE>
<TE>   Long before connecting swampland was filled in, Coronado was
actually part of two islands owned by Josefa Bandini and Don Pedro
Carrillo, who were granted the land in 1846 as a wedding gift from
Pio Pico, the last Mexican governor of California. The happy couple
did what many sensible newlyweds do with useless gifts: They
exchanged it. Bezer Simmons, a ship captain, got the islands, and the
couple received $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Years and owners passed, as did experiments in growing wheat and
establishing a whaling station. But with no fresh water and little
rain, the land held few prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Then the dreamers arrived. In 1885, telephone executive Elisha
Babcock Jr. and piano company founder Hampton Story bought the land
with partners for $110,000, certain they could turn barren soil into
Shangri-La: tracts of homes and a luxury hotel, all blessed with
breezes and sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   At this point the island still had no name, so local newspapers
held a reader contest.</TE>
<TE>   Among the options presented to Babcock and Story: Shining Shore.
Welcome City. Hiawatha. Belulah.</TE>
<TE>   They chose Coronado, from the Spanish meaning "the crowned one,"
because their resort was to be king of the West. The owners then
turned their attention to the jewel in their crown, the Hotel Del.</TE>
<TE>   Near the hotel site, a planing mill and ironworks were built
quickly, as was a kiln that turned out 150,000 bricks a day, by one
estimate.</TE>
<TE>   A 3,000-foot pipeline under the bay brought fresh water from San
Diego. So much lumber was floated on rafts from San Francisco and the
Pacific Northwest--a million feet were on site at one point--that
smoking was banned.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven months after construction began, the Hotel Del welcomed its
first guests.</TE>
<TE>   Building a first-class hotel from the ground up--as well as homes,
streets, a ferry landing and recreation facilities--drove the project
deeply into the red. When the finances went sour, sugar heir John
Spreckels stepped in.</TE>
<TE>   In 1889, a year after the hotel opened, Spreckels and his brothers
bought a controlling interest in Babcock and Story's company. They
spruced up the hotel, dredged a proper ferry landing and built a
racetrack, an ostrich farm and a labyrinth for guests.</TE>
<TE>   Camp Coronado, later known as Tent City, followed. Tents offered
modern conveniences such as electricity, provided by the hotel's
mammoth generator. Japanese gardens, a public library, a band
pavilion, tennis courts, a Ferris wheel and a children's carousel
(today turning in Balboa Park) kept the masses entertained. But 39
years after opening, Tent City closed, a victim of shifting tastes.
America's growing love of cars and the burgeoning construction of
roads and highways spawned an intimidating, newfangled competitor:
the motel.</TE>
<TE>   We followed Cobb from the old Spreckels mansion to the Hotel Del.
Through monolithic picture windows, we could see the vast
Crown-Coronet dining room, the sugar-pine ceiling held up with
neither pillars nor nails (strictly tongue-and-groove joints) and
lighted with Baum-designed chandeliers shaped like king's crowns.</TE>
<TE>   The royal treatment brought notables, and as we strolled around
the hotel, we tried to imagine the days when Chaplin played polo,
when Hollywood types like novelist and screenwriter Anita Loos
("Gentlemen Prefer Blondes") camped out at Tent City and when
muckraker Upton Sinclair wintered here in a house on J Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The hotel was party central, welcoming Mae West, John Barrymore,
Babe Ruth, Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler and such dignitaries as
President Franklin Roosevelt and Edward, Prince of Wales.</TE>
<TE>   We walked past the hotel's Prince of Wales restaurant and the
expansive Windsor Lawn, then marched on along Ocean Boulevard, where
the Del was renovating two cottages on the beach into guestrooms. The
eight units, next to the beach house where Marilyn Monroe stayed
during the filming of "Some Like It Hot," have since opened with peak
weekend rates starting at $1,650 per night.</TE>
<TE>   We reached the nondescript house where L. Frank Baum spent his
winters, partying at the Hotel Del by night and crafting the
adventures of Dorothy and Toto by day. (He wrote six "Oz" books here
in all.) Across the street in Star Park, Cobb pulled out a sweet
black-and-white photo of the author at this spot, reading a book to a
ring of smiling schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Cobb's yellow brick road had come to an end, but a couple of
blocks away I found more history at the Coronado Historical Society's
Museum of History and Art (www.coronadohistory.org), open daily. The
space is a jewel box of artifacts documenting Coronado since its
diamond-in-the-rough days: early maps detailing Babcock and Story's
dream; 1927 newspaper clippings reporting Charles Lindbergh's
departure from Coronado to New York, where he continued on to Paris
on his historic transatlantic flight; and a photo of President
Richard Nixon in 1970, when he held the first state dinner outside
the White House for Mexican President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz at the Hotel
Del.</TE>
<TE>   My dinner that night at Chez Loma, a converted 1889 home near the
museum, was stately too: Normandy onion soup, baked with a layer of
Gruyere; boeuf bourguignon, burgundy-braised sirloin and mushrooms
over pasta; and for dessert, creme caramel.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning I explored the Marriott, a low-slung complex of
nicely furnished rooms set amid gardens and ponds. (Nightly rates at
the time of my visit started at $139 plus tax; weekend rates this
spring and summer start at $229.) The gentle splash of fountains was
the only noticeable sound in a remarkably quiet complex.</TE>
<TE>   After a workout and massage at the hotel spa, I pulled on my
in-line skates and wobbled along the waterfront promenade backing the
resort. The rest of the afternoon was crammed with Coronado
attractions: a ferry ride across the bay to San Diego and back; a
walk past the shops on the main drag, Orange Avenue; a drive along
Silver Strand State Beach, the slender strip connecting Coronado to
south San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The highlight, though, was at the Hotel Del, where I had lunch on
the rear terrace with two San Diego friends, Matt and Liz Fitzsimons.
The menu at the hotel's Sheerwater restaurant consisted of crab
cakes, a chicken wrap with roasted peppers and asadero cheese, and
crispy taro with wok-seared vegetables, all matched with a view of
sand, surf and sky.</TE>
<TE>   With a table overlooking the Windsor Lawn, it was easy to feel
like royalty. And by the time we were ready to leave, Babcock and
Story's dream didn't seem so farfetched after all.</TE>

<HD>A Second Renaissance in Harlem</HD>
<DH>A new excitement is brewing in the historic heart of urban
black America.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONIQUE M. TAYLOR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Noisy, diesel-belching tour buses routinely roll uptown headed for
the heart of Harlem. Some residents call them "drive-bys."</LD>
<LD>   "The bus comes by. Cameras go off. Then they're gone," said
Anthony Bowman, co-owner of the Harlem Gift Shop. "There's no
exchange if you only roll off a bus."</LD>
<LD>   The exchange, as Bowman called it, is a deeper interaction with
Harlem and its people. The neighborhood, covering much of the north
end of Manhattan above Central Park, isn't on the itinerary of many
tourists. But it's one of New York City's most rewarding spots, a
community where America's past, present and future are all
dramatically represented. Walking tours--on your own or with a
guide--allow you to take in a treasure trove of history while
day-to-day life pulses around you.</LD>
<TE>   Named by early Dutch settlers, Harlem had few black residents
until a wave of white flight at the beginning of the 20th
century--the product of failed real estate speculation, a growing
black presence and a frustrating wait for a rail line connecting to
lower Manhattan. The Great Migration of the late 19th century drew
thousands of Southern blacks to New York, and black real estate
agents steered clients to Harlem.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood became the heart of the 1920s Negro Renaissance,
a social movement that wed art and activism. As a center of urban
black America, it was home to churches, hospitals and other important
institutions.</TE>
<TE>   Harlem was a mecca for black activists, intellectuals, painters
and musicians. Writers Langston Hughes, Nella Larsen and Zora Neale
Hurston and political figures Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Marcus Garvey
and Malcolm X are among those whose contributions are memorialized in
buildings, parks, housing projects and street names throughout the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Today the area's architectural grandeur rubs elbows with
scaffolding announcing gentrification, as well as boarded-up,
burned-out emblems of past neglect. The arrival of Bill Clinton, who
set up an office on 125th Street last year, coincided with a burst of
public and private development that put Harlem in the spotlight
again. A smattering of new cafes, galleries, gift shops and boutique
hotels signals a percolating tourist industry.</TE>
<TE>   When I was a child living in suburban Washington, D.C., Harlem was
a place where I visited relatives. Faded family snapshots capture
Aunts Anne and Skeeter and Uncles Bud and Ty helping me grow up back
when. These same relatives put me up in 1988 when, as a Harvard
graduate student, I started field research on gentrification in
Harlem.</TE>
<TE>   But visiting as a tourist was to be something different. This
time, a high-school friend's 40th birthday party in February brought
me to New York. The invitation's hotel suggestions included one that
caught my eye: the Harlem Flophouse, a 11/2-year-old boutique hotel
on 123rd Street. I booked myself for a weekend stay, and Demetra, a
friend from Maine, joined me on her first Harlem visit.</TE>
<TE>   The Harlem Flophouse is run by Rene Calvo, a writer from
Massachusetts who has lived in New York for 15 years. Tucked between
7th and 8th avenues, the three-room hotel is in the heart of Harlem.
The house, a four-story 1890s brownstone, was in the throes of
restoration during our stay. Calvo, who is still searching for the
right Victorian-era wallpaper, said he wants to restore the
building's grandeur without erasing its "torrid past."</TE>
<TE>   "Beautiful and rough around the edges, a little funky," is how he
described the place in a conversation after my visit. A parlor with
two kitschy orange sofas and a fireplace opens out to the kitchen on
the spacious first floor, where guests relax, socialize and soak in
Latin jazz. In a quirky nod to the brownstone's rooming-house past, a
claw-footed tub occupies a corner of the parlor, showing off old jazz
LPs rescued from the garbage during renovation.</TE>
<TE>   Second- and third-floor guest rooms are spacious and simply
furnished--radios but no TVs or telephones. The maple, oak and
Peruvian walnut floors, fireplaces and alcoves with built-in cabinets
add turn-of-the-century charm.</TE>
<TE>   Calvo hopes that the Flophouse name--harking back to the places
where jazz musicians stayed--will attract painters and other artists.
He has hosted two exhibits and offers an "artist rate," $75 versus
the $90 I paid for a double. But for now he receives mainly
non-artists--German, Italian, French and Scandinavian tourists as
well as African American couples looking for a romantic getaway.</TE>
<TE>   Demetra and I started our visit by meeting a friend, Maria, for
lunch at one of my old favorites, a local coffee shop called Pan Pan,
where we found her at the low Formica counter swapping astrological
information with a woman seated on the next stool.</TE>
<TE>   On summer days after my library research, I used to slip in here
and nurse the same iced tea for hours. People don't come to Pan Pan
simply to order coffee or grits. They come in, well, to come in.
Maria was happily going at a plate of salmon cakes, recommended by
her new friend. Demetra and I settled on cheeseburgers and fries.</TE>
<TE>   After lunch we emerged into a brisk but sunny afternoon for a
self-guided walking tour. The corner outside Pan Pan is rich with
pillars of Harlem society: Harlem Hospital and the Schomburg Center
for Research in Black Culture, plus a historic branch of the New York
Public Library and the YMCA. Demetra loved "The Autobiography of
Malcolm X" and was pleased to stand before the YMCA where the civil
rights leader stayed, getting a glimpse of "his view of the world."</TE>
<TE>   We headed to Striver's Row, the nickname for the black
middle-class enclave of Stanford White townhouses. Along the way we
passed the home of James Weldon Johnson, author of "Lift Every Voice
and Sing" (a poem and later a song that became a black national
anthem of sorts), and a studio space of Harlem Renaissance
photographer James Van Der Zee, who came to prominence in the 1969
show "Harlem on My Mind" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually we circled back to 125th Street, Harlem's main
commercial thoroughfare. Also named Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard,
the street is a bustling mix of old and new. The famed Apollo
Theater, where performers such as Ella Fitzgerald and "Little Stevie
Wonder" performed at Amateur Night, is undergoing an 18-month
renovation. (AOL Time Warner held its annual shareholders meeting
here last year.) The new $65-million Harlem USA is a monstrous glass
expanse that houses Old Navy, the Disney Store and Magic Johnson
Theatres. And what's brewing at the corner of Lenox Avenue, a few
doors down from Bill Clinton's office at 55 W. 125th St.? None other
than Harlem's first Starbucks.</TE>
<TE>   Afternoon street life was loud and busy with hip-hop music and
neon signs advertising hair braids and gold jewelry. Pungent wisps of
sandalwood incense wafted from tables where piles of black history
books, $1 socks, watches, CDs and videocassettes were for sale.</TE>
<TE>   On Lenox Avenue near the north end of Central Park, we ducked into
Harlemade--a new, bright and uncluttered bookshop that also stocked
Harlem memorabilia, postcards, posters and T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   A few doors away we were drawn into Settepani, a sleek new cafe
and bakery. We sipped espresso and cappuccino and shared a fruit tart
as dusk set in. An elderly man clutching plastic shopping bags paced
before the glass case of treats, bemoaning the fact that his diabetes
forbade even a taste.</TE>
<TE>   Harlem's West Indian presence dates to World War I, and a vibrant
Caribbean commercial and political life is evident today. A Guyanese
restaurant called Flavored With One Love was our choice for dinner.
We enjoyed delicious plates of spicy curry chicken and goat
accompanied with rice and peas, string beans and chickpeas.</TE>
<TE>   We found night life at the restored Lenox Lounge. It was early
enough for us to land two stools at the bar, our vantage for an
evening of people-watching and chatting with regulars. "This is our
Cheers," said one of our bar mates.</TE>
<TE>   The next day I wanted to see Harlem through a different lens, so I
selected the guidebook "Stepping Out: Nine Walks Through New York
City's Gay and Lesbian Past."</TE>
<TE>   Demetra and I concentrated on the area around historic Mount
Morris Park, also known as Marcus Garvey Park. Elegant brownstones,
churches and apartment buildings sit amid signposts festooned with
banners announcing the neighborhood's landmark status.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for the homes of writer Hurston and Alain Locke, the
so-called father of the Harlem Renaissance, we were treated to the
magnificent Graham Court apartment building, the Olga Apartments and
a brownstone that was home to Langston Hughes. None of these
buildings is open to the public, but their exteriors--windows,
stoops, columns and arches--opened our eyes to the aesthetic sense
and sensibility of another era.</TE>
<TE>   The art scene in Harlem today also provides a richness tied to the
neighborhood's diversity. With the remaining daylight we headed for
Gallery X, a new venue showing paintings of an Iranian American
artist. Antonio Pringles, who was minding the front gallery for
Turkish owner Gulsun Erbil, offered to show us the studio in back.</TE>
<TE>   There Erbil had spun a crazy, three-dimensional web of
colors--string, glass, mirrors and spiral slivers of wood. The art
sprawled around the office and into a kitchen and the loft sleeping
space.</TE>
<TE>   At day's end we stumbled upon the Brownstone, another fabulous
discovery. "Created by women for women," the house is a cozy, shared
commercial space. Each room offered something different: clothing,
accessories, fine jewelry and art, a bridal salon, an interior design
studio, even massages and facials at the Lady Sandalwood Day Spa. It
added up to a funky mix.</TE>
<TE>   A small tearoom on the second floor offered lunch and dinner by
reservation only. Lucky to get a last-minute spot, we stayed for
dinner and found ourselves seated at a silk-wrapped table. Our
orders--Thai peanut chicken, cilantro-soaked whitefish,
carrot-and-basil-dressed salad and sweet potato chips--were
delicious.</TE>
<TE>   The meal was sophisticated and elegant, two qualities we
discovered again later that night at Showmans, a jazz club dating to
the 1940s. The long, narrow layout made for a cozy setting when the
joint reached full swing. Throaty saxophone notes played off
rat-a-tat drumming and keyboard twinkles. Up and down the bar, hands
clapped and heads nodded.</TE>
<TE>   Demetra chatted with a Japanese couple next to us. He was in New
York studying English. She was on a weekend visit. They wanted to
hear good jazz, and their guidebook had led them to Harlem. Just then
a tea-colored woman at the bar grabbed the hand of another Japanese
tourist and pulled him to an improvised dance floor. They may not
have understood each other's words, but they settled on a language
their dancing bodies knew how to speak, giving us all a glimpse of
the exchange that can happen when you get off the bus.</TE>

<HD>Cave Landing Is Also a Takeoff Point</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sculpted with coves, Cave Landing is a dramatic promontory thrusting
150 feet into San Luis Obispo Bay, just southeast of Avila Beach.</LD>
<LD>   A short path leads to a natural arch chiseled through the cliffs
at the end of the headland. Other trails cross the promontory to
views of the rugged coast here and more mellow beaches and sand dunes
farther south.</LD>
<LD>   Generations of Chumash once fished from Cave Landing. Early in the
19th century, hides and tallow produced at Mission San Luis Obispo
were loaded onto ships here.</LD>
<TE>   During the 1920s and '30s, nearby Shell Beach was a retreat for
San Joaquin Valley residents escaping the summer heat.</TE>
<TE>   This hike explores Cave Landing, then descends to crescent-shaped
Pirate's Cove. The cove has long been known as a clothing-optional
beach, though many days are too cold and windy for people to shed
their jackets, much less their swimsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The parking lot at the end of Cave Landing Road offers a trio of
trail heads. For a half-mile hike, join the path leading west from
the lot. It descends to a grassy plateau along the cliff edge, and
hikers can look for caves at the base.</TE>
<TE>   The other trails, both southbound, are described below.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From U.S. 101 in Pismo Beach, take
Avila Beach Drive two miles west to Cave Landing Road and turn left.
Drive half a mile to the parking lot at road's end.</TE>
<TE>   To reach Pirate's Cove, join the path leading southeast and almost
immediately bear left at an unsigned junction.</TE>
<TE>   After a quarter of a mile, the trail divides again. The left fork
descends to Pirate's Cove, where you can walk the beach below tall
cliffs. The right fork leads to an overlook and the rock arch I
mentioned before.</TE>
<TE>   To reach Shell Beach from the parking lot, look for a gated dirt
road curving downhill around the cove. The dirt road becomes a trail
and leads to a paved path. This walkway runs atop coastal cliffs
paralleling Bluff Drive, then leads to a small trail head and parking
area at the end of Indio Drive.</TE>
<TE>   To add another mile to your journey, look for a dirt road
beginning just above the roundabout on Indio Drive. The road heads
east, rounding a hillside above the Sunset Palisades subdivision to
Shell Beach Road.</TE>

<HD>Devoted to a Pet? Don't Leave Home Without It</HD>
<DH>For many vacationers, a trip has gone to the dogs if Fido
can't come along. An industry has arisen to keep such animal fans
happy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As plans for the annual family vacation begin to take shape, pet
owners start to think about what to do with their animals. Last year
about 14% of American adults said they recently had taken their pets
on trips, according to a survey by the Travel Industry Assn. of
America. More than three-quarters of them took the dog, 15% took the
cat and the rest took birds or other creatures.</LD>
<LD>   "More people are traveling with dogs than ever before," says Robyn
Peters, owner of the bimonthly newsletter Doggone ($25 per year;
[888] 364-8728, www.doggonefun.com), which provides subscribers with
33,000 listings of hotels and other places that accept dogs.</LD>
<LD>   The Internet site www.dogfriendly.com, which lists hundreds of
pet-welcoming hotels, parks, attractions and restaurants in the U.S.
and Canada, is averaging 1.5 to 2 million hits a month this year, up
from about 1 million a month last year, says Tara Kain, its
president. "Traveling With Your Pet," an annual compendium of
pet-loving lodgings, is one of AAA's top three retail titles, a
spokeswoman said.</LD>
<TE>   Furthermore, pet owners are begging for information on where to
take their animals. No wonder.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, fewer U.S. hotels are accepting pets--about 40% last
year, compared with nearly 60% in 1990, according to the 2001 Lodging
Survey that Smith Travel Research did for the American Hotel &amp;
Lodging Assn. Bowser's best odds are at budget hotels (60%), the
worst at luxury lodgings (33%). About a third of AAA-rated lodgings
are identified as pet friendly. But numbers don't tell the whole
story.</TE>
<TE>   "The mom-and-pop places and bed-and-breakfast inns are becoming
more pet friendly" because they see it as a niche market, says Chris
Kingsley, president and co-owner of www.petswelcome.com. (His site
lists more than 14,000 animal-friendly hotels and B&amp;Bs in North
America and also hosts a lively bulletin board.)</TE>
<TE>   Newsletter owner Peters notes that although big chain hotels seem
less willing to host dogs, several companies, including Loews,
Kimpton and Ritz-Carlton, have a reputation for being pet friendly.
Various Kimpton hotels offer doggie treats, dog-walking city maps and
videos such as (I'm not making this up) "Non-Stop Kittens." Some
Loews hotels even have room service menus for pets.</TE>
<TE>   However you choose to search for pet-friendly facilities, "always
call first," Peters says, because policies seem to change almost
hourly. Kingsley says he gets about 60 e-mails a week from places
wanting to be added to the www.petswelcome.com listings and maybe 10
asking to be removed.</TE>
<TE>   "Friendly" may not mean "free." Nearly a third of hotels charge
extra for pets, according to the 2001 Lodging Survey; some require a
refundable deposit of up to $250.</TE>
<TE>   Many hotels also require that the pet never be left alone in the
room--a Catch-22 if you want to go to a movie or a restaurant that
doesn't allow pets. Fortunately, pet-sitting is a growing field,
Kingsley says. His site lists thousands of pet sitters, as do sites
such as www.petsitters.org, maintained by the National Assn. of
Professional Pet Sitters. On its useful toll-free phone, (800)
296-PETS (296-7387), you can locate NAPPS members by ZIP Code.</TE>
<TE>   As for getting there, traveling with pets still means hitting the
road for most of us. About 87% of people who traveled with pets took
a car or an RV, and only 6% took a plane, the Travel Industry Assn.
found. That's partly because pet travel by air can be daunting.</TE>
<TE>   Let's start with airline policies. "They change frequently, and
there's no consistency from one airline to another," Peters says.</TE>
<TE>   And the rules are complicated. On April 18, Northwest's rules took
up 15 pages on its Internet site, www.nwa.com, and specified age
limits (at least 8 weeks old), sizes of kennels that may be put under
a passenger seat (a maximum of 17 by 12.3 by 8 inches), weight limits
for pets sent as checked baggage (less than 100 pounds for domestic,
150 pounds for international travel) and much more.</TE>
<TE>   In a restriction common to airlines, it bans so-called
brachycephalic (snub-nosed) dogs and cats as cargo or checked baggage
when temperatures exceed a certain level, in this case 75 degrees "at
any point on the planned itinerary." Delta's policy uses 70 degrees
as the cutoff and lists 22 breeds of dogs and four breeds of cats
that are no-goes.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest won't accept any animals as baggage or cargo if
temperatures on the itinerary are forecast to exceed 85 degrees or
drop below 10 degrees. Delta won't check pets as baggage from May 15
through Sept. 15; they can, however, be shipped as cargo as long as
temperatures are 85 degrees or cooler. Add airline partners and it
gets truly byzantine: Delta's partner Aeromexico forbids pets in the
passenger cabin "at all times," Delta says. Continental won't
transport American pit bull terriers at all, its Web site says.</TE>
<TE>   Fees vary widely too, and they have increased in the last two
years. Pets traveling in the cabin or as checked baggage typically
cost about $75 each way. Continental, which doesn't accept animals as
checked baggage (but does allow them in the cabin), requires the pets
to use a special cargo program at rates from $89 to $299 one way,
depending on weight.</TE>
<TE>   The other issue with pets traveling as cargo or checked baggage is
safety. This is passionately debated. Animal activists like Lisa
Weisberg, senior vice president for government affairs and public
policy of the ASPCA, insist such travel is risky; she goes so far as
to say "you're really playing Russian roulette with your animal."</TE>
<TE>   The Air Transport Assn. says such travel is safe, and baggage
compartments that hold pets are pressurized and heated. As for deaths
of animals in cargo, "those incidents are so rare, any time it
happens it's headline news," says ATA spokeswoman Diana Cronan. No
one is collecting current data on this, even though a federal law
passed in 2000 requires that airlines report statistics on animal
injuries and deaths to the Federal Aviation Administration. Rules
drafted last fall by the FAA to implement this requirement are still
under review.</TE>
<TE>   The frustrations of air travel have led Florida entrepreneurs Rick
and Diana Roof (that's really their name) to plan a small airline
that would let pets ride in the passenger compartment with their
owners. The Roofs are seeking financing to launch Companion Air,
www.companionair.com, using leased or purchased turboprops. They hope
to start flights from the Southland; no date has been set.</TE>
<TE>   For right now, though, I offer the "Canine Commitment Ceremony
Package" at the Caliente Tropics Resort in Palm Springs, (760)

<LD>Five days.</LD>
<LD>   Between camp, sports, summer jobs and full-time work schedules,
that's all the time my family will have together this summer.</LD>
<LD>   So how will my husband, three kids and I spend those five days?
White-water rafting or a road trip? A glitzy beach resort or a cabin
in a national park? A trip to Grandma's house or a trip with her?
Museum or mall crawl?</LD>
<TE>   If your life is anything like mine, you haven't had much time to
think about what you will do for summer vacation, much less figure
out when everyone can get away together.</TE>
<TE>   It's even tougher if you are trying to coordinate plans with
grandparents, siblings or friends across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Plus nobody wants to spend too much this year, and some of us are
reluctant to fly (more because of the hassle than the risk, travel
surveys suggest).</TE>
<TE>   But we also are determined to spend time with those we care about
most, enjoying the sort of nice getaway that can keep us going for
months.</TE>
<TE>   That time is all the more special to me this year because my
oldest child, Matt, will be heading off to college 3,000 miles from
home in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Before anyone could come up with another scheduling conflict, I
made some reservations. I figured we had just enough time for a trip
to Cape Cod (just a few hours by car from our New England home),
where we could sail, bike and gorge on seafood. Now when things get
impossibly frenetic, I can think about those lazy family days ahead
of us.</TE>
<TE>   Don't wait too long to plan for this summer, no matter how busy
you are or how tight the vacation budget is. Often the anticipation
can be nearly as much fun as the trip.</TE>
<TE>   To help you start thinking about summer vacation now, here is a
handful of possibilities. Some are bargains.</TE>
<TE>   And some, I hope, will lead you in directions where you and the
kids have never gone.</TE>
<TE>   * Think tropical beaches, frothy fruit drinks and swaying palms.
No, it's not too pricey, not in summer. Fourteen resorts on Aruba
have banded together for "One Cool Family Vacation," with free kids'
breakfasts and activities plus a host of other discounts. (Visit the
Web site www.aruba.com/pages/1coolfam.htm.)</TE>
<TE>   * In Miami, the newly renovated Eden Roc Renaissance Resort and
Spa has rooms for $129 a night, free kids' activities and a
55,000-square-foot spa and workout facility overlooking the ocean.
Call (800) 468-3571 or visit www.edenrocresort.com.</TE>
<TE>   * If you book a United Vacations package to Walt Disney World, you
will get discounted air fare and you'll save $25 to $100 a night on
hotel rooms. Three-night packages (including Disney park-hopper
passes and air fare) start at $689 per person from Los Angeles and
San Francisco. Call (800) 328-6877 or visit www.unitedvacations.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Choose from among 100 family vacation packages in the Caribbean.
For the complete listing, log on to the Caribbean Hotel Assn.'s Web
site, www.caribbeanhotels.org.</TE>
<TE>   * How about crisp, clean air? Pristine mountain lakes and
mountain-bike and hiking trails studded with wildflowers? Those who
have moved to ski country for the snow say they stay for the summers.
And summer is bargain season at ski resorts, where some mountain
condos go for less than $100 a night.</TE>
<TE>   In Winter Park, Colo., you will find a 50-mile network of
mountain-bike trails (served by lifts), a giant human maze,
Colorado's longest alpine slide (3,030 feet) and a summer's worth of
outdoor programs for those with disabilities. Four-night Western
adventures start at $399 per person for adults, $130 for kids 12 and
younger, and include lodging and more activities than a family could
pack into a week. Call (800) 729-5813 or visit
www.winterparkresort.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Wouldn't it be nice to have a maid and cook to attend to your
family's every whim while you laze at the pool? You don't have to win
the lottery. In summer you can rent a vacation house in Montego Bay,
Jamaica, with chef and laundress, for less than $1,500 a week. Meet
friends or family and split costs. There are hundreds of similar
options for staffed vacation rentals in the Caribbean as well as in
the United States. Try Hideaways International travel club, which
specializes in villa vacations. Call (800) 843-4433 or visit
www.hideaways.com.</TE>
<TE>   * Perhaps you could take a road trip to show the kids a new part
of the country, or the place where you grew up. You could eat at
old-fashioned diners and maybe even hit a state fair or amusement
park.</TE>
<TE>   * Maybe this is the summer to make your children's dreams come
true or cater to their current fantasy about what they want to be
when they grow up.</TE>
<TE>   Take the family to eco-camp at the Tiskita Jungle Lodge in Costa
Rica, where you can check out bugs and lizards, swim, snorkel and
ride horses. A nine-day, eight-night package including meals, camp,
hotel and airport transfers and the short flight from San Jose to
Tiskita costs $925 per person for adults, $745 for one child and $645
for additional children. Call (800) 345-7422 or visit
www.tiskita-lodge.co.cr.</TE>
<TE>   Your future marine biologist can go to dolphin discovery camp at
Anthony's Key Resort in Roatan, Honduras (a two-hour flight from
Houston or Miami), where you can also snorkel and scuba dive.</TE>
<TE>   The weeklong dolphin program for children ages 5 to 14 costs $600
and includes dolphin interaction, instruction, meals, room and other
activities.</TE>
<TE>   All-inclusive dive packages for adults start at $599. Call (800)
227-3483 or visit www.anthonyskey.com.</TE>

<LD>Great story about the author Katherine Mansfield and Wellington, New
Zealand ("Wellington's Storied Past," April 21). As American consul
in Wellington from 1979 through 1983, I was familiar with the plaque
to her memory placed prominently at 47 Fitzherbert Terrace, on the
lawn in front of the U.S. Embassy.</LD>
<LD>   Just across the street is a small, serene park, lush in greenery,
where I often took my lunch and read some of her stories. Mansfield's
name recalls many fond memories of a wonderful country.</LD>

<LD>My husband and I have been on many cruises, and recently we took a
Norwegian cruise in Hawaii. At first we were not sure we would like
"Freestyle" dining, but once we got used to it we liked it. There
were several places to eat, including some that had a cover charge.
We chose the main dining rooms, the buffet or the fast-food eatery,
which did not have a cover. We liked that we did not have to dress up
every evening but could dress formally in the dining rooms if we
wished. We could also eat on our own schedule instead of theirs.</LD>

<HD>Remembering Patzcuaro</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I thoroughly enjoyed Christopher Reynolds' fine article on Patzcuaro,
and I reminisced about a Christmas vacation car trip to Mexico with
my family when I was 11.</LD>
<LD>   My favorite and most memorable place was Patzcuaro, especially
when we went to Janitzio Island on a small boat. I was entranced by
the many fishermen using their lovely butterfly-shaped nets.
Apparently they were not aware that we tourists would dish out tips.
For the most part, no one held out upturned palms except for three
colorfully dressed Tarascan girls, who sang a song for us in their
dialect, then happily accepted our coins. Then my two sisters and I
sang for them in English, which fascinated them. When our guide asked
whether they were going to give us money, they ran away giggling.</LD>
<LD>   It sounds as though things have changed a bit in the ensuing 50
years.</LD>

<LD>To add one more amazing woman to your story ("Conquering the Grand
Canyon," April 14): Mary Colter created the beautiful Phantom Ranch.
Twenty years before American women could vote, Colter began her work
in the Wild West. The Grand Canyon is the perfect place to learn
about this great architect's fierce determination, exacting standards
and take-no-prisoners sense of humor. She designed Hopi House,
Watchtower, Hermit's Rest and the Lookout Studio, and they are
accessible to South Rim visitors without hiking.</LD>

<LD>If smokers are entitled to specific areas or lounges at airports
("Trying to Steer Clear of the Smoking Lounge," Her World, April 21),
the same should apply for those who do not want to be bothered by
music at airports. Enjoying music (and we do) does not mean you want
to hear it all the time and anywhere.</LD>
<LD>   At Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, the music was so loud
in the concourse that we could barely hear the television in our
boarding area. If you want a quiet and peaceful area to relax or read
a book, forget it.</LD>

<DL>McCLEOD, Mont.</DL>
<LD>McLEOD, Mont.--A week of fly-fishing and horseback riding at a
Montana dude ranch an hour and a half from the nearest town was not
our daughters' idea of a great family vacation.</LD>
<LD>   Eleanor, 21, just back from a spring semester in Paris, and
Lizzie, 17, share a taste for indie films, books, museums and cafes.
Rugged outdoorswomen they are not.</LD>
<LD>   As a Foreign Service family, we had done a fair amount of
globe-trotting but had never toured the American West. My husband,
Larry, thought a small ranch in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in
south-central Montana would give us precious time with our grown
children and a taste of Western life. The legendary trout fishing in
the Boulder River had nothing to do with it, said the man who moons
over fly-fishing brochures.</LD>
<TE>   So on a Saturday last August we flew to Salt Lake City, rented a
car and headed 480 miles north to Montana. Jagged mountains towered
over sage-tufted meadows as we drove along the Boulder River. So many
movies were filmed here--"Jeremiah Johnson," "A River Runs Through
It" and "The Horse Whisperer"--that the landscape seemed familiar.</TE>
<TE>   Near the tiny town of McLeod we glimpsed plush spreads with Range
Rovers parked in front. This is the stamping ground of Tom Brokaw,
Michael Keaton and author Tom McGuane. (Keaton lives on the road we
traveled; Brokaw and McGuane live on a road that branches off it.)</TE>
<TE>   An hour later the road turned to dirt and the multimillion-dollar
ranches gave way to church camps. When we could drive no farther, we
spotted the Hawley Mountain Guest Ranch, billed as one of the most
remote ranches in Montana accessible by car.</TE>
<TE>   Hawley Mountain is a rustic, family-run operation, not a slick
commercial resort. The 155-acre spread has three cabins and four
lodge rooms accommodating up to 20 guests. More than an hour's drive
from the nearest store or hospital, the ranch appeals to guests who
love the wilderness, know how to amuse themselves and don't whine if
the electricity goes out in a storm. Families are advised to bring a
baby-sitter for children younger than 6, and those with heart or lung
problems are discouraged from coming because of the 6,400-foot
altitude.</TE>
<TE>   Our secluded log cabin was furnished with lodgepole pine
furniture, metal folding chairs, a coffee maker and a tiny
refrigerator for our beer and wine. (Alcohol is not served at meals.)
No TV, no phone, no laptop hookup. And your cell phone won't work
here.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you people are ready to play card games," said Lizzie,
scowling.</TE>
<TE>   We walked through the woods to Eagle's Nest Lodge, built on a
300-foot rocky cliff with a bird's-eye view of the Boulder River
valley. Reference books, binoculars and a spotting scope were
available when a hummingbird or elk herd wandered by the picture
windows. The lodge had a large circular fireplace and was furnished
with spare pine furniture.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch is owned and operated by two Montana ex-farm boys and
their hard-working wives: Ron Jarrett, a retired engineer, and
Phyllis, a third-grade teacher; Bryant Blewett, a former tax
attorney, and his wife, Ellen Marshall, an ex-bank vice president.</TE>
<TE>   We introduced ourselves to the staff and other guests--an English
couple and two artists from California and their 7-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen explained the week's program: daily fly-fishing lessons and
horseback rides, a four-wheel-drive road trip to a ghost town and a
mountain lake, talks on Crow Indian history and archeology. Then we
lined up for a buffet of hearty home cooking (cheesy chicken-sausage
bake, mashed potatoes, fruit salad and chocolate pudding). The
owners, ranch hands and guests ate all meals together in the main
lodge, sharing conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Since everything was included, we parked our wallets as well as
the car for the week.</TE>
<TE>   "This reminds me of camp," said Lizzie, walking back to the cabin.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps a little," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "I hated camp, remember?"</TE>
<TE>   While the girls and I unpacked and explored the grounds, Larry
headed straight for the river, the first of many such trips. But what
if he didn't catch anything? A long drought had lowered the water
temperature, and the trout were sure to be scarce.</TE>
<TE>   I needn't have worried.</TE>
<TE>   "What an amazing river," Larry said when we met for dinner. "I
caught 10 trout. Now I know why the guidebook said the fishing in the
Boulder is stupendous."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant told him he had a long way to go before he matched the
record of the Englishman who needed a counter to keep track of nearly
100 trout a day. The ranch has a strict catch-and-release policy, and
Bryant was happy to teach a way to release trout with medical forceps
and a flick of the wrist so the fish aren't stressed. No spinning
tackle was allowed. When a guy from the neighboring campground waded
down the stream with spinning tackle, Ron threw rocks into the water
until he left.</TE>
<TE>   Horseback riding began Monday morning, and we greenhorns were
nervous. Larger guest ranches have baby-sitting and elaborate
children's programs or a barn and riding rings for the horsy set. At
Hawley Mountain, horses are the best way to explore the roadless
wilderness, where vehicles are banned.</TE>
<TE>   The wranglers--Steve, 24, Melissa, 16, and Rachel, 21--helped us
choose our horses and adjust the saddles. Steve was an
honest-to-goodness cowboy, and both of the young women had grown up
on ranches with fathers who were outfitters. Melissa, handsome in
leather chaps and spurs, looked like a model in a Ralph Lauren ad,
and I told her so.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's Ralph Lauren?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   After a quick lesson--"Show the horse who's boss. Squeeze with
your thighs. Put a third of your weight in the stirrups. Remember,
the horse doesn't want to fall any more than you do"--we formed a
string and ambled down the road, nose to tail along the river.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't so hard," I thought as my horse, Whiskey, plodded
through the pasture.</TE>
<TE>   After lunch we remounted for a longer ride, heading into the
mountains on trails that grew narrower, edging steep ravines lined
with enormous boulders. We grew quiet as the horses picked their way
among the loose rocks on abrupt descents.</TE>
<TE>   "Just lean back and relax," Rachel told us.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, right. I never let go of the saddle horn. The opening scenes
of "The Horse Whisperer" came back to me--where the horses rear up
and one girl is killed and the other loses her leg.</TE>
<TE>   Lizzie was easy in the saddle, barely holding the reins. She
chatted with Rachel about close encounters with celebrities--Michael
Keaton fishing the ranch's stretch of the river, meeting Dennis Quaid
in a bar and managing horses for the Brokaws.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly one of the guests screamed as her horse stumbled. In the
commotion, Eleanor's horse bucked and she lost her sunglasses and her
composure. Melissa dismounted and led the visibly shaken guest back
to the ranch. Nobody said much on the ride home. We had signed a
liability waiver absolving the owners in case of injury or death, but
I never thought it would be an issue.</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon the girls and I joined Bryant for a quick
trout-fishing lesson at the stocked pond.</TE>
<TE>   "When you feel the fish bite, throw your arms up and say 'Wow!'"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite our best effort--and pails full of fish food--we barely
caught anything. "You girls don't have a 'wow' in your bodies,"
Bryant said in despair. The trout were safe from us.</TE>
<TE>   That night Eleanor needed a back rub to ease tension aches from
the horseback ride. "It's 8 o'clock and I can't keep my eyes open,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   It took us a week to get used to the altitude, and we were early
to bed, early to rise every day. I never did see the stars glittering
in the Big Sky. Most evenings we read or played board games, a rare
event in our family. We wept with laughter playing Pictionary, since
only Eleanor can draw. Tuesday morning after breakfast, Ellen offered
to tailor the riding program to our comfort level. Did we want to
practice in the pasture or take a ride up to a cabin in the
mountains? Our one concern was the steepness of the trail. Uphill was
bearable because you just lean forward on the horse. Downhill, you
see your life pass before your eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Eleanor wasn't wild about getting back on buckin' Buster, but she
wasn't crazy about trout fishing either. Lizzie was eager to
ride--she turned out to be a natural in the saddle. So we gave it
another shot, and this time the ride was easy and Buster was well
behaved.</TE>
<TE>   "This is pretty cool," Eleanor said. "I'm learning a lot--because
I'm being forced to--but if anybody asks if I can ride a horse, I can
say yeah."</TE>
<TE>   On the daily rides Eleanor and Lizzie got to know the two women
wranglers, so close in age to my daughters but so far apart in
experience. Rodeo queens by age 7, Melissa and Rachel could hunt elk,
field-dress a deer and ride bareback through the mountains at night.
My daughters could negotiate the Paris Metro and deconstruct a modern
novel.</TE>
<TE>   "We call that Bloody Bridge," said Rachel on one of our rides.
While she and Melissa were clearing fallen limbs from the wood
bridge, Melissa cut her arm with the saw. Instead of returning to the
lodge, she tied a bandanna around the wound and kept working.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never met anyone like these girls," Eleanor said. "They're
intense."</TE>
<TE>   Rachel told us she sometimes carries a .357 pistol just to make
noise in case riders meet a grizzly. Driving through the Gallatin
National Forest we had read terse warnings for hikers: "Many bear
charges are bluff charges. If attacked, play dead." The grizzly paw
prints in the riverbank and the mountain lion scratches on tree
trunks gave those warnings force.</TE>
<TE>   When Larry mentioned that he had spotted a moose and a calf on the
river, Ron and Bryant were alarmed. "How close did you get?" they
asked. Since we live in New England, we are accustomed to
mild-mannered Maine moose. Their Western cousins are a lot more
aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   I was reexamining my knee-jerk Eastern attitude that all wildlife
is benign and all guns are bad. When I spotted Rachel reading the
"Armed Citizen" column in a National Rifle Assn. magazine, I was
relieved. At least one of us would know what to do in a dangerous
encounter with an animal.</TE>
<TE>   One night we had a cookout with grilled trout, steak, baked
potatoes, beans, s'mores and cowboy coffee (boiled over the fire, the
grounds settled with eggshells). Melissa played her guitar and,
without giggles or irony, sang about "Grandpa and the olden days when
there were no single mothers." She had never seen the ocean and was
excited about an upcoming trip to Seattle with her Future Farmers of
America group. Roasting marshmallows over the campfire, Ron told us
about his great-grandmother coming West in a covered wagon and his
childhood tending sheep on the ranch. We talked about the idiocy of
bull riders in rodeos, "all stove in before they're 40," and why real
cowboys wear Wranglers (no welted seams that chafe when riding).</TE>
<TE>   We discussed the Forest Service policy of reintroducing wolves in
nearby Yellowstone. Steve's T-shirt summed up the local view: "Save
the Wolves--for Stew."</TE>
<TE>   The federal government's fire policy was also controversial. In
the distance we could see smoke from Yellowstone, only 24 miles away.
Our hosts were worried. The year before, the Forest Service had
closed the road and the camp because of wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   "They say 'liberal' in the same tone of voice that I say
'conservative,'" Lizzie said to me, slightly amazed. In long
conversations with our charming hosts, we began to understand the
Western viewpoint and why the electoral map in the last presidential
election was blue on one side and red on the other.</TE>
<TE>   Midweek we drove up a primitive road in "Ol' Blue," a 1960s Ford
four-wheel-drive truck held together with duct tape. Steve tied the
gearshift with a bungee cord and off we went, clutching the
horseshoes welded to the frame. Ducking tree branches, I lost an
earring and another guest lost a watch.</TE>
<TE>   After a stop at an abandoned gold mining town, which once had a
brothel, phone lines and four blocks of buildings, we drove up to
Blue Lake for a box lunch and some fishing. Larry spotted a juvenile
golden eagle soaring above 10,996-foot Monument Peak, its white spots
clearly visible. The dried vestiges of blue lupine, Indian
paintbrush, gayfeather and harebell made me vow to return in June to
see them at their peak.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday morning I noticed a slight dip in our daughters' mood.
Both are accustomed to a fair amount of independence and privacy, and
they chafed a bit at the organized activities and communal meals.
They were missing friends and beginning to think of school starting
in a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy I came, but I'm ready to go home," Eleanor said.</TE>
<TE>   On the day before our departure we made a triumphant all-day ride
to Meat Rack, where the Crow Indians once dried elk meat. After three
hours of hard uphill riding, we reached an 8,500-foot meadow with a
tiny stream so clear you could see the colors of the cutthroat trout,
descendants of those Ron's family had carried up in coffee cans a
generation ago. Larry caught a nice one in spite of the splashing and
shenanigans of indefatigable Blue, Rachel's blue heeler, a
dingo/Australian shepherd mix.</TE>
<TE>   On the ride down we eased our way past kneecap-smashing boulders
and eyeball-gouging tree limbs. Crossing a stream, my horse jumped a
3-foot embankment, and I nearly sailed over Whiskey's head.</TE>
<TE>   Something about the trail seemed familiar, and as we fed our
horses carrots and gave them goodbye pats, I asked if that wasn't the
same path we had taken Monday, which rattled us.</TE>
<TE>   "Yup," Steve said. "Guess we broke you in."</TE>

<HD>Steps From the Sand</HD>
<DH>Ocean views can come with $400-a-night price tags at

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Sometimes, on a Friday night as I climb the stairs to my apartment
after work, I think fleetingly of packing a bag and driving up the
coast to this small, sophisticated town that holds such a special
place in the hearts of Southern Californians. I'd visit Santa
Barbara's 18th century Spanish mission, tour its farmers market, shop
on State Street, bike along the waterfront, build sandcastles at the
beach, eat seafood on the wharf. It's all just a hundred miles away.</LD>
<LD>   Then I wonder where I would stay. Alas, the best-known places are
luxurious beachside resorts like Bacara and the Four Seasons
Biltmore, where the least expensive room in the summer high season
costs about $400 a night. So I stay put, pay bills, clean house.</LD>
<LD>   There are plenty of good reasons not to act on impulse. But the
high price of accommodations shouldn't automatically be counted among
them when the impulse is getting away to Santa Barbara. Never mind
the Biltmores and Bacaras, or other pricey hotels and
bed-and-breakfasts farther inland, like San Ysidro Ranch, El Encanto
or the Simpson House Inn. Who can afford them?</LD>
<TE>   I recently checked out nearly three dozen less expensive, less
glamorous places to stay around the Santa Barbara waterfront; after
all, much of the appeal of a getaway here is to get as close to the
beach as possible. Many have welcome touches like free continental
breakfasts, driven in part by the large number of Europeans who visit
Santa Barbara. And some of these little inns, comfy
bed-and-breakfasts and mom-and-pop motels have been there for decades
and are family-owned, says B. Corkery, executive director of the
Santa Barbara Conference and Visitors Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, nothing comes cheap in this soigne town. The least
expensive of these little hotels, very basic and a few short blocks
away from the beach, are priced from about $50 to $200 a night. The
most expensive aren't all that fancy either but charge $200 and up
simply because they're on Cabrillo Boulevard, which runs along the
beachfront.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, rates fluctuate wildly at each hotel depending on the
time of year you visit and whether you book for a weekend or a less
expensive weeknight. Tariffs are highest and a two-night minimum stay
is generally required on weekends in peak season, from late May
through September.</TE>
<TE>   When I was there in late April, rates were on the low side and
there were plenty of vacancies. I spent my time pounding the
pavement, touring inns, chatting up hotel managers and snooping in
rooms when the chambermaids were cleaning. I focused solely on the
beach area, excluding big chain hotels (with one notable exception),
and, admittedly, stayed (always anonymously) in only three of the
places listed below. The rest I toured, limiting my ability to make
detailed assessments. Without spending the night at a place, you
simply don't know how noisy the corridors are at midnight, whether
the hot water is sluggish and if it's really worth it to pay premium
prices for rooms with ocean or partial ocean views. But I love the
variety and personality of little hotels, have a practiced eye and
sussed out the 11 I liked best, from East Beach to West Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Location, Location</TE>
<TE>   A few chain resorts, such as Fess Parker's Doubletree Resort and
the Radisson Santa Barbara, and very comfortable medium-size inns
occupy a place of pride on busy Cabrillo Boulevard, which makes them
expensive and, in some cases, noisy. My favorites were the 71-room
Santa Barbara Inn, overlooking West Beach, and Oceana, a stylish
122-room boutique hotel that opened this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara Inn: The Santa Barbara Inn is about a 15-minute
stroll from State Street and Stearns Wharf. There's a small but
attractive heated pool and hot tub on the ocean side of the inn, and
an elegant restaurant, Citronelle, upstairs. If it weren't for the
fact that the mid-century modern look is currently chic, it would be
an unexceptional '60s motel with three stories, a porte-cochere,
valet parking and an airy lobby that needs more cheerful decor. If it
were at a highway exit instead of on the ocean in Santa Barbara,
you'd never pay $249 to $359 for a room, the rates in summer.</TE>
<TE>   But the rooms are large and quite pleasant, done in beige and
wicker with beachy prints on the wall, marble baths and little bar
areas equipped with coffee makers. Some have balconies and full ocean
views. The one I rented on the ground floor ($299 in high season,
$209 in late April) had a sliding glass door yielding to the pool
area, two double beds and a low cottage cheese ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   Citronelle, which features the California-French cuisine of chef
Michel Richard, is in a picture window-lined room on the top floor. I
invited some of my family to drive up, and we had a memorable dinner
there of appetizers such as Richard's signature porcupine shrimp and
entrees like sea bass in a delicate mushroom polenta crust,
accompanied by a bottle of Vouvray. The next morning I ordered mixed
fruit, fresh-squeezed orange juice and coffee from Citronelle, which
provides room service meals at the hotel and is easily its most
winning amenity.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel Oceana: The Oceana is a total renovation and banding
together of four beach-area motels, three facing the ocean and
another on the far side of an alley. Sambo's restaurant squats in the
midst of them, a Santa Barbara fixture since it was founded as the
first eatery in the chain in 1957. The spread-out nature of the
Oceana keeps the bellhops running, but they look young and able.
There are two pools, a fitness center and lots of pretty patios with
overflowing planters and umbrella tables, all very Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble is, rooms in the same price category vary dramatically
from building to building. I looked at three or four--cramped or too
noisy or without a locking bathroom window--before settling on a
modest double in the rear. It was a partial ocean view room, priced
at $225 during the week and $275 on the weekend. You could see the
Pacific from the main window, an azure wash behind Sambo's. Better
choices in the building housing the lobby were already taken.</TE>
<TE>   All the Oceana's rooms were decorated by interior designer Kathryn
Ireland, who favors cheerful yellow, green and red checks and prints
against white walls. Upholstered headboards and benches at the foot
of the beds, pretty prints on the walls and mostly blond furniture
give the rooms a feminine air. But when you settle in, you find that
some expense has been spared. The comforters are thin, the bottles of
Aveda toiletries in the baths are minuscule, the rooms are
underfurnished. I'd have been happier if my room at the Oceana had an
easy chair.</TE>
<TE>   Back From the Beach</TE>
<TE>   The intersection of Bath and Mason streets, just behind the Oceana
on the West Beach side of the waterfront, is a good place to start if
you're looking for a modest place to stay in Santa Barbara. I liked
all four little inns at this crossroads, from the perfectly neat
Marina Beach Motel, which lacks only a pool, to the comfortably
modern Franciscan Inn; antique-filled, 10-room Harbor House Inn; and
Casa Del Mar, my favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Casa Del Mar: This intimate 21-room inn, which has the feeling of
beach apartments, occupies a series of small, close-set buildings
from the '20s, with all the trademarks of the Mediterranean style,
like red tile roofs, white stucco walls and arches. The buildings are
separated by narrow walkways lined with flowers and palm trees,
leading to gurgling fountains and a little deck with a hot tub facing
quiet Mason Street--all a block back from the beach but surprisingly
secluded.</TE>
<TE>   The rooms and suites are large, some with fireplaces and
kitchenettes. Though more functional than stylish, they have a
freshly redecorated look, tiled entryways and floral bedspreads and
are priced from $129 to $224.</TE>
<TE>   The lobby has a small dining room where wine and cheese are served
in the evening and a big breakfast buffet is spread in the morning.
Such touches give Casa Del Mar the hospitableness of a B&amp;B without
impinging on its very private air.</TE>
<TE>   Tropicana Inn and Suites and Colonial Beach Inn: These two
attentively refurbished vintage motels are across Castillo Street
from each other, near the band shell and ball fields of Pershing
Park, halfway between the highway and Cabrillo Boulevard. So
naturally they lack a waterfront feeling, though they're just a short
walk from the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Both shine with tender loving care, have little pools and
charmingly decorated rooms with patterned wallpaper, overstuffed
chairs and Laura Ashley quilts on the beds.</TE>
<TE>   The two inns were started by David and Pamela Webber, who moved
from Plymouth, England, to Santa Barbara in 1956. Pamela needed a job
that would allow her to care for her daughter, Jeanette, so she went
to work in a hotel. Over the years the Webbers began buying hotels,
now a home-grown chain run by their children, consisting of the
Colonial, the Tropicana, the Inn By The Harbor around the corner and
two Best Westerns in town.</TE>
<TE>   A high level of upkeep, personal attention and pleasing details,
like milk and cookies served in the late afternoon, recommend the
Webber hotels. The Colonial has 24 rooms ($146 to $196 weekend, $126
to $176 weekdays), cherry wood furnishings and reproduction
Lincoln-era beds.</TE>
<TE>   A dolphin fountain marks the entry to the bright pink Tropicana,
which has 31 chambers, half of which are big suites ($152 to $162
weekend, $132 to $142 weekdays).</TE>
<TE>   Montecito del Mar: The location of Montecito del Mar isn't prime.
It backs onto U.S. Highway 101 three blocks from the beach. It would
be just another basic courtyard mom-and-pop motel were it not for
recent renovations and a refurbishing, which have given the 23-room
inn the handmade charm of Mexican folk art.</TE>
<TE>   There are several styles of rooms and suites, set in a U shape
around the parking lot (with two hot tubs at the rear). The least
expensive, priced $95 to $145, are small and a little dark, with
simple pine furniture and tile floors. Rooms in the next category up,
at $145 to $225, are much more enticing. They have wrought-iron,
gauze-canopy beds, settees, baskets, patterned pillows and colorful
hand-painted Mexican basins that serve as bathroom sinks.</TE>
<TE>   The Old Yacht Club Inn: The Old Yacht Club Inn, on a quiet
residential street just off East Beach, was started by two
schoolteachers in 1980, the first B&amp;B in Santa Barbara. The main
building, which briefly served as the headquarters of the Santa
Barbara Yacht Club, is a classic California Craftsman-style house
with a deep front porch, wainscoting and burnished wood floors. The
inn is now owned by Eileen Bruce and Vince Pettit, who knew a gem
when they bought it two years ago and wisely did not change a thing.</TE>
<TE>   The front sitting area and breakfast room has a fireplace,
Oriental rugs, lace curtains, doilies and multitudinous knickknacks.
There, a full gourmet breakfast is served, evening social hour is
held and the owners lend bicycles and dispense beach towels and
chairs to guests.</TE>
<TE>   To the rear on the first floor of the main house is one of the
least expensive rooms, priced at $140. There are four guest rooms
upstairs and six more in the Mediterranean-style annex next door, all
with private baths and fluffy, pretty decorations like swag curtains,
flowered bedspreads and Victorian mirrors, tables and chairs. The inn
is homey and not too formal, giving guests a taste of what it must be
like not just to visit but to live in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Inn at East Beach: A recent renovation and an exceptionally
friendly staff make the 33-room Inn at East Beach one of my favorite
places to stay near the Santa Barbara waterfront. It's a block off
Cabrillo Boulevard, with the Radisson in front of it. But from the
balcony in No. 17, I had a full ocean view without craning my neck.</TE>
<TE>   The inn, a '60-style motel with a shingle roof and green wood
siding, provided accommodations for members of the White House motor
pool, Secret Service and communications staff when President Reagan
visited his Santa Barbara ranch. It occupies three banks of buildings
that climb down a hill, ending at a little park and the Santa Barbara
Zoo. There's a well-maintained pool in the middle and a deck with
umbrella tables. A continental breakfast is served in the lobby, and
coffee and tea are always available. Co-manager Frank Santana is
usually sitting at the front desk in shorts and a Hawaiian shirt,
telling people what to do in Santa Barbara, a town he loves.</TE>
<TE>   The rooms are large and have durable carpets, plain spreads, pine
furniture, the occasional wicker chair and thoughtful details like
ironing boards, mini-refrigerators, microwaves and coffee makers.
There is nothing extraneous in them, but they are shipshape,
comfortable and a good buy at $180 to $270 on weekends, $119 to $199
weekdays.</TE>
<TE>   Bare-Bones Basic</TE>
<TE>   If you just want a place to sleep and dry your bathing suit, there
are options in Santa Barbara. Soap may be the only free toiletry you
get, and the towels may be thin at these inexpensive inns, but you
can count on a neat room and easy access to the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Motel 6: Yes, it's part of the budget hotel chain, noted for cheap
sleeps along the highway. Its rooms, in a pair of two-story concrete
block buildings, are small, with no pictures on the wall; plain,
functional baths; and a few sticks of unadorned furniture. There's no
restaurant or room service, the pool lacks the charms of landscaping
and it's standing room only in the little lobby.</TE>
<TE>   But this Motel 6 is a block off East Beach in Santa Barbara, with
51 clean, perfectly acceptable rooms. Some on the second floor even
have ocean views. In summer, the price is $85.99 weekends, $75.99
weekdays (plus $6 for a second adult in the room). If you combed the
Santa Barbara coast from Carpenteria to Goleta, I doubt you could do
better.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel State Street: The 52-room Hotel State Street is in an old
three-story building with a Subway sandwich shop on the ground floor.
It is near the train station and exactly 176 steps from the beach (as
measured by co-owner Serb Topalski's feet). Friendly, tidy and
recently refurbished, it caters chiefly to European tourists.</TE>
<TE>   The rooms have shared baths (except No. 35), though all have
in-room sinks and some have toilets. There are TVs but no phones, and
the furniture is almost as spartan as at the Motel 6. But I liked it
better because guest chambers are roomy, with big windows and high
ceilings. Besides, sharing a bath doesn't sound so bad at $69 to $79
weekends, $49 to $69 weekdays.</TE>
<TE>   Cabrillo Inn: This breezy little white frame motel occupies one of
the best spots on the shore, just across the street from East Beach.
It has 39 rooms in four two-story buildings, connected by meandering
walkways and sundecks. There's almost no landscaping, the two pools
are surrounded by plastic chairs and the rooms are small and
characterless. But the price is about as low as you're likely to find
on Cabrillo Boulevard, $139 to $199 weekends, $109 to $169 weekdays.
And all the rooms have full or partial views of the glorious Santa
Barbara waterfront.</TE>

<TE>   Guidebook: Booking an Ocean-Side Room in Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   Getting there: Santa Barbara is 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles
via U.S. Highway 101, about a two-hour drive from downtown L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak makes several trips a day from Union Station in downtown
Los Angeles to the downtown Santa Barbara train station. Fares range
from $34 to $56 round trip. For reservations, call (800) USA-RAIL.</TE>
<TE>   When to go: The law of supply and demand drives rates in Santa
Barbara, so prices escalate when visitors are plentiful. A room can
vary in price by $100 or more depending on when you book it.
Throughout the year rates tend to be higher on Friday and Saturday
than during the week, and in summer a two-night minimum is almost
always required on weekends (though walk-ins can sometimes get just a
Friday or Saturday when there are last-minute cancellations).</TE>
<TE>   Low season is generally January to March; shoulder season is
April, early May, October and November; and high season starts in
late May and lasts through September. Summer weekends usually book up
far in advance; graduation weekend, June 22 and 23, and Old Spanish
Days (called Fiesta by locals), the first week in August this year,
are especially popular.</TE>
<TE>   Room choices: Think twice about how important it is for you to get
a room with an ocean view, given the substantially higher prices. In
some cases, partial ocean view rooms are hardly better than a room
with a view of town and the Santa Ynez Mountains. Moreover, Cabrillo
Boulevard is busy and noisy, which can make it hard to sleep in an
ocean-facing room.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: What Santa Barbara reader Bruce Bigenho likes about
this photo is the contrast of ancient and modern. Amid the
traditional instruments and garments of a gamelan orchestra, a sign
of the times: a digital wristwatch. It's an otherwise timeless scene
from a monthlong visit to the Indonesian island of Bali in September.
Bigenho was touring the countryside when he was invited to observe a
cremation ceremony. He says the ceremony wasn't solemn but rather
full of elaborate decorations and dance. What struck him most was the
gamelan orchestra, including this 12-bell instrument (called a
bonang) played by four musicians. "The music is very rhythmic--lots
of patterns, an overlay of bell sounds," he says.</CP>

<HD>Since 1915, Thomas Bros. Has Led in Putting the Golden
State on the Map</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SPANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES TRAVEL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was there when they put West Pincushion Lane on the Tucson map.</LD>
<LD>   "There" is not in Tucson but at Thomas Bros. Maps in Irvine, the
venerable maker of those indispensable street guides that lie
tattered on the floor of many Angelenos' cars. I used to pore over a
Thomas Bros. "Los Angeles and Orange Counties Street Guide and
Directory" before I moved to L.A.--or even owned a car.</LD>
<LD>   I love maps. Small wonder, then, that my idea of a thrilling field
trip is a visit to Thomas Bros., in an office park 3.7 miles
southeast of Interstate 5 and California Highway 55. I know this
because the mapmaker sent me step-by-step computer-generated
directions.</LD>
<TE>   Thomas Bros. displays its wares in a shop at the entrance to the
plant. Among the merchandise: detailed street guides to nearly every
county in California; some for Oregon, Nevada, Washington state,
metropolitan Baltimore and Washington, D.C.; road atlases; large wall
maps; and CD-ROM versions of many Thomas Bros. guides, including one
that covers all of California and sells for $300.</TE>
<TE>   That may sound pricey, but a Thomas Bros. State of California
Digital Edition does more than just help you find your way. Jim
Welch, a senior vice president of Rand McNally, the Skokie, Ill., map
company that acquired Thomas Bros. in 1999, says the software has
been licensed to the California Highway Patrol as a navigational
tool. It also has helped firefighters battle wildfires by enabling
them to chart the ever-changing boundaries of the blaze and make the
information instantly available to colleagues connected via laptop.</TE>
<TE>   The wall-street guides are used to plot deliveries by Pizza Hut,
which has a computer system that matches customers' phone numbers to
their addresses and Thomas Bros. map pages.</TE>
<TE>   Welch started my plant tour by showing me a collection of Thomas
Bros. maps--a hardbound "executive" edition from 1994, big old Mylar
panels with erasure marks that cartographers used before the company
went digital about 10 years ago, and a yellowed guide to Oakland,
Alameda and Piedmont counties from 1927.</TE>
<TE>   The company was founded in 1915 in Oakland by surveyor George
Coupland Thomas and his brothers, Leonard and Gilbert. They made
old-fashioned folding maps obsolete by developing page-by-page
gridded maps bound in a book. Recognizing that the need for maps was
connected to urban growth, the brothers Thomas moved the company to
suddenly sprawling L.A. in the early '40s and have been in Southern
California ever since, making street guides that are accurate within
10 feet, they say.</TE>
<TE>   We are blessed to have them, not only because they keep us from
getting lost but also because they are innovators in the mapmaking
field. Under the direction of then-company leader Warren Wilson, the
company shifted from manual charting to digitalization long before
others did. Welch calls Wilson a visionary for starting the process
of computerizing data that had been painstakingly collected over the
years by ruler, pencil and erasure mapping. Now the company can
replicate its geographical data bank in paper, digital systems and
wall maps, Welch says.</TE>
<TE>   When Thomas Bros. went digital, it had to renumber its pages and
grids. "It's amazing how many people know the page and grids where
they live and work. We turned the world upside-down for a lot of
them," Welch says. "I still have scars from the complaints." But the
result was accurate maps that are flexible enough to change.</TE>
<TE>   When a municipality approves a new subdivision or a fire
department notices that the name of a street has changed, they often
let Thomas Bros. know, which makes sense because they rely on the
guides. Cartographers then confirm the amendments and change the
maps. More than 15,000 changes were made for the 2002 edition of the
"Los Angeles and Orange Counties Street Guide and Directory," which
has been updated and reissued every year since 1945. Next year there
will be more, including new ZIP Codes in Santa Clarita, the renaming
of Interstate 10 in West L.A. (now the Rosa Parks Freeway), the
addition of malls in Burbank and West Hollywood and interstate and
state highway exits that reflect the new numbering project.</TE>
<TE>   My visit to Thomas Bros. also helped me put some misconceptions to
rest. Why can't they make maps with bigger print for aging baby
boomers? They can if it's a map of Portland, Ore., or Tucson. But
L.A. is so dense that a large-print version of the Thomas Bros. guide
would be phone book size. And do they really put a mistake on each
page to detect illegal duplication? Welch says the maps are secretly
marked but never misdrawn because emergency services depend on them.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of my visit, I stood over the shoulder of Robert Jones,
a young cartographer, as he was putting new geographical information
into the Thomas Bros. metropolitan Tucson area map. I saw him add
West Pincushion Lane, which didn't seem all that different from
finding a new constellation.</TE>

<HD>A May of Remembering</HD>
<DH>With NBC leading the way, networks roll out nostalgia
programming, intent on sweeping the sweeps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the classic Peter Allen song states, everything old is new again.
In fact, nostalgia programming is so prevalent this May, it's
overshadowing the month's other big events, such as the series
finales of "Ally McBeal" and "The X-Files" and Anthony Edwards'
departure from "ER."</LD>
<LD>   NBC has the lion's share of the nostalgia programming under the
umbrella of the network's 75th anniversary celebration. (The Peacock
network hasn't been on the small screen for that long--the
anniversary actually commemorates NBC's birth as a radio network.)
But all the networks are getting into the act, fueled in part by the
huge ratings a "Carol Burnett Show" retrospective garnered for CBS
last fall.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Gaspin, NBC's executive vice president of specials, says
nostalgia programming has always been "fun, exciting and hot." But he
believes it's especially popular this year because of the Sept. 11
tragedy. "Nostalgia provides an opportunity for us to look back at a
time where we at least believe it as less complicated," he said.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know in reality if that's true," Gaspin added, "but you
tend to look back at the good stuff, not necessarily the bad stuff. I
think at this point in our culture, looking back to times that might
have been simpler or felt simpler and safer provides a positive
feeling for us."</TE>
<TE>   Here's a look at some of the oldies but goodies scheduled for this
month, one of the three ratings sweeps periods each year used to help
set TV advertising rates:</TE>
<TE>   "NBC's 75th Anniversary Special": The network celebrates with a

<HD>Ventura County Sees Decline in Dropouts</HD>
<DH>Education: The 1.4% rate for the last year was half the
state average. Most local districts show a five-year improvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fewer students dropped out of Ventura County high schools during the
academic year that ended last June than in the previous year,
according to a new state Department of Education report.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice to see it going down," Chuck Weis, Ventura County
superintendent of schools, said of the dropout rate. "But we know we
lose kids, and that's a travesty. We need to work on it."</LD>
<LD>   Most Ventura County school districts have seen a decline in
dropouts over the last five years. The countywide dropout rate was
1.9% during the 1998-99 school year, 1.8% in 1999-2000 and 1.4% in
2000-2001.</LD>
<TE>   Statewide, 2.8% of high school students dropped out in
2000-2001--the same rate as the two previous school years.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000-2001, the state graduation rate for seniors who had
enrolled four years earlier was 68.9%, according to the report. But
that doesn't account for students who moved out of state, switched to
private schools, took an extra year to graduate or entered adult
schools or community colleges, said Donna Rothenbaum, an education
program consultant for the state.</TE>
<TE>   The data will not be precise until at least 2005, when a new
electronic system to track all California students is in place,
Rothenbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   Rates are not broken down by county, but the state calculated an
estimate of the number of dropouts from 1997 to 2001, based on the
2000-2001 rate. In Ventura County, an estimated 5.6%--or about 7,840
students--dropped out, down from an estimated 7.4% in 1998-99.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the most significant strides were made at Fillmore and
Santa Paula high schools, which consistently score among the lowest
on standardized tests.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Paula, the dropout rate decreased from 2.9% in 1999-2000
to 1.3% last school year. Educators attribute the change to a Gateway
Community School program that began in the small farm town about 15
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Gateway programs, which exist in several communities from
Ventura to Moorpark, aim to recapture students who fall behind or are
expelled from comprehensive and continuation high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula's campus is serving 98 students this year in classroom
and independent study programs--teenagers who might otherwise be on
the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids who have never been successful in school are seeing success
here," Santa Paula teacher Judy Dobbins said.</TE>
<TE>   At Fillmore High School, administrators and teachers have
implemented programs to prepare students for the new statewide exit
exam and a new district rule that requires a 2.0 GPA for graduation.</TE>
<TE>   Principal John Wilber said those efforts likely contributed to the
school's dropout rate decreasing from 4.4% to 1.4% over one school
year. In Conejo Valley and Oak Park school districts, the county's
highest performing high school systems, dropout rates increased in
2000-2001 over the previous school year.</TE>
<TE>   But Mike Vollmert, testing coordinator for Conejo Valley Unified
School District, said figures reported to the state from Thousand
Oaks High School from 2001 were inaccurate. Still, he said, any rise
in the number of students dropping out is a concern, which is why
Conejo offers many programs designed for at-risk teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "Educators need to do everything we possibly can to find a program
that works for every single kid," Vollmert said.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who says a comprehensive high school is perfect for every
kid is naive or in serious denial."</TE>
<TE>   Some public education critics say the state's four-year dropout
estimates represent only a fraction of the true population of high
school dropouts.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report by San Francisco-based California Parents for
Educational Choice, which lobbies for charter schools and school
vouchers, says that more than one-third of California high school
students leave school before graduation.</TE>
<TE>   The rate in Ventura County, according to the report, is 29.6%.</TE>
<TE>   State and county officials disputed those numbers, saying the
report assumes that students are dropping out when they may have
moved out of the state's public school system or into alternative
programs.</TE>

<LD>As a parent of two small children, I may wince and shake my head
when I hear the thumping of outrageously loud rap music ("Parental
Advisory: Explicit Lyrics," by Terry McDermott, April 14). But I cannot
deny the monumental influence that rap music had on my peers and me when
we were at UCLA in the '80s. We got a glimpse of Run-DMC at a run-down
club near downtown L.A. one evening, and our relationship with rap music
was cemented forever. We were mesmerized by performers such as SoulSonic
Force, Egyptian Lover, Dr. Dre, the World Class Wreckin' Cru and many
others who were at the forefront of the hip-hop explosion.</LD>
<LD>   We were there before it became mainstream, and we all wanted more. If
you had the ability to get your hands on this music, which was
impossible, you were king. I lived in Inglewood for part of my childhood
and was exposed to the struggles of a gang-influenced environment. There
is an important story to tell, and it is being brought to the fore by rap
music. It's too bad that this music, which has such an important voice
and is a bridge for its culture, finds it necessary to use profanity to
tell a story.</LD>

<LD>Leslee Komaiko's article about a local hat store ("The Interfaith
Appeal of a Fine Hat," Metropolis, April 7) brought back a sweet,
nostalgic memory of the year 1945. Returning home to Brooklyn after
serving 28 months in China, Burma and India, my new husband excitedly
donned his old zoot suit and, with great anticipation, made a mad dash to
Ruby's to purchase the perfect fedora. A zoot suit, a new bride, a black
overcoat, gray suede gloves and a custom-made Ruby's hat. It was as good
as it got!</LD>

<LD>I read that men's style consultant Martin Kedzior listed Russell
Crowe's poor sense of style tied with that of Don Knotts' character in
"Three's Company" ("Well-Suited to His Profession," by Michael T. Jarvis,
Metropolis, April 7). I just wanted to say thank you. Some 20 years ago,
as the costume designer for "Three's Company," I was assigned the task of
finding a look for the new character on the show played by Don Knotts.
The look I chose was that of an out-of-date, overdressed, self-important
swinger.</LD>

<TE>   Ugh. The fact that Kedzior, a snotty little know-it-all, makes his
living telling people how to dress makes my head hurt. I'm glad I'm not
dating him. I'd be living in a constant state of sixth grade "high-water"

<LD>I'd like to thank Steven Ivory for his article about Vidal Sassoon
("When One Door Closes," Men's Spring Fashion Issue, April 7). I heartily
agree that Sassoon is a gentleman. I met him years ago and found him
warm, kind and in fit condition. We hit it off well; it was not difficult
to warm up to him. I appreciate how Ivory's article allowed thousands of
people to get a brief look at the thoughtfulness of this gentleman.</LD>

seem to build up our idols only to tear them down.</TE>

<HD>Memories of a 'Collapsed Catholic'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES RICCI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For many of us who were raised Catholic, it's only a matter of time
before the public drumroll of priestly sexual transgression reverberates
in private memory. My moment came when I read of the Rev. Christopher
Kearney.</LD>
<LD>   Kearney was dismissed as head of a seminary in late March because he
allegedly had molested boys during impromptu wrestling matches more than
a decade ago at a Catholic high school in La Canada-Flintridge, where he
had taught for 25 years.</LD>
<LD>   When I was 13, the pastor of a nearby parish, a friend of my family,
would sometimes invite me and various combinations of my younger brother
and my friends to watch television with him. He was a fat, sissified man,
outspokenly censorious of the dating habits of teenagers. Although we
were young, he would give us wine and would end up getting us in bearhugs
and headlocks on the couch of his den.</LD>
<TE>   He never did anything overt, such as grabbing for our genitals, but it
was clear the physical contact wasn't just roughhousing to him. I recall
the sharp smell of armpit odor that would rise from him when he held my
head fast against his side.</TE>
<TE>   I am a thoroughly collapsed Catholic, gratefully godless. I left the
church when I was 16, convinced that I couldn't live by its sexual
proscriptions. Even though I believed at the time I was choosing eternal
damnation, that seemed preferable to the recurrent misery I experienced
trying to reconcile the irreconcilable.</TE>
<TE>   A part of my alienation was the memory of the parish priest, who I'd
come to think of as the worst sort of repressed, pious hypocrite. I bore
my contempt for a long time. After he delivered the homily at my father's
funeral more than 30 years later, I barely managed to be civil to him.
The priest himself died not long after that.</TE>
<TE>   The current pedophilia scandal inevitably and unfairly paints all
priests the color of the offenders, which is why I want to mention
another priest I encountered as a Catholic schoolboy. He was my
10th-grade biology teacher, a smart young martinet of a cleric named
Robert T. Francoeur.</TE>
<TE>   Even we students could tell that Francoeur far outclassed our high
school. This was confirmed a few years later when, via studies at Johns
Hopkins, Fordham and the University of Delaware, he earned his doctorate
and became a professor of embryology at Fairleigh Dickinson University in
New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   That, however, is not all he became. He was a founding member of the
National Assn. for Pastoral Renewal, an organization working for optional
celibacy in the Catholic church. In 1967, with the support of his bishop,
he married, and the Vatican, probably through a fluke, never laicized
him. Still married and the father of two grown daughters, he remains
"canonically and technically," as he puts it, a Catholic priest.</TE>
<TE>   Francoeur also became an expert on human sexuality, authored 22 books,
edited "The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality" and received the
American College of Sexology's Public Service Award. A follower of the
French Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, he expounds a
modern view of sexuality, and advises clergy and religious leaders on the
subject.</TE>
<TE>   Now 70, he keenly remembers the sexual deformation that boys of his
generation endured in the seminary, particularly if they entered directly
from eighth grade, as he (and the parish priest above) did. He knows the
loneliness and longing that beset a young man at his sexual peak who is
compelled to suppress the most fundamental of human drives.</TE>
<TE>   "Seminary was a horrendous environment," he told me in a telephone
conversation. "We lived in an isolated world, and many of those priests,
including myself, came out psychologically crippled. I was fortunate
because my path was very different from the average parish priests, and I
can empathize with them because they were really screwed up by this
system. I think it left many of these men with arrested development."</TE>
<TE>   None of this is to excuse those priests who, discerning that the
church hierarchy would protect them, turned the children entrusted to
them into their private sexual playground. They deserve prison, and so do
those who covered up their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   This phenomenon, however, didn't emerge in a vacuum. Its roots are in
the suffocating sexual policies the church inflicts on its ministers,
policies that are willfully out of touch with evolving human experience.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the current din about priestly sexual abuse is reaching
decibel levels that will finally shake the American church to its core.
"Day by day," Francoeur says, "I become more convinced that it is going
to force a major change, maybe even a schism, a sort of silent schism,
that will result in a unique American church. The majority of Catholics
would accept and welcome a married clergy. The patriarchal, authoritarian
hierarchy, top down, isn't going to work anymore. Sooner or later, it
will come. I think it might come sooner than we think."</TE>
<TE>   To which I say, from his lips to You-Know-Who's ear.</TE>

<LD>Homeboy and word-slinger Luis J. Rodriguez has never been busier.
The poet, memoirist and educator is promoting a new short story
collection, "The Republic of East L.A." (HarperCollins). We shadowed the
soft-spoken, tattooed, East L.A.-bred author during a few days that
included interviews, readings, a stop at Tia Chucha's, the cafe, bookshop
and art gallery he co-founded in Sylmar, and a dash home to the San
Fernando Valley for an after-school pickup.</LD>
<LD>   How did you arrive at the title for the new book?</LD>
<LD>   Actually, it was the title for one of the stories. But we decided it
would be better for the whole book. People see the lowrider car on the
cover, but then they see the title, and there's a sense of something
being re-imagined about East L.A.</LD>
<TE>   Are you a Chicano Raymond Carver or was he a gringo Luis Rodriguez?</TE>
<TE>   I've read a lot of Raymond Carver. I like Dagoberto Gilb, John Fante,
Sherman Alexie and Lorrie Moore, because of her humor and the way she
puts her stories together. Of course, writers from Latin America. One of
my favorites is T. C. Boyle, but I think it's important [not to] emulate
other writers. They're all kind of talking in my ear, but I'm trying to
figure out my own way.</TE>
<TE>   You now live in San Fernando, but you grew up in East L.A. How has the
neighborhood changed?</TE>
<TE>   I was gone for 15 years, and a lot happens in 15 years. L.A.'s Mexican
population now has a tremendous influx of Central Americans, which I see
as a good thing. It's like having a brother group among us. The politics
have changed a whole lot. There seems to be a lot of tension among
Chicanos for some reason toward migrants from Mexico and Central America.
Some things have probably gotten worse--the economy, everything that's
affected by it affects people. Those are the kinds of changes I've tried
to reflect in the stories.</TE>
<TE>   Would you consider moving back to the Eastside?</TE>
<TE>   I came back from Chicago two years ago, and one of the issues was
where we would live. East L.A. was my first choice, but my wife grew up
in Pacoima, which is a very old, large Mexican barrio. And her family's
still here. My family is just scattered all over. [The Northeast Valley]
doesn't have the compactness of East L.A., but you still have the
flavor--the families, the parks filled up on Sundays, the peddlers. The
stories could be any barrio, wherever mejicanos and the rest of our
people are.</TE>
<TE>   Has the protagonist of your memoir "Always Running: La Vida Loca: Gang
Days in L.A." slowed down?</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe it's a different kind of running. I was talking about when
you're always running and don't seem to be going anywhere. I had to stop
that kind of running, but I never wanted to stop being active. [They] say
if you just sit in your house, watch TV and go to work every day, you're
doing fine, but it wouldn't be fine for me. I have to keep writing. I
have to be out there all the time.</TE>

<LD>Invited to: The 1st Annual Celebrity Dodgeball Tournament to
benefit the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, at the Toluca
Lake Tennis Club and Sports Center.</LD>
<TE>   The setup: "Five balls?!" wonders diminutive "Buffy the Vampire
Slayer" sidekick Alyson Hannigan, grasping that this event isn't your
father's dodge ball. "I'm hoping they're soft," she adds . . . and is
promptly beaned by a stray practice shot. This latest twist on the
let's-get-celebrities-together-to-do-something-for-a-worthy-cause idea is
hosted by longtime foundation supporter Courteney Cox Arquette and
husband David. "I'm ready, I'm prepared," she says, showing off a cute
pair of Nikes, though her duties this evening don't involve perspiring
(or grievous bodily harm). Team rosters for the celebrity matches include
Cox Arquette's fellow "Friend" Matthew Perry and a few other bona
fides--the pinnacle of a fame pyramid, as it were--and are well bolstered
with larger contingents from TV's "Survivor" and the film "The Wash."
Doing the gustatory hostessing honors is a contingent of equally
well-bolstered Hooters girls. The event raises nearly $90,000 for
children with HIV, AIDS and other life-threatening illnesses. Others,
such as David Spade of "Just Shoot Me" and Jeff Timmons of 98 Degrees,
show up but decline to enter the fray. "It just brings back horrible
memories," says "According to Jim" headliner Courtney Thorne-Smith. "I'm
rooting for nobody to die."</TE>
<TE>   The agony and the ecstasy: "In Toronto," Brendan Fraser says of his
early dodge-ball memories, "we had an awful name for it: 'Murderball.' "
When Kevin Richardson was just a little Backstreet Boy, he says, "we had
about 15 balls going at once." Richardson, however, ends the evening by
messing up some previously completed reconstructive knee surgery. Perry
also goes down early. "I was too aggressive," he reflects. "It's all for
charity, but it's really about winning and losing, and I lost." Harland
Williams and his teammates from the cross-dressing comedy movie "Sorority
Boys" put on a better show.</TE>
<TE>   "We may dress like women in the movies, but we're all men on the
dodge-ball court," he says. Still it's a double-elimination event, and in
the end, the "Survivor" team takes the tournament. "Even in a rematch,
the 'Survivors' were still the survivors," David Arquette says. "It's
like reality TV meets reality. It's frightening."</TE>
<TE>Celeb Quotient: ** "Friends," friends of "Friends," a Backstreet
Boy and a host of "Survivors."</TE>

<LD>In a town so fashion-forward that even the health inspectors
inspire trends, designer Dalia Vosylius is making the grade with a
T-shirt line spoofing the rating signs local restaurants must display
under the L.A. County Department of Health Services regulations. "Stacey
Levno, who was my business partner, got a copy of a sign from a friend
who owns a restaurant," says Vosylius of the tees, which come with giant
letter grades of A, B, C, D, F or X . "We matched up the font and did it
on a computer program."</LD>
<LD>   "It's a parody," Vosylius says, stressing that her attorney concluded
that the design does not violate any laws. "It's legit." To avoid
confusion with the county's official Food Facility Rating System,
Vosylius' shirts read: "County of Los Angeles Department of Health and
Social Fitness." The bottom of each garment says: " This Individual
Received a Score of --at the Time of Inspection." Like the real-life
health grades, the shirts also read "Do Not Remove Under Penalty of Law"
(except for the one with the X rating, which says: "Must Remove Under
Penalty of Law").</LD>
<TE>   The shirts still confuse some people, says Vosylius, noting that a
friend who wore one to a restaurant got the red-carpet treatment from
nervous employees who mistook him for a county inspector. Vosylius, 32,
an actress and ice hockey player who has skated on TV shows such as
"Malcolm in the Middle" and "CSI," says the shirts, which run from $15 to
$20, are guaranteed conversation starters. "Sometimes it's flirting. When
I wear a shirt out, I always get comments like, 'Why'd you get an F?' or,
'Only a D?' or, 'You're slipping.' " She's considering adding the letter

<LD>Plenty of studio honchos play golf, but for this filmmaker,
miniature golf is indie turf. Scott King, whose plucky King Pictures has
hatched such quirky projects as the 1996 documentary "Shotgun Freeway:
Drives Thru Lost L.A.," spent three months and about $20,000 creating a
nine-hole miniature golf course at his home near Silver Lake.</LD>
<LD>   Miniature golf courses have a theme, and King's is L.A. landmarks past
and present. The holes on the front- and-backyard course at his half-acre
property represent Angeleno monuments such as the Brown Derby, Angels
Flight, the Donut Hole drive-through in La Puente, and Hoover Dam. ("It
wouldn't exist without L.A.," King explains.) "We mostly picked the least
obvious choices," he says. "We could have done Phillipe's or other
classical landmarks, but we wanted things that were less recognized."</LD>
<LD>   A team led by a landscape-designer friend engineered each hole and
built all the mini-landmarks by hand. "You can't really find those in
Dumpsters," King notes. Hole #6, a rendition of the long-gone Dog Cafe
that once graced Culver City, is a formidable wire-mesh-and-concrete
canine weighing more than 300 pounds. The miniature Brown Derby is made
of fiberglass, and Hoover Dam doubles as a retaining wall for King's
swimming pool. King, 36, throws occasional golf parties and a yearly
tournament for friends and associates, with each winner's name emblazoned
on a trophy titled "King Pictures Annual Mini-Golf Invitational Thingie."
The lowest score so far is a 34. (King's personal best is 35).</LD>
<TE>   Two or three times a day, inquisitive neighbors peer into the yard to
check out the course. King understands their curiosity. "It's kind of
bizarre to peek into the fence and see a statue of a doughnut," he says.
Prying eyes notwithstanding, King claims his course has one big advantage
over traditional gardens. "It's low maintenance," he points out.
"AstroTurf saves you time."</TE>

<DH>Artist Gregory Beylerian Has a Herd Mentality</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL T. JARVIS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Gregory Beylerian's uncle gave him a 1968 Volvo four years
ago, he initially dreamed of turning it into a race car. Then, a couple
of years later, he saw the elephants. "They were in the trash near a toy
factory in downtown L.A.," Beylerian says. "I thought, 'Rescue and
recycle.' " An artist whose murals adorn the walls of the Krikorian
Monrovia Cinema, Beylerian attached his find--about 100 stuffed
pachyderms--to the car with industrial-strength adhesive, added
graffiti-style decorative paint, and his life has been a circus ever
since.</LD>
<LD>   To ride shotgun with Beylerian is to know firsthand what it means to
stop traffic. As the bloblike apparition floats down Melrose Avenue, an
enthusiastic blond in a tube top yells out:"Love your car!" "Near a
school, the kids go wild," says Beylerian, who has to stop people from
pulling elephants off the vehicle. "Gang members love it. Hindus love it.
It's a temporary sharing of space." Beylerian has even set up an online
forum (www.loveandtruth.com) revolving around the car. "People get a
spark and you can see it in their eyes," he says. "I get a lot of peace
signs. It has become a social experiment."</LD>
<TE>   The interior of Beylerian's contribution to "art cars" is festooned
with graffiti, poems and signatures from passengers, and it features a
dashboard altar covered with plastic dolls, toys, tchotchkes, religious
icons and cartoon characters. A string of Tibetan bells jingles when the
car rounds a corner. "My grandmother gave me a plastic Virgin Mary, and
it snowballed," says the artist, who has degrees in design, photography
and philosophy and does commissioned portraits using a hybrid of
techniques. The car continues to be a work in progress. "Just today a
neighborhood kid, Alex, came over, and we were gluing toys into the
inside."</TE>
<TE>   Beylerian, 33, has an almost karmic connection with the traveling
artwork. "My grandmother bought it two weeks before I was born," he
recalls. "My uncle gave me the car in 1997 on the exact date that my
grandmother registered it 28 years earlier. It's synchronicity." He calls
the Volvo "Medz Mobile" in honor of his late grandmother. "Her name was
Marie, but I called her Medz Mobile, which means grandmother in Armenian.
She is a deep part of my life even though she passed on. She supported my
journey into the arts."</TE>
<TE>   But what exactly is Beylerian's message? "That's the question I get
the most," he says. (The next most frequently asked question: "Are you
Republican?" Beylerian is not.) As for the meaning of it all, the Fairfax
District resident says, "As Henry David Thoreau put it so well: Go
confidently in the direction of your dreams, live the life that you've
imagined. The message is simple: To have the courage to follow your
heart."</TE>

<DH>Those Who Watched Marie Elise West's Manic Spiral Saw a Collision
Coming. But Under Existing California Law,  There Was Little They Could
Do to Stop It.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Al Bowman knew the answer, but he still had to ask. "Honey, why
don't you skip your shift tonight and check in at Harbor-UCLA? Maybe you
could use a little help." He phrased it as a gentle suggestion to his
wife, but her blazing blue eyes scorched him from across the room.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to get strapped down and get a needle stuck in me," he
remembers her saying. "I'm fine. I'm going to work."</LD>
<LD>   It was Aug. 31, 2000, the Thursday night before Labor Day, and Hermosa
Beach was getting ready to do what it does best: paaaarrrtty. But the
41-year-old Bowman had no time for barbecues and block parties, no time
for the skin-on-skates fashion show rolling down the Strand or the Fiesta
de las Artes that turns the Pier Plaza into a sprawling, smoky street
fair. His wife, 35-year-old Marie Elise West, was showing signs of
another manic episode like the one she had experienced five months
earlier, in March 2000, when she was arrested for trespassing at a
Redondo Beach hotel called the Palos Verdes Inn.</LD>
<TE>   She had been hospitalized for 45 days after that arrest, her sixth
arrest and 19th hospitalization since 1990, when she was diagnosed with
manic-depression, also known as bipolar disorder. During the depression
phase, she often slept as many as 18 hours a day. But she had slept
little during the previous few days. At dinner with a friend the night
before, Bowman says, she spoke in the voices of three different
personalities: an Army drill sergeant, a college professor and a
street-walking prostitute. Then she was involved in a late-night car
accident.</TE>
<TE>   Now she couldn't stop buzzing around the little Cape Cod-style
bungalow they shared with their three Chihuahuas five blocks from the
beach. West's manic episodes usually came in the spring or early fall,
but clearly she was close to the edge on that late summer day. Bowman
says he paced the floor in frustration after she rejected his plea to
check in at a hospital. Under the 33-year-old state law known as the
Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, mentally ill people in California can be held
against their will only if they are deemed a danger to themselves or
others, or gravely disabled. Typically, police are called during a
violent episode and they "5150" the patient to a hospital--a reference to
a section of the LPS Act that allows police to transport someone to a
hospital, where they can be held for evaluation for 72 hours. Otherwise,
people showing signs of a psychotic episode must sign themselves in
voluntarily to receive emergency medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   With West's mania and its surge of inflated self-confidence coming on,
Bowman knew there was no chance his wife would sign herself in that
night. A onetime law student, she knew all the angles of California's
mental-health laws. He had called the police under similar circumstances
in March, to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   The police officers who came to the house that March night determined
that West was not violent, and they made Bowman give her the car keys she
was demanding. Sgt. Paul Wolcott of the Hermosa Beach Police, who once
before had 5150'd West, says of the March episode: "She wasn't violent,
and the car was registered to her, so we had no choice. The law gives us
very narrow, very strict guidelines to work under. If she doesn't meet
the 5150 guidelines, there's not much we can do."</TE>
<TE>   Bowman had already called one of her psychiatrists, Dwight Bergquist,
and advised him of the situation a few days before. Bergquist had not
seen West in several weeks, but Bowman says the psychiatrist advised him
to adjust her medication, which he did, adding Haldol to the four
medications--prescribed by different doctors--that she already was
taking. Bergquist says he advised Bowman to take her to a hospital, but
Bowman did not. What was the point, he says, if she wasn't going to sign
herself in?</TE>
<TE>   The mental-health movement known as mainstreaming, designed to get
mental patients out of hospitals and into the community, has had a number
of unintended consequences, many of them positive, some of them deadly.
One of every 20 homicides in this country is committed by untreated or
under-treated mentally ill people, according to a 1994 report by the U.S.
Justice Department. A recent study by the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation, an Illinois-based philanthropic group, estimates
that mental patients released into their communities commit nearly 1,000
homicides each year.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents hailed the mainstreaming movement in the 1970s as part of
the civil-rights struggle. Critics warned the impact of the movement on
society could be dangerous, but they were brushed aside by an unlikely
alliance of politicians--including then-California Gov. Ronald Reagan,
who saw mainstreaming as a way to empty overcrowded treatment facilities
and cut state costs--and civil-rights leaders, who cited horror stories
of people held against their will after they were no longer a threat to
anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years later, the story of Marie Elise West highlights one of
the unintended consequences of that dramatic policy shift. It also raises
disturbing questions about whether California's mental-health laws are
outdated. Have the civil rights of the mentally ill taken priority over
public safety? Has the basic right to walk the streets safely been
compromised by state government's unwillingness to legislate--and pay
for--treatment of the mentally ill?</TE>
<TE>   "We've been aware that the pendulum had swung too far for quite a
while now," says Assemblywoman Helen Thomson, D-Davis, a leader in the
movement to reform the state mental-health laws. "It's sad because 99% of
the mentally ill are not involved in violent incidents, but the focus is
on the 1% who do commit these violent acts because the headlines are so
startling to the community."</TE>
<TE>   The warning signs of problems with the new mainstreaming policy
cropped up early. Within the first five years after the LPS Act took
effect Jan. 1, 1969, the number of mentally ill people who committed
crimes and were imprisoned in state or county jails  jumped 300%.
Although the LPS Act has been amended during the ensuing 30 years, it
continues to guide California's approach to the tricky intersection of
the criminal justice system, which is based on a culture of punishment,
and the mental-health system, which is based on a culture of treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson, who began working as a psychiatric nurse in 1963, asked for a
report on the criminalization of the mentally ill in 1997. That report
found that 20% of the state prison population and 11% of the county jail
population are severely mentally ill. In its final report, issued in
1999, an LPS Reform Task Force--an ad hoc advocacy group made up mostly
of mental-health professionals and affected families--concluded that the
original law underestimated "the structure and support some people with
mental illness would require to successfully participate in community
life." Even with piecemeal amendments, it described the law as "one of
the most adversarial, costly and difficult to administer involuntary
treatment systems in the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   The report added to a growing call for reform, but major changes in
the LPS Act proved elusive until a spate of high-profile automobile
homicides involving mentally ill people made the issue a legislative
priority. In 1999, an Orange County man with a history of mental problems
drove into an Irvine schoolyard and killed two children. Last year four
people died during an Isla Vista street party when a UC Santa Barbara
student with a history of mental problems drove his car into a crowd.
Several cases involved affluent mentally ill people, reminding
legislators that mental illness is not just a problem among the homeless
and disenfranchised.</TE>
<TE>   The basic issue--when and how someone should be involuntarily
treated--remains the same. "It's not only morally and legally wrong to
allow these people to go without care until they do something criminal,
it's also financially wrong," says Carl A. "Tony" Capozzola, a defense
attorney representing West in the case stemming from the tragic
consequences of that late August night. "It costs taxpayers more in
police, legal and incarceration costs than it ever would to treat them
properly."</TE>
<TE>   West dressed for her shift as a server at the Hermosa Steakout
restaurant in an outfit that showed off her blond hair and compact
dancer's body. Barely 5 feet 6 in heels, she was a high-energy dancer who
had worked as a Vegas showgirl in 1991 and 1992. For a moment Bowman
remembered why he had stood by her, unlike two previous husbands who had
bailed out when they realized this sexy, smack-talking beach babe was
also mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   After she left for work, Bowman called her parents, Roger and
Geraldine West of Seal Beach, at 7:30 p.m. He conferred with them, as he
often had since he met West in 1995 and married her in 1999. The
relationship with his in-laws had been rocky from the start. For five
years, they were reluctant caregivers, each blaming the other for her
occasional flights into mania. Bowman felt that any contact with her
parents was stressful for her.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents felt that Bowman's lifestyle as producer of the Los
Angeles Music Awards--which Bowman says includes late-night clubbing,
loud music and 24/7 phone calls--was a catalyst for her manic episodes.
But this night, after nearly an hour of discussion, they agreed on a plan
that ultimately would be doomed by apparent miscommunication. Roger West
and his son Allen, an attorney who had represented Marie Elise during
many previous episodes, intended to come over to take her to the
hospital, then to ask the hospital police to 5150 her.</TE>
<TE>   At the restaurant, West was so exuberant she started inviting people
in off the street and urging them to order dinner and put it on her
credit card. At 9 p.m., two hours before her usual quitting time, her
supervisor ordered her to go home. When she arrived, Bowman was convinced
a manic phase was beginning, and that it likely would lead to an incident
that would keep her hospitalized anywhere from two days to four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   At 10:30 p.m., West began to fear for someone else's safety, another
signal that she was spiraling into a manic phase. In 1993 she had driven
her car into the Huntington Beach Pier because she thought Nazis were
gassing Jews underneath it, and in 1995 she had attacked a teacher at an
elementary school after she walked on the school grounds, announced she
was the Messiah and warned students they would be sold into sexual
slavery. Now she began to obsess that Michael Maglieri, son of Mario
Maglieri, owner of the Sunset Strip clubs The Whisky, The Roxy and the
Rainbow Bar &amp; Grill, would be killed by gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman hid West's car keys when she went into the bedroom to change
into black jeans and a black shirt, but he was no match for her guile as
the mania took over. A minute later she came flying out with a "secret"
set of keys to her 1989 green Volvo 240DL and said she was going to
rescue Maglieri. She began screaming and ran outside, drawing the
attention of neighbors. Once before, Bowman had been issued a
domestic-abuse warning when he says he was merely trying to get
assistance for her. He feared another such police misunderstanding, so he
stood and watched as she drove away at 11:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Bowman called her parents again and swore that he would take her to
the hospital himself--against her will--as soon as she returned and ask
the hospital police to 5150 her. Then he called Hermosa police and warned
them she was loose. They promised to look for her.</TE>
<TE>   At 1 a.m., West called from the Rainbow Bar &amp; Grill. Bowman begged her
to come home but she ranted about land mines on the 405 Freeway and hung
up. He walked the floor all night and called police twice more. Nothing.</TE>
<TE>   At 3:45 a.m., as Bowman was still pacing in  Hermosa Beach, Jesus
Plascencia pulled his old, cranberry-red Buick into the parking lot of
the Western Bagel Shop in Van Nuys. It was the same routine the
65-year-old Mexican immigrant had performed six days a week for the last
12 years: pick up several dozen bagels and bring them to nearby Weiler's
Deli, where he worked as a busboy. A frail, gentle man at 5 feet 9 and
140 pounds, Plascencia spoke little and communicated mostly through his
hands. As he walked into the bagel store, he passed a green Volvo parked
in a no-parking zone with a blond woman fidgeting behind the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   When Plascencia came out with his bagels and approached his car,
police say West suddenly put her car in reverse, backed up and hit him.
The blow knocked him to his knees as dozens of bagels and his black
baseball cap scattered onto the oil-stained parking lot. His shirt caught
on the undercarriage and he was dragged 30 yards onto Sepulveda
Boulevard, where he rolled free. Although no one knows if she did so
deliberately, police say West stopped the car, turned around, and ran
over him again, once more snagging his shirt and dragging him farther
down the road until he rolled free again. She left him dead in the
street, police say. She drove back into the parking lot, went in the
bagel shop and asked employee Hector Quintero for a cup of water.</TE>
<TE>   When Quintero confronted West about Plascencia, she replied: "Oh, him?
He's roadkill." Quintero called 911. West grabbed the cup of water and
stormed out to the parking lot, where she wandered aimlessly for a few
minutes. One witness said West looked like a "stripper" in her black
blouse and tight black pants. Then she picked up a few of the fallen
bagels and put them in the trunk of her car before being confronted by a
firefighter.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not a police officer," she said. "I don't have to answer your
questions." As other firefighters surrounded her, West got in her car,
locked the doors, rolled up the windows, turned up the volume and put on
a favorite CD.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters from L.A. Station 90 in Van Nuys were on the scene within
five minutes of the dispatcher's report of a car-pedestrian accident at
Western Bagel. After several firefighters surrounded the Volvo, West
rolled down her front passenger window.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you want? All I did was stop and try to get some water
because my radiator is overheating," she said. She rolled up the window
again, turned the volume all the way up and ignored them. Finally, Capt.
Corey Rose took a ball-peen hammer and broke the Volvo's left rear
window. West kicked and cursed as she was dragged out of the car.</TE>
<TE>   "You people don't run this country, you're just servants," she said.
"Wait till my ex-husband hears of this. He's a big man, and, yes, he is
black."</TE>
<TE>   Police took West to the Van Nuys division of the Los Angeles Police
Department. As she was brought in for booking, Det. Al Aldaz says, West
made anti-Latino slurs and kicked at the officers escorting her. The
first TV reporters arrived at Western Bagel minutes after police took
West away. Within hours, Aldaz made the first of several public
statements suggesting the homicide was a hate crime. He told the media:
"She said something about people of Hispanic descent should go back to
their country, after the intentional hitting of the vehicle toward the
victim." He also told reporters that West said "she hated people of
Hispanic descent."</TE>
<TE>   At 5 p.m. Friday, a reporter for WABC/7 news delivered a report that
was typical of the early TV coverage: "This was no accident here this
morning," he began. "Police have arrested 35-year-old Marie West of
Redondo Beach [sic] and charged her with murder, and they do say it was a
hate crime. They say she intentionally ran down a Hispanic man simply
because he was Hispanic."</TE>
<TE>   After showing footage of the crime scene, the reporter concluded:
"L.A. police say they see no indication that Marie Elise West is crazy.
They say the first thing she did when she got to the police station was
ask for a lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   The hate-crime angle continued to build in the media echo chamber over
the weekend as details emerged. Plascencia had never married, but he had
worked at the deli for more than 20 years and he lived with a family that
took him in as their honorary grandfather. He was known and beloved by
his friends and co-workers as a humble, hard-working man. They gathered
2,000 signatures on a petition demanding that West be charged with a
hate-crime murder.</TE>
<TE>   To convict West of a hate-crime murder, the state would have to prove
that she intentionally killed Plascencia because of his ethnicity. Such a
charge also would make her eligible for the death penalty or life
imprisonment without the possibility of parole, depending on how the
district attorney decided to pursue it.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of Sept. 5, four days after the homicide, Gil Garcetti,
then the L.A. County district attorney, charged West with a hate-crime
murder, alleging that she killed Plascencia in a premeditated act because
he was Latino. Capozzola, West's attorney, says he asked Jacquelyn Lacey,
head of the D.A.'s hate-crime unit, to hold off on the charge until
West's mental state could be evaluated. He says he was told the decision
had already been made and that the complaint could be amended later if it
turned out a hate-crime charge was not warranted.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her it was premature and not consistent with a careful
evaluation of the facts," says Capozzola, a former deputy district
attorney. "Why was there such a rush to judgment?"</TE>
<TE>   West's parents suspect that Garcetti--who declined several interview
requests for this story--was trying to curry favor with the Valley's
Latino voters as part of his losing bid for reelection two months later.
Bowman tried to fight back on local newscasts, arguing that West was out
of her mind on a toxic cocktail of medications at the time of the
homicide and, in her right mind, would never harbor any racist thoughts.
Three weeks after Plascencia's death, a judge in Van Nuys Superior Court
referred West's case to a mental-health court, which determined that West
was not competent and should be held for treatment and evaluation until
she is competent to stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Jones, Western Bagel's human resources director, was at the
scene the morning Plascencia was killed . He says he is surprised that
D.A. Steve Cooley--who defeated Garcetti--still has not dismissed the
hate-crime charge. He said all the employees he talked to that morning
understood instinctively that West was mentally ill. "Several of the
workers said she was crazy. It's unfortunate the police turned it into a
hate crime so quickly," Jones says. "It had nothing to do with
[Plascencia] being Latino--unless there's something we don't know about
in her background."</TE>
<TE>   West had grown up assuming she was white, but in 1978 she learned that
her mother was officially "racially mixed" because of her Creole
background. That was when the West family first learned that her mother,
Geraldine Porche, had ancestors in Louisiana that included black slaves
who had borne the children of white French settlers.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 1990, West completed an internship at the Bet Tzedek
Legal Services firm, where she told everyone she was headed to Berkeley's
Boalt Hall law school. In her exit review, dated Aug. 13, 1990, her
supervisor described the 25-year-old West as a "legal assistant
extraordinaire."</TE>
<TE>   The flattering description was supported by detailed insights: "Marie
Elise is an extremely intelligent woman. She has excellent oral and
written communication skills. . . . She is highly organized." On her
application to Boalt Hall, West checked off "racially mixed," a factor
that could have helped her gain admission after graduating from UCLA in
1988 with a bachelor's degree in history and a 3.2 grade-point average.
She delayed starting law school for two years.</TE>
<TE>   By the time she arrived at Boalt Hall, West had begun to wonder if she
had been admitted because of affirmative action policies. She decided she
would leave law school if she had. "She felt she would have been
depriving someone who had suffered true discrimination of the extra help
they were entitled to," Bowman says.</TE>
<TE>   West checked with the admissions director, who told her, informally,
that affirmative action had not been a factor. Two days later West tried
to join the Black Student Union. Her lead attorney, Capozzola, did not
allow her to be interviewed for this article. But according to Bowman,
West claims she was ridiculed by some of the black students, who may have
felt the blond-haired, blue-eyed West was mocking them.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 9, 1990, two weeks after she arrived at law school, West told
her roommate that CIA spies were following her. Someone called police
after seeing her behave erratically at a mass-transit station, and police
took her to the Herrick campus of Alta Bates Medical Center, where she
was first diagnosed with the onset of bipolar syndrome. She stayed for
more than a week, then she checked out and resumed classes. But after two
more weeks of classes, West voluntarily returned to Alta Bates. She
checked out in mid-October and came home to Seal Beach. Four days later,
a very troubled West was admitted to College Hospital in Cerritos.</TE>
<TE>   Her "chief complaint" on her admission form, as quoted by the
attending  physician, Charles Clegg: "There is too much--too much--the
pressure of law school is too much." It became clear to West's College
Hospital doctors that there were other problems--family and racial
issues--that may have played as much a part in her initial breakdown as
those first weeks of law school. She said she was hearing voices that
frightened her, and ascribed racial overtones to her emerging mental
problems.</TE>
<TE>   According to Clegg's notes of Nov. 3, 1990: "She stated the voices
told her they knew she was mentally ill. She stated she thought these
voices were people from the black student union she had joined at
Berkeley. She stated she was extremely fearful of these voices. She
stated she was a Creole and that had made her black. In fact the patient
is Caucasian. . . . Her initial mental status examination showed her to
be totally overwhelmed. Flight of ideas and tangentiality were obvious. .
. . She was clearly hypomanic and did not appear to realize that she was
mentally ill."</TE>
<TE>   Clegg had identified a critical problem for West and many mental
patients: the inability to realize they are ill and need medication. Her
parents, Geraldine and Roger West, have joined several organizations for
families of the mentally ill. They say they have seen and heard about the
denial syndrome many times.</TE>
<TE>   During an interview at their Seal Beach duplex, Roger, a retired
computer salesman, reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a
3-by-5-inch notecard. In capital letters, he carefully prints the word
"ANOSOGNOSIA"--defined as a patient's inability to recognize his or her
own disorder or illness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the key to understanding all this," he says as he hands the card
over. Even though they don't get along, Bowman agrees with his
father-in-law on this point. "It's the Catch-22 that the authors of the
LPS Act didn't take into account," he says. "Medication works, but only
if the patient is conscientious about taking [it]. When the mania comes
on, they start to feel so good that the idea there might be something
wrong with them is absurd. So they no longer feel the need for
medication, and that's when the public is endangered."</TE>
<TE>   J. Raymond DePaulo, a specialist in manic-depression at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, says it is crucial for a patient to establish a
stable, long-term relationship with a hospital and a therapist. Ideally,
outpatient care of medication and therapy is  supplemented with brief
hospitalizations when necessary. More than 75% of America's 3 million
manic-depressive patients manage to live fairly stable lives, he says,
even though most are not correctly diagnosed until 10 years after the
onset.</TE>
<TE>   West's medical records, provided by Bowman, are littered with
references to her resistance to medication. She complained constantly
that the medications were fueling her descent into mental illness. Within
two months of her initial episode, the pattern for the next decade was
set: West--often convinced that she was not sick--began a modern odyssey
of 19 hospitalizations that would lead her to eight hospitals, seven
therapists and an ever-growing list of medications, including the
mood-stabilizing drug lithium and the powerful psychotropics Haldol and
Seroquel.</TE>
<TE>   "That happens all too often," DePaulo says. "Her case is not unique.
The cohesive support network often just isn't there."</TE>
<TE>   Money for medication, therapy and hospitalization quickly became an
issue. West's parents went through more than $125,000 helping her during
the first few years after diagnosis, until a monthly bill of $951 for
medication finally forced them to look for help from Medi-Cal. West was
granted Social Security disability payments in December 1995, but that
did not cover all the medical costs. Money was always a stress point for
her.</TE>
<TE>   West's parents say California's outdated, inadequate laws force
families--even relatively affluent families determined to stay involved
with their mentally ill children--to watch helplessly as their loved ones
try to live independently until their next episode, when they again can
be hospitalized against their will. That leads to fragmented treatment,
they say.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that when someone is 5150'd, the police take him or
her to the nearest institution equipped to handle them. That's how she
started at Alta Bates and Harbor-UCLA," says Geraldine West, a retired
paralegal. She noted, too, that her daughter was 5150'd eight times
before she ran down Jesus Plascencia.</TE>
<TE>   During the decade that passed between Sept. 9, 1990, the day of West's
first psychotic episode, and Sept. 1, 2000, the day she killed
Plascencia, West had struggled to live as a "normal" person, to prove to
everyone how smart and involved she was. She tried law school three more
times, and three more times she quickly had psychotic episodes and
dropped out. She also worked as a legal assistant, as a Las Vegas
showgirl and as a cosmetics saleswoman.</TE>
<TE>   She joined health clubs and the Sierra Club, volunteered for the ACLU
and wrote songs. She tried to start a bumper sticker business with her
own heartfelt messages ("Immigrants Are People Too," and "Why Do We Kill
People to Show Them That Killing People Is Wrong?") and wrote hundreds of
letters offering advice to politicians such as former President Bill
Clinton and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein. She took up the causes of
everyone from inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal to publisher Larry Flynt.</TE>
<TE>   She married three times, once to a black man and the third time to
Bowman, who is half-Latino. Bowman did not realize she was mentally ill
until several months after they began dating, when he woke up to find her
burning his Beatles albums and screaming, "These are not the Beatles.
They're impostors from the CIA." Bowman called her parents in the morning
and learned he was in love with a mentally ill woman.</TE>
<TE>   "Up till then I just thought she was a beautiful, kind, idealistic
girl who had a really outgoing personality," he says. "By the time of the
first episode, I was in love, and I couldn't leave her."</TE>
<TE>   Typical of West's efforts during the five years Bowman lived with her
was a letter she wrote to film director Steven Spielberg on June 7, 1997.
"I recently saw your latest movie, 'The Lost World.' I was shocked and
delighted to see a young girl of color play a role in your film that
would have normally gone to a Caucasian. . . . I am very sensitive to
race issues for reasons unknown to myself."</TE>
<TE>   The letter shows why the hate-crime charge is so absurd, Bowman says,
and so painful for West's friends and family. "She celebrated her own
ethnicity," he says. "This had nothing to do with hate. She couldn't
control the illness. It controlled her. Because the law wouldn't let us
hold her against her will when the illness took over, Mr. Plascencia is
dead and my wife is facing the death penalty."</TE>
<TE>   West's case has been stalled for the past 20 months as she goes
through her prison-style daily routine of evaluation and treatment.
Currently taking five different medications, she remains at Patton State
Hospital, waiting to be declared competent to stand trial. She was found
incompetent again last month, and her next hearing is scheduled for Oct.
8. If West is found competent, both sides agree a trial could follow soon
after--unless a deal is struck. The fundamental questions posed by the
hate-crime charge remain: Did West kill Plascencia deliberately? Did she
kill him because he was Latino, or because she was out of her mind and
would have backed into whoever was there?</TE>
<TE>   Bowman says his wife should be charged only with involuntary vehicular
manslaughter. "This was a terrible accident by a woman having a psychotic
episode, a woman who tried desperately to stay on the right mix of
medication. Mr. Garcetti tried to pump it up into a hate crime for his
own political purposes," he says. "It was a politically motivated rush to
judgment." While Deputy D.A. Scott Millington, who took over the case and
now is head of the D.A.'s hate-crime unit, and Det. Aldaz say they still
believe this was a hate crime, Plascencia's nephew, Sal Hernandez, says
he is not sure. "I don't know why she did it," he says. "The reason will
probably never be known."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, who works as a mechanical engineer in Los Angeles, says he
does not want to see West on death row. "But she deserves to be put away
from society, so she will not commit a similar act," he says. "She was
responsible for maintaining her medication. This is what society demands
of all of us."</TE>
<TE>   home alone at night with his three dogs, estranged now from West's
family, notorious in the town he was raised in as the husband of the
crazy woman who ran down a kindly old immigrant, Bowman says he relates
to the plight of Rusty Yates, husband of the Texas woman convicted of
drowning her five children in the family tub. "Sometimes I feel like the
only man in America who can relate to what he has had to endure, when you
love someone who turns out to be mentally ill," Bowman says.</TE>
<TE>   He says he is haunted by memories and second-guesses. Suspecting the
approach of another manic episode, he says he talked things over with a
still-rational West a week before Plascencia's death. He says she told
him she wanted to be treated at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley,
where she was brought after her first episode back in 1990. "She always
felt they did the best job with her," Bowman says. He also says she
wanted to go alone, insisting, "I don't need a babysitter."</TE>
<TE>   So he bought her a plane ticket for San Francisco, arranged for her to
stay with friends and took her to the airport on Aug. 27. That same day
workers began a long-planned refurbishing of their house.</TE>
<TE>   When West arrived at Alta Bates the next day, she told the admitting
doctor she was having gynecological problems, not mental problems. "I
think that, like many mental patients, she just chickened out from
admitting herself to the psych ward. No one likes to get strapped down or
get a needle stuck in them," Bowman says.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor prescribed an anti-bleeding medication and released West
without any mental evaluation. She flew home Aug. 29, took a taxi from
the airport and showed up at the house unannounced. She found the carpet
pulled up and the furniture removed, and Bowman says his wife began
crying hysterically.</TE>
<TE>   "Any kind of stress like that, any change in her environment, could
set her off," he says. "I knew she was on the edge, but I felt helpless.
There was nothing I could do. Not until she was violent. Not until it was
too late."</TE>

<LD>Despite previous legislative efforts to amend California's
mental-health laws, "there has been a growing recognition that waiting
for danger is just too late, and a growing recognition that the problem
is getting worse," says Assemblywoman Helen Thomson, D-Davis, one of
California's most vocal reform proponents.</LD>
<LD>   The first result of the reform movement, AB 1424, which allows
families to introduce a history of mental illness when police are
considering whether to take a patient to emergency services, took effect
this Jan. 1. The more comprehensive reform bill, AB 1421, which would
mandate and pay for court-ordered outpatient treatment after patients
such as West are released from a hospital, passed the Assembly but did
not come up for a vote in the Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Critics say the need to pass that bill is long overdue. Tony
Capozzola, one of West's defense attorneys, says the lack of reform has
turned California into an "open-air asylum."</LD>
<TE>   Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, whom critics
blame for the lack of Senate action on mental-health reform, says the
Senate will deal with the issue this session when an amended version of
AB 1421 will be heard in the Senate Health and Human Services Committee.
"It's a serious problem, and we intend to deal with it in a serious way,"
Burton says. "But we have to balance the patient's rights against the
safety of society."</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Bergquist, West's last therapist before the killing, says that
what happened to West that night more than 20 months ago should serve as
a warning. "In California you have the right to act crazy and destroy
your life, and Marie Elise exercised that right," he says.
"Unfortunately, she killed someone at the same time."</TE>

<DH>Investigation: Julie Fahrer's adoptions never happened,

<LD>They named her Alexandria Sumiko. They made arrangement for a crib
and baby furniture. They started loving her, sight unseen.</LD>
<LD>   But that's as far as Holly and George Foster got in their quest

facilitator Julie Fahrer.</LD>
<LD>   Alexandria never existed, the Fosters say. There was no birth, no

<TE>   Fahrer will not comment. Her husband, in a recent interview, said
he knows of no children his wife has worked with in the last 20
years. Asked about the allegations made by the Fosters and other

life to lead," he said. "I'm not participating."</TE>
<TE>   His wife never guaranteed to anyone that she could find them a
baby, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Fahrer gained publicity last month by telling Afghan
families across California that she had access to hundreds of orphans
from Afghanistan. After that claim was exposed as a hoax, other
stories came to light--stories of couples desperate to adopt and a
woman who leads them on.</TE>
<TE>   Some families say they gave Fahrer hundreds of dollars, money that
could be considered gifts or payment for services such as
consultations.</TE>
<TE>   Fahrer has never been sued or prosecuted. The Fosters, like other
families, said they did not consider going to court because they
wanted to put their experience behind them.</TE>
<TE>   After Fahrer's claims about Afghan orphans, however, the FBI is
investigating her.</TE>
<TE>   Fahrer and her husband have told several stories to explain her
actions. Ten years ago, when couples began demanding proof of the
babies they hoped to adopt, they say Fahrer claimed she had a brain
tumor and was going blind. Later, she told her church congregation
that the tumor story was untrue, Neal Fahrer and other members of the
congregation say.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Neal Fahrer explained the Afghan hoax by saying
that his wife had created a fantasy because she suffers from
psychological problems.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the explanation, for the families, the experience has
been traumatic.</TE>
<TE>   Over 13 months in the early 1990s, the Fosters say Fahrer promised
them seven children. As each adoption fell through, the Fosters say,
Fahrer created tragic stories to explain why. Alexandria, for
example, died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, Fahrer said in a
letter the Fosters shared with a reporter. A detective was unable to
find a birth or death certificate. Fahrer sent ashes, photos, a lock
of hair and baby photos to the Fosters to make her seem real.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was an illusion," Holly Foster said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Fahrer built a reputation as an adoption resource.
She operated businesses under such names as HOPE Agency, Adoption
Library, and Adoption Research Center, according to letters and
brochures that carry her name.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1980s, she told people she worked with Beverly Hills
adoption attorney D. Durand Cook. Letters written by Fahrer use
Cook's letterhead. Cook did not return phone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Fahrer Was Known as an Adoption Facilitator</TE>
<TE>   Although no instance has been verified in which she delivered a
child, Fahrer became known in the Southern California adoption
community as a person who could help couples find Asian babies. In
1991, she spoke at a conference at which she was described as an
"expert in international and domestic adoption, specializing in
Japan."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of reputable adoption agencies, attorneys, churches and
social service agencies referred hopeful couples to Fahrer, according
to referral letters. She is listed as a resource in a book about
adoption.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Monica adoption attorney Randi Barrow knew of Fahrer through
a well-established adoption agency and met her once. "I didn't have
reason to believe she was a phony in any way," said Barrow, who later
helped the Fosters complete an adoption.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a year, according to the Fosters, who now live near
Sacramento, they placed their hopes for a child with Fahrer. Looking
back, they recognize the unreality of their situation. One adoption
purportedly of a 9-year-old named Yuki fell through after Fahrer told
them the boy had ties with the Japanese mafia, the Yakuza.</TE>
<TE>   But they believed it all. When they received what Fahrer said were
Alexandria's ashes in a pink heart-shaped box, they grieved for their
child, they said. They rented snow shoes, drove to Big Bear and
buried the ashes in snow along with a piece of turquoise. "It felt
very real," Holly Foster said. Added her husband, George: "It was as
if someone had actually passed away."</TE>
<TE>   They had already paid Fahrer $250 for a consultation, they said.
When Alexandria "died," they gave her $100 for flowers and $100 to
cover her alleged phone calls to Japan. Later, they bought her a $600
fax machine and spent more money on information resources Fahrer sold
them.</TE>
<TE>   They signed a contract acknowledging that Fahrer's services came
with no guarantees. The contract also notes that Fahrer is not a
licensed adoption agency. The contract gave Fahrer an even greater
aura of professionalism, the Fosters said.</TE>
<TE>   Another family, Rita and Curtis Yoshimura of Santa Monica, also
say they hoped Fahrer could help them. In front of a crowd of people
at a Christmas party, the Yoshimuras say, Fahrer announced that a
birth mother had selected them. The Fosters, who also were present,
recalled the same story. By Valentine's Day, Fahrer said, the
Yoshimuras would have a baby.</TE>
<TE>   "I was elated," Rita Yoshimura recalled. "It was my dream come
true." Weeks passed and Yoshimura said she kept asking for proof.
When would they meet the birth mother? Did she need financial
assistance? Where were the papers to sign?</TE>
<TE>   The story began to unravel, and Fahrer disappeared, Yoshimura
said, allegedly to a San Diego hospital where she was being treated
for a tumor. Yoshimura said she pieced things together, quizzed one
of Fahrer's assistants, called phone numbers Fahrer had given her. No
one knew of the mother.</TE>
<TE>   "It really was an incredible mind game," said Yoshimura, a
psychoanalyst. "It was such an assault. It was such an exploitation.
... It was like a bomb had gone off and our lives had been
shattered."</TE>
<TE>   Other Families Don't Want to Relive Pain</TE>
<TE>   Other families said they experienced similar scenarios, but
declined to comment on the record, saying they could not relive that
time in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Fahrer, meanwhile also began representing herself as someone who
worked with the United Nations and the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   She started another agency unrelated to adoption, International
Resources, and in the last two years has trained actors to become
drama therapists assisting refugees, according to people who
participated in the program. At an orientation meeting, Fahrer told a
group that she was working "officially, but unofficially" for the
United Nations, according to a tape recording of the session provided
by one of the participants.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those actors say they paid Fahrer a nominal $15, but
invested months--even years--in the training, with no results. United
Nations officials said they have no knowledge of any such program,
and Fahrer's husband says it does not exist.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years after their contacts with Fahrer, the Fosters and
Yoshimuras said they cannot believe she is still in business.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope our story can convince some of these people to wake up,"
George Foster said. "She's been around. She's done this before."</TE>

<LD>After months of contentious political debate over Bernard C. Parks'
bid for a second term as LAPD police chief, he was honored Saturday,
his official last day, as a role model and public servant whose work
has improved Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Parks, wearing a suit and tie, received a standing ovation as he
stood to speak to about 150 people at Ted Watkins Park in Watts,
where a sidewalk plaque was dedicated to him.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing relaxed, he smiled, nodded and thanked the audience.
Parks said he and his wife, Bobbie, both look forward to the next
step in his career. He has said he may consider a run for the Los
Angeles City Council.</LD>
<TE>   "We will be a part of this city for the rest of our lives," Parks
said. "Certainly, this is just another phase of moving forward in
dealing with public service."</TE>
<TE>   Parks retired last month after failing to win the support of Mayor
James K. Hahn, the Police Commission and the City Council. His term
as chief was to end in August. Parks, the city's second African
American chief, had been with the Los Angeles Police Department for
37 years and was credited with breaking racial barriers there.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Chief Michael Bostic has been serving as acting chief. The
commission is expected to announce an interim chief this week,and
will conduct a nationwide search for Parks' replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, having already cleaned out his desk, said he spent his last
day attending to final duties at the department, signing paperwork
and turning in equipment. Parks and his wife planned to attend a few
private receptions in his honor Saturday evening.</TE>
<TE>   During his speech, Parks recognized community activists in Watts
and reminisced about the changes that community has seen in the past
four decades. He said he remembered the day in 1961 when he first saw
a white officer and an African American officer in the same patrol
car.</TE>
<TE>   He Urges Residents to Monitor LAPD</TE>
<TE>   Already more in the character of a politician than a police chief,
Parks briefly talked about the importance of improving health care
and helping the homeless. And he urged residents to continue
monitoring the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a lot of things that have been harmful to the
community, and unfortunately some of those things were caused by the
Los Angeles Police Department," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've moved beyond a great number of those issues, but
that doesn't mean we shouldn't still be vigilant," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) praised Parks as a trustworthy
and responsible leader who put himself as risk by cleaning up the
police department.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew where the bad eggs were, and he was not afraid to do what
he had to do," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Rampart corruption scandal, which became known during Parks'
administration, has put former police officers in jail for stealing
drugs and money and planting evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Waters criticized the City Council and the Police Commission for
not backing Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "They should have been able to rise above whatever the mayor
wanted, but they didn't have the courage to do that," she said,
receiving loud applause.</TE>
<TE>   Police commissioners decided not to support Parks because they
said he was responsible for a rising crime rate and a decline in
officer morale. Hahn had said he was unhappy with the chief's record
on crime, as well as reform and community policing.</TE>
<TE>   If Parks runs for City Council or eventually mayor, Waters said,
"this city would be better off for it."</TE>
<TE>   After the speeches, a plaque with Parks' name and picture was
unveiled on the Promenade of Prominence, modeled after Hollywood's
Walk of Fame. He joins other honorees such as Kenneth Hahn, Willie
Brown, Johnnie Cochran and Willie Williams. Also honored Saturday
were dentist Ralph Winge and Leo Hill, director of equal opportunity
programs for Lockheed Martin Corp.</TE>
<TE>   James Mays, who founded the promenade, said Parks has made history
through his leadership. "He will eternally be here as chief," Mays
said, pointing to the plaques on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Johnson, 49, who attended the celebration, said he
respects Parks and worries about the LAPD without him. "I don't want
to see us go backward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yvonne Casey, 68, also said she was disappointed to see Parks
leave.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sad, but I think he's going to have a lot more ahead," said
Casey, a retired secretary from the Compton Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   As Parks prepared to leave the community celebration Saturday
afternoon, he said he planned to spend some time doing what he hasn't
been able to do for many years.</TE>
<TE>   His wife interrupted with a smile and said, "Like housework."</TE>

<HD>Little Job Security in Being a Police Chief</HD>
<DH>Politics: Era of longtime leaders gives way to era of
short-timers who are often gone in three years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the retirement of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks, Los Angeles now
joins the dance of the chiefs.</LD>
<LD>   Top police brass nationwide regularly change their
partners--chiefs match up with one city for a few years, then leave
to take up with the next, or bow out into retirement.</LD>
<LD>   The era of longtime police chiefs, such as Los Angeles' Daryl
Gates, has given way to the era of short-timers, as chiefs and
sheriffs of major departments rarely last longer than three years
anymore.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, by surviving nearly all of his five-year term, Parks
outlasted a bunch of them.</TE>
<TE>   Among large police organizations, 21/2 to three years is now the
average chief's tenure, according to several police associations,
including the Major Cities Chiefs of North America, representing
chiefs of departments with 1,000 or more officers.</TE>
<TE>   That average has been drifting downward. As recently as the
mid-1980s, the Police Executive Research Forum found that police
chiefs generally held their jobs for five to six years.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago, for example, has had three top police officials in the
last 10 years, counting interim chiefs. Philadelphia has had four,
and Dallas, Washington, D.C., and New York have all had
five--although the current New York commissioner, Raymond Kelly,
served once previously.</TE>
<TE>   In many medium-sized cities as well, police chiefs serve without
contracts, and at the whim of political leaders. Many wear out their
goodwill within a few years, drawing the ire of police unions,
politicians or community groups, and move on.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, some chiefs now regard themselves as itinerant
laborers, or baseball managers going from one team to another. They
live with uncertainty, and take it for granted they will move
repeatedly. "I live life one day at a time," said Oxnard Police Chief
Art Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Long stewardships typical of a previous generation of chiefs are a
luxury few chiefs enjoy today, said Detroit Police Chief Jerry A.
Oliver, who ran departments in Richmond, Va., and Pasadena before
becoming Detroit's sixth chief in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Change agents have a shelf life," Oliver said. "When you make
changes, you make enemies, and sooner or later your enemies become
51%."</TE>
<TE>   In some departments, turnover at the top is such a way of life
that lower commanders joke that it's hazardous to go on vacation: You
never know who might be in charge when you get back.</TE>
<TE>   North Miami Beach Police Chief Bill Berger, president of the
International Assn. of Chiefs of Police, said that actually happened
to him. Once while working as an underling in another jurisdiction,
Berger said, he returned from a conference and was surprised to be
summoned to see his boss--a chief whose name he didn't recognize.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, introductions are a way of life at the annual
conference of the 50 top chiefs in the country, where a quarter of
the attendees each year are new faces, said Chuck Wexler, executive
director of the Police Executive Research Forum.</TE>
<TE>   The dizzying turnover at high ranks of policing may prove
fortunate for Los Angeles, as the city begins its search for its
sixth chief or interim chief in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Qualified candidates for the post, considered one of the country's
top police jobs, may not be numerous. But by necessity, they job hunt
with some frequency.</TE>
<TE>   For example, few eyebrows were raised when Portland, Ore., Police
Chief Mark Kroeker announced last month that he would apply for
Parks' job, even though Kroeker has only been in Portland since
December 1999. After all, if Kroeker--Portland's fourth chief in a
decade--changed jobs now, he would merely be conforming to the
statistical norm.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey is
something of a veteran in chief circles, having held onto his job for
four years. He said he doesn't plan to move, because his chances for
renewal look good. Still, he mused when asked in an interview whether
he might be interested in the Los Angeles job: "If the right offer
came around," he said, "and things didn't work out here...."</TE>
<TE>   Experts say very small police agencies seem to have less turnover
at the top than do larger jurisdictions. But in larger jurisdictions,
the rotating-chiefs phenomenon is pervasive.</TE>
<TE>   A study from the late 1990s of chiefs in cities with a population
of more than 50,000 found that, at that time, nearly two-thirds had
held their jobs for less than five years, according to the
police-executive research group. A majority had replaced predecessors
who also had served less than five years. The same study found that
only about a third draw six-figure salaries, although most earn more
than $70,000 per year.</TE>
<TE>   Although police experts say chiefs' terms seem to be shrinking of
late, the trend is not unprecedented.</TE>
<TE>   Short-timers were common for much of the LAPD's early history. In
fact, Los Angeles in the early 20th century was a veritable
police-chief mill. Serving at the pleasure of the mayor, chiefs often
came and went after serving just a few months--or in some cases, a
few days.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent civil-service protections for chiefs changed that.
Chiefs such as Los Angeles' William H. Parker, chief from 1950 to
1966, ushered in an era of relative stability (an anomaly was 1967 to
1969, when Tom Reddin and two short-term acting chiefs held the
post). Ed Davis was chief from 1969 to 1978, and Gates from 1978 to
1992.</TE>
<TE>   But another wave of reforms in the 1990s changed the landscape
again. Altered civil-service provisions, improved pension plans and
trends toward earlier retirement have accelerated change in top
positions.</TE>
<TE>   One influential factor driving high turnover of police chiefs is a
volatile mix of scandal and political backlash. Often, new chiefs are
hired after public outrage emerges over issues such as racial
profiling, riot control, corruption, high-profile shootings or
brutality cases.</TE>
<TE>   The incoming bosses are expected to shake up the status quo, and
thus find their jobs are set for political conflict from the outset.</TE>
<TE>   "The mandate for change is with every chief," said Seattle Police
Chief Gil Kerlikowske, formerly police chief in Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   That is true whether they are brought from outside their
departments, or hired from within, as Parks was, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A number of prominent chiefs seem to embrace the role, portraying
themselves as challengers to the business-as-usual cultures of their
departments. Said Detroit's Oliver: "We are not our dad's police
chiefs."</TE>
<TE>   But such chiefs are practically guaranteed to run afoul of one or
more competing constituencies--officers unions, politicians or
community groups, said Wexler, of the police-executive research
group.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' well-publicized disputes with the LAPD officers union over
work schedules and discipline, for example, were not unique. Other
chiefs have been similarly undone, Wexler said.</TE>
<TE>   The same motifs crop up in city after city. A union no-confidence
vote against Parks late in his term, for instance, is a tactic
replicated in several jurisdictions, Seattle included.</TE>
<TE>   Other experts compare the short tenure of police chiefs to the
frequently short terms of big-city school superintendents. In both
instances, leaders are hired to oversee institutions that have become
flash points for public discontent over social problems. They pay the
price.</TE>
<TE>   "So many roads through American life run right through your
office," Portland's Kroeker said. "You find yourself in the middle of
discussion about race in America, about education failing, about
young people [using] drugs."</TE>
<TE>   And as with schools, Seattle Chief Kerlikowske said dryly,
"everyone knows how to run the police department."</TE>
<TE>   But policing experts are divided over whether short terms for
chiefs are good or bad. On one hand, short-timer chiefs may have a
hard time getting much done. Reform efforts may be stifled because
more reactionary elements in police bureaucracies prevail by simply
outlasting a vulnerable chief and that chief's command staff.</TE>
<TE>   "These are very large complex organizations. You don't turn them
like speedboats," Kerlikowske said. Further, high turnover of chiefs
breeds unrealistic public expectations of quick reform, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other chiefs say the endurance required to handle the stress and
long hours of the job make short terms for chiefs a necessity.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, they say change at the top fosters innovation, and
ensures chiefs remain in top form. Successful chiefs end up engaging
in what Kroeker called "speed leadership" because they know their
time is short and they must move quickly.</TE>
<TE>   This pressure is not without its downside, however.</TE>
<TE>   After announcing his intention to apply for Parks' job, Kroeker
said friends reacted with one voice, telling him: "You're out of your
mind."</TE>

<HD>Slain Deputy Is Mourned</HD>
<DH>Funeral: Thousands gather to bid farewell to David March,
'a good guy to be around.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With thousands of uniformed officers standing at attention and two
electric guitarists playing "Amazing Grace," the flag-draped casket
of Sheriff's Deputy David March was carried into a Santa Clarita
amphitheater Saturday afternoon. Then, as if on cue, gusts of wind
rustled through the pine trees.</LD>
<LD>   The moment was not lost on Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca,
who addressed the crowd of 3,000 who had gathered to bid farewell to
March.</LD>
<LD>   "David is a part of that cool breeze," said Baca. "David's hand is
on the shoulder of each of us here."</LD>
<TE>   March, 33, who was gunned down Monday by a man he had stopped for
a traffic violation, was remembered as a man of God and a man who
could be counted on to do the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the mourners sat or stood on the steps of the Grace
Baptist Church Amphitheater. In the center, hundreds of chairs were
set up for March's family, brass from various law enforcement
agencies including the FBI, Secret Service, Drug Enforcement
Administration and Los Angeles Police Department, as well as members
of the sheriff's Temple station, where March had worked for the last
two years.</TE>
<TE>   "In one horrific moment that Monday morning, the entire Temple
family was devastated," said Capt. Roberta Abner, of the Temple
station, located in Temple City. "He was a good street cop."</TE>
<TE>   The shooting has made his fellow deputies even more aware of their
surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   "It can happen anywhere, any time," said Zoltan Tombol, who works
the gang unit at Temple station and who rushed to the scene moments
after hearing the call for help. "It was scary to see one of your
friends lying on the street dying."</TE>
<TE>   Another deputy who worked with March for two years described him
as "a great dude."</TE>
<TE>   "He was just a good guy to be around, always smiling," said Deputy
Rich Soto.</TE>
<TE>   March was born in 1969 in Barstow and joined the Sheriff's
Department seven years ago. He spent his first five years at the
sheriff-run jail in Castaic before transferring to the Temple
station.</TE>
<TE>   March was on patrol in Irwindale about 10:30 a.m. when he began
following a car, which may have contained as many as three people,
for an undisclosed traffic violation, investigators said. After March
pulled the car over on Live Oak Avenue just east of Peck Road, the
driver got out, Deputy Rich Pena said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver "met the deputy halfway between the patrol car and
[his] vehicle," Pena said. The driver drew a gun, fired and fled.
Detectives said March was shot several times.</TE>
<TE>   The search is continuing for 25-year-old Jorge "Armando" Arroyo
Garcia, the man suspected of killing the deputy. The suspected drug
dealer is known to carry a pistol and reportedly has vowed to kill
any law enforcement officer who tries to arrest him.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, who is also known as Chato, is 5 feet 7 to 5 feet 9 and
weighs 195 to 230 pounds. He may have the word "Garcia" tattooed on
his back or shoulder area.</TE>
<TE>   During the service, one of March's friends described how the
deputy tried to help some of those he arrested.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of months ago, March took extra time to have a talk with
a man he had arrested and later released. March told him it was time
to straighten out his life. Two weeks later, the man returned to the
station to thank March.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, three days after March was killed, his wife, Teri,
received a letter from that man, who told her how sorry he was and
said March had helped him turn his life around.</TE>
<TE>   Abner told mourners what March had written about his job in his
last evaluation:</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I give a full day's work. I've learned to enjoy what I'm
doing. My goals are simple: To always be painfully honest, to work
hard and to hopefully make a difference in people's lives."</TE>

<HD>Districts See Decline in Dropout Rate</HD>
<DH>Education: Ventura County's 1.4% tally last year was half
the state average, which has stayed constant for three years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A greater percentage of Ventura County high school students stayed in
school during the academic year that ended last June than in the
previous year, according to a new state Department of Education
report.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice to see it going down," Chuck Weis, Ventura County
superintendent of schools, said of the dropout rate. "But we know we
lose kids, and that's a travesty. We need to work on it."</LD>
<LD>   Most Ventura County school districts have seen a decline in
dropouts over the last five years. The countywide dropout rate was
1.9% during the 1998-99 school year, 1.8% in 1999-2000 and 1.4% in
2000-01.</LD>
<TE>   Statewide, 2.8% of high school students dropped out in
2000-01--the same rate as the two previous school years.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000-01, the state graduation rate for seniors who had enrolled
four years earlier was 68.9%, according to the report. But that
doesn't account for students who moved out of state, switched to
private schools, took an extra year to graduate or entered adult
schools or community colleges, said Donna Rothenbaum, an education
program consultant for the state.</TE>
<TE>   The data will not be precise until at least 2005, when an
electronic system to track all California students is in place,
Rothenbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   Rates are not broken down by county, but the state calculated an
estimate of the number of dropouts from 1997 to 2001, based on the
2000-01 rate. In Ventura County, an estimated 5.6%--or about 7,840
students--dropped out, down from an estimated 7.4% in 1998-99.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the most significant strides were made at Fillmore and
Santa Paula high schools, which consistently score among the lowest
on standardized tests.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Paula, the dropout rate decreased from 2.9% in 1999-2000
to 1.3% last school year. Educators attribute the change to a Gateway
Community School program that began in the small farm town about 15
months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Gateway programs, which exist in several communities from
Ventura to Moorpark, aim to recapture students who fall behind or are
expelled from comprehensive and continuation high schools. Santa
Paula's campus is serving 98 students this year in classroom and
independent study programs--teenagers who might otherwise be on the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids who have never been successful in school are seeing success
here," Santa Paula teacher Judy Dobbins said.</TE>
<TE>   At Fillmore High School, administrators and teachers have
implemented programs to prepare students for the new statewide exit
exam and a new district rule that requires a 2.0 GPA for graduation.</TE>
<TE>   Principal John Wilber said those efforts likely contributed to the
school's dropout rate decreasing from 4.4% to 1.4% over one school
year.In the Conejo Valley and Oak Park school districts, the county's
highest performing high school systems, dropout rates .increased in
2000-01 over the previous school year.</TE>
<TE>   But Mike Vollmert, testing coordinator for Conejo Valley Unified
School District, said figures reported to the state from Thousand
Oaks High School from 2001 were inaccurate because the staff person
in charge left midyear.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, any rise in the number of students dropping out is
a concern, which is why Conejo offers many programs designed for
at-risk teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "Educators need to do everything we possibly can to find a program
that works for every single kid," Vollmert said. "Anybody who says a
comprehensive high school is perfect for every kid is naive or in
serious denial."</TE>
<TE>   Some public education critics say the state's four-year dropout
estimates represent only a fraction of the true population of
dropouts.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report by San Francisco-based California Parents for
Educational Choice, which lobbies for charter schools and school
vouchers, says that more than one-third of California high school
students leave school before graduation. The rate in Ventura County,
according to the report, is 29.6%.</TE>
<TE>   State and county officials disputed those numbers, saying the
report assumes that students are dropping out when they may have
moved out of the state's public school system or into alternative
programs.</TE>

<HD>Field Workers Finally Win Fight With Dump</HD>
<DH>Environment: Shipments of radioactive waste to halt.
Operator says facility poses no threat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUTTONWILLOW, Calif.</DL>
<LD>When the dust blows hard across the brown flatlands around here,
people cover their eyes and wonder what foul things are in it.</LD>
<LD>   For a decade, the farm laborers who live in this eye-blink of a
town west of Bakersfield have fought a losing battle against a nearby
hazardous waste dump.</LD>
<LD>   It isn't right, they argued, to put poisons in the ground just a
few miles from houses. Especially trainloads of radioactive debris
from atom bomb factories. Especially when the dump sits on an aquifer
and is less than a mile from the California Aqueduct, which sends
Southern California most of its water.</LD>
<TE>   If they weren't poor and Latino, they suspect, the big corporation
that owns the dump wouldn't get away with it.</TE>
<TE>   Kern County bureaucrats repeatedly said there was no danger, even
after the operator--Safety-Kleen Corp.--filed for bankruptcy
protection, falling $1.6 billion into debt. The dump is safely lined,
they said. Buttonwillow was chosen because it was once remote, not
because the neighbors were poor or Latino.</TE>
<TE>   But Buttonwillow's field workers, many of them first-generation
immigrants, carried on their fight. So much time passed that people
measured their lives against the war on the dump.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Beltran, 49, says his daughter Griselda was 8 when he
took her to her first protest. She's 18 now, a grown woman studying
to be an engineer.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, a resolution surprisingly appeared, largely because both
sides say they are exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   Safety-Kleen announced that it wouldn't take any more radioactive
waste, even if it legally could.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to return to doing business and not spend any more
resources arguing," said Robert Hoffman, a Sacramento representative
for the Columbia, S.C., company.</TE>
<TE>   But the waste already buried at Buttonwillow--all of it dangerous
if not handled correctly--will stay.</TE>
<TE>   In the main, the Buttonwillow dump's business has been disposing
of waste from the large oil drilling operations in western Kern
County. In fact, the company is the largest recipient of waste oil in
America, operating 400 facilities in 47 states.</TE>
<TE>   It also operates two of the state's three Class One hazardous
waste landfills, which accept the most serious chemical waste allowed
to be disposed of in California. The other is in Westmoreland,
another small San Joaquin Valley town. The third dump, in Kettleman
City just up Interstate 5, is run by Waste Management Inc.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the Buttonwillow landfill operated in relative
anonymity. Then in 1991, the facility requested permission to expand
and take more than oil waste. It might have been a simple procedural
matter had the poor of Buttonwillow, aided by a determined
environmental activist, not reacted.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran said he heard at his daughter's school about plans to
expand the dump. Beltran had worked for years in the cotton fields
that turn the limitless landscape white in late summer and had
proudly made Buttonwillow his home. To him, it was a wonderful,
peaceful place, despite, or maybe because of, its high
nothing-going-on quotient.</TE>
<TE>   Then Luke Cole came to town. An attorney with the Center on Race,
Poverty and the Environment, Cole is an idealistic, rangy man with
boyish features that make him look more like a Scout leader than the
trouble-stirring outsider his opponents see.</TE>
<TE>   He helped organize the worried people of Buttonwillow, and offered
his advice and expertise on how to petition the local government for
redress. To Cole, it was a matter of simple justice.</TE>
<TE>   Big corporations are used to running over the powerless, he says,
especially when they live in places whose only apparent virtues are
serving as burger and taco stops on the road to somewhere else.</TE>
<TE>   Cole, who included a chapter on Buttonwillow in his book on
environmental racism, believed it was no coincidence that all three
Class One hazardous waste dumps in California were near small towns
that just happen to have minority majorities.</TE>
<TE>   "Kettleman City is 95% Latino," Cole said. "Buttonwillow is 55%
Latino and 10% black. Westmoreland is 85% Latino. Just by
coincidence, 100% of the toxic waste disposed of in California is in
farm-worker communities."</TE>
<TE>   Cole was talking at the kitchen table in Francisco Beltran's tidy
rented bungalow on a dirt lot near the edge of town. Sitting
alongside him were Beltran and another longtime soldier in the dump
war, Eduardo Montoya.</TE>
<TE>   Cole is widely known and feared by those who defend the
Safety-Kleen dump. But the thing that really gets them worked up is
their conviction that he has misled and exploited the very people he
supposedly cares about.</TE>
<TE>   "This is pure politics on Luke's part," said John Kyte, a
Washington, D.C., attorney for Safety-Kleen. "He's wrong on the
science, the law and the facts. It's deliberate fear-mongering."</TE>
<TE>   Beltran disagrees, saying the people of Buttonwillow made up their
own minds. "The more we learned, the more we worried," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After Cole's arrival came meetings, speeches and marches through
town. The tiny town boiled with activity. "We used to go door-to-door
talking to people," Beltran said.</TE>
<TE>   They lost the first big battle in 1994, when the Kern County Board
of Supervisors approved the dump's expansion. The folks in
Buttonwillow appealed under something called the Tanner Act, kicking
off hearings that are still going on today. More controversy arrived
years later, when it was discovered that the Buttonwillow dump
accepted 2,200 tons of radioactive waste from Tonawanda, N.Y., one of
the nation's first atomic bomb factories.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Buttonwillow was not licensed as a radioactive-waste
dump, it was able to accept the bomb factory material because of a
technicality that had nothing to do with any danger the waste might
pose.</TE>
<TE>   Because the waste was produced before 1978, when the federal
government gave authority over radioactive materials to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, it was left for the Energy Department to
oversee. And the Energy Department decided Buttonwillow was safe.</TE>
<TE>   After years of fruitless struggle, a kind of despondency crept
over dump opponents. Beltran's once formidable army of protesters has
dwindled to five families who spend each Mother's Day together at a
picnic.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody else lost interest; they felt there was no way we could
win," said Montoya, 46.</TE>
<TE>   Some moved away to escape the perceived threat to the west.</TE>
<TE>   Beltran didn't quit. He got mad. "When I came to this country, I
was 18," he said. "I always heard about how the U.S. [protected the
little guy]."</TE>
<TE>   Cole also was upset by what he perceived as the brushoff being
given to the townspeople. "I've been appearing on this issue for 10
years," he said. "At every stage of the game the people from
Buttonwillow have been locked out."</TE>
<TE>   But Cole hadn't given up. He even came up with a new line of
attack, charging that the company's bankruptcy over accounting
irregularities posed a new threat. Kyte, of Safety-Kleen, strongly
denied that filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 would cause
dump operators to skimp on safety. The company has obtained new
financing and will be in the black soon, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes a great sound bite," he said. "'Do you want a toxic
waste company in bankruptcy?' But that is fear-mongering. That's a
disservice."</TE>
<TE>   The dump poses no threat to anyone's health, he argued. It's even
a gross exaggeration to label as "low-level" the radioactive waste
shipments it received.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have taken is soil and building debris that contains
very, very low concentrations of radionuclides," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Safety-Kleen officials announced two weeks ago that
they are not interested in taking any more radiation waste.</TE>
<TE>   The company even signed on as a sponsor of legislation (SB 1623)
by state Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles) banning even the most
inconsequential radiation waste from landfills such as Buttonwillow.
That announcement came just after a Superior Court judge in
Sacramento ruled that radioactive waste should go only into landfills
designed for it.</TE>
<TE>   For both sides, it is something of a deal with the devil. For
Safety-Kleen, the advantage is that Romero's bill exempts from
regulation naturally occurring radiation.</TE>
<TE>   That would include wastes from oil and gas exploration, the bulk
of Safety-Kleen's business, even though those materials can be as
radioactive as bricks from an old nuclear facility.</TE>

<LD>A Stanton man who depended on a wheelchair died early Saturday when
flames swept through the rear of his single-story home, filling the
house with smoke, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Firefighters pulled Raymond Dubois, 65, from the home shortly
after midnight, but he was pronounced dead at 12:46 a.m. at Anaheim
General Hospital, said Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Stephen
Miller.</LD>
<LD>   About 20 firefighters took 15 minutes to extinguish the fire,
which caused an estimated $175,000 damage to the home in the 10200
block of Garrett Road.</LD>
<TE>   "It was extremely hot and smoky inside," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said investigators believe a short circuit sparked the
blaze. A preliminary investigation also found that the home had no
smoke detectors.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors recalled Dubois as a friendly father of four adult
children--a daughter and three sons--one of whom lived with Dubois
but was not home at the time of the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Evans, 63, said Dubois was popular in the community. About
three years ago, she said, Dubois suffered a stroke that left him
unable to walk and made it difficult for him to talk.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very nice neighbor," she said.</TE>

<LD>For ever cursed be this detested day,</LD>
<LD>   Which snatched my best, my fav'rite curl away!</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Belinda, the heroine who spoke these words in Alexander Pope's
"Rape of the Lock," threw a hissy fit after a scissors-wielding
suitor sneaked up behind her and stole a lock of her hair.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen girls at Los Angeles High School had entirely different
feelings when they had their ponytails cut off. They did it for
charity.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Nancy Garcia grew her shiny black hair down to her waist
only to give it away, after seeing a television talk show that
featured hair donors and sick children who received wigs.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Gomez, a ninth-grader, remembered visiting a children's
hospital recently and seeing young leukemia patients who had lost
their hair because of chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent lunch break on campus, Garcia and Gomez and the
other volunteers stepped up to the clear plastic tarp spread over a
basketball court, where two Supercuts stylists awaited with scissors
and Ziploc bags. Behind a band of yellow tape, hundreds of students
gawked or cheered them on.</TE>
<TE>   The hair drive was the brainchild of a leadership class on campus.
After getting the idea from advisor Rosanne Altin, a group of
students spent weeks researching a Florida-based nonprofit called
Locks of Love--www.locks oflove.org--that links hair donors to
children with medical hair loss.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, several girls who signed up backed out at the last
moment. But one ninth-grader, swept up in the excitement, got a
last-minute OK to participate by calling her mother on a cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   "We were only expecting, like, five or six [volunteers]," said
senior Rhadora Rabara, one of the organizers. "We were really
surprised."</TE>
<TE>   When her turn came, 10th-grader Elba Cortez pressed her fingers
hard against her eyes to stop the tears.</TE>
<TE>   A KIIS-FM deejay who was invited to the event took one look at
Elba's wispy black hair--it reached down to her knees--and shouted
into a microphone: "Let's show her some support! She's giving away
her entire life!" The students cheered.</TE>
<TE>   Stylist Vickie Vargas tied Elba's hair into a ponytail just above
the shoulder. A band member started a drumroll. And then, snip, snip,
snip, and the stylist waved a 35-inch-long handful of hair in the
air. The students cheered some more.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel kind of sad because I've had my hair so long," Elba said
afterward, her eyes still moist. "I've never cut it. I never dyed it.
I never put anything in my hair." Her older brother, Saul, a senior,
hugged her. Elba said her mom had been against the idea, but relented
when she saw her daughter was determined.</TE>
<TE>   Her friend Anna Angeles, a 10th-grader with waist-length hair
since she was a little girl, worried about what her father would say
when she got home.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad always wanted me to have long hair," Anna said. "He said a
woman with long hair is beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Altin, the advisor, said the school was galvanized by the hair
drive in a way she had never seen. Girls with long hair said their
schoolmates were constantly "bugging them" to participate.</TE>
<TE>   The ponytails, sealed in plastic storage bags, will be shipped off
to Lake Worth, Fla., this week. Jennifer Cox, executive director of
Locks of Love, said the organization gets between 1,500 and 1,800
ponytails of various lengths, textures and colors each week. It has
received hair from donors across the country, as well as Japan,
Australia, Belgium, France and England. About 10 ponytails, which
yield roughly 140,000 usable hairs, go into a single wig.</TE>
<TE>   About half of the ponytails received turn out to be unusable,
either because they are chemically damaged, unbound or too short.
Those either get discarded or sold to help support the 5-year-old
organization, which has a staff of four and a dozen volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Recipients, all of them children from low-income households, have
lost their hair because of different ailments. Three percent are
cancer patients. Others are burn victims or compulsively yank out
their own hair. Many suffer from an autoimmune skin disease called
alopecia areata, which prevents hair growth.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Fields, 18, who has received two wigs from Locks of Love,
said she admires the donors. She remembers watching a biker with hair
"down to his butt" give up his hair for charity. "It's something that
takes courage," said Fields, who lives in Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   When Shannon's hair fell out from alopecia at age 15, her mother
could only afford cheap wigs, which became the target of teasing
schoolmates. "I wouldn't go out of the house even to get the mail,"
she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   The hairpieces Locks of Love provides have a silicone scalp that
seals airtight over a person's head, said Greg Taylor, president of
Millbrae, Calif.-based Taylormade Hair Replacement, which makes wigs
for the organization. "You could literally pick the person up by the
hair of their head, and the product would not come off," Taylor said
with confidence, although he has never tried it.</TE>
<TE>   And the donors at Los Angeles High?</TE>
<TE>   The bell signaling the end of the lunch period rang, sending
students scurrying back to class. The girls with butchered hair
stayed behind, waiting their turn to get a decent-looking trim.</TE>

<HD>Making Education a Priority Just a Good Sound Bite for
Politicians</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Perched atop Mike Lansing's desk at the Boys &amp; Girls Club of San
Pedro is a wooden carving that says, "No Excuses," a challenge to
himself more than to the kids.</LD>
<LD>   The club's executive director brings this attitude to his other
job too, where the fate of 736,000 children is in his hands, and
where, last week, Lansing did something that pained him greatly.</LD>
<LD>   Lansing and his mates on the Los Angeles school board whacked
$384.6 million out of the budget, knowing it will hurt children.</LD>
<TE>   The last thing Lansing wanted to do was cast a vote to stuff even
more kids into overcrowded classes, taking the number to 40 in some
cases. But he did.</TE>
<TE>   "Some board members didn't want to face reality. But if the house
is burning, you can either pull out a hose or you can run around
saying there's no fire," Lansing said.</TE>
<TE>   How many times have you read the story of the great morass? The
last two cities I lived in--New York and Philadelphia--were no better
off. The schools made occasional strides that were soon swamped by
waves of new challenges.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a greater collective failure in American society than
the state of public education, it has not been brought to my
attention.</TE>
<TE>   The economy, the quality of life, flight from cities, segregation,
the crime rate in your neighborhood--all these things are tied to the
quality of public education in the richest country on Earth. And yet
despite the stakes, we can't get it right. Can't even get close.</TE>
<TE>   I went to see Lansing, a solid, quiet sort of guy who doesn't look
for headlines, to see if he could explain why.</TE>
<TE>   I already knew some of the answers. I knew, for instance, that
school boards often attract a mutant strain of public official less
interested in serving children than in launching or preserving a
political career.</TE>
<TE>   Tune into an L.A. board meeting on public television and in two
blinks, you'll realize two or three of the seven board members are
the kind of clowns who are there to dole out contracts to political
hucksters, and who don't go to the bathroom before checking in with
union bosses or other hacks.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the larger problem, which Lansing sums up with a
well-aimed question.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are we even having to deal with cuts, given that every
politician lists public education as a No.1 priority?"</TE>
<TE>   Bull's eye on that one. Gray Davis promises he's the education
governor. George Bush vows that no child will be left behind. One
politician after another, for decades, has checked the polls and
promptly reduced the challenge of education to a neat little sound
bite, only to run for the hills when it comes time to pay up.</TE>
<TE>   Not that money is the answer, says Lansing, who, for the record,
thinks L.A. city schools have done reasonably well given the
challenges. But he opens his wallet and takes out a newspaper
clipping that says California flunks out in a national ranking of
spending per pupil, coming in third from the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   How this can happen in the richest state and the world's
fifth-largest economy, one steeped in technology and dependent on an
educated work force, is beyond Lansing. But to blame failure on
government or politicians would be to make excuses, violating
Lansing's sacred principle.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of society, with its something-for-nothing, Proposition
13 mentality, is just as guilty, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "The responsibility for public education is something everyone has
to take on, because it's the only chance for children of need and
color to get an equal opportunity. Yes, we've got to do a better job
as a district and a board, and teachers have to do a better job. We
can't just say there's not enough money and throw our hands up.</TE>
<TE>   "But there's more to teaching children than what happens from 8
a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm talking about the Boys and Girls clubs and other
groups that extend the learning day for children. This generation
isn't making sacrifices for its children. We're all getting fat and
sassy, and while individual wealth has risen greatly, people are less
involved in community issues and events."</TE>
<TE>   If you're a parent, Lansing suggests you do something other than
slap lunch money on the table or ask the kiddies how school was
today. "If more parents were involved in meaningful ways, public
education would be transformed overnight," Lansing says.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you're not a parent, vote for the bond issue this November
to finance new schools. Better yet, become a tutor, teach a kid to
read, put in some time on career day.</TE>
<TE>   No excuses.</TE>

<HD>Veteran Marine Base May Get Boot</HD>
<DH>Military: Plagued by noise and tight quarters, San Diego
depot may be moved. Civic die-hards gird for political combat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>For nearly 80 years, young men have been coming here to see if they
are tough enough and disciplined enough to become U.S. Marines.</LD>
<LD>   When the first would-be warrior arrived in 1923, San Diego was
barely a village and the Marines' West Coast boot camp sat on
reclaimed marshland safely on the outskirts of town.</LD>
<LD>   Now this is the sixth or seventh largest city in the country and
the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego is caught in an urban
squeeze unlike any other training facility in the U.S. military.</LD>
<TE>   This week a group of Marine Corps officers will arrive from
headquarters to study whether the time has come to shift the boot
camp to a less cramped locale--possibly to the former El Toro base in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   But many plan to fight any attempt to move the Marines out of
town, where they are viewed as delivering both a psychological and
economic boost.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there are challenges for the old base that can't be ignored.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, noise from adjacent Lindbergh Field is so loud it
can accomplish the near impossible: silencing the booming voices of
Marine Corps drill instructors.</TE>
<TE>   "Boot camp is meant to be a communicative experience," said
Commandant Gen. James Jones, who has ordered the study. More
important, the depot is too small to accommodate weapons training and
a grueling 54-hour field maneuver called "The Crucible." For those
activities, recruits must spend four of their 13 weeks of training at
Camp Pendleton, 35 miles north.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the Marine Corps' other boot camp, at Parris
Island, S.C., is entirely self-contained and there is no distracting
noise, save the squeaking of the island's infamous sand fleas.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone at the San Diego base is convinced its drawbacks
are serious.</TE>
<TE>   Gunnery Sgt. David Palm said the periodic pauses caused by jets
roaring overhead allow the drill instructors to catch their breath
before resuming their high-volume instruction.</TE>
<TE>   And while trucking recruits to and from Camp Pendleton chews up
some time, it is not seen as a detriment to turning out squared-away
Marines ready for advanced combat training.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't see it as a huge disadvantage making the trip to
Camp Pendleton," said Col. Thomas W. Spencer, the depot's chief of
staff. "We feel the Marines trained here are every bit as good as
those turned out at Parris Island or if they were trained at El Toro
or somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   The civic attachment to the recruit depot is financial and
emotional.</TE>
<TE>   The depot pumps $200 million into the local economy, including $20
million from 90,000 parents and family members who come to San Diego
to attend graduation ceremonies each year, according to a number of
economic studies.</TE>
<TE>   A business park or biotechnology campus might be just as
financially beneficial, but many locals doubt that other uses for the
property would provide the same boost to San Diego's civic psyche.</TE>
<TE>   "The Marines are part of San Diego's identity," said politically
connected lawyer Louis Wolfsheimer. "Letting them move makes no
sense."</TE>
<TE>   Civic die-hards are girding for political combat if needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I will not let [the boot camp] go without a fight," said
Councilman Byron Wear, who represents the area.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Randall "Duke" Cunningham (R-Escondido) has suggested that
moving the depot to El Toro would allow for a necessary expansion of
Lindbergh Field.</TE>
<TE>   But Reps. Susan Davis (D-San Diego) and Duncan Hunter (R-El Cajon)
want the depot to stay put. And Hunter is a prime contender to be the
next chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "We appreciate Orange County's offer to take [the recruit depot]
off our hands," Hunter said archly, "but the answer is 'no.'"</TE>
<TE>   On 388 acres, the depot has 148 buildings, most in the red-tile
roof and canyon gold color of the Spanish Colonial Revival movement.</TE>
<TE>   Training continues apace, oblivious to the San Diego-El Toro
debate. More than 21,000 young men from west of the Mississippi
River--average age 19--come here each year for the longest and
toughest basic training of any U.S. military service. Eleven percent
wash out.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an extended 13-week job interview, to see if they have
what it takes to be a Marine," said Lt. Patrick Savage.</TE>
<TE>   Days begin with reveille at 5:30 a.m. and end with lights-out at
9:30 p.m., with only an hour free time squeezed in between physical
training, marching, instruction on Marine history and myriad other
tasks and tests.</TE>
<TE>   The key to basic training is repetition and more repetition and
no-nonsense remediation--until a recruit has mastered a skill.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them have never had any intensity," said Lt. Scott
Kelly. "We try to find something inside them that will respond to
intensity."</TE>
<TE>   The Marines' presence is woven deeply into the surrounding
community.</TE>
<TE>   The base museum is a major tourist attraction and Marines are
involved in numerous charities and public events in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   The Marines often invite groups to watch training--like the
recently added 28 hours of martial arts instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the era of laser-guided weapons launched at 15,000 feet,
recruits are taught that a swift knee into the groin of an enemy can
be handy.</TE>
<TE>   "Max aggression, max aggression, Charlie Company!" a drill
instructor bellows as recruits repeat and repeat again the martial
arts drills. "Max aggression! Kill!"</TE>
<TE>   Many recruits arrive with few, if any, swimming skills. Before
they leave, they will have learned how to swim a 50-meter pool in
full combat gear, including rifle and helmet.</TE>
<TE>   "Tighten-it-up-tighten-it-up!" a swimming instructor yells at a
line of sopping-wet recruits emerging from the pool.</TE>
<TE>   Tired, drenched, and a little dazed, the recruits nevertheless
respond crisply: "Yes sir!"</TE>
<TE>   It's a response heard often here.</TE>

<DH>Ceremony: Fellow USC alumnus spends years making the case
for awarding the Medal of Honor to a Southland officer he never met.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>No member of Ben Salomon's family was in the White House Rose Garden
last week when he became the first Army dentist to receive the Medal
of Honor, awarded posthumously.</LD>
<LD>   Salomon was an only child who died in a lonely, courageous last
stand on the island of Saipan in 1944, and his remains lie next to
his parents' in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.</LD>
<LD>   But as President Bush said during the award ceremony Wednesday,
Capt. Salomon was represented by a "true friend, Dr. Robert West."</LD>
<TE>   It was largely through the efforts of West, a 75-year-old dentist
from Calabasas, that Salomon's heroism as a soldier-dentist during
World War II was finally recognized.</TE>
<TE>   West never met Salomon, but proudly accepted the medal from
President Bush on his behalf.</TE>
<TE>   A 29-year-old Angeleno who graduated from the USC dental school in
1937, Salomon was acting as a surgeon with the 27th Infantry Division
in the South Pacific's Marianas Islands on July 7, 1944, when his
battalion was attacked by thousands of Japanese soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "The advancing enemy soon descended on Capt. Salomon's aid
station," Bush recounted. "To defend the wounded men in his care, he
ordered comrades to evacuate the tent and carry away the wounded. He
went out to face the enemy alone, and was last heard shouting, 'I'll
hold them off until you get them to safety. See you later.'"</TE>
<TE>   "In the moments that followed, Salomon single-handedly killed 98
enemy soldiers, saving many American lives but sacrificing his own.
As best the Army could tell, he was shot 24 times before he fell,
more than 50 times after that. And when they found his body, he was
still at his [machine] gun.</TE>
<TE>   "No one who knew him is with us this afternoon. Yet America will
always know Benjamin Lewis Salomon by the [Medal of Honor] citation
to be read shortly. It tells of one young man who was the match for
100, a person of true valor who now receives the honor due him from a
grateful country."</TE>
<TE>   "I think Ben Salomon is smiling down on us today," West told the
president at a meeting in the Oval Office.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon was originally denied the Medal of Honor, the highest
award for military bravery in the United States, because his
commanding general believed, incorrectly, that he was ineligible.</TE>
<TE>   The general agreed that Salomon deserved the honor but thought the
Geneva Convention barred medical officers from bearing arms against
the enemy under any circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   West, who graduated from USC dental school in 1952, discovered
Salomon's story in 1997 when he and other alumni were working on the
"Tommy Trojan Goes to War" chapter of a book for the dental school's
100th anniversary. After West, who served in the Navy during World
War II, started writing to Army brass and others, urging that Salomon
be given the medal, he learned that Salomon was eligible.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Geneva Convention, medical personnel could not
take up arms for offensive purposes. But they could fight in
self-defense or to defend others, as Salomon had done, West said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just possessed when I found out it was an error, an
innocent error, on the part of the commanding general," West
recalled. With the help of Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Woodland Hills), West
pleaded Salomon's case with military officials.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a labor of love," West said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been working toward his recognition for years and years,"
said Maj. Gen. Patrick D. Sculley, chief of the U.S. Army Dental
Corps. "We were very close in the late 1960s. For whatever reason, it
didn't get approved at that time. We in the Army Dental Corps have
always had two professions--being a soldier and being a dentist, and
Ben Salomon epitomized that."</TE>
<TE>   Harold Slavkin, dean of the USC School of Dentistry, was a new
faculty member in 1968 when he learned about Salomon from then-Dean
John Ingle.</TE>
<TE>   Slavkin said he was moved by how long, hard and selflessly Ingle,
West and fellow USC alumni William Ridgeway and William Dahlberg had
fought for Salomon's recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a kind of moral imperative," Slavkin said. "They were
compelled to do it because they wanted the right thing to be done."</TE>
<TE>   The people who were closest to Salomon are all gone. His yearbook
photo captures a young man with a shy smile, dark, curly hair and
wire-rimmed glasses. His admittance into dental school was itself a
triumph at a time when American universities limited the number of
Jews they accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Slavkin had dinner with several elderly alumni who had known
Salomon as a young man, in hopes of learning more about him. He was
tall, single and good-looking, they told Slavkin, and he had several
aspiring movie stars as patients in the Beverly Hills dental practice
he started before entering the Army.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh out of USC in 1937, Salomon tried unsuccessfully to enlist
as a dentist in both the American and Canadian armies. In 1940, he
was drafted as a private in the infantry.</TE>
<TE>   Even when Salomon was an infantryman, he would give dental
checkups to his Army buddies, sometimes scaling their teeth as they
lay on their bunks. A former Eagle Scout, Salomon was also a fine
all-around soldier--an excellent marksman and first-rate
machine-gunner.</TE>
<TE>   Finally commissioned in 1942, Salomon became a regimental dentist.
He was acting as a surgeon when he died because he had volunteered to
replace the aid station's wounded surgeon.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Army Dental Corps' official history, published in
2000, more than 18,000 Army dentists served during World War II.
Salomon was one of only 20 to die in battle.</TE>
<TE>   Sculley said he had a visceral sense of the sacrifice Salomon had
made as he stood next to 91-year-old Robert B. Shira, a former chief
of the Army Dental Corps, during the Medal of Honor ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   A contemporary of Salomon's who fought to win recognition for the
heroic dentist in the 1960s, Shira has had a long and distinguished
career in the military, academia and public service. He also has
children and grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "All the things that Dr. Shira accomplished were done in the years
Ben Salomon never had," Sculley said.</TE>

<HD>Immigrant Activist Wants Fraud Unit</HD>
<DH>Crime: Task force sought to apprehend phony INS agents who
bilk people who 'wanted hope.'</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a mother-daughter team pleaded guilty recently to posing as
immigration agents and defrauding more than 100 families, a Latino
activist is calling on the Orange County district attorney to form a
task force for just such cases.</LD>
<LD>   "This is nickel-and-dime stuff but it's repeated enough to warrant
the district attorney's constant review," said Nativo Lopez,
co-director of Hermandad Mexicana Nacional.</LD>
<LD>   Rosalva Jurado, 52, and her daughter, Norma Lillian Perez, 31,
both of Fontana, pleaded guilty Monday to fraud, theft by false
pretenses and conspiracy.</LD>
<TE>   The two posed as Immigration and Naturalization Service agents at
a Stanton trailer park, where they promised residents they would get
them residency cards by giving them special treatment in the federal
agency's daunting bureaucracy. They collected $105,000 from their
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "We just wanted hope and sometimes you pay anything for hope,"
said Maria Martinez, who came to the United States from Mexico, and
is a 34-year-old mother of three children. She gave Jurado $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez and others said immigration fraud is rampant because
victims, mostly undocumented workers, are afraid to come forward and
report it.</TE>
<TE>   Without a specialized unit that works with nonprofit
community-based organizations, the district attorney's office will be
unable to penetrate the problem, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said Orange County should copy the efforts of Los Angeles
County, which established such a task force five years ago. The force
has completed four arrest campaigns against immigration consultants
who operate without required bonds. The sweeps led to charges of 55
misdemeanors and felonies.</TE>
<TE>   Tori Richards, spokeswoman for the Orange County district
attorney's office, said the department might be facing budget cuts
that would make it difficult to dedicate resources to specialized
prosecution. However, she said, the district attorney is addressing
complaints in the Stanton case and completed investigative work often
done by police.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, immigrants can attend meetings of a Hispanic
commission formed by the district attorney's office to address
immigration fraud, Richards said.</TE>
<TE>   The Stanton case was brought to the attention of the district
attorney by Lopez at a forum during the campaign for district
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' task force has gotten mixed reviews.</TE>
<TE>   It does bring immigration fraud into the spotlight. Kathleen
Tuttle, Los Angeles County deputy district attorney, said the task
force shows, "We want to prosecute their cases. We say we don't care
about their immigration status."</TE>
<TE>   But many said the problem is bigger than the task force's domain.
The force's occasional sweeps have not rid Los Angeles of repeat
offenders, said Los Angeles immigration attorney Alan Diamante,
co-chairman of Committees Against Unauthorized Practice for two bar
associations.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many people out there defrauding other folks that it
appears [there is] more out there than the task force can do," he
said.</TE>

<LD>Three teenagers were injured--one critically--when their car smashed
into a light pole at nearly 90 mph Saturday, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Kim, 19, a passenger in the car, underwent surgery at UCI
Medical Center, where officials said Saturday evening that he
remained in critical condition.</LD>
<LD>   The car's driver and a second passenger were taken to separate
hospitals with moderate injuries, said Fullerton Police Senior
Officer Fred Bybee.</LD>
<TE>   Police said the three were in a 1994 Acura Integra that was
westbound in the 2100 block of Rosecrans Avenue when the car spun out
of control about 1:15 a.m. It struck a curb and then smashed into the
light pole, nearly splitting the car in two, police said.</TE>

<HD>More Cities Look Inward for Growth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Red-tiled and earth-toned, Camarillo is a sea of shopping centers,
parking lots and walled-off subdivisions by a busy freeway--a
prototypical Southern California suburb.</LD>
<LD>   So it's a surprise that California's busiest builder of
high-density housing in blighted urban areas is applying his
principles there.</LD>
<LD>   In that young, affluent community of 58,000 on the edge of the
Ventura County farm belt, Stephen Olson's fast-growing firm is
planning construction of 24 three-story townhouses on half an acre
downtown.</LD>
<TE>   In a mixed-use fashion increasingly popular in the state's aging
city cores, owners will work out of first-floor offices and live in
the rooms above. A Metrolink train station connecting them to Los
Angeles is a short walk away.</TE>
<TE>   Such "in-fill" development is in these days, even in semirural
Ventura County, where anti-sprawl laws are forcing cities to look
inward for growth opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   The same thing is happening in big cities and smaller suburbs from
San Francisco to San Diego. Converging trends are forcing public
officials and home builders to embrace "smart growth" principles that
place homes near jobs by making better use of abandoned, odd-shaped
or marginal lands already within city boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to clogged freeways, limits on usable land and a need
for affordable housing, city redevelopment agencies have begun
pairing with some of the state's largest suburban home builders to
construct more dwellings on less land than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're trying to do is match jobs, transportation and
housing, so we have smart living," said Olson, whose 14-year-old Seal
Beach company helped pioneer such public-private collaborations.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a correct assumption that downtown living was going to
grow, and that state mandates for affordable housing would eventually
get legs and teeth," said Olson, whose company has 71 projects and
4,500 units in the development pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires city redevelopment agencies to spend 20% of tax
revenues on affordable housing. So the agencies try to sell less
desirable land to developers at cut rates.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, in a trend that models the successes of East Coast
cities, and of San Francisco, Portland and Seattle in the West, lofts
and townhomes built on those parcels are increasingly popular. But
sometimes not so affordable.</TE>
<TE>   Often they are snapped up by young white-collar professionals
weary of freeway commutes, and 50-something baby boomers with grown
kids who are trading tract-home routines for the bustle and
sophistication of reviving downtowns in cities such as Pasadena and
Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Tight clusters of fashionable apartments and condos are also
springing up along new subway, light-rail and commuter train lines
that resurrect a portion of the Los Angeles Basin's efficient Red
Line trolley system abandoned half a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the most tattered sections of Los Angeles, a few new
projects are taking root as lower- and middle-class families search
for a home they can afford.</TE>
<TE>   "If it has warts and hair, we're there," Olson said. "We build in
areas that are challenged."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Olson Co. was among the first to fill the in-fill
niche, such smaller specialty firms now often compete with big
companies.</TE>
<TE>   They all recognize the opportunities in a new cityscape that shuns
the car and values urban living as much as suburban retreats.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion of always expanding ... beyond the urban fringe is
something that is not as viable as it once was," said Stuart Gabriel,
director of the Lusk Center for Real Estate at USC. "Housing is
coming back to the jobs. And this is occurring in part because of
very significant commute costs in time and money."</TE>
<TE>   Traditional home builders are eager to catch the crest of the new
trend, said John Stanek of Western Pacific Housing, who is also a top
officer with the Building Industry Assn. in the Los Angeles region.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all trying to find properties where we can work with local
redevelopment agencies," Stanek said. "It's something everybody is
fighting to do."</TE>
<TE>   Stanek's company is cutting deals with Westminster and Buena Park
in Orange County and hustling a piece of Redondo Beach's large new
Heart of the City project on 17 acres near the marina.</TE>
<TE>   "As a developer who commutes regularly in Los Angeles and Ventura
counties, I know it's vital that we provide more housing closer to
the job centers," Stanek said. "And I believe we'll see people moving
back to the city, just as it happened on the East Coast. Some people
will have two homes--a condo or apartment in the city and home in the
suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   "Olson was the first to focus on this," Stanek said, "but the rest
of us are playing catch-up."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach is the beneficiary.</TE>
<TE>   When that port city requested bids from developers to build 300
townhomes on The Promenade in its rejuvenated downtown last year,
four large suburban builders responded along with the Olson Co.</TE>
<TE>   Olson, Lyon Realty and Greystone got the contracts, said Barbara
Kaiser, redevelopment bureau manager. They will build three- and
four-level homes, some with shops below, that will probably sell for
between $200,000 and $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   They are at the end of the Blue Line light rail system to Los
Angeles, which recently added a third car to handle an overflow of
riders during rush hours.</TE>
<TE>   "We have about 3,000 units on the drawing board," said Kaiser of
Long Beach, which was in deep economic doldrums before recovering
last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those new units will be in oceanfront towers. The tougher
sells are inland 10 or 20 blocks, where the Olson Co. recently built
40 single-family homes and a day-care center in a project honored as
the best of its kind for 2002 by the California Redevelopment Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Those Craftsman-style homes, in one of the city's most blighted
areas, sold out in six months for $170,000 to $200,000. Built on
small lots, they have front porches, river rock on the facades and
separate garages.</TE>
<TE>   Many recent in-fill efforts are marked by stylish designs intended
to dress up aging communities with artists' lofts, mixed-use
storefronts and small-lot houses linked to downtown businesses.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Ana, where severe crowding stopped approval of
high-density development in 1987, the city broke ground last week on
an Olson project composed of 86 artists' lofts on three acres in
three designs in the downtown Artists Village.</TE>
<TE>   "They were the only ones who came to us when we were looking for
someone to build these lofts," said Larry Yenglin, redevelopment
project manager. "They were excited about our idea to do them in
different designs. They hired good architects, too. They're looking
at these as models so they can expand this type of opportunity in
other cities."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Olson, a 60-year-old Long Beach resident, has been in the
forefront of in-fill models since the former Dean Witter &amp; Co.
manager founded his company in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   His 110-employee firm is active in two dozen cities. It completed
520 dwellings worth $187 million last year, expects to sell as many
homes this year and will start more than 1,000 units next year, Olson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite increased competition, Olson says his company can continue
to grow and prosper by staying with its in-fill specialties.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where the future is in California," he said. "I think we
can have a sustainable business of $500 million annually in this
state indefinitely."</TE>
<TE>   There is plenty of room for competition.</TE>
<TE>   State studies have found that California's housing shortage
becomes more critical every year as new construction falls at least
75,000 dwellings short of demand from population growth.</TE>
<TE>   And Olson notes that another 35,000 dwellings become so
deteriorated each year they are virtually uninhabitable.</TE>
<TE>   City redevelopment officials say they are looking for housing help
wherever they can find it.</TE>
<TE>   So far, much of the work has occurred in the center of cities that
haven't fallen very far, or are on the rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Among Olson's projects, for example, are 232 units in bustling
downtown San Diego, 110 condos next to Burbank City Hall, 48
townhomes in the Playhouse District of Pasadena, 277 homes on the
Gilbert Street revival in Fullerton and large projects at commuter
train stations in Richmond and Hayward in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Georgino, community development director in Burbank, worked
with Olson while she was redevelopment chief in Brea, when that city
was reconstructing its downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Olson built dozens of homes linked by a walkway with Brea's
community center.</TE>
<TE>   "I've worked with them over the last six years," Georgino said.
"And I've always been impressed by how open they are to agency
suggestions and community desires. They actually become part of the
community."</TE>
<TE>   The same development forces that are pulling residents back to
attractive old downtowns are at work in Los Angeles, albeit at a
slower pace.</TE>
<TE>   Don Spivack, deputy administrator of the Los Angeles redevelopment
agency, said the nation's second-largest city had foundered with
downtown renewal but is beginning to gain momentum, thanks partly to
the region's new rail system.</TE>
<TE>   About 3,400 dwellings are completed, under construction or planned
near subway stations in the downtown, Hollywood and North Hollywood,
he said. And more are on the drawing board along light-rail lines to
Long Beach and Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "People are becoming more and more disenchanted with long
commutes, and more people work at home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's leading to an interesting phenomenon in Los Angeles with
the conversion of long-vacant office buildings into loft-style
housing."</TE>
<TE>   About 2,300 such units are completed or in the works in the
central city, and young professionals are flocking to them, he said.
Planned development near Staples Center will only speed up that
trend.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a brand new thing in Los Angeles," Spivack said. "But I
think it's going to be a lasting change."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles architect Tom Gilmore, a downtown developer who is
transforming old office buildings into hundreds of lofts, said big
developers are increasingly interested in downtown for properties.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beginning to tell the end of sprawl as we know it," Gilmore
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Olson, who has worked mostly with smaller cities, said Los
Angeles is the promise of the future, especially its rail corridors.
He is building a 100-condo piece of a planned 800-unit community near
the North Hollywood subway stop.</TE>
<TE>   "In Los Angeles, it's not as easy to go to one central authority
and get things done," he said. "But it's an underserved market. And
we're focused there now."</TE>

<HD>Logicon Will Help Undo Oracle Deal</HD>
<DH>Contracts: The firm was driving force behind the pact. Its
willingness to break the agreement may help Davis deal with political
liability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Angered by accusations that their company played a secret, conflicted
role in crafting the state's $95-million Oracle software contract,
Logicon executives said Saturday they would join efforts to rescind
the agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Logicon's offer could help ease California's exit from a deal that
state auditors have criticized as one-sided and unnecessary and that
has become a political liability for Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   With legislative hearings set to resume Monday, Davis and
executives of Oracle Corp. offered to break the deal, but such a move
requires assent from Logicon, which is a party to the contract, and
Koch Financial Services, which arranged the financing.</LD>
<TE>   "It's evident that at the current time, the state of California is
not a satisfied customer," said William S. "Steve" Carrier, vice
president of business development for Northrop Grumman Information
Technology. "And we will do whatever it takes to fix that and make
the state of California a satisfied customer, up to and including
walking away from the contract."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' Press Secretary Steven Maviglio welcomed the offer.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor said he'd be willing to do that in a New York
minute," Maviglio said. "We're pleased that all parties are on board
and are willing to look at the steps to rescinding the deal."</TE>
<TE>   In the last several weeks, furor over the contract has led to the
resignation or suspension of two department heads and Davis' chief of
e-government. It has raised questions about the timing of a $25,000
Oracle contribution to Davis, prompted the governor to send police
officers to prevent document shredding at a state office and spurred
Republicans to call for a federal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said Logicon may have violated
conflict-of-interest laws by representing both the state and Oracle
in contract negotiations. In an interview Saturday, Carrier disputed
that characterization. He called the contract a good deal for the
state and defended his company's behavior as open and ethical.</TE>
<TE>   Logicon wants foremost, he said, "to make this thing right at the
end of the day."</TE>
<TE>   A Virginia-based subsidiary of aerospace giant Northrop Grumman,
Logicon was the driving force behind the state's six-year agreement
to license Oracle software for thousands of users. Logicon approached
the state about doing business together after being hired to advise
the Department of Information Technology on large software purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Carrier said the company is also willing to rescind its side
agreements with Arizona-based Koch Financial Services.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be a lot of contracts folks and lawyers involved in
unwinding this thing," Carrier said. "But if that is the ultimate
deal the state wants, we're going to work with our partners Koch and
Oracle to make that happen."</TE>
<TE>   Oracle executives offered to repeal their portion of the contract
on Thursday. Koch refused to comment Friday on the possible
nullification, and no representative could be reached Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Maviglio said the governor's legal advisor and the Department of
Finance director have begun analyzing the legal and financial
implications of ending the contract.</TE>
<TE>   The Oracle contract was sold as a way for the state to save as
much as $111 million over 10 years on its software purchases.
However, an April report by the state auditor concludes that rather
than save money, the state stands to spend between $6 million and $41
million more on database licenses and maintenance than it would
without the Oracle agreement. The auditor found that the state signed
the deal in spite of Department of Information Technology surveys
that showed little demand for the products within the government.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the audit concluded, the state approved the agreement
without independently verifying Logicon's claims of drastic savings.</TE>
<TE>   Logicon first began talking to state officials about signing a
broad software licensing agreement in February 2001, Carrier said. Up
until a week before the contract was signed on May 31, it was
intended to be a deal between Logicon and the state, with Logicon
arranging separately with Oracle for licensing. But state officials
decided to contract directly with Oracle because they thought that
would help them better meet the state's rules for contracts that
avoid competitive bidding, Carrier said.</TE>
<TE>   In a news conference Friday, Lockyer said he is investigating
whether Logicon may have violated conflict-of-interest laws by
working for the state at the same time it was working for Oracle.</TE>
<TE>   Logicon had been hired by the Department of Information Technology
for $93,000 in June 2000 to write a "white paper" analyzing various
approaches to buying software licenses on a large scale. The company
delivered a draft analysis, but never finalized the paper because the
state showed no interest in the draft, said Neil H. O'Donnell, a San
Francisco attorney representing Logicon.</TE>
<TE>   Logicon was never paid, and that contract was formally severed in
November 2001, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Carrier said the company had no conflict of interest, even though
it had begun negotiating with the state as a business partner on a
software licensing agreement in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "The white paper in no way contributed to the state's enterprise
license agreement," he said. "We were not a consultant in this deal
whatsoever. We were a participant in a business arrangement with
Oracle and Koch, and it was all aboveboard.</TE>
<TE>   "Our internal checks and balances wouldn't allow any of this stuff
to go on," said Carrier, referring to Lockyer's description of
Logicon as "serving two masters." "I really believe that when the
attorney general gets all the facts and gets them all in front him,
he'll understand this very well."</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell said it's not clear yet what Logicon would have to give
up if the contract is rescinded. As it is, Koch has already paid
$52.7 million to Logicon, which in turn gave $36.5 million to Oracle.
Logicon kept $16 million, but paid $3 million in sales tax, O'Donnell
said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something that's going to have to be worked out among
Logicon, the state, Oracle and Koch," O'Donnell said. "My guess is
that if the state concludes that it wants to undo the whole deal,
there's going to be some money that's going to have to be given up."</TE>

<HD>Razor Blade, Nail Discoveries Haven't Emptied Playgrounds</HD>
<DH>Crime: After last week's spiking of three Orange County
parks, parents still willing to bring their kids say they find the
police sweeps reassuring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the discovery of dozens of razor blades and nails in three
Orange County playgrounds last week, parents and children took to the
parks Saturday, a little guarded, definitely shocked, but feeling for
the most part unthreatened because of a new vigilance.</LD>
<LD>   Dana Brown, 39, of Laguna Beach was throwing a birthday party for
her 3-year-old daughter, Madison, on the grounds of the city's Main
Beach, where authorities found 18 razors in the sand last Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "We talked about it, that maybe we should cancel," Brown said.
"But my husband thought that it might be safe now since people are
more aware."</LD>
<TE>   When the 20 or so toddlers arrived for the party Saturday morning,
police officers were scanning the area, Brown said. "It just feels
like they are monitoring this area closely."</TE>
<TE>   As a precaution, however, most parents made sure their toddlers
were wearing shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Police were still searching for suspects Saturday and keeping a
close eye on parks with random surveillance and sweeps.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sunday incident in Laguna Beach, more razors and 1
1/2-inch-long construction nails were found in playgrounds in Laguna
Niguel and Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, razors were found at six parks in Costa Mesa and
Newport Beach. Police never caught the perpetrator, and the incidents
stopped by late May.</TE>
<TE>   No one has been reported hurt so far, but the razors and nails
were placed strategically to cause harm, hidden in sandboxes and
lodged at the bottom of a slide in one case.</TE>
<TE>   "What are people thinking when they do that kind of stuff?" asked
Laura McArdell, who regularly takes her 2-year-old son from their
Mission Viejo home to a park in the Laguna Hills community center.</TE>
<TE>   The incidents are frightening, McArdell and other parents said
Saturday, but the threat seems incongruous in a setting of gated
communities and quiet suburban streets.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the last place you'd think something like that might
happen," said Tom Christian, 48, visiting Laguna Beach's Main Beach
with his wife, Helen, and the couple's three young children.</TE>
<TE>   "It might happen in Venice Beach," he said, "but this place is ...
it is normal here. But then again, normal is not normal anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The Christians, of Hacienda Heights, had heard about the razors
and nails in the news but hadn't been aware they were in one of the
hot spots.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my lord!" Helen Christian, 38, said. "I am so surprised. This
is such a wealthy area, so safe."</TE>
<TE>   As their children frolicked on the sand and monkey bars under the
spring sun, parents said Saturday they will be more watchful. But
they added that the razors and nails shattered their sense of safety.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't feel like it will be something that will turn into an
epidemic," McArdell said. Nonetheless, she now checks all playground
equipment before she allows her son to use it.</TE>

<LD>An administrator in the San Diego Unified School District is the top

School District, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, a team of school board members, teachers and community

administrator of San Diego Unified. Details of a contract with Santa
Paula are expected to be considered at the May 14 board meeting, said
trustee Michelle Kolbeck.</LD>
<LD>   "He fits all of our needs here," she said. "He has the vision; he
is bilingual. He has the education, the energy and the expertise
required."</LD>
<TE>   Villegas would replace former Supt. Bonnie Bruington, who retired
last fall. Kenneth Moffett, a retired superintendent from Los Angeles
County, has been filling the job on an interim basis since then.</TE>

<HD>Ventura to Consider Year-Round Homeless Shelter</HD>
<DH>Housing: Endorsement by the council would be a first step
in creating a facility that would also help get needy people back on
their feet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Ventura may come one step closer to gaining a year-round
homeless shelter this week.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council is being asked to endorse a proposal for the
shelter and a request for funding--a milestone after a three-year
effort and two earlier proposals that did not pass council muster.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the council is ready to step forward and be a partner in
the process," said Mayor Ray DiGuilio, who anticipates a favorable
vote. Project Understanding, a faith-based nonprofit agency, has
proposed a facility that would offer emergency shelter, longer-term
transitional housing, help in finding permanent housing and other
services. Project Understanding would run the shelter.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not just a shelter, but a homeless service center,"
DiGuilio said.</TE>
<TE>   "This would be intended for people who want to end their
homelessness," said Richard Pearson, executive director of Project
Understanding, which has seen two previous proposals turned down
because city officials wanted more information. The facility would
fill what has long been a void in services in Ventura County, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, if a family came to us, there would be nowhere they
could spend the night tonight," Pearson said.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson estimates there are 2,000 to 4,000 homeless men, women and
children in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, there are only a few places where homeless people can
find a bed for the night, and Project Understanding and RAIN in
Camarillo offer some transitional housing. In addition, Oxnard and
Ventura set up emergency shelters each winter.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson, however, said no place in the county offers the range of
services and housing that the new facility would offer. He hopes to
accommodate 30 to 40 people in the emergency shelter and about 50 in
the transitional housing. Once at the shelter, a person or family
would have to begin a plan to escape homelessness, with the help of a
counselor, Pearson said.</TE>
<TE>   The center also would have many of the services that Project
Understanding has long offered, such as showers, laundry service and
mail pickup.</TE>
<TE>   Even after action by the council, many obstacles would remain
before the proposal could become a reality. If the council endorses
the proposal, it would next be reviewed by the county. If the Board
of Supervisors approves it, the Ventura County Homeless and Housing
Coalition's Continuum of Care committee would forward the request to
the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's approved for funding, then we're into the first major
step," DiGuilio said. "This is a first step, but an important first
step."</TE>
<TE>   Although city staff members have recommended the council approve
the proposal, there are lingering concerns, said Nicole Doner, a
Community Development Block Grant housing planner with the city.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, the city has decided that we can approve the
proposal with conditions," Doner said.</TE>
<TE>   Chief among the city's concerns is that Project Understanding
lacks a plan for long-term funding. Also, the city would like to see
more agreements between Project Understanding and other social
service agencies that would provide more services at the shelter.</TE>
<TE>   But the city has taken the lead in beginning to resolve the last
of its concerns--location. Doner said the city next week will form a
staff committee to meet with community members. Pearson said Project
Understanding had focused on the Telephone Road area in eastern
Ventura--an area he describes as mostly industrial and commercial but
with two bus lines running through it. He does not expect the city to
set its sights so narrowly, however.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a completely open process," Pearson said. "I think their
intention is to keep all options open."</TE>

<HD>A New Plant Forges Success in an Old Craft</HD>
<DH>Revitalization: Ironworks nurtures blacksmiths while
bringing hope to the struggling Alameda industrial corridor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joel Corona received only a seventh-grade education in his home state
of Michoacan, Mexico, but in the past decade he has mastered one of
the world's oldest trades, blacksmithing.</LD>
<LD>   Manuel Rodriguez, six years younger than Corona at 31, is his
student. A onetime construction worker, Rodriguez wanted to apply
skills he picked up in past jobs to something more artistic.</LD>
<LD>   Both are among the 200 employees at Murray's Iron Works--a company
industry experts describe as one of the largest of its kind--which
opened last month in a portion of South-Central Los Angeles that has
been caught in a downward economic spiral since the 1992 riots.</LD>
<TE>   City officials say the establishment of Murray's Iron Works and
other businesses in the struggling Alameda industrial corridor is an
early step in revitalizing the area.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more significantly, Murray's Iron Works came to
South-Central to take advantage of government subsidies and the local
labor pool, leaving behind a 39,000-square-foot plant in Culver City.</TE>
<TE>   The new 205,000-square-foot plant not only occupies property that
had been a large, vacant eyesore, it also functions as an educational
incubator of sorts, offering apprenticeships to those who, like
Rodriguez, are new to the craft.</TE>
<TE>   On his first day, Rodriguez, of South Gate, learned to forge iron
into cylinders and squares to be used as decorations on chairs and
tables.</TE>
<TE>   He then heated one of the squares, about 5 inches across and as
thick as a finger, in a gas furnace until it glowed bright red. He
took it out with tongs, flattened it with a few strikes of a hammer
and dropped the square in a pile.</TE>
<TE>   While this task is pretty simple, it's a step to learning more
complicated techniques. It's much more satisfying than the
construction work he used to do, Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to get familiar with design work," said the father of
four. "A lot of people have been asking me to do stuff like this on
the side and I wanted to get to learn about it."</TE>
<TE>   Theirs isn't a business known for large-scale production
facilities. Most blacksmiths--like their counterparts, farriers, who
shoe horses--work part-time in the age-old trade or in small shops.</TE>
<TE>   The profession saw a dramatic decline for decades, until recently,
said Gordon Kirby, president of the California Blacksmith's Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The blacksmith population has increased recently because "there's
been a large demand for hand-forged works," said Kirby, who runs a
small shop in Sonoma, and is president of the 854-member association.</TE>
<TE>   Murray's Iron Works took full advantage of that demand. Since Ed
Leisner became the company's president in 1986, he and his brothers,
Gary and Steve, have grown their father's one-man shop into one of
the industry's largest. The company now has showrooms in West
Hollywood, Dallas, San Francisco, Chicago and Dania, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The company's last plant, really a cluster of buildings, was never
ideal because it was too spread out. It also was difficult to recruit
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Culver City is a "bedroom community," Leisner said. "When I put
out job ads in Culver City, no one came out." More than 20 applicants
showed up when he advertised the workshop's April 11 grand opening in
South-Central, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Murray's Iron Works purchased the new plant for $5.3 million.
Leisner expects to spend $2 million to refurbish the building.</TE>
<TE>   By setting up shop in the Alameda industrial corridor, a city
redevelopment zone, Leisner is eligible to receive state, federal and
city incentives. Murray's Iron Works gets a 35% break on its monthly
electric bill. The company also gets federal and state tax credits
over the next five years for each employee it recruits from economic
target zones, communities with a significant unskilled labor force.</TE>
<TE>   The business brings a much-needed "cycle of revenue" to
South-Central, said Jasper Williams, director of the city's
industrial and commercial development division. Murray's Iron Works
is one of a handful of major employers to embrace the area in recent
years, Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   "People talk about rebuilding after the riots," Leisner said, "but
if you don't do anything to help the community, all you're doing is
talking."</TE>
<TE>   Leisner said he's looking to hire two dozen more employees. The
only stipulation, Leisner said, is that applicants must be willing to
work with their hands. He's advertising exclusively in
Spanish-language newspapers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two main reasons we chose this location," Leisner said.
"The size of this building and the size of the local labor pool. We
felt that this area had a tremendous potential for employees."</TE>
<TE>   Murray's Iron Works employees make anywhere from $12 to $25 an
hour, depending on their experience.</TE>
<TE>   Master blacksmith Corona said he's taught more than a dozen
apprentices over the years. Many of them still forge metal alongside
him. Others have taken what they've learned and gone elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the kind of work I like," said Corona through a
translator. "It's the type of thing I thought I could make a career
out of."</TE>
<TE>   Corona, a blacksmith who's been with Murray's Iron Works for a
little more than a decade, recently moved his family into a house he
purchased in Hawthorne.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, he used a technique called heli-arcing to
weld a bronze fireplace screen. In between blasting the gold-colored
screen with a small torch, he supervised three other employees.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know anything about welding or the whole process," he
said. "Now I can do everything, from start to finish."</TE>

<HD>Boy, 15, Tries to Get His Life Back to Normal After Trip
With Teacher, 33</HD>
<DH>Reunion: 'We're just showing him a lot of love,' his mother
says after son returns home.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While a Cajon High School teacher sat in a Las Vegas jail Saturday
facing charges of kidnapping and statutory sexual seduction, the
15-year-old student that she ran off with was trying to get his life
back to normal, according to his family.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, Richard Pena went out to breakfast with his father, a
17-year-old sister and a friend. Later, several buddies visited the
house.</LD>
<LD>   His parents, Herman and Ida Pena, said they are worried about
their son, but didn't want to press him for details about his Las
Vegas trip with teacher Tanya Joan Hadden, 33.</LD>
<TE>   "We're just showing him a lot of love," Ida Pena said from her San
Bernardino home Saturday night. "We haven't pried too much yet. We
don't want to push him right now."</TE>
<TE>   Richard has been reticent since his return, spending most of his
time playing with his 7-month-old pit bull, Pinky, his parents said.
Herman Pena said he was baffled by his son's behavior last week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like Richard," he said, adding, "I'm sure he didn't
expect things to turn out this way."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, police found Richard with Hadden in a room at the
$39-a-night New Frontier Hotel &amp; Gambling Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The two ended up in Las Vegas after they were questioned by police
about reports that Hadden had bought alcohol for minors.</TE>
<TE>   Richard's parents were escorted to the California-Nevada border
late Thursday for a tearful reunion with their son.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are looking into whether the popular science teacher
had an inappropriate relationship with the student. She was arrested
by Las Vegas police and is facing arraignment. She denied that she
had broken the law by having sex with a minor.</TE>
<TE>   Richard's 23-year-old sister, Roxanne Pena, said that he always
gets attention from girls, and that she was shocked after reading an
article in The Times in which Hadden said she had shown poor judgment
by taking the boy to Las Vegas and described him as her soul mate.</TE>
<TE>   "Soul mates? She called them soul mates?" Roxanne Pena said. "I
can't imagine what she was thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Although she had not yet talked to her brother about the details
of his three-day trip with his teacher, Roxanne Pena said the family
has been overwhelmed by media attention and struggles to keep some
semblance of privacy.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly, your life is exposed," she said. "Reporters were
camping out on our lawn."</TE>
<TE>   Roxanne Pena said her family did not suspect that Richard was
involved in an inappropriate romantic relationship with his teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, she said, Hadden gave Richard rides home from school
along with other friends. Richard often sat in the back seat, so
there was no reason to be suspicious, his sister said, adding that he
had dated other girls his own age in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Herman and Ida Pena declined to talk about Hadden's prosecution,
but said they did not look forward to the attention future court
hearings would bring to their family.</TE>
<TE>   Ida Pena said she is just glad to have her son home. Every hour
that passed while he was gone seemed like a year, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said her son will likely need counseling. "I'm sure he's going
through hundreds of emotions," his mother said. "It's going to take
some time."</TE>
<TE>   The Penas have not decided when Richard will return to school.</TE>

<HD>Woman Helped Bring a Peaceful End to Mexican-American War</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stashed away under a Santa Barbara house, in a long-forgotten chest
covered with almost a century's worth of dirt and dust, a curious
woman with deep California roots unearthed a rare book. It was
California's first schoolbook, "Tablas Para los Ninos," published in
1836 and headed for the auction block this month.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 200 copies printed, only two others are known to exist. One
is archived among treasures at the Huntington Library; the other
holds a special place at UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library.</LD>
<LD>   The child who owned the 10-page arithmetic book does not stand out
in history--but his mother does. She was a broker of peace and
architect of the cease-fire agreement that effectively brought
California into Yankee hands.</LD>
<TE>   The book's discovery brings to light a true peacemaker and major
player who wrote most of the Articles of Capitulation, which ended
the Mexican-American War in California. More than a year later, the
articles served as a model for the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which
gave Texas, California and everything in between to the United
States, and which was the nation's only treaty to be written by the
losing side.</TE>
<TE>   Bernarda Ruiz de Rodriguez was on the losing side, a Californio
Mexican born in 1802. She was the daughter of a sergeant of the Santa
Barbara presidio and of an heiress to the prominent Lugo landowning
family of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In 1845, when the California she had known began to fall apart,
she was a widow with nine children.</TE>
<TE>   Californios up and down the state were so unhappy with Mexico
City's authority that they raised their own army and defeated Mexican
federales in the near-bloodless Battle of Cahuenga, which was fought
near what is now Universal Studios. The Californios had established
their autonomy, at least temporarily.</TE>
<TE>   Bernarda's four eldest sons, who supported the family by running
an informal pony express mail service between Santa Barbara and
Mexico, were eager to fight. A year later, their chance came. In
1846, the newly autonomous Californios found themselves doing battle
with Yankees wanting to take over California.</TE>
<TE>   In December of that year, as the Mexican-American War began
heating up on scattered battlefields, the Ruiz de Rodriguez brothers
joined other Santa Barbarans and moved south to Los Angeles to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Others headed for the Gaviota Pass to ambush American forces led
by Lt. Col. John C. Fremont and his band of nearly 400 freebooters,
who were coming to Los Angeles for the battle.</TE>
<TE>   On Christmas Day, Fremont was warned of the plot by a local sea
captain who guided them by another route into the undefended town of
Santa Barbara. Fremont led a fearsome force of men with heavy black
beards, blue flannel shirts, buckskin pants, Bowie knives and guns.</TE>
<TE>   While the Californios lay in wait in the pass, preparing to drop
tons of rocks on the American soldiers, Fremont and his troops took
control of Santa Barbara, commandeering a herd of fresh horses that
belonged to Bernarda.</TE>
<TE>   As Fremont plotted his attack on Los Angeles in the hotel
next-door to Bernarda's adobe, she was planning her own strategy to
bring peace to both sides--and get her horses back.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont's reputation as an officer and a gentleman was in
contradiction to the band of well-armed adventurers that accompanied
him. Word circulated among frightened townspeople that he might take
revenge on them for the failed ambush, and seize their property.</TE>
<TE>   As the panic-stricken townsfolk huddled in their homes, Bernarda
walked next-door to the hotel and confronted Fremont. Because she was
the town's matriarch, a woman of influence with important family
connections, he promised her 10 minutes of his time.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomatically, as she would later write, she urged him to "go
easy on" her people, advising him that a "generous peace," one
respecting property rights--including her horses, which Fremont later
returned--would be to his political advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Undaunted by the era's barriers to women, she appealed to
Fremont's ego and ambition, reasoning that he could gain thousands of
loyal allies rather than bitter enemies if he released prisoners,
permitted those who did not wish to stay in California to go back to
Mexico, granted those who did stay equal rights with U.S. citizens,
and pardoned Gen. Andres Pico, commander of the Californios.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 minutes he promised lasted two hours. Bernarda skillfully
proved that the pen was mightier than the sword.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, in Los Angeles the Californios were waving a
flag of truce, surrendering their "dear City of Angels." Nonetheless,
the Californios refused to yield to Fremont's rivals, Gen. Stephen
Watts Kearney and Commodore Robert Stockton, who wanted to hang Pico
and his 75 soldiers. Though peace looked possible in Santa Barbara,
more bloodshed appeared likely in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, amid escalating tensions, Bernarda accompanied
Fremont south to the San Fernando Mission, where they heard of
Kearney's and Stockton's harsh terms, and where angry and embittered
Californios were waiting to complain.</TE>
<TE>   Bernarda went alone to Pico's camp and smoothed things over by
telling him of the peace agreement she and Fremont had forged.</TE>
<TE>   Pico knew of Fremont's penchant for going over the heads of his
superiors, and agreed to meet with him at an already famous spot
where two other battles had been fought, an old storage building
belonging to the mission. It would later become known as Campo de
Cahuenga, the unofficial birthplace of modern California, which
stands near the Los Angeles River where Lankershim and Cahuenga
boulevards meet.</TE>
<TE>   What happened next, on Jan. 13, 1847, may have lacked the drama of
a battle, but there's no denying that it was a momentous event.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont and Pico sat at the treaty table on the adobe's porch, in
the pouring January rain. Behind them stood Bernarda. Surrounded by
high-ranking officers, she watched in silence as Fremont, Pico and
six others signed the Articles of Capitulation, the cease-fire that
reflected her thinking and philosophy and became known as the Treaty
of Cahuenga.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement, one copy in English and the other in Spanish, ended
the war in California--although it continued elsewhere for a
year--and became the keystone to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
Under that treaty, the United States eventually paid more than $18
million to get control of a half-million square miles of the American
West, setting the wheels in motion for California to become part of
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Though Fremont jumped into the spotlight as a peacemaker during
his monthlong stint as California's first military governor,
Bernarda's catalytic role was lost amid the Yankee fanfare and,
later, in the pages of history.</TE>
<TE>   She returned to Santa Barbara, where she lived until her death in
1880, at 78.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bernarda's name is nowhere to be found in the treaty, a
fountain at Campo de Cahuenga is dedicated to her triumph. In 1887,
seven years after her death and four decades after the Treaty of
Cahuenga, Fremont acknowledged in his memoirs that the peace
agreement was modeled on her advice.</TE>
<TE>   "I found that her object was to use her influence to put an end to
the war, and to do so upon such just and friendly terms of compromise
as would make the peace acceptable and enduring," Fremont wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "And she wished me to take into my mind this plan of settlement,
to which she would influence her people; meantime, she urged me to
hold my hand, so far as possible. Naturally, her character and sound
reasoning had its influence with me, and I had no reserves when I
assured her I would bear her wishes in mind when the occasion came,
and that she might with all confidence speak on this basis with her
friends."</TE>
<TE>   Bernarda's son, the textbook's owner, Mariano Rodriguez, later
became principal of the Normal School in Monterey and died in
Carpinteria in 1897.</TE>
<TE>   Bernarda's great-great-great-granddaughter, Beverly Roland, found
the fragile textbook under her mother's Santa Barbara home a few
years ago. It was printed by Augustin Vicente Zamorano, the state's
first printer, and contains 10 hand-sewn pages and a blue cover and
is full of almanac-style tables: how many inches to a foot, how many
seconds to a minute, how many tens in a million. The tiny treasure
will be auctioned off at John's Western Gallery in San Francisco on
May 17.</TE>

<LD>More than 100 children's baseball uniforms were stolen in southwest
Los Angeles, forcing the cancellation Saturday of about a dozen
opening-day games and possibly affecting games the rest of the week
at Rancho Cienega Park.</LD>
<LD>   The new uniforms, for children ages 5 to 12, were stolen from a
small storage building at the park late Friday or early Saturday,
said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Tony O'Brien.</LD>
<LD>   "The [thieves] broke a window, reached through, unlocked the door
and got in," O'Brien said. "They prevented opening day from
occurring."</LD>
<TE>   Police have no suspects.</TE>
<TE>   This would have been the first time four teams played in replicas
of Negro League uniforms, said senior recreational director Ed Dabbs.
He personally paid $1,800 for about four dozen uniforms honoring
Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson and other legendary Negro League players,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Negro leagues sprung up in the 1920s and faded after the unwritten
major league ban on black players ended in 1947.</TE>
<TE>   "Coaches were telling the kids to get educated, to go to the
library and do research on these teams and the players who were on
these teams," Dabbs said. "I thought it was important for the kids to
know what the Negro League was about."</TE>
<TE>   Games on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday might be canceled
as league directors scramble to buy uniforms, Dabbs said.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids were pretty sad. They were asking, 'Why would anybody
steal uniforms? What are they going to do with them?'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information on the theft is asked to call police at
(213) 485-6571.</TE>

<HD>Don't Renew Sewage Waiver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With all the controversy surrounding water quality off Huntington
Beach, one would think that disclosure of important information would
be a priority. Not so, apparently, at the Orange County Sanitation
District, where the prevailing philosophy seems to be the less said
the better.</LD>
<LD>   The district long has maintained that partially treated sewage
discharged four miles out remained well offshore. These assertions
had important ramifications for the ability of local communities and
environmental groups to evaluate the waiver the district has from
federal clean water standards. While many districts around the
country are required to treat sewage to a higher level of
cleanliness, the district has enjoyed a pass, and, of course, it has
realized a considerable saving.</LD>
<LD>   But the questions persist about the water off Huntington Beach and
Newport Beach, and the possibility that the district's discharge of
huge quantities of partially treated water is affecting the beaches.
Last month, the Orange County Grand Jury said the county's largest
sanitation agency had withheld sensitive water-quality reports,
including a study that the agency did not disclose for five years
that mapped the offshore sewage plume.</LD>
<TE>   The study, which started in the mid-1990s, was made available to
regulatory agencies, but not to the cities with the most obvious
stake in local water quality. The cities have been trying to deal
with the consequences of poor water quality to their local economies,
and obviously would benefit from knowing more. Several cities that
belong to the district already have gone on record as opposing
another waiver.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that the partially treated waste water discharged
four miles offshore actually washed back to within 11/2 miles of
Newport Beach, far closer than previously acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury proposed the obvious remedies, releasing agency
studies to the public in a timely fashion, publishing study results,
putting study topics on the Web and providing public access to
research data. The district replied appropriately that it wanted to
improve the way it communicates with the public. But why did it have
to come to this?</TE>
<TE>   The agency, as the grand jury noted, is largely "self-monitored,"
that is, responsible to regulatory agencies but enjoying latitude in
deciding what it reveals to the public. Now we know that its latitude
has been exercised to the maximum.</TE>
<TE>   All of this comes at a time when the district is deciding whether
to seek a renewal of the waiver, which is up in 2003. As we have said
before, it should not be renewed.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some South County residents want to derail a proposal that would send
high-speed trains barreling through the heart of San Clemente. The
fatal Metrolink commuter train crash April 23 in Placentia is fueling
a new sense of urgency for a plan that would move increasingly busy
railroad tracks running through the city into a trench below street
level.</LD>
<LD>   The growing chorus of railroad blues might sound like a bad case
of NIMBY in a county that just grounded an airport proposal. The
noisy parade of passenger and freight trains rolling through the
county is growing longer, though, and talk of 200-mph passenger
trains racing between San Diego and San Francisco is moving into the
realm of serious public policy debate.</LD>
<LD>   Existing railroad tracks were laid decades before suburban sprawl
blanketed the county, so there is no easy way to give frazzled
commuters a ticket out of freeway gridlock, or accommodate freight
traffic that carries goods to and from the ports of Los Angeles and
Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Solutions that will eliminate bottlenecks along tracks are costly
and will emerge in bits and pieces. The proposed four-mile trench
through Placentia, for example, would keep automobiles and
pedestrians out of harm's way by eliminating 11 dangerous grade
crossings. The plan is worth implementing as funds become available;
Placentia residents are assaulted by the blaring horns of more than
70 daily Metrolink, Amtrak and Burlington-Northern Santa Fe trains.</TE>
<TE>   The trench is a real-world solution patterned after the
$2.4-billion, 20-mile Alameda Corridor that eliminated traffic jams
and noise in municipalities bisected by busy tracks linking the port
with freight yards in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The April 23 head-on collision between a freight train and a
Metrolink commuter train that left two passengers dead underscored
another unfortunate fact of railroad life in the county. Existing
corridors force freight and passenger trains to share tracks. Those
bottlenecks threaten to stall discussion of innovative proposals,
including the California High-Speed Rail Authority's envisioned fleet
of high-speed passenger trains.</TE>
<TE>   One key bottleneck is in San Clemente, where northbound and
southbound trains share a single set of tracks perched beneath
delicate coastal bluffs. Stand at the foot of the municipal pier and
it's clear that the extremely narrow railroad right of way that
barely accommodates one set of tracks wasn't built to handle
high-speed trains.</TE>
<TE>   Safety is an issue in San Clemente, where seven people have died
during the past decade while trying to walk across railroad tracks.
On a recent morning, a middle-aged couple ignored the flashing red
lights and crossing gates as they scrambled safely across the tracks
and toward the pier. Seconds later, a northbound Amtrak Surfliner
drowned out the rhythmic pounding of the surf.</TE>
<TE>   The rail authority is considering two possible solutions in San
Clemente. Unfortunately, neither is an easy or good one. The first
would create a pair of high-speed tracks that would run along the
existing seaside corridor. The second is a mammoth, five-mile railway
tunnel that would run under Interstate 5.</TE>
<TE>   The environmental cost of anchoring two sets of high-speed tracks
near the fragile bluffs would be unacceptable. It's difficult to
imagine the rail authority finding hundreds of millions of dollars
necessary to finance a massive tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   The rail authority's charge to move Californians into the future
is laudable in a state where transportation alternatives are a
necessity. However, the problems of Placentia and San Clemente show
that it won't be easy to move passengers and freight in a manner that
coexists with nature and civilization.</TE>

<LD>The red, white and blue "For Sale" sign planted in the ground outside
Tustin Villas is more than just a marketing pitch for another of
Orange County's housing developments. The sign that invites
developers to bid on 235 acres of land at the former Tustin Marine
air base means that after years of talking, negotiating, fighting and
suing, it's finally time to start doing something with the former
military base.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Navy is selling Tustin Villas, along with two other
military housing units, to help recoup costs associated with moving
troops and equipment to other locations. The three subdivisions
contain more than 1,200 townhomes, duplexes and multifamily units
that once housed Marines and their families. Some older units will be
torn down to make way for new development, but the base reuse plan
calls for medium- and low-density residential development on the
land.</LD>
<LD>   The sale of Tustin Villas, Marble Mountain and Moffett
Meadows--the latter two named, respectively, for a helicopter base in
Vietnam and the father of Navy aviation--will do more than help the
Navy generate cash. The real estate deal also could provide insight
into how the Navy will dispose of remaining land at the 1,600-acre
blimp and helicopter base as well as the 4,700-acre El Toro base.</LD>
<TE>   The housing developments that sit in the shadow of the massive
blimp hangars are cataloged on the federal government's General
Service Agency's Web site. Motivated buyers are encouraged to visit a
sales office on the former base. The Navy modestly describes the land
as "prime parcels" that are just a short drive from UC Irvine, South
Coast Plaza and the Orange County Performing Arts Center.</TE>
<TE>   The value of the 235 acres was hinted at a few months ago when 22
developers, an unexpectedly high number, submitted bids to the city
of Tustin for a smaller, undeveloped parcel. And residential land
just off the base in Irvine has sold for as much as $1 million an
acre.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Sam is on track toward the goal of closing out a big part of
the federal government's long military association with Orange
County. Unfortunately, the city of Tustin still is at odds with the
Santa Ana Unified School District, which wants land on the base to
build a much-needed school. Tustin knows it won't be able to zone its
base property--the first step toward redevelopment--until the
disagreement is settled. Tustin has accommodated other school
districts and community colleges, and a similar agreement with Santa
Ana Unified is overdue.</TE>

<HD>Mission Viejo City Hall Stayed Within Budget</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Reining in Spending in Mission Viejo," April 28:</LD>
<LD>   I was alarmed to see a letter from Rod Freed saying that he had
read in the Los Angeles Times that overruns had pushed the cost of
the new Mission Viejo City Hall from $12 million to $22 million.
There were no cost overruns on this project, and neither of these
dollar figures are correct. I am writing to set the record straight.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, in an advisory vote, 74% of Mission Viejo's voters
endorsed a proposal to build a city hall "on land already owned by
the city across the courtyard from the Mission Viejo Library at a
total construction and financing cost of approximately $57.7 million
over the next fifty years."</LD>
<TE>   This cost, calculated by the Keyser Marston Associates real estate
consulting firm, compared favorably with a similar 50-year cost of
$81 million to buy and renovate an older office building, or $107.5
million to continue leasing office space in an existing building.</TE>
<TE>   Through a series of actions, the Mission Viejo City Council
established a budget of $14.4 million for design and construction of
the city hall and gave strict instructions that there were to be no
cost overruns. Ground was officially broken on March 21, 2000, and
the doors to this modest two-story structure were opened one year
later, on March 25, 2002, on schedule and within budget.</TE>

<LD>Re "Fatigue Is Too Often Part of Job, Train Operators Say," April 27:</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps it was providence that the Brea Fire Department was taking
part in a countywide disaster training drill right before the April
23 train accident. As a mother who had a son seriously injured in the
collision between the Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight train and
the Metrolink commuter, I have nothing but praise for the rapid
response of the rescue workers, volunteers and hospital staff.</LD>
<LD>   My son was in the first car and, like other passengers, had made
friends with the conductor and engineer, who told him to run if he
ever saw them running. They ran and he followed them to the back of
the first car. He sustained multiple head injuries and chest trauma.
He was knocked unconscious but woke up and stumbled out of the car.
My son wrapped his bleeding head in a T-shirt given to him by a
passenger named John. I'd like to say "thank you" to John. I was
watching the morning news that day, and when I saw the accident
report, I had a funny feeling. I called his cell phone, his phone at
work and his girlfriend, but got no answer. I called his work again
and asked if he had arrived or had called. "No" was the answer. Soon
a Kaiser emergency-room doctor called.</LD>
<TE>   Emergency room staff gave me good directions to the hospital. I
called a sheriff chaplain to pray. He beat me to the hospital. We had
first-rate doctors, who decided to transfer my son to Anaheim
Memorial for cardiac care. Doctors were waiting to attend to him at
Anaheim Memorial Medical Center. Even the media, who were looking for
a story, were respectful as I declined most of their inquiries. At
that point, I was interested in the mental, physical and spiritual
state of my adult child.</TE>
<TE>   Such days are nightmares. Mine was much less so because of a
community of caring, sensitive and competent professionals doing
their job, and a merciful God.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you" feels inadequate, but words are what I have to extend
my gratitude to all who helped take the sting out of a bad situation.
Oh yes, I took my son home from the hospital recently. Our prayers go
to those injured and those who have lost a loved one.</TE>

<LD>   I also want to respond to your article about welfare moms. The
woman you used in the article was a good example of a typical
situation. I have a large amount of sympathy for her four children,
but little for her. She, like many in her situation, needs to stop
having kids. Families must be planned and begun only when parents are
stable financially and socially. Everyone has access to birth control
until one is truly ready to have children.</LD>

<HD>Grand Jury Is Praised for Sewage-Study Action</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Negative Study on Sewage Was Withheld," April 25:</LD>
<LD>   I commend the Orange County Grand Jury for investigating and
criticizing the Orange County Sanitation District for not releasing
the 1996, 20-meter study in a timely manner. The district did not
release a written report on this study until March 2002. This is
inexcusable, and the district should be reprimanded and penalized.
Had this study been public in 1996, perhaps the district would not
have been able to change the Santa Ana River Basin Plan standards in
1997, and perhaps the district would not have gotten a 301(h) waiver
from the EPA and Water Quality Control Board in 1998 to discharge
partially secondary treated wastewater.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the sewage would have been disinfected in 1999, preventing
the disastrous beach closures in Huntington Beach that year that
caused millions of dollars in economic losses. The study found three
days in 1996 when there was simultaneous evidence of near-shore and
surf zone contamination by coliform bacteria, suggesting a
correlation between the sewage plume and bacteria on the shore.</LD>
<TE>   It is the district's manipulation of data after the discovery and
suppression of the unpublished study that I find most repugnant and
worthy of punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Jan D. Vandersloot</TE>

<TE>   The sanitation district is playing games with public health. I
think that any board members who served before March 2002 should be
immediately removed, and the district's waiver should be immediately
rescinded since it was obtained using false information. Decisive,
quick action is required to prevent further damage to our ocean, our
beaches and the health of Orange County citizens and visitors.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Toll Board Sees a Merger as Cure for Its Ills," April 26:</LD>
<LD>   Can any of our elected officials explain what is going on with
Orange County's toll roads?</LD>
<LD>   The 91 Express Lanes are purchased in order to retire the
noncompetition agreements that blocked improvements to the public
freeway. Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer approves the purchase
because the toll road "relied on congestion and a lack of mobility to
get people to pay. It's bad public policy." But apparently it's OK
for Orange County's other toll roads, which continue to have similar
noncompete agreements.</LD>
<TE>   Even with such agreements, the San Joaquin Hills toll road is
drowning in red ink. Panicked board members, fearing bankruptcy, want
the road merged with the Foothill/Eastern toll roads. But officials
of the Foothill/Eastern roads are reworking traffic and revenue
projections in the wake of the El Toro airport defeat. That's why
Foothill/Eastern board members are saying they have a lot of
"research" to do.</TE>
<TE>   Despite ominous financial indications, those same board members
are spending millions to design the unneeded Foothill South toll
road, which would add nearly a billion in debt to the toll roads'
current $4-billion debt.</TE>
<TE>   When will Orange County leaders tell taxpayers the whole story
about the toll roads and come clean on the financial risks these
public agencies are taking?</TE>

<TE>   Re "Opening Up the 91 Freeway," Editorial, April 28:</TE>
<TE>   You write that "a strategy that benefited only those motorists who
can buy their way out of traffic jams is flawed." Why not try
rephrasing that: A strategy that benefits only some politically
favored motorists is unwise, unfair and corrupt. Unfortunately, the
latter strategy is still in place and carries your continued support.</TE>
<TE>   The 91 toll lanes will continue to levy a toll so only those who
can buy their way into the lanes will get the maximum benefit. Yes,
some carpools may get a free ride, but those politically favored
motorists also are paying a price, which many cannot afford. At the
same time, needed freeways are not being built because politically
favored motorists who live in the area resist them. The result is not
only severe congestion but also increased pollution from vehicles
operating at inefficient speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Alternatives to the Riverside Freeway have been suggested for
years, and some were included in state planning 40 years ago.
Alternatives to the San Diego Freeway were also once planned and
would have alleviated traffic problems in Encino, which you also
described.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, a more-complete freeway network in urbanized areas
might actually reduce the incentive for people to move to outlying
areas with smoother traffic patterns.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Close</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I agree with your observation that the decision by the Orange
County Transportation Authority to buy the 91 toll lanes was a good
one for regional transportation. Supervisor Todd Spitzer, Irvine
Councilman Mike Ward and OCTA Chief Executive Art Leahy ought to be
commended for their vision and leadership in coming to grips with
this serious problem.</TE>
<TE>   I disagree, however, with your analysis of the public policy
issues involved, particularly your characterization of the toll lanes
as a "misguided chapter in the county's toll road experiment." You
correctly observe that when the toll lanes were built, there was no
other solution to the problem of needed additional capacity in the
corridor. California Private Transportation Co. stepped up and
invested over $135 million to build the lanes and provide that
relief. Wall Street demanded the noncompetition clause as a way to
make sure the bonds would be repaid to investors as they would for
any business.</TE>
<TE>   We see those same noncompetition clauses in our public sector toll
roads built and operated by the Transportation Corridor Agencies. The
only problem was that growth in the region, particularly in Riverside
County, outpaced California Private Transportation Co.'s ability to
pay off the bonds. So it was appropriate that OCTA stepped up to
assume the remaining debt, reward the company with a reasonable
profit and assume responsibility for improving the corridor.</TE>
<TE>   It is still a "win-win" for the public, and there are no bad guys
in this story. The entrepreneurs of the company deserve credit for
rolling the dice and providing relief for the corridor. OCTA deserves
credit for accepting the challenge of providing for the next stage of
improvements. The process has evolved to meet the needs of a rapidly
changing region. Thank goodness for leaders such as Spitzer, Ward,
Leahy and California Private Transportation Co.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Disputed Figures Add to Orange Teacher Tensions," Letters, April
28:</LD>
<LD>   David J. Smollar, director of communications for the Capistrano
Unified School District, cites last year's 13% "raise" in his letter
to the editor. The 13% raise was for half a year, effectively a 10%
raise for the year. The district's health program costs to teachers
who continued in preferred provider programs increased, accounting
for another 5% of the 13% "raise." Smollar cites top salaries in the
district at $81,000 or more. The published salary schedule shows that
any teacher making more than the "maximum" must work extra hours.</LD>
<LD>   Using fuzzy math to compute raises and failing to indicate that
those who make more must work extra hours are misleading. The result
of this sort of communication is an advanced "we-they" mentality
among the teachers.</LD>

<LD>Re "In Special Ed, Accountability Is Left Behind," April 17:</LD>
<LD>   As someone involved in special education, I was sad to see the
length given to Ruben Navarrette Jr.'s op-ed piece. What should have
been a one-paragraph opinion based upon one day of experience in the
role of a substitute was given a quarter of a page. The Times should
have researched the funding of special education and how students
with special needs are placed in programs before printing the
inaccurate commentary.</LD>
<LD>   I find it offensive that Navarrette refers to special education,
and thus the professionals working in the field, as some sort of
contrived "scheme" seeking to avoid accountability. All I'm trying to
do is give students with special needs a chance to reach their full
potential and live productive, useful lives. If that qualifies as a
scheme, so be it.</LD>

<LD>Re "This Just In, Judge: There's No Cultural Defense for Child Abuse"
column, April 28:</LD>
<LD>   I am one of Judge James O. Perez's five sons. Before you start
making judgments about my dad and blasting them out to thousands of
readers, you should have done some research.</LD>
<LD>   First, the injury was a single burn to the outside of a single
finger requiring only a Band-Aid.</LD>
<TE>   Second, did you look at the guilty-plea form to see if there was
additional punishment beyond the $100 fine? The defendant was placed
on four years of formal supervised probation and can have no contact
with the minor unless approved by the Dependency Court. The defendant
also had to attend and successfully complete a one-year child
batterer's treatment program.</TE>
<TE>   Third, have you checked into my father's background? He was the
son of a miner, born in Arizona, served our county in WWII, came
home, went to college and law school, and became the first
Spanish-speaking judge in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   You should be ashamed of yourself for making such a bold assertion
about my father staying retired without doing adequate research.
Being a columnist and not looking into the facts is simply
unprofessional and dangerous. Print this; my dad deserves it.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Burning Son's Hand Gets Dad $100 Fine," April 27:</TE>
<TE>   My stomach absolutely turned while reading the story of the father
who burned his son's hand. Giving this man a $100 fine for punishing
his son and citing "customs and habits" was a grave injustice.</TE>
<TE>   What's next, a father getting a slap on the wrist for punishing a
daughter who was unwilling to enter into an arranged marriage by
killing her?</TE>
<TE>   People who choose to live in the United States must understand
that they have to abide by our laws, our "customs and habits." Did
the Soto family ever notice that their friends and neighbors were
most likely not burning their children's' hands as punishment?</TE>
<TE>   By choosing to respond with such a violent and unnecessary act, I
wonder if the Sotos are now going to see the cycle repeat if their
son has children one day. After all, the father was punished in this
manner when he was a small child. Perhaps the Sotos need to enroll in
a parenting class to better acquaint themselves with the "customs and
habits" of parenting in the United States. As an elementary school
teacher who sees the results of different "customs and habits" on a
daily basis, I urge them to seek out assistance. As a parent, I beg
them to do so.</TE>
<TE>   R. Strong</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The idea of fining a man $100 for abusing his child is
unbelievable. The idea that Judge Perez actually stated that this
will help the child down the road is absurd. A father from a
different country with different customs and habits does not have a
right to abuse his child.</TE>
<TE>   I guess I am unaware of a culture that excuses child abuse because
that is its custom. This is why the United States has child abuse
laws that Perez should be enforcing instead of allowing this man to
continue abusing this boy. What punishment will be given out the next
time the father thinks his son did something wrong?</TE>
<TE>   The judge should be removed from the bench and the father should
have been given the sentence he deserved.</TE>

<TE>   There is a positive side to this sad event. Perez is a pro tem
judge and can be dismissed at will. Put his feet to the fire and let
him go.</TE>

<LD>Re "Church, Costco at Odds Over Site," April 6:</LD>
<LD>   The Cypress City Council sees sales tax revenue as more important
than religion. It is refusing to allow construction of a large church
complex on prime land owned by the church. Costco also wants to build
on that land. The city plan seems to be to use its power of
condemnation to take the church land and then sell it to Costco--or
to simply keep the land vacant until the church gives in.</LD>
<LD>   The 1st Amendment says that Congress shall make no law prohibiting
the free exercise of religion. The city's taking of church property
is a violation of the 1st Amendment. That should make it easy to win
the court battle and recall the pro-tax, pro-Costco council members.</LD>

<LD>Re "A Smooth Ride for Freight Railway," April 12:</LD>
<LD>   For years I have read letters to the editor on the pros and cons
of an international airport at El Toro. The cavalcade has included
some of the most uninformed opinions I have ever read. I thought when
Measure W passed and the Navy announced its decision that I would no
longer be reading ridiculous letters. Then you published the opinion
of Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp. With a great wringing of hands, Kyser states that
Ontario Airport can accommodate millions more passengers, but that,
at 35 miles' distance from Los Angeles, it is too far from
transportation hubs. He also states that El Toro is just 45 miles
from Los Angeles and is next to a freeway and rail line.</LD>
<LD>   Ontario International Airport is next to the San Bernardino
Freeway. Someone with a strong arm might be able to throw a rock from
the airport over the multiple tracks of the Southern Pacific
Railroad.</LD>
<TE>   El Toro is next to a single rail line and a single freeway that
run between San Diego and Los Angeles. There are no major truck
terminals in Orange County, and it's 10 miles farther away from L.A.
than Ontario. My suggestion to Kyser is to look to the Northeast
where he'll see a gigantic international airport already in operation
that's called Palmdale.</TE>

<TE>   Re "El Toro Airport Advocates Lost to a United Suburbia," April
28:</TE>
<TE>   I believe the final legacy of the El Toro debate will be a study
of the endless spin-doctoring by the local news media. The latest
news-reporting-as-subterfuge appears in your April 28 story. The
reader is expected to bemoan the loss of the alleged "benefit" of an
airport as an illustration of the inherent flaw in leaving decisions
about building regional facilities to locals.</TE>
<TE>   The state never intervened in the El Toro debate, despite
arguments that the issue of new airports is a statewide concern. I
guess the state recognized a simple fact that The Times missed: The
'L' in LRA stands for Local Redevelopment Authority. The explicit
intent of the federal government is that base reuse is a local
decision, not to be made by outside residents.</TE>
<TE>   The decisions regarding base reuse are clearly and legally the
responsibility of the adjacent cities. Previous editorials in The
Times have correctly recognized the many flaws in Orange County's
mishandling of the duties of the LRA. Had federal guidelines been
followed from the beginning, most of this debate would have been
moot. No amount of spinning this tale can change this simple fact.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Navy Makes No El Toro Promises," April 26:</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad said how she and her husband wanted to
buy some property at the former Camp Elliot in San Diego, and that
only three years ago, they were still sweeping for unexploded
ordnance. Out of curiosity, I did a little research about Camp
Elliot. On Dec. 10, 1983, three boys were playing in a fieldin
Tierrasanta and found what appeared to be some scrap metal. Two of
them were killed when it exploded.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson is that an old military base is the last place for a
park. I hope the Navy does not quickly unload El Toro for the sake of
Irvine's convenience.</TE>

<TE>   Re "El Toro Sale Puts Regional Plans in a Fix," April 24:</TE>
<TE>   Recent news stories quote the current Southern California Assn. of
Governments' travel projection of 157 million annual passengers for
the region by 2020. This projection is the basis for the push for
Orange County to build a second airport, as well as for Assembly Bill
2333, which is intended to punish Orange County for not agreeing to
build El Toro by withholding future federal highway funds.</TE>
<TE>   SCAG's projection is bogus. It projected 1.72 million new regional
passengers by Aug. 31, 2001, a 2.91% annual increase. But just
221,405 new passengers used the region's airports during the first
eight months of 2001, even before 9/11. Missing the mark by a factor
of five or more in the first eight months of the new 20-year SCAG
projection is a good indicator of the projection's accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   The folks at SCAG have missed badly in every attempt to forecast
regional air travel. They have consistently projected regional air
travel to be 30 to 36 million air passengers too high--the size of a
large new regional airport--and they are well on their way to being
at least 30 million passengers too high on this 20-year forecast. How
many of us would keep our jobs with that track record?</TE>

<LD>A gunman surrendered to police and freed 13 people after holding them
hostage for an hour at a luxury Istanbul hotel in an apparent protest
against Russia's military campaigns in Chechnya.</LD>
<LD>   No hostages were harmed in the standoff, which would be the latest
in a series of such hijackings and hostage-takings in overwhelmingly
Muslim Turkey, where sympathy for the breakaway Russian republic has
been strong. Other guests ran in panic from the hotel, where about
550 people were staying. More than 1,000 people were in the building
at the time, hotel manager Cem Gundes said.</LD>
<LD>   NTV television identified the gunman as a Turk, Mustafa Yildirim.
A brother told NTV that the gunman fought against the Russians in
Chechnya in 1997.</LD>

<HD>38 Children Among Victims in Colombia</HD>
<DH>Latin America: As many as 98 civilians were killed in
battle between rebels and paramilitaries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MEDELLIN, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Officials said Saturday that 38 children were among as many as 98
civilians killed during fighting between rebels and rival
paramilitaries in an isolated corner of northwestern Colombia.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the civilians were killed when homemade mortars slammed
into a church in the village of Bojaya, Juan Gonzalo Lopez, health
secretary for Antioquia state, said late Saturday. The village is 235
miles northwest of the capital, Bogota, and borders Antioquia state.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities blamed the attack on the leftist Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC.</LD>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear if rebels were aiming at the church.
They use cooking gas canisters packed with explosives as mortar
rounds, which are not accurate.</TE>
<TE>   The battles began Wednesday in Choco state when combatants squared
off for control of lucrative drug-producing territory, said Gen.
Leonel Gomez, commander of the army's 1st Division.</TE>
<TE>   Rescuers evacuated more than a dozen people who were wounded.
Dozens of other people caught in the cross-fire remained stranded.
Authorities said some of them were missing limbs, and rescuers were
not expected to reach them until today at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-eight bodies, about 20 of which haven't been identified,
were brought to the nearby village of Vigia del Fuerte in Antioquia,
Lopez said. One of the victims was a 1-year-old baby.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told rescue workers that about 30 bodies were still
scattered in the area, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia's civil war pits the FARC and a smaller rebel group
against the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia and
government forces. About 3,500 people, most of them civilians, are
killed in fighting each year.</TE>

<HD>Jet Crashes With 76 Aboard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANO, Nigeria</DL>
<LD>A Nigerian airliner with 76 people aboard crashed, tearing a
three-block swath through mosques and homes in the northern city of
Kano on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   At least two people on board survived, aviation authorities
said--one, a passenger who rose from his seat amid the wreckage and
staggered away.</LD>
<LD>   The other known survivor was a female crew member, said John
Okafor, spokesman for Nigeria's federal airport authority.</LD>
<TE>   There was no firm report on overall casualties. But dozens were
feared dead on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The plane had taken off from Kano for Nigeria's commercial
capital, Lagos, about 500 miles to the southwest, Okafor said.</TE>
<TE>   The aircraft crashed at about 1:30 p.m. approximately half a mile
from the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation authorities said they were searching for the plane's
black box, hoping for clues to the crash. Residents said the plane
tore along at roof level for several blocks, shearing off tin roofs
and top stories of modest concrete homes, before hitting the ground
and exploding.</TE>
<TE>   The plane clipped the minaret of one mosque and smashed full force
into a second mosque.</TE>
<TE>   The passengers on board included Nigeria's sports minister as well
as a number of local dignitaries, radio stations reported.</TE>
<TE>   The plane belonged to Nigeria's private EAS Airlines, one of more
than a dozen independent carriers operating within the West African
country. Kano State Gov. Rabiu Isa Kwankwaso visited the crash site
late Saturday, adding to confusion at the scene, as distraught
residents jostled to talk to him and were pushed back by security.</TE>

<HD>Afghans Feel the Bite of a Pest the War Nourished</HD>
<DH>Health: Thousands of people have painful lesions caused by
a kind of sand fly. The insect proliferates in debris, garbage and
sewage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Phlebotomus sergenti is a tiny gray sand fly slightly smaller than a
mosquito. It feeds on human blood and, when feasting, can transmit
parasites called leishmania.</LD>
<LD>   One fly bit Mansoor Mimtaza the day he was born. That was 10
months ago, and he still has a weepy red lesion beside his tiny pug
nose.</LD>
<LD>   A sand fly also bit Mohammed Sarwar, 52, leaving a crusty purple
scab along his terribly swollen right wrist.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds of victims--old, young and newborn--arrive daily at the
Khair Khana Clinic here in the Afghan capital to be treated for an
affliction that isn't fatal but is painful, traumatic and
disfiguring. Cutaneous leishmaniasis, the lesion caused by the bite
of an infected sand fly, is reaching epidemic proportions in Kabul
and other Afghan cities.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the clinic, children wriggle and howl as clinicians probe
their lesions and inject the sores with medication. Older boys and
men clench their teeth or bellow in pain while a ragged line of
blistered mothers and fathers, children and grandparents snakes
through the mud outside.</TE>
<TE>   The war and destruction of last fall helped create fertile
breeding grounds for the sand fly, which proliferates in damp areas
and among debris, garbage and sewage. Health Net International, a
Dutch humanitarian aid group that funds the Khair Khana Clinic,
estimates that 69,000 new cases of leishmaniasis will break out in
Kabul alone this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you have an infected population, the parasite easily travels
from one person to the next as flies bite infected people and then
bite someone else," said Esmee de Jong, a Health Net International
coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   The grimy faces of many children begging on the streets of Afghan
cities bear deep scars and pockmarks from the disease. People with
the scars, whether young or old, are often shunned or stigmatized in
Afghan society.</TE>
<TE>   A survey by Health Net International found that most young women
with scars from sand fly lesions cannot attract a husband and are
ostracized by their families. Many mothers refuse to let their
scarred offspring eat with the rest of the family.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a terrible stigma, a real social rejection," said Kamal
Mustafa, a microbiologist with the World Health Organization in
Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   To Afghans, leishmaniasis is known as soldana--the "sore for a
year"--because the lesions fester for up to 12 months before they
heal and harden into scars. The disease is common in the Middle East
and Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   It is so prevalent that the Khair Khana Clinic resorts to a brutal
form of triage. Of the several hundred new patients who arrive on a
typical treatment day, the clinic usually can treat only 30, 15 males
and 15 females. Without treatment, victims recover within a year as
their bodies develop antibodies, and they are immune for life.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic staff selects only the most severely infected patients.
Infected joints such as a knee or elbow can become immobile if not
treated.</TE>
<TE>   The clinic and its 10-member staff treated 96 patients when it
opened in 1997. It treated 4,490 last year and 1,708 in the first
three months of this year, which points to about 7,000 cases for
2002.</TE>
<TE>   Patients receive painful injections of sodium stibogluconate, a
drug that costs $130 a dose in Britain but is provided to the clinic
by WHO for $12 a dose through an Indian pharmaceutical company, De
Jong said.</TE>
<TE>   Working recently in a sunny room was Abdul Qayemudin, a sturdy,
bearded man in a white lab coat. A container of disposable syringes
lay at his elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Qayemudin worked quickly and efficiently, a one-man production
line. He smiled tenderly at children and tried to cajole them. He
politely asked men and older boys to either drop their pantaloons or
present their lesions. The drug was injected into a patient's buttock
or directly into a lesion.</TE>
<TE>   Fathers and mothers and older siblings dragged in terrified
children, who saw the needles and began to wail. About 53% of the
clinic's patients are 14 or younger. An assistant was on hand to help
subdue recalcitrant men. Girls and women were treated in a separate
room.</TE>
<TE>   Once inoculated, the men pulled up their pantaloons and shuffled
out. The children bolted for the door. Each time, Qayemudin silently
unwrapped and filled a fresh syringe.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, a long procession of people with sore, splotched faces
stood in silence, listening to the sharp wails of the children
inside, waiting and praying for something to make their pain and
their lesions disappear.</TE>

<HD>France's Social Problems Are the Real Villain, Analysts Say</HD>
<DH>Europe: As the nation votes today in the presidential
runoff, political observers see Le Pen's success as symptom of
disenchantment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The extraordinary public repudiation of far-right candidate
Jean-Marie Le Pen in the last two weeks has made the campaign for
France's runoff presidential election today unlike any other.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of thousands of protesters have staged the biggest
marches here in memory and called the grizzled former paratrooper
every name in the book, especially racist, Nazi and thug. The
indignation of the anti-Le Pen movement filling the streets each day
makes it clear that France hasn't been overwhelmed by rabid
neo-fascists.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, the rush by politicians and voters across much of the
spectrum to condemn Le Pen as the sole villain of the moment could
obscure the real lesson of his surprise showing in the first round
April 21, political observers say.</LD>
<TE>   Le Pen's success is a symptom of the nation's political paralysis
and identity crisis, they say. The forces driving the success of this
snarling maverick are rage and fear caused by crime, immigrants,
European integration, economic globalization--change in all its
manifestations.</TE>
<TE>   Similar conditions produced U.S. populists such as former Alabama
Gov. George Wallace in the 1960s and Ross Perot and Patrick Buchanan
in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   If French leaders don't recognize their failure to address
festering social problems, Le Pen's almost certain loss to incumbent
President Jacques Chirac won't make much of a difference. Pollsters
believe that Le Pen will cobble together extremist, protest and
working-class votes to improve on the 17% he won in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   "Le Pen could get 25% to 30%," said a French official who is
monitoring the race for the government and asked to remain anonymous.
"That would be a victory for him. His strength shows there is a
rupture between the people and the elites. Between the French who are
scared and the French who are not scared. Between the closed France
and the open France.</TE>
<TE>   "The demonstrators just keep saying 'Le Pen the racist'; they
attack the results of a democratic vote. But that's not the problem.
The problem is that the institutions don't work."</TE>
<TE>   The broad-based campaign against Le Pen appears to have slowed his
momentum, sweeping up a remarkable number of young people disgusted
by his longtime association with pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic and
anti-immigrant ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been an exceptional mobilization of the young," said
Pierre Giacometti, a pollster for the Ipsos public opinion firm.
"April 21 was like a moment of civic revelation for them."</TE>
<TE>   Le Pen will have trouble breaking the 25% barrier, according to
Ipsos. But he could benefit from the dynamics that shaped the first
round: abstention on the left and a counter-reaction by conservative
voters resentful of the anti-Le Pen barrage.</TE>
<TE>   The first round revealed that a chasm separates the voters from
pundits and politicians. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin--whose
third-place finish to Le Pen brought his political career to a
traumatic end--and his Socialist government failed to understand the
anxieties of farmers, factory workers, shopkeepers and other converts
to Le Pen's far-right National Front.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the Socialists' achievements in stabilizing the economy
and reducing unemployment, they apparently didn't calculate the
magnitude of disenchantment even on issues that would appear to be in
the past.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of Le Pen's proposals are as colorful as his plan to
reinstate the guillotine.</TE>
<TE>   He has all but declared war, for instance, on the idea of France
as a bulwark of a unified Europe. He wants to resurrect the franc,
which was replaced by the common euro currency Jan. 1, and withdraw
from the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   Both measures would be economically and politically disastrous for
France, experts say. The country rakes in billions of dollars thanks
to European Union subsidies and trade policies. France and Germany
are seen as the core states of the emerging European political
entity.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Le Pen's followers agree with his diagnosis that France has
surrendered precious sovereignty to the European bureaucracy, which
he calls an instrument of globalization that endangers traditional
jobs and values.</TE>
<TE>   After all, almost half the French electorate voted against the
treaty that created the European Union in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   The resurgent hostility to Europe is embarrassing for the French
Socialists, because they have occasionally thrown their weight around
in the European Union and irked neighbors in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Gleeful Italian leaders said the Le Pen bombshell was comeuppance
for repeated attacks on Italy's center-right prime minister, Silvio
Berlusconi.</TE>
<TE>   Jospin's culture minister declared recently that she was
embarrassed to attend an event with Berlusconi, apparently because
she finds his brash free-market politics distasteful.</TE>
<TE>   "The French left showed itself to be so pretentious and so
arrogant regarding the Italian people and government that it deserved
a defeat," Gianfranco Fini, Italy's deputy prime minister, said in
published comments last week.</TE>
<TE>   And a Spanish commentator said the outburst of outrage at Le Pen
was ironic. Many of Le Pen's critics either didn't vote or squandered
their votes on Stalinist and Trotskyite extremists, according to
columnist and philosopher Fernando Savater.</TE>
<TE>   "The young people who didn't vote ... now march in the streets,
indignant about the candidate others voted for," Savater wrote in the
Spanish newspaper El Pais last week. "The good people of the left who
voted with their eyes closed yesterday will have to vote tomorrow
holding their noses. That's what usually happens."</TE>
<TE>   Jospin and seven of the other eight leftist candidates who ran
last month have urged the French to vote against Le Pen, despite the
left's longtime enmity toward the conservative Chirac. Local
Socialist leaders have even offered to hand out nose plugs to
crossover voters at polling places.</TE>
<TE>   A massive turnout against Le Pen might not prevent an increase in
his numbers. He is sure to add to his total the votes of his fellow
far-rightist Bruno Megret, who got about 3% in the first round. He's
also likely to pick up some support from three conservative
candidates who won a combined 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Many French voters hope to make an emphatic statement against Le
Pen today. But political observers caution that the statement will
have to lead to action on crime, immigration, economic inequality,
political stagnation, urban decline and other meaty, long-ignored
issues. Pragmatism and practical solutions must replace the governing
elite's preoccupation with ideology, theory and political
correctness, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, France's leaders could confirm the suspicion that, even
after the political equivalent of a punch in the face, they still
don't get it.</TE>
<TE>   "Le Pen is not the danger," the government official said. "The
danger is what he reveals."</TE>

<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>A monthlong standoff between the Israeli army and Palestinians holed
up inside this city's venerated Church of the Nativity appeared to be
nearing an end early today, with negotiators expressing cautious hope
that the crisis might soon be resolved.</LD>
<LD>   A top aide to Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat met
Saturday with Israeli and U.S. officials for intensive talks aimed at
breaking the siege, which began April 2. More than 200 Palestinians
took shelter in the church when Israeli troops entered Bethlehem as
part of their West Bank offensive.</LD>
<LD>   More than 150 people, including civilians, police and gunmen, are
believed to remain inside, encircled by the army. The Israelis demand
that a number of wanted men in the church surrender to face trial in
Israel or go into exile. The Palestinians have insisted that the men
be sent to the Gaza Strip.</LD>
<TE>   After 34 days, the situation inside the church has become
increasingly difficult, with food and medicine running low.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, each person was given a small amount of thin rice
soup, and several men fought over the scorched bits of rice clinging
to the bottom of the pot. Supplies brought in by activists who
entered the church Thursday were nearly gone.</TE>
<TE>   The first news of a possible deal was greeted early Saturday with
relief and hope inside the 4th century basilica. People began to
organize their belongings and took turns washing themselves and
cleaning their clothes at spigots in the sprawling compound.</TE>
<TE>   At dusk Saturday, Israeli soldiers near the church appeared to be
preparing to lift the siege. They were setting up powerful overhead
lights and moving the barbed-wire and other barricades that for more
than a month have blocked access to the shrine and adjoining Manger
Square.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians speaking by telephone from inside the church said
they had compiled a list of about 130 names of those holed up there
and turned it over to a European envoy to convey to Palestinian
negotiators. The tally was not believed to include a number of
priests, monks and nuns who have remained in the church throughout
the siege, or a group of activists who eluded Israeli troops Thursday
and raced in through its low wooden door.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, however, Palestinians, Israelis and others close to
the negotiations said that although an agreement appeared to be in
the works, many details were unresolved. Such agreements "are never
easy between these two parties," a Western official said.</TE>
<TE>   A Palestinian inside the church compound was shot by an Israeli
sniper Saturday. The man, identified as Khalaf Najazeh, 40, was a
militant wanted by Israel and was spotted carrying a gun, an Israeli
army spokesman said. Najazeh, who later died at an Israeli hospital,
was the seventh person at the church to be killed by Israel since the
standoff began, the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The army also said it had discovered a bomb-making factory in a
medical clinic a few hundred yards from the church, which is revered
by Christians as the site of Jesus' birth.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Israel lifted what had been a parallel siege of
Arafat's Ramallah headquarters as part of a deal allowing six men
wanted by Israel to be transferred to a Palestinian prison near
Jericho. The prisoners are being monitored there by U.S. and British
observers.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat has said that it is his top priority to end the standoff in
Bethlehem, the only West Bank city where a large number of Israeli
troops remain from last month's offensive. Most of the city is still
under daily curfew.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian leader was said to be overseeing Saturday's
negotiations and had dispatched his financial advisor, Mohammed
Rashid, to lead the Palestinian side.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomatic push on Bethlehem came on the eve of Orthodox
Easter celebrations and as Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
prepared to fly to Washington early today to hold talks with
President Bush on the U.S. leader's call for a Middle East peace
conference.</TE>
<TE>   But the latest round of talks aimed at resolving the Bethlehem
standoff took center stage for most of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Antoine Salman, an attorney for the Franciscan monastery in the
compound who has acted as a liaison for the negotiations, said the
situation inside was "very complicated and difficult."</TE>
<TE>   "After so many days, the people are suffering from shortages of so
many things--food, medicine, water, electricity," Salman said. "Each
day, it gets worse."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians said the man killed Saturday was a member of Arafat's
security services. Israel said he was a member of the Tanzim, the
armed wing of the Palestinian leader's Fatah movement. About 30 of
those inside consoled one another over Najazeh's death.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim Abeiyat, the Bethlehem commander of the Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade and the man inside the church who tops Israel's wanted list,
said he understood that he and the others would probably be exiled to
Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators said they could not discuss specifics of the emerging
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Late Saturday, Mitri abu Aita, the Palestinian tourism minister,
said the list prepared by people inside the church would be kept by
the negotiators and compared with a list of wanted men compiled by
Israel. The Israelis have said they are still not aware of exactly
which men are inside the church.</TE>

<HD>350 Rebels Reported Killed in Nepal</HD>
<DH>Violence: Security forces attack guerrilla camps, ministry
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal</DL>
<LD>Security forces killed at least 350 guerrillas in gun battles in
western Nepal, the Defense Ministry said Saturday, in what could be
the deadliest fighting in the rebels' 6-year-old campaign to oust
this Himalayan nation's constitutional monarchy.</LD>
<LD>   The bloodshed comes days before Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba
travels to Washington to discuss the communist insurgency with
President Bush. The administration recently asked Congress for $20
million in military aid for Nepal.</LD>
<LD>   The attack by security forces on rebel camps and hide-outs in the
Lisne area of Rolpa district, a guerrilla stronghold about 220 miles
west of Katmandu, the capital, began Thursday and lasted until Friday
night, the ministry said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   "The rebels have suffered heavy losses. Army soldiers and police
have destroyed most of their training camps in that region," Devendra
Raj Kandel, the junior interior minister, said.</TE>
<TE>   The death toll could not be confirmed independently. The rebels do
not comment on battles.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas, who are demanding sweeping land reforms and an end
to the constitutional monarchy, draw their inspiration from Chinese
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung. Since 1996, fighting has killed
more than 3,500 people, crippled Nepal's aid-dependent economy and
scared away tourists.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the government said the army had killed 40 guerrillas.
The death toll increased to 350 by Friday night as security forces
searched for more hide-outs and killed more guerrillas, including
several local rebel commanders, the government said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Several rebels were also arrested during the army offensive in
Rolpa, which came after the Maoists attacked security forces
patrolling the area, the Defense Ministry said. Two soldiers and one
policeman were also killed in the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, security forces killed six rebels in three shootouts
Friday night, the ministry said.</TE>

<HD>Hong Kong's Catholic Church Seeks to Ease Fears About Sex
Abuse Cases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>Roman Catholic officials in Hong Kong say they will be ready to
address questions from parishioners today about the church's handling
of three recently disclosed cases of sexual abuse of children by
local priests.</LD>
<LD>   The chancellor of Hong Kong's Roman Catholic diocese, Lawrence Lee
Len, reportedly has told parish priests to work at services all day
to ease worries among the region's quarter-million Catholics.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement issued Thursday, the bishop of the Hong Kong
diocese, Cardinal John Baptist Wu, confirmed accounts of the three
incidents first printed in the region's leading English-language
daily, the South China Morning Post.</LD>
<TE>   He acknowledged that church leaders had not reported the three
cases to the police, but instead had handled them internally. Two
offenders were suspended and eventually left the priesthood, while
the third was transferred to an administrative post and barred from
any contact with minors.</TE>
<TE>   Late Saturday, one of the three, now a 42-year-old insurance
agent, was detained by police on allegations of assaulting a
15-year-old boy in 1991. A police official said the man, who was not
identified, was questioned for several hours and released early
today.</TE>
<TE>   The diocese reportedly received two new complaints from
individuals claiming that they had been molested by priests. No one
was available at the diocesan center to comment on the reports.</TE>
<TE>   News of the incidents marks the latest in a string of accusations
linking Roman Catholic priests with sexual abuse of minors. The most
widespread allegations have been in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an American problem; it's breaking out all over the
world," said Father Elmer Wurth, pastor of St. Anne's Catholic Church
in the village of Stanley on Hong Kong Island.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had no calls to express shock, but I think people are
feeling hurt," Wurth said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Lee was not available for comment Saturday and did not return
telephone calls placed to his office. However, in Saturday's editions
of the South China Morning Post, the diocesan chancellor denied any
attempt by the church to cover up the incidents or pay families of
the victims for their silence.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the decision of victims and their families not to report
the incidents to the police, and we respected their choice," the
paper quoted Lee as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Wu's formal statement also justified the quiet handling
of the three cases, saying that "the church had always given
preference to the spirit of mercy and forgiveness." However, the
statement made clear that any future instances of child sexual abuse
would be dealt with more severely.</TE>
<TE>   "The diocesan authorities will adopt a no-tolerance policy," Wu
said. "This means any Catholic priest working in Hong Kong, once
proven to have committed even one act of sexual abuse of a minor,
shall be removed from public ministry."</TE>
<TE>   He cited new psychiatric evidence about the difficulties of
altering such behavior as the reason for the shift.</TE>
<TE>   Wurth said that he planned to distribute a one-page leaflet on the
issue to parishioners attending today's services and that he would be
available to answer questions.</TE>

<HD>Sharon's Washington Trip Will Test U.S. and Israel as
Partners</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Strategies on making peace with the Palestinians
diverge. Bush wants to speed up the negotiating process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States and Israel, allies for half a century, face a tough
test of their partnership in the Mideast peace process when President
Bush plays host to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon at the White House
this week.</LD>
<LD>   Although still firmly united in outlook, they have emerged from
events over the last month with sharply different visions of how to
end the violence that threatened to engulf the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   "Support for Israel and Sharon is as solid as it's ever been, and
there's a lot of affinity in principle, but we do diverge on several
points," said a senior State Department official involved in the
sensitive diplomacy.</LD>
<TE>   In order to inject new energy into the process, Bush has made the
bold and somewhat risky decision to accelerate it, moving swiftly to
the tough political issues of a final settlement and in effect
planning to relaunch negotiations at an international conference,
possibly as early as next month.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has also embraced an Arab initiative to recognize Israel,
offered moderate Arab leaders a role in the process and brought in
the European Union, Russia and the United Nations as partners.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon is leaving for Washington armed with a plan that he hopes
will counter Bush's proposals. According to his aides, Sharon intends
to argue, when he meets with the president Tuesday, that after 19
months of bloodshed, Israelis are unable to contemplate negotiating a
final settlement with the Palestinians for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sharon originally proposed a regionwide meeting, he
intends to tell Bush that Israel has no interest in a conference
"where Israel might find itself on one side of the table, with the
Arabs, the Europeans and God knows who else on the other side, with
only the Americans somewhere in between," said Zalman Shoval, a
former Israeli ambassador to the United States and Sharon's foreign
policy advisor.</TE>
<TE>   This "is something that Israel has always opposed, and it will not
let itself be dragged into such a thing," he added.</TE>
<TE>   While Sharon is intrigued by an eight-point Saudi Arabian plan to
end the conflict, the prime minister also will make clear his
reservations about it, aides say. He will propose instead that the
Bush administration broker talks on long-term interim arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Sharon do agree on a two-state solution to the most
critical issue. Both broke historic ground after they took office
last year by formally pledging to support the creation of a
Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. and Israeli positions diverge on the timing of that
state's creation and its size. They also disagree on what rights
Israel might have over the interim Palestinian Authority. And they
have serious differences about what should be the fate of Jewish
settlements in Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   The gap is most conspicuous regarding Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat. Bush has reluctantly concluded that Arafat
must be included in any peacemaking effort, at least for now.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a whole lot of faith in Arafat. But at the same
time, there isn't any alternative," said the senior State Department
official. "He was chosen legitimately, if not totally democratically,
by the Palestinians. We can't pick the leader. So our view is that he
needs to be pushed, and we have to rebuild the Palestinian Authority
based on democracy and transparency."</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon is bringing a 100-page dossier purporting to prove
Arafat's ties to terrorism. It includes documents the Israeli army
says were confiscated from Arafat's headquarters and other
Palestinian offices during Israel's incursion into the West Bank, as
well as purported testimony from Arafat lieutenant Marwan Barghouti,
who was captured by Israel on April 15. Israel says the material
proves Arafat financed and knew about militants' attacks on
Israelis--a charge Palestinians deny.</TE>
<TE>   The dossier underscores Sharon's goal of isolating Arafat and
finding other Palestinian leaders to work with. Israeli officials say
Sharon believes he can reshape the Palestinian Authority into
something more to his liking than the administration Arafat built
over eight years, most of which is now in ruins.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials say they plan to remind Sharon of Israel's
attempt to foster an alternative to the nationalist Palestine
Liberation Organization by encouraging Palestinians in the 1970s to
turn to their religion. One result was the growth of Hamas, one of
three extremist groups behind the recent spate of suicide bombings in
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Israel is also unwilling to comply with growing international
efforts to move quickly to a final settlement of the conflict. Sharon
plans to propose small incremental steps, with each move dependent on
the completion of the previous one. The goals include disarming
Palestinian militias, reestablishing Israeli-Palestinian security
cooperation and restoring commercial ties.</TE>
<TE>   "If we interpret correctly the administration's intentions, the
aim of both the U.S. and Israel will be to define goals and not
specific timetables," Shoval said. "It is practically impossible to
set a timetable, certainly not for permanent solutions. It would be
counterproductive to try to do so."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Sharon appears to have no intention of agreeing
to Bush's demand that Israel refrain from reentering West Bank areas
it has left. The Israeli army says such incursions are the only way
it can thwart Palestinian attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials think the results of Israel's incursion prove
that there can be no military solution to the conflict. The offensive
might even prove to have been counterproductive long-term. Militants
have been hurt, but some will be able to regroup, these officials
predict.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to reconcile the U.S. and Israeli visions will be the
"biggest challenge of Bush's foreign policy," said Geoffrey Kemp, a
National Security Council staffer during the Reagan administration.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no black-and-white issues like there were after Sept.
11, when he had the country and the world united behind him. This is
a much messier tapestry and a real test of Bush's leadership as he's
being pulled in different directions by other countries and
Congress."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials say Sharon should find the new U.S.
approach appealing.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the heads of past administrations, Bush wants a regional
process that would ultimately secure peace not just with Israel's
four immediate neighbors but with all 22 members of the Arab League.
A meeting last month between Bush and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah,
who initiated the Arab League peace offer, was "very much of a
breakthrough in building Arab support. Sharon should find this
attractive," said a senior administration official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is now determined to ensure that a new Palestinian
state is built on democratic and free-market principles.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine that Israel will not find that attractive," the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush believes that he is building an important new context for the
peace process.</TE>
<TE>   "We're certainly going to hear Sharon out, but the president has
provided a broad outline of what he thinks needs to happen, and we're
not going to back away from that," the official added.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the war on terrorism, the prism through which Bush
views the conflict differs from how it was seen by past
administrations. The president wholeheartedly backs Sharon's goal of
eliminating terrorist threats. But he thinks that quickly achieving a
political solution would provide the best hope for peace. He also has
begun to see the Arab-Israeli conflict as a threat to his global
counter-terrorism campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush is now aware that the situation in the Mideast is much more
precarious for U.S. interests than he had thought," said James Hoge,
editor of Foreign Affairs magazine. "This could be a session in which
Bush spends more time telling Sharon that he's got to get in line
with this conference, quite unlike the last time, when Sharon spent
more time educating Bush about his security problems."</TE>
<TE>   The White House has already tried to lower expectations for the
planned peace conference, which Bush on Friday labeled only a series
of meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a series of ongoing discussions to help solidify the
visions that have been expressed by not only the United States but
the Europeans--but more importantly, the visions expressed by Israel
[and] Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia," Bush said. "And so
there are going to be a lot of discussions and a lot of meetings."</TE>

<HD>Indra Devi, 102; Helped Popularize Yoga Around World</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Indra Devi, one of the first Western women to study yoga in India,
who later taught it to several Hollywood stars, has died. She was
102.</LD>
<LD>   Devi, who at 99 was still performing demanding yoga poses, died
April 25 in Buenos Aires, where she had lived and taught since the
mid-1980s. The cause of death was not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   A charismatic woman who attracted students with her gentle yet
insightful personality as much as with the form of yoga she
practiced, Devi lived and taught in India, China, the United States,
Mexico and Argentina. She brought yoga to industry, prisons and
hospitals.</LD>
<TE>   Born Eugenie Peterson in Riga, Latvia, the daughter of a Russian
noblewoman and a Swedish banking official, she attended drama schools
in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   But her academic career came to a halt when the communists came to
power in 1917. Her mother took her to Berlin, where she found roles
as a dancer and actress with a Russian touring theater.</TE>
<TE>   She became interested in India after reading poet Rabindranath
Tagore and a book on yoga that had been translated into Russian. She
later called the books transforming.</TE>
<TE>   In 1927, she traveled to India, and using the name Indra Devi,
became a star in the Indian cinema. Three years later, she met her
first husband, Jan Strakaty, the commercial attache in the
Czechoslovak consulate.</TE>
<TE>   Strakaty introduced his wife to the maharajah and maharani of
Mysore, who allowed part of their home to be used as a yoga palace.
The teacher was Sri Krishnamacharya, the Indian master whose students
included two others who would become influential yogis: BKS Iyengar
and K. Pattabhi Jois.</TE>
<TE>   Her initial efforts to become a disciple of Krishnamacharya ended
in failure. He had never had a woman in his class, much less a
Western woman, and strongly discouraged her participation.</TE>
<TE>   But he took her on as a pupil after the maharajah and maharani of
Mysore intervened on her behalf. When her husband was transferred to
Shanghai, she stayed in India for another year to continue her
studies with Krishnamacharya.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very strict with me, thinking that I would not keep up the
regime that he imposed on me," she told a writer for Yoga Journal
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the discipline, she was ordered to give up coffee, tea,
white sugar, white flour, white rice and everything in bottles and
cans. She was already a vegetarian, so giving up meat wasn't a
problem, but she later said she missed the coffee.</TE>
<TE>   She moved to Shanghai in the late 1930s and began teaching yoga
classes despite the opposition of her husband, who called the
practice nonsense, and the discouragement of the Japanese who
occupied the city starting in 1937.</TE>
<TE>   Her class grew to 70 people, and she eventually held it at the
home of Madame Chiang Kai-shek, wife of the country's ruler, who had
developed an interest in yoga, as well as in private homes in the
French Concession area.</TE>
<TE>   She also recalled years later teaching at the Metropole Hotel what
she called a "prison class," consisting of the entire staff of the
American Consulate in Shanghai, whom the Japanese held under arrest
there during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   She said the officials, who had derided the yoga classes before
they were taken into custody, embraced the practice during their
incarceration.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II, her husband returned to Czechoslovakia and she
returned to India, where she began teaching what were believed to be
the first yoga classes taught in India by a Westerner. She also wrote
the first of several books on yoga. It was thought to be the first
book on yoga published in India by a Westerner.</TE>
<TE>   She returned to Shanghai in 1946 to sell her home and possessions,
then took a boat to San Francisco, landing in early 1947. She moved
to Hollywood, where she taught such actors as Greta Garbo, Jennifer
Jones, Robert Ryan and Gloria Swanson.</TE>
<TE>   Devi dedicated one of her books to Swanson, who became a serious
practitioner and went on television on several occasions to offer
testimony to the advantages of yoga.</TE>
<TE>   Devi also taught yoga at spas run by Elizabeth Arden in Maine and
Arizona but rejected Arden's overture to join the staff, saying that
she would not work for anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "She had an early pre-feminist feminism about her," said Fernando
Pages Ruiz, a contributing editor with Yoga Journal who interviewed
her on several occasions.</TE>
<TE>   "Long before the use of 'Ms.' became popular, she bristled when
people addressed her as Miss or Mrs. She had a long career of going
to places where people couldn't go, and wanted to be treated with
respect."</TE>
<TE>   She married Dr. Sigrid Knauer, her second husband, in 1953, and
legally changed her name to Devi when she became an American citizen
several years later. Through much of the next 20 years, she lived and
taught at an 80-acre ranch in Tecate, Mexico, purchased by Knauer. He
died in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1960s, she developed a new form of yoga called Sai
yoga, inspired by her interest in the teachings of the guru Satya Sai
Baba.</TE>
<TE>   "She had a style that combined the teachings of Krishnamacharya
and a devotional style of yoga called Bhakti," Pages Ruiz said.</TE>
<TE>   "Her class was an extended prayer and devotional experience,
coupled with a sequence of standard poses of yoga."</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, she moved to Argentina, where she opened six studios
holding 15 classes a day.</TE>
<TE>   She also became something of a cultural figure in Buenos Aires,
holding court in the sitting room of her house and receiving guests
that ranged from former President Carlos Menem to the local
cabdriver.</TE>
<TE>   "She really saw your possibilities when you met her," Pages Ruiz
said. "She would see the world of opportunity in you, in what you
were going to do and accomplish. She saw meaning in life."</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yevgeny Svetlanov, 73, a renowned conductor who specialized in works
by Russian composers, died Friday at his home in Moscow of
unspecified causes.</LD>
<LD>   Svetlanov was the chief conductor of the Bolshoi Theater from 1963
to 1965, when he was named artistic director and chief conductor of
the Soviet State Symphony. Known as a leading interpreter of Russian
symphony, ballet and opera music, he was named a People's Artist of
the Soviet Union in 1968 and was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1972 and
the Order of Lenin in 1978. He received the Soviet State Prize for
creative achievement in 1983.</LD>
<LD>   But two years ago, Svetlanov was dismissed from the State Symphony
after Culture Minister Mikhail Shvydkoi said he was spending too much
time conducting overseas. For the past two years, Svetlanov has been
an honorary conductor at the Bolshoi and a guest conductor around the
world, particularly in the Netherlands.</LD>
<TE>   Trained at the Gnesin Institute of Music, he became known as a
pianist, then moved on to composing and conducting. He graduated from
the Moscow Conservatory in 1955 in all three musical specialties.</TE>

<LD>Edna Mae Robinson, 86, the ex-wife of boxing great "Sugar Ray"
Robinson and a one-time performer at Harlem's famous Cotton Club,
died Thursday at her home in New York. The cause of death was not

Advancement of Colored People, and supported several charities and
educational projects benefiting the black community. Calling on her
experience as a Cotton Club performer, Francis Ford Coppola brought
Robinson in as a historical advisor on his film "Cotton Club."</TE>
<TE>   While working in the club, she was famed for dancing atop a huge
drum.</TE>

<LD>United Airlines Flight 862 finally made it to San Francisco after
three aborted attempts. It was two days late.</LD>
<LD>   The plane left Sydney, Australia, on Wednesday and had to make an
emergency landing in Auckland, New Zealand, after several passengers
were injured by severe turbulence.</LD>
<LD>   Passengers sat on the ground for four hours Thursday after the
pilot thought he heard noises in the landing gear.</LD>
<TE>   Another plane tried to complete the trip, but turned back after
being in the air only an hour.</TE>
<TE>   An airline spokeswoman said the problem had to do with the plane's
air conditioning, but passengers said the pilot announced that it was
a serious mechanical problem.</TE>
<TE>   A fourth flight left Auckland and made it to San Francisco without
incident Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the 269 passengers from the original flight had made other
arrangements, and were not aboard the plane that carried 200 people

<LD>As the father of a missing 2-year-old boy issued a tearful plea
Saturday for his return, police and volunteers spent another futile
day digging through the city landfill for clues to the disappearance
of Jahi Turner.</LD>
<LD>   The boy was reported missing April 25 by his stepfather, Tieray
Jones, who lives in San Diego with the boy's mother, Tameka Jones, a
Navy sailor.</LD>
<LD>   Police are treating the case as a kidnapping.</LD>
<TE>   Jahi's father, Tremaine Sampson of Maryland, came to San Diego to
thank the dozens of volunteers who have searched for the boy, but was
overcome by emotion while trying to read a statement asking that the
boy's abductor let him go.</TE>

Tieray Jones says he took Jahi on the day he disappeared.</TE>

<HD>Christians Split Over Conflict in the Mideast</HD>
<DH>Religion: Liberal Jews find themselves allied with
conservative evangelical believers. Standoff at Bethlehem church adds
to tension.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mideast conflict is deepening a schism in the Christian Church
between staunch supporters of Israel, who see Jews as God's chosen
people battling for their Promised Land, and those concerned that the
Jewish state's treatment of Palestinians violates Judaism's core
values of justice.</LD>
<LD>   In recent days, Christians from both camps have unleashed a
barrage of dueling messages on the Mideast--backed by their own
selective readings of biblical commands about Israel. Evangelical
Christian supporters of Israel cite God's promises to Abraham of land
and divine assurances that God would "curse those who curse" Jews.
Those more troubled by Israeli actions focus on biblical railings
that the chosen people would be "utterly destroyed" and the land
would "vomit" them out if they failed to remain righteous and keep
God's commands.</LD>
<LD>   The intensifying debate has cast the nation's generally liberal
Jews into an odd alliance with conservative evangelical believers and
has strained relations with their more natural Christian allies.
Those tensions are growing, as the recent violence at the Jenin
refugee camp and the standoff at the Church of the Nativity in
Bethlehem have fixated Christian attention on the Holy Land.</LD>
<TE>   Church leaders in Jerusalem and a stream of Christian visitors to
the Holy Land have sent out increasingly distressful e-mails from the
scene--many of them highly critical of Israeli military actions--to
millions of believers worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Far more than the Catholic Church sex scandals, the Mideast crisis
is now the No. 1 concern among evangelical Christians, according to
Richard Land of the 16million-member Southern Baptist Convention, the
nation's largest Protestant denomination.</TE>
<TE>   In his frequent travels to Baptist churches throughout the nation,
Land said he is constantly asked to relay messages to President Bush
not to "abandon Israel" in his effort to secure peace in the Mideast.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very, very important to evangelicals that the U.S. continue
to back Israel," said Land, president of the Baptist convention's
ethics committee. "The Bible Belt is Israel's safety belt."</TE>
<TE>   White evangelical Protestants support Israel more strongly than
the general American public--64% versus 49% in one recent national
poll. In part, their support stems from personal religious beliefs
that Jews need to be restored to the Promised Land before the second
coming of Jesus can occur.</TE>
<TE>   These advocates have taken a high-profile campaign for Israel to
cyberspace, TV and the mass mails. Land and other evangelical leaders
recently issued a letter to Bush decrying rising anti-Semitism and
what they described as a campaign to "blame the Jews." Pat Robertson,
chairman of the Christian Broadcasting Network, is featuring
"teachings" on his home page that affirm Jewish rights to the
disputed land and castigate recent U.S.-led resolution of support for
a Palestinian state by the United Nations Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   In passing the resolution, Robertson wrote, the U.N. "said we
don't believe the word of God. We will reverse it, and the United
States led the way to say we want to take East Jerusalem back from
the Jewish nation in defiance of the words of Jesus Christ."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson added that such events were forecast in the Bible.
Quoting the prophet Zecharia warning of a time when Israel would be
attacked by all nations of the world, bringing forth the Lord to
battle for Jerusalem, Robertson urged Americans to "begin to pray."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, meanwhile, has posted a "Keep Jerusalem
Free" petition on his Web site that says, in part: "Palestinian
terror MUST stop.... Arafat and his militant Palestinian groups must
never be allowed to claim Jerusalem as their own."</TE>
<TE>   Passions on the other side are just as intense. In Southern
California, 83 leaders, most Christian, recently brought a letter to
Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) asking Congress for a more "balanced"
Mideast policy.</TE>
<TE>   The letter, signed by leaders from Catholic, Presbyterian,
Episcopal, Methodist and other mainline denominations, called the
Israeli occupation "illegal and unjustifiable" and blamed it for
escalating the violence. (Schiff said he told the group that it was
the Palestinian suicide bombings that had devastated the peace
process and that there was "no moral equivalency" between those
terrorist acts and Israel defense forces' actions.)</TE>
<TE>   Several Christians participated in a recent silent vigil in
Pasadena's Old Town, where more than 100 people brandished signs and
passed out fliers calling for justice for Palestinians. At one
corner, evangelical scholar Mark Harlan told a curious passerby that
Palestinians had lost hope, and were forced to resort to suicide
bombings because "they don't have F-16s" like the Israeli military.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, fanatical Islam springs up when you have this
oppression and people feel desperate and see no other option," said
Harlan, who explained that his once-hawkish views supporting Israel
had been transformed by several years in Jordan teaching theology to
Arab Christians.</TE>
<TE>   Glen Stassen, a Fuller Theological Seminary professor in Pasadena,
called Harlan a "symbol of the change" occurring among many
Christians, who he said seem to be rethinking their traditional
one-sided support of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is an awakening and growing distress about what
Israel is doing with its army and with the settlements because of the
messages that the church in Israel is sending out," said Stassen, who
also considers himself an evangelical Christian.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the Episcopal Church Web site is carrying links to
diaries from its churches in Nablus and Ramallah describing massive
Israeli destruction of the communities there.</TE>
<TE>   "They continue to destroy everything in their way including
valuable documents, archives, research work, medical and dental
clinics .... In short, they are destroying the Palestinian
people--their identity, their culture and their memory," said one
April 20 letter from St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Stassen, a professor of Christian ethics and author of "Just
Peacemaking," argued that God did not give Israel the land
unconditionally, but warned that unless people acted with justice,
they would be punished with war and exile. "The greatness of Israel
is the commitment to justice for the oppressed, and many Jews are now
really concerned that they are losing their identity because of the
violence," Stassen said.</TE>
<TE>   Such views provoke withering retorts from people like Land, who
called Stassen a "neo-evangelical" and his biblical views "silly
nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   "God does not make conditional covenants," Land declared.</TE>
<TE>   On the national level, another letter on the Mideast was issued
last week by a delegation from the National Council of the Churches
of Christ in the USA, which represents 50 million believers in 36
Protestant, Anglican and Orthodox denominations.</TE>
<TE>   The delegation, which recently returned from a trip to the
Mideast, called on both sides to end the violence. But the group said
it was "alarmed" over what it called Israel's "intentional
destruction of Palestinian civil society."</TE>
<TE>   It called on the Jewish state to end its occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza, dismantle settlements and address the Palestinian
refugee problem. The statement also called for a shared Jerusalem and
Palestinian affirmation of Israel's right to exist within secure
borders.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in a widely circulated commentary published last week,
Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa expressed distress that
Israeli Jews who had experienced the iniquities of the Holocaust were
now subjecting Palestinians to a humiliation that reminded him of his
homeland's apartheid policies.</TE>
<TE>   "Such reactions have frustrated many American Jews, who question
why their progressive friends seem to have left them with
fundamentalists as Israel's strongest Christian allies. The generally
liberal American Jewish community is often at odds with evangelicals
over such issues as prayer in public schools, end-times prophecies
and proselytizing."Many liberal Jews are uncomfortable, if not
offended, with having these fundamentalist Christians be the only
Christian friends of Israel, and their motives in my mind are highly
suspect," said Rabbi Lawrence Goldmark of Temple Beth Ohr in La
Mirada, a Reform Jew and past president of the Board of Rabbis of
Southern California. "But at tough times, you've got to take your
friends wherever you can get them."</TE>
<TE>   On the Orthodox side, however, Rabbi Yitzchok Adlerstein of Loyola
Law School in Los Angeles said he was gratified by the evangelical
support. He criticized their more liberal Christian brethren for
"making an icon of left-leaning Western values and putting that ahead
of the Judeo-Christian ethic of good and evil."</TE>
<TE>   "People with as much blood on their hands as the church can't
point fingers," Adlerstein said.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty of bridging the divides among faith communities was
illustrated by a recent failed attempt to draft an interfaith
statement on the Mideast by the Rev. Ed Bacon of All Saints Church in
Pasadena, a liberal Episcopal congregation. Among other things, the
statement faulted the Israel occupation as the primary source of
violence, and failed to get even liberal members from the Progressive
Jewish Alliance to sign on.</TE>
<TE>   "There are political and emotional land mines on both sides that
just set people off," Bacon said. "It's a matter now of learning
where they are."</TE>

<HD>New Drug Tunnel Found at Border</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexican federal agents discovered a drug tunnel near the beach
between Tijuana and San Diego, Mexico's federal attorney general's
office said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The tunnel, which appeared to run under the metal fence dividing
the two countries, was discovered Friday, attorney general spokesman
Abraham Sarabia said. It was originally built near Tijuana's beach to
get rid of extra water from a nearby and now unused water treatment
plant.</LD>
<LD>   The 80-foot-long tunnel contained recent handprints and cart
tracks, indicating it was likely used to sneak drugs or possibly
illegal immigrants to the United States, Sarabia said. However, most
border tunnels are used only to move drugs.</LD>
<TE>   Sarabia said the tunnel was near a residential area along Mexico's
Pacific coast and was more than 3 feet wide and 30 inches tall.</TE>
<TE>   He said U.S. officials had been notified of the tunnel, which will
be sealed.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fifth tunnel discovered in recent months along the
U.S.-Mexico border.</TE>
<TE>   In March, American drug agents discovered a tunnel the length of
four football fields with electricity and ventilation pipes. The
agents said smugglers probably used it for at least three years to
transport marijuana and cocaine. The agents also found 500 pounds of
marijuana at the U.S. end of the tunnel, which was beneath the border
in eastern San Diego County.</TE>

<HD>5 Men Hurt in Tustin When Van Hits Tree</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five men were injured Saturday, three of them critically, when their
minivan jumped the median of a major Tustin thoroughfare and smashed
into a tree, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The men, all believed to be over 50, were traveling on Tustin
Ranch Road just south of Rawlings Way when the van crashed about 6:07
p.m., police and fire officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Nineteen firefighters and rescuers arrived within minutes and cut
into the 1989 Ford Windstar to extract the driver and front
passenger.</LD>
<TE>   One of the victims was airlifted to UCI Medical Center in Orange,
where he was listed in critical condition, said Capt. Stephen Miller
of the Orange County Fire Authority. Police said the man suffered a
punctured spleen and head injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Two others, also in critical condition, were rushed to Western
Medical Center-Santa Ana, fire officials said. The remaining two
passengers were listed in moderate condition at Mission Hospital
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were unsure what caused the van to crash. The van
was southbound on Tustin Ranch Road when it struck a curb and lurched
onto the parkway, hitting the tree.</TE>
<TE>   The accident "doesn't appear to be alcohol-related," said Tustin
Police Sgt. Tom Tarpley. "Witnesses at the scene said the vehicle was
going about 50 mph, which is not dangerous for that stretch of road."</TE>

<HD>Bush Salutes Mexican Holiday</HD>
<DH>Politics: President uses Cinco de Mayo message to back
measures aiding immigrants. Democrats call it mere symbolism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Reaching out to Mexicans on both sides of the Rio Grande, President
Bush on Saturday honored the Cinco de Mayo holiday and praised
immigrants whose hard work and family ties enrich America.</LD>
<LD>   In his weekly radio address, Bush renewed his pledge to help "the
entire American familia achieve prosperity and live in peace."</LD>
<LD>   He said that people on both the U.S. and Mexican sides of the Rio
Grande value independence, freedom and opportunity. He cited Mexican
immigrants for their "strong values and their determination to create
a better life for themselves and their children."</LD>
<TE>   Bush worked with measurable success to win Latino votes in his
2000 presidential campaign, and he is the first president to follow
his weekly radio speeches with a Spanish translation.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, whose party traditionally received strong support in
the Latino community, dismiss Bush's overtures to Spanish-speaking
voters as more symbolic than real.</TE>
<TE>   The radio broadcast was Bush's second annual commemoration of the
Mexican national holiday, which is today.</TE>
<TE>   Cinco de Mayo--the fifth of May--celebrates the victory of Mexican
soldiers over the French at the 1862 Battle of Puebla.</TE>
<TE>   "That victory continues to inspire liberty-loving people across
the globe," Bush said. "It reminds us that the cost of freedom is
always high, but it is never too high."</TE>
<TE>   Bush renewed his support for border reforms to speed commerce and
visitors between Mexico and the United States while keeping out
terrorists and drug traffickers. He urged Congress to extend
immigration measures allowing Mexican families to stay together while
awaiting permanent residency in the United States.</TE>

<HD>Cable Flap Scratches Yankee Games From TV Lineup</HD>
<DH>Sports: Baseball lovers in the Bronx are driven to drink at
bars equipped with satellites while YES network blocks televised
games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Yankee Tavern in the Bronx has everything a Yankees baseball fan
could want: huge, sepia-toned photos of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe
DiMaggio and other Yankee greats; big-screen TVs in every corner;
even a pinstripe pattern on the tile floor to echo the famous
uniforms.</LD>
<LD>   Then there's the location: Open the tavern's door when the team is
in town--as it is this weekend--and you can hear the roar from Yankee
Stadium a block down 161st Street.</LD>
<LD>   But owner Joe Bastone said the place would be empty on game days
if he hadn't shelled out $3,000 last month to have a satellite TV
dish installed.</LD>
<TE>   On the home turf of the Bronx Bombers, most fans can't see the
team on television because of a dispute between YES, the new Yankees
Entertainment &amp; Sports Network, and Cablevision, the cable company
that up until last year had the contract to carry Yankee games.</TE>
<TE>   Cablevision, with nearly 3 million subscribers in metro New
York--including slices of nearby New Jersey and Connecticut--is
balking at YES's terms for airing Yankee games: a fee of about $2 per
subscriber plus a requirement that the games be included in
Cablevision's basic subscription package, to reach the widest
possible audience.</TE>
<TE>   Cablevision offered to carry YES as a premium channel for those
willing to pay an extra charge. But YES said no, so the standoff
continues as baseball season enters its sixth week.</TE>
<TE>   YES contends that Cablevision has lost as many as 50,000
subscribers to satellite TV since the dispute began. Cablevision puts
the number at 5,400.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of who's right, bars that cater to a sports crowd have
felt pressured to get satellite hookups. The payoff is more walk-in
traffic from locals who don't get the games at home. Bastone is
seeing twice as many game-time customers than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   At the Out of Bounds Sports Bar in suburban North Tarrytown, N.Y.,
by contrast, there is no dish and no Yankees, as the business
undergoes an ownership change.</TE>
<TE>   "Even my regulars are going across the street," bartender Doug
Tornello said.</TE>
<TE>   There is another Major League team in New York, and its games are
widely televised, but the Mets have always run a distant second to
the Yankees in popularity.</TE>
<TE>   The TV stalemate has been publicized as a personal clash between
George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, and Charles F.
Dolan, founder and chairman of Long Island-based Cablevision. But
business is business, so the two sides are sniping away at each other
in ads on their networks, in the courtroom and in the press, where
Steinbrenner's antics are catnip for New York's feisty tabloids.</TE>
<TE>   Enlisting star lawyer David Boies, who led the Justice
Department's antitrust case against Microsoft, YES last week filed a
federal antitrust suit accusing Cablevision of trying to use its
regional monopoly power to crush the fledgling network. The 52-page
court complaint is a litany of Cablevision's alleged anti-competitive
sins, such as using acquisitions to reinforce its local dominance and
lock up the TV rights to most of New York's other pro sports teams.</TE>
<TE>   (In a different context, it might be a kind of business behavior
that Steinbrenner could admire, considering the Yanks' venerable
tradition of swooping down on financially weaker teams to pluck their
best players.)</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, Cablevision sniffed, is "entirely without merit."</TE>
<TE>   Fordham University law professor Mark Conrad is inclined to agree.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a business problem, not a legal problem," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have their heels dug in so deeply, however, that
experts don't expect a resolution before All-Star break in July, if
then.</TE>
<TE>   Advertising man and Yankee partisan Joe Dell'Aquila is irate that
the Yankees have gone dark at his home, just across the state line in
Stamford, Conn. So far, the situation hasn't driven him to drink, but
when the pennant race heats up this summer, Dell'Aquila will probably
head for a sports bar.</TE>
<TE>   Because he lives in New England, nominally the domain of the
Yankees' arch rivals, the Boston Red Sox, Dell'Aquila's Cablevision
package carries a full slate of Red Sox games. But mindful of the
Sox' history of torment at the hands of the perennial champion
Yankees, Dell'Aquila won't deign to tune in.</TE>

<HD>GAO to Check Post-9/11 Aid Efforts</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Several senators have asked congressional investigators to review the
Federal Emergency Management Agency's response to the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks after complaints surfaced about how the agency
determines aid eligibility.</LD>
<LD>   The General Accounting Office review is expected to look at the
eligibility issue as well as at how much the government expects to
spend on aid efforts.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to try to get to the bottom of some of the stories and
complaints we've been receiving about the interpretation FEMA has
been using to determine who receives benefits," Sen. Hillary Rodham
Clinton (D-N.Y.) said Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   She pointed out that there "doesn't seem to be a lot of rationale
that explains why one group is eligible and another isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, FEMA Director Joseph Allbaugh said the agency planned
to reopen more than 7,000 applications from people whose requests for
mortgage and rental assistance were denied.</TE>
<TE>   The change occurred after reports that FEMA has distributed less
direct aid to people affected economically by the terrorist attacks
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon than it has in other major
disasters.</TE>
<TE>   About $65 million has gone out since Sept. 11, compared with $1.4
billion after the Northridge earthquake in 1994 and $1 billion after
Hurricane Georges in Puerto Rico in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   FEMA officials have said they are somewhat constrained by
eligibility rules set by federal law.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers have moved to clarify any eligibility questions in
federal laws.</TE>

<DH>Cockfighting: Trying to close a loophole, lawmakers bet on
a farm bill making it a crime to take game roosters over state lines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For three years the battle raged. On one side, two former senators
were hired as high-powered lobbyists. On the other, law enforcement
organizations were recruited across the nation to take up the cause.</LD>
<LD>   All over cockfighting.</LD>
<LD>   A seemingly simple proposition--close a loophole in federal law
that allows cockfighting to thrive, even though it is illegal in all
but three states--proved anything but simple to pass.</LD>
<TE>   The anti-cockfighting provision finally is headed for approval, as
part of the massive farm bill that President Bush has pledged to
sign. But the battle over the little-noticed plank in the bill
illustrates how disputes over narrow interests can escalate into big
struggles in Washington, engaging all of the high-stakes tactics of
major party collisions and winding up in the middle of serious
legislative business.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a commentary on the legislative process," said Rep. Earl
Blumenauer (D-Ore.).</TE>
<TE>   The measure is straightforward enough: It would make it a federal
offense to take fighting roosters across state lines.</TE>
<TE>   Cockfighting is illegal in all but three states: Louisiana,
Oklahoma and parts of New Mexico. But cockfighting has remained a law
enforcement problem throughout the country, despite decades-old laws
against it in most states.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials say people are able to skirt the
cockfighting bans by claiming that game birds in their possession are
set to be shipped to one of the three states--or foreign
countries--where cockfighting is permitted. Once the farm bill
becomes law--perhaps as soon as this week--they will have "no excuse"
to possess game birds in states where cockfighting is illegal, said
Wayne Pacelle, lobbyist for the Humane Society of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In cockfighting, roosters with razor-sharp knives or needle-sharp
gaffs strapped to their legs are pumped full of stimulants, put into
a pit and made to claw each other until one is dead.</TE>
<TE>   California has banned cockfighting since 1905. But just last
month, Ventura County authorities seized nearly five dozen roosters
in a raid on a cockfighting operation. Cockfights also have been
raided this year in New York, Philadelphia and Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such crackdowns, cockfighting has a considerable
following, with numerous Web sites and magazines such as Grit and
Steel and Feathered Warrior devoted to the subject.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very large industry," said Sandy Johnson, director of
administration for the United Gamefowl Breeders Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "If the birds cannot be shipped for fighting purposes," she added,
"then the industry is dead."</TE>
<TE>   When the measure to ban such transportation was introduced in
early 1999, proponents figured it would win speedy approval. It
enjoyed bipartisan sponsorship. Its authors were Sen. Wayne Allard
(R-Colo.), a veterinarian, and Rep. Collin C. Peterson (D-Minn.),
whose office is decorated with hunting trophies, including a prairie
chicken.</TE>
<TE>   The lawmakers had confidence in the logic of their arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Under current law, Allard said, "There is no way for law
enforcement officers to determine if someone really is transporting
the birds or if the cockfight will be held right down the road."</TE>
<TE>   The measure's supporters were buoyed when more than 200 House
members and 60 senators--Democrats and Republicans alike--signed on
as co-sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   What they didn't anticipate was the buzz saw of opposition they
would encounter.</TE>
<TE>   Two little-known groups--the Ohio-based United Gamefowl Breeders
Assn. and the Texas-based American Animal Husbandry
Coalition--mounted aggressive campaigns to defeat the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   They spent $300,000 on lobbyists, including two former senators,
J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) and Steve Symms (R-Idaho), according to
congressional records.</TE>
<TE>   They packed one congressional hearing with 300 breeders, arguing
that the measure would deprive struggling farmers of a way to
supplement their incomes. They also portrayed the measure as an
attack on a misunderstood part of the rural lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is basically rural versus urban," said Bobby Jones,
president of the American Animal Husbandry Coalition, who raises
about 400 fighting birds annually at his poultry farm 30 miles west
of Waco, Texas. "I don't expect people who are raised on microwave
dinners and go to movies on weekends to understand what goes on in a
rural setting."</TE>
<TE>   A number of lawmakers, mostly from the South, quietly worked
against the measure. They criticized the measure as federal intrusion
on a matter that should be decided by states.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Zell Miller (D-Ga.), one of the few lawmakers to publicly
speak out against the proposal, last year said, "This isn't about
cockfighting. It's about the proper role of the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the federal government's job was to suppress
insurrections, repel invasions, declare war ... not to stop folks
from hauling chickens across state lines."</TE>
<TE>   Sean Conway, an aide to Allard, said most lawmakers opposed to the
measure often worked behind closed doors because they were reluctant
to be seen as publicly defending cockfighting. That made it more
challenging to rebut them, Conway said.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent a lot of time shadowboxing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the measure fought back by threatening to force a
roll call vote that would force opponents to come out into the open.</TE>
<TE>   "People came up to me and begged me not to have a roll call vote,"
Blumenauer said.</TE>
<TE>   The Humane Society of the United States told lawmakers their votes
would appear in a report card sent to voters at election time.</TE>
<TE>   When the measure came to the House floor last fall, it passed on a
voice vote.</TE>
<TE>   It became a hotly debated issue in negotiations over the
multibillion-dollar farm bill, even though the game fowl industry is
minuscule compared to other segments of agribusiness.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, lawmakers opposed to the measure gave up the fight
because they didn't think it was worth the political risk, said
Pacelle, the Humane Society's senior vice president of government
affairs. He said lawmakers figured, "Do I want to have my public
persona attached to defending cockfighting?"</TE>
<TE>   Some of the measure's supporters, however, are angry that
opponents succeeded in making its penalty a misdemeanor instead of a
felony.</TE>
<TE>   But Pacelle said he considers the measure's expected passage a
"very important victory in stamping out a practice that we consider
absolutely odious and indefensible."</TE>
<TE>   And, he said proponents plan to introduce a measure seeking to
restore the felony penalties and to make it a federal crime to take
across state lines paraphernalia used in cockfighting.</TE>
<TE>   Pacelle said he believes the measure ran into opposition in part
because some farm-state lawmakers have a "reflexive antagonism" to
the Humane Society and animal welfare issues.</TE>
<TE>   "You had members behind the scenes who were saying, 'Why are we
dealing with this?'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   "To the ag people, a chicken is a chicken. This whole process has
been a huge learning experience for me."</TE>

<HD>Flood Puts Town in Rebuild Mode</HD>
<DH>Appalachia: The second inundation since July also has some
residents of mountain community talking about pulling up stakes and
moving.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NORTHFORK, W.Va.</DL>
<LD>For the second time in 10 months, residents of the Appalachian coal
towns along the Tug Fork river were digging out from a devastating
flood Saturday and talking about rebuilding their lives and homes and
businesses.</LD>
<LD>   "We're tough people up here in the mountains, but we're getting
tired of this," said Marvin Cochran, 45. "I'll put things back
together again because this has always been home. But my father says
he's getting out, if we can get his trailer off the hill."</LD>
<LD>   Near an emergency center where Cochran had come for bottled water,
the river still gurgled with high, muddy water. "At least it's
started going down," he said. Then he looked at the heavy dark clouds
overhead and added, "Those clouds let loose and she'll come right
back up."</LD>
<TE>   Tug Fork, which separates West Virginia and Kentucky, crested
Friday at nearly 20 feet above flood stage after a night of heavy
rain. The overflow rushed through the little towns stretched out
along Route 52--just as had happened last July--and left in its wake
a sense of weariness among people who for generations have entrusted
their fate to God, nature and the coal companies.</TE>
<TE>   "You really admire the resilience of people like this," said Capt.
Sandra Mullins of the Salvation Army as she handed out ham salad
sandwiches. "But you look in their faces and you see the sadness and
the tiredness. They were just recovering from the last flood."</TE>
<TE>   After the last one, the state began investigating whether new coal
mining practices were to blame for the intensity of the flooding. In
the last 10 years, coal companies have been shearing off mountaintops
to get to coal and piling the leftover rock and dirt into valleys,
forever altering the region's topography.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said this flood, which also touched part of Virginia and
Kentucky, killed at least five people. Rescue crews were searching
door to door for a dozen missing.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the towns, like Northfork (population 591), were
temporarily isolated when landslides cut Route 52. By Saturday, crews
with bulldozers and shovels had reopened the road. The National Guard
was helping with the cleanup and search operations.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd taken time off and spent three months repairing my mother's
home after the last flood," said Mike Boyd, 38. "Now this. Her home
is a wreck. ... Even my late father's '88 Cadillac was swept away. I
can't take time off again."</TE>
<TE>   On Northfork's main street--littered with plastic bags, tree limbs
and debris carried by the flood--the town's funeral director, Mike
Widener, had installed a steel door after the last flood to protect a
display of 25 caskets in his basement. The contractor had guaranteed
not a drop of water would get in.</TE>
<TE>   The steel door splintered Friday and the caskets were destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Widener's recently remodeled ground floor office was spared, and
Saturday, as though unsure what to do next, Widener was cleaning his
desk with a feather duster.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost everything the first time ... But I'll start over. Of
course, I will. In Appalachia, it seems we're always doing that."</TE>
<TE>   That's what people tried to do when the coal companies pulled back
from these towns in the 1970s. The scars are evident: empty store
fronts, hotels turned into residences for the elderly, abandoned car
dealerships, the faded words "Montgomery Ward" on the side of a
building.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, though, there is a sound that harks back to more
prosperous times. It came Saturday, just as Widener was dusting --a
lonely wail that reaches up the hollows, then the rumble of Northfork
Southern Railroad engines, snaking out of the mountains, bound for
Roanoke, Va., with a mile-long procession of loaded coal cars.</TE>
<TE>   It is a reminder that life goes on.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush gave reporters here a look Saturday at
"what life is really like inside the Bush White House," showing off
his collection of "actual, never-seen-before photos."</LD>
<LD>   One of the good things about life in the mansion is that his wife,
Laura, is always on hand to help him out, he said displaying a
photograph of the first lady standing with her hands on each side of
his face.</LD>
<LD>   "Here she is helping me pronounce 'Azerbaijani,'" said Bush, who
is known to sometimes stumble over long words.</LD>
<TE>   Bush and top members of his administration mingled with reporters
and other Washington insiders at the annual White House
Correspondents dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Comedian Drew Carey was on hand to provide the entertainment
during the more than three-hour event, doing stand-up comedy for the
president and more than 1,800 guests, including White House advisor
Karl Rove and rock star Ozzy Osbourne.</TE>
<TE>   Bush noted that Carey is the host of a television show that "is
totally improvised."</TE>
<TE>   "Drew," the president said, "got any interest in the Middle East?"</TE>
<TE>   Osbourne and his wife, Sharon, were the guests of Fox News' Greta
Van Susteren. The couple and two of their three children are stars of
the hit MTV reality show, "The Osbournes," which chronicles the
family's home life.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about Ozzy is, he's made a lot of big hit
recordings--'Party With the Animals,' 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,' 'Face
in Hell,' 'Black Skies' and 'Bloodbath in Paradise,'" the president
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ozzy. Your mom loves your stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The correspondents dinner, in its 88th year, has become an
occasion for self-deprecating humor from presidents. Last year, Bush
presented a slide show of his family accompanied by a joke-riddled
speech about the 2000 presidential election recount.</TE>
<TE>   The year before, President Clinton put together a farewell video
in which he pretended to be at loose ends in the final lame-duck
months of his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Honored guests included the winners of the White House
Correspondents Assn.'s annual journalism awards. Most of the winning
entries were about the terrorist attacks last year on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The Edgar A. Poe Award went to four Newsweek journalists--Evan
Thomas, Mark Hosenball, Martha Brant and Roy Gutman--for their
reporting on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The association was formed in 1914 as a liaison between the press
and the president. Every president since Calvin Coolidge has attended
the group's annual dinner.</TE>

<HD>Waste Plan Under Attack</HD>
<DH>Politics: Democrats criticize Republicans for forging ahead
with a Nevada nuclear dump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Democrats used their weekly radio address Saturday to
lash out against the Bush administration's plan to store the nation's
nuclear waste at Nevada's Yucca Mountain.</LD>
<LD>   "The state of Nevada has vetoed this plan ... but now the
president and the Republican leadership in Congress have indicated
that they are going to move ahead with the plan anyway," said Rep.
Shelley Berkley (D-Nev.).</LD>
<LD>   The Democrats' decision to use their radio platform to press the
issue--the latest move in a furious campaign on both sides of the
debate --appears to reflect the position of Democratic Party leaders,
however, more than the anticipated votes of the party's rank and
file.</LD>
<TE>   Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican, last month vetoed the
federal plan to ship 77,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste from
across the nation for storage at Yucca, about 90 miles northwest of
Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   A House committee voted, 41 to 6, to override Guinn's veto, and 17
Democrats voted with the majority. The six opposed were all
Democrats, including three from California. The House is expected to
back the White House plan by a wide margin when it comes to a vote,
likely this week.</TE>
<TE>   Those opposed to the Yucca site believe their best chance for
success lies in the Senate, where 51 votes to uphold Guinn's veto
would kill the plan. President Bush in February signed off on the
Yucca Mountain plan, saying it was "important for our national
security and our energy future."</TE>
<TE>   Those opposed to using Yucca Mountain warn that it sits in an
earthquake zone. They caution against going forward with the plan
before all scientific studies are completed.</TE>
<TE>   "An even more devastating incident would be a terrorist attack,"
Berkley said in Saturday's address. "We already know that Al Qaeda
and other terrorist groups are looking for a 'dirty bomb.' These
waste transports are exactly the type of target-rich environment they
are looking for."</TE>
<TE>   To get the votes needed to block the plan, the anti-Yucca forces
have said they would need to sway about 15 senators. They have
conceded that the task will be difficult, despite having Nevada
Democrat Harry Reid, who serves as whip, leading their side.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-Yucca effort suffered a serious setback in March when
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who had vowed to use
procedural delays to block it if necessary, learned that a statute
regarding votes in nuclear matters barred him from doing so.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks lobbying by both sides has intensified.</TE>
<TE>   Public Citizen, a Washington-based advocacy group, on Friday
chided staff members from 22 congressional offices for taking part
this weekend in a trip to Las Vegas sponsored by the Nuclear Energy
Institute. The trip, they said, includes a visit to the site, as well
as a stay at the Four Seasons Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not hear Public Citizen whining when the publisher of the
Las Vegas Sun [who is opposed to the plan] was overnighting in the
Lincoln Bedroom when President Clinton was in office," said NEI
spokesman Steve Kerekes. In 2000, Clinton vetoed a Republican-led
bill designating Yucca Mountain as the nuclear waste repository.</TE>

<KH>ORANGE COUNTY COMMENTARY</KH>
<HD>State Needs to Rein In Accountants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOU CORREA</AU>
<BD>Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim) represents the 69th
District and chairs the Assembly's Business and Profession Committee,
overseeing the State Board of Accountancy.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the 1930s, the regulation of accountants has been a shared
federal-state responsibility. The Securities and Exchange Commission
provides federal regulation, and state regulatory boards license
accountants and enforce state laws.</LD>
<LD>   Recently, these governmental bodies have been criticized for
failing to do their jobs. For more than a decade, accountancy has
been undergoing a profound evolution, which has led to a decrease in
government regulation and an increase in self-regulation. Critics
maintain self-regulation has translated into no regulation, creating
an environment in the accounting profession similar to that for
energy companies that resulted in huge profits for Enron at the
expense of California ratepayers.</LD>
<LD>   For example, in 1997, California passed a law permitting
accountants to receive commissions for referring products or services
to a client. The following year, a law was passed allowing
nonaccounting businesses (that is, a stock brokerage) to have an
ownership interest in a California accounting firm. Consumer groups
and many accountants are deeply concerned.</LD>
<TE>   Allowing California accountants to receive commissions creates
excessive profit motives that can impair their objectivity. In
addition, when a nonaccounting business has an ownership interest in
an accounting firm, there is the potential for conflicts of interest
and incentives to "churn" clients between businesses. Self-regulation
and the Enron and Andersen debacle recently prompted the legislature
to hold a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose was to explore reforms of corporate audits and
accounting methods to help protect Californians from future audit
failures, and enhance the image of the accounting profession in the
state. Participants included the Society of California Accountants,
the California Board of Accountancy and other leading experts.
Shockingly, the largest accounting firms refused to participate in
the hearing. It appears that the "Big Five" have decided to embark on
a well-known political strategy--hunker down until this all blows
over.</TE>
<TE>   They should rethink their strategy for three reasons. First, the
members of their profession deserve better. Second, the citizens of
California deserve better. Third, this is not going to blow over for
the millions of investors. One out of every two adults in the United
States owns stock, directly or indirectly. In order to make sound
investments, audited financial statements must be truthful and
accurate.</TE>
<TE>   We invest for our retirement and for our children's education.
Californians cannot afford to let this issue disappear. The number of
corporate financial "restatements" resulting from bad audits has
climbed dramatically, from a low of three in 1983 to more than 200 in
the year 2000. The real effect of these restatements was a loss in
market value of more than $31 billion in the year 2000 alone.</TE>
<TE>   Accordingly, the legislature has decided to take action. Rather
than allowing accounting firms to continue on their present path of
self-regulation, it will be considering several proposals aimed at
protecting investors and strengthening professional standards for the
accounting industry. The end result will help California investors as
well as the accounting profession.</TE>

<HD>Why Kline Should Resign</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART P. JASPER</AU>
<BD>Stuart P. Jasper, an Irvine lawyer, is a former chair
of the Orange County Bar Assn. Judiciary Committee. These are solely
his views.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The debate over whether Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline may
withdraw his name from the ballot has obscured a more basic issue.
When should a judge charged with a crime resign? Before we answer,
some background on judicial selection may be helpful.</LD>
<LD>   Today, about half the states appoint their judges, and about half
elect them. Two-thirds use commission plans to aid the governor in
choosing judges. In California, trial court judges initially are
appointed by the governor when seats become available during the
course of an incumbent judge's term. The other route to the bench is
direct election, when an incumbent declines to run again, or less
frequently, is defeated. Judges stand for reelection for six-year
terms. If they have no opponents, as is often the case for
incumbents, their names do not even appear on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The governor makes the appointment after review of nominees by a
commission of the State Bar of California. The commission sends out
questionnaires, conducts confidential interviews with people who know
the applicants professionally, and interviews the applicants.</LD>
<TE>   With one exception, only the governor receives their evaluation.
The exception is that if the governor appoints a trial judge found
not qualified, the state bar, after notifying the prospective judge
of its intentions, may disclose publicly that it found the applicant
not qualified.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, county bar associations conduct independent
investigations of the applicants and report their results
confidentially to the governor's appointments secretary. The
procedures vary by county. In Orange County, the bar historically has
provided not only a rating but also a written summary of the
evaluation made by a 30-person committee after review of the report
of a three-person subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   There is a third screening committee, which is local, and may be
the most important. The governor's office often appoints one or more
distinguished lawyers and judges to act as gatekeepers. This can be a
significant or determinative stage in the process.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the process is an interview with the governor's
appointments secretary, currently Burt Pines, the former Los Angeles
city attorney.</TE>
<TE>   By and large the system works. Judges are selected on merit.
Partisanship rarely plays a role. The better lawyers usually are
picked. In recent years, in Orange County in particular, some very
distinguished lawyers have given up lucrative private practices in
order to serve the public on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Usually unopposed, incumbent judges are shoo-ins. Usually they
deserve to be. That was not the case in the past primary election
with Kline. Facing charges of child molestation and possession of
child pornography, he has been confined to his home under arrest,
pending trial while suspended with pay.</TE>
<TE>   After several candidates mounted an unprecedented write-in
campaign, Kline was forced into a runoff, which he is certain to
lose. After the election the judge petitioned to have a court remove
his name from the ballot, which has generated controversy over
whether the law allows removal in these circumstances. The motion is
pending.</TE>
<TE>   Like every citizen, Kline is presumed innocent. That he holds
public office does not lessen the presumption. But being indicted for
pedophilia-related charges has destroyed public trust in Kline's
ability to be fair and impartial.</TE>
<TE>   If Kline were acquitted, he could return to the courthouse, at
least theoretically, but not to the bench. As a practical matter, the
presiding judge could not, and would not, assign him to juvenile,
family law, criminal law or probate panels, because his impartiality
would be presumed to have been impaired. If he were assigned to a
civil panel, lawyers would exercise peremptory challenges to bar him
from hearing their cases.</TE>
<TE>   Even if acquitted, Kline might face impeachment by the Assembly
and trial by the Senate for the charge of using his courthouse
computer to download child pornography. As a practical matter, Kline
would remain at home, drawing his $11,000-per-month salary, just as
he is today.</TE>
<TE>   While Kline negotiates with prosecutors and awaits trial, the
public is suffering. The Orange County Superior Court bench is short
a judge. The work of the judiciary in trying cases is delayed.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinarily, the presumption of innocence is so strong that Kline
should not be asked to leave office before standing trial. But the
primary election changed that. The write-in candidates managed to
force him into a runoff, a rare occurrence considering that there was
nobody else listed on the ballot, and that voters had to know to
request a list of qualified write-in candidates. The public sent a
message that irrespective of what happens to Kline in criminal court,
it wants him off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt Kline first put on his robes in part out of a sense of
public service. If he still wishes to serve the public, he should
respect its wishes and resign. Even though the write-in process was
an unexpected triumph of democracy, in fact it was clumsy and at best
a stopgap measure. Voters didn't get adequate information.</TE>
<TE>   If the governor is given a chance to select Kline's successor, he
will be using a process that is based on selection by merit, and is
likely to result in a better judge than would result from the
write-in route. The governor can start the lengthy process anew, and
this is likely to produce a better field to select from than the
awkward write-in campaign produced.</TE>
<TE>   All this will help the Orange County Superior Court get on with
the public's business, with the best possible replacement. Judge
Kline should bow out with grace now, even if it comes with no reward
but the satisfaction of doing the right thing for the right reason.</TE>

<HD>Coalition Troops Seek the Last Militants</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: A Canadian-led mission working in rough
terrain becomes the latest aimed at weeding out remnants of Taliban
and Al Qaeda.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Waves of Chinook helicopters carrying several hundred Canadian troops
took off here Saturday for a fresh operation in eastern Afghanistan,
another sign that coalition forces were stepping up their campaign
against Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters.</LD>
<LD>   In the south, American Special Forces and Afghan troops disarmed
an entire village suspected of harboring sympathizers of the Al Qaeda
terrorist network, U.S. military spokesman Army Maj. Bryan Hilferty
said.</LD>
<LD>   And in the southeast, a 1,000-strong British-led force continued a
massive sweep through the hillsides, seizing 2,000 rounds of
automatic weapons ammunition in a cave, according to Royal Marines
spokesman Lt. Col. Paul Harradine.</LD>
<TE>   Each of the missions falls under the umbrella of Operation
Mountain Lion--the overall U.S.-led search for Taliban and Al Qaeda
remnants in the eastern half of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Both Operation Torii and Operation Snipe, under Canadian and
British command respectively, are backed by U.S. air support and
Afghan ground forces. A small number of U.S. troops from the 101st
Airborne Division also was participating.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are going well and there have been no battlefield
casualties reported," said Col. John Collin, the senior Canadian
officer in Afghanistan. One Canadian soldier, however, injured his
leg and was evacuated by helicopter.</TE>
<TE>   American Lt. Col. Christopher Pease said the Canadian operation
was "in probably the roughest terrain we have experienced to date
since we've been in Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   He described it as taking place in a mountainous area where
altitudes range from 7,000 feet to 11,000 feet. Allied military
officials refused to describe the location in further detail.</TE>
<TE>   Pease said Operation Torii's objective was to gain intelligence on
Al Qaeda and could take two days to several weeks to complete.
"They'll stay out there until they're done," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The operation was the first major deployment of Canadian troops
since April 18, when an American F-16 pilot on a night patrol dropped
a 500-pound bomb on Canadian troops conducting a live-fire training
exercise near the southern city of Kandahar. Four Canadian soldiers
were killed and eight others injured.</TE>
<TE>   Pease said Afghan and U.S. special forces had surveyed the area in
the east over the last few days and secured a landing zone for the
Canadians. They would sweep the area together, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The operations are part of amplified efforts to hunt down what's
left of Al Qaeda and the Taliban, both of which U.S. officials say
have dispersed into small groups since the last major combat
operation against them in March.</TE>
<TE>   Hilferty, the U.S. military spokesman, said coalition forces had
disarmed an entire village in the south Friday after intelligence
suggested that the residents include Al Qaeda sympathizers. A cache
of weapons was seized, including an antiaircraft gun.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't terribly happy, but there was no resistance,"
Hilferty told reporters at Bagram air base. He refused to identify
the town.</TE>

<HD>War on Terrorism Puts a Load on Air Force's Cargo Fleet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Although hamstrung by its lowest cargo capacity in decades, the Air
Force has managed to operate a supply bridge to Afghanistan that has
proved invaluable to the U.S.-led campaign here.</LD>
<LD>   But as the Bush administration lays the groundwork for expanding
the war on terrorism to Iraq, military strategists say the Pentagon's
diminished, aging and stressed cargo fleet will be hard-pressed to
support such an invasion.</LD>
<LD>   "If we had two contingencies that were similarly remote as the war
in Afghanistan, we would be stretched to the breaking point," said
Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute think
tank in Arlington, Va. "There aren't enough aircraft."</LD>
<TE>   The Pentagon promises that it will get the job done somehow, but
any new mission would leave an already strapped cargo fleet cutting
back on missions in Afghanistan and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   During two weeks in November, all of the nation's C-17s, the new
backbone of the Pentagon's cargo fleet, were flying war-related
missions. Air Force officials say future demands could force them to
activate emergency agreements allowing them to seize planes from
commercial carriers.</TE>
<TE>   And it's not just cargo planes. With as many as one in three of
the nation's aging refueling tankers undergoing repairs at any time,
some U.S. cargo and fighter jets have been relying on British and
Turkish allies for midair refueling.</TE>
<TE>   "This entire process, from 9/11 to where we sit today, has been a
dramatic stress" on cargo capacity, said Gen. John W. Handy, the
commander in chief of the U.S. Transportation Command at Scott Air
Force Base in Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   The shortage of aircraft has its ironies. In 1990, the
Pentagon--headed by then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney--cut the
number of C-17s the Air Force had planned to buy from 210 to 120 amid
a lessened Soviet threat. Because of the enormous time lag in
producing such planes, only 84 have been delivered to the Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   As Vice President Cheney now helps run the war on terrorism, with
its far-flung logistical demands, Pentagon chief Donald H. Rumsfeld
has an acronym for items such as the C-17: LDHD--low density, high
demand.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a euphemism meaning we didn't buy the right things,"
Rumsfeld said recently in a general assessment of Pentagon budgeting.</TE>
<TE>   In most wars, U.S. troops and their armored vehicles, helicopters
and base-building equipment get to where they're going by sea, then
by rail or road.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't possible in landlocked Afghanistan, governed by a
hostile militia, its roads controlled by bandits and rival warlords,
and its rail lines not only damaged by bombing but constructed in a
different gauge than those of neighboring countries.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the war, the only option was the air lanes.</TE>
<TE>   "We came in by pure air," Col.Frank Wiercinski, the 101st Airborne
Division commander in charge of the military base here in Kandahar,
said in a recent interview. "Everything that we eat, everything that
we drank ... and all our equipment came in by air."</TE>
<TE>   From Oct. 7 to March 26, Air Force carriers hauled 142,888 tons of
cargo to the theater of the Afghan war. On some days, more than a
dozen flights arrived from Frankfurt, Germany, and elsewhere into
Kandahar, which is to become a humanitarian aid hub as well as a
military airstrip.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan airlift is the third-largest in history after the
fabled Berlin airlift of 1948-49 and Operation Desert Storm in Iraq
in 1990-91.</TE>
<TE>   The crunch will come when, as expected, the United States expands
the anti-terrorism campaign to another front. Nearly everyone agrees
that there aren't enough cargo planes to support two fronts at the
level of the Afghan airlift.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has 126 massive C-5 cargo carriers. Because of
its size and weight, however, the C-5 has never landed on the short
and heavily patched runways in Afghanistan. It will face similar
constraints in other prospective theaters of the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon also has the 84 new C-17s, modern aircraft built at
Boeing's Long Beach plant that can carry perhaps four jeeps, or a
helicopter and a water-purification system--about half the load of a
C-5.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its 1990 order of 120 C-17s at about $237 million
apiece, the Air Force is negotiating with Boeing to buy an additional
60. That's still short of the 220 new C-17s that Transportation
Command chief Handy says he needs.</TE>
<TE>   "If Al Qaeda's the worst we're going to face, maybe 180 [C-17s] is
enough," analyst Thompson said. But if the United States invades
Iraq, he added, "maybe 220 aircraft will not be enough."</TE>
<TE>   One option is to use standby contracts with commercial
carriers--from FedEx Corp. to passenger airlines--to fill the gap.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can't fly you on [a] military airplane, I will then try to
find a commercial contract that will meet your requirement," Maj.
Gen. William Welser III, the No. 2 official at the U.S.
Transportation Command, said in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, planes are now sent to Afghanistan as fast as Boeing
can supply them. Another major limitation for the airlift effort is
the availability of refueling tankers. The lack of a land bridge and
the difficulty in getting approval to use local airspace--planes
returning from Kyrgyzstan to Germany deliberately skirt Iranian and
Russian territory--have made the hazardous practice of midair
refueling increasingly necessary.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force has 59 massive KC-10 and 546 KC-135 midair refueling
tankers, while the Marines and Navy have a combined tanker fleet of
fewer than 200. While that might sound like a lot, it took eight to
nine refueling jets--sometimes two at a time--to fuel a single B-2
bomber making the 48-hour trek from U.S. soil to Afghanistan early in
the war.</TE>
<TE>   Even in peacetime, on an average day 300 to 350 missions use Air
Force tankers. That number increases any time there is an earthquake,
hurricane or other natural disaster, all of which take the Air Force
planes that respond out of regular service.</TE>
<TE>   During wartime, "I automatically come up with shortages," said
Welser. "We could use more tankers if we're going to continue to do
just our day-to-day mission, much less the kind of missions we're
involved in now."</TE>

<KH>THE UNTOLD WAR</KH>
<HD>Fragile Alliances in a Hostile Land</HD>
<DH>The partnerships that Green Berets and other U.S. troops
forged with Afghan fighters were key to defeating the Taliban. But it
wasn't easy.</DH>
<SE>ABOUT THIS SERIES: This is one in an occasional series
chronicling untold stories from the war in Afghanistan.</SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN and RICHARD T. COOPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Protected by darkness, the 574th Team of the U.S. Army's 5th Special
Forces Group had ridden "right into the lion's mouth," landing deep
inside Afghanistan's Oruzgan province--the cradle of the Taliban. A
rocket-propelled grenade had whizzed past the descending MH-60
helicopters.</LD>
<LD>   As the Green Berets unloaded their gear and the helicopters
clattered away, Capt. Jason Amerine heard a cheery voice calling to
him through the lingering dust cloud, in an incongruous British
accent: "Hello, hello, hello! Welcome."</LD>
<LD>   The Oxbridge-New Delhi accent belonged to Hamid Karzai, the
anti-Taliban resistance leader. Karzai was supposed to be raising an
army of 200 or more seasoned fighters, a force capable of driving the
Taliban out of the all-important southern region of Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Yet barely a dozen ragged Afghans were waiting at the edge of the
landing zone, along with a handful of pathetic-looking pack mules.
And one of the Afghans, a teenager, confessed it was he who had fired
the grenade at the helicopters--in a fit of exuberance.</TE>
<TE>   This did not look like a promising start.</TE>
<TE>   From the earliest days of the Afghan war, small teams like
Amerine's--Green Berets and other Special Forces troops--lived and
fought alongside anti-Taliban commanders and fighters, playing a
unique and largely unseen role: part soldier, part diplomat, part
psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   Some GIs were embraced as trusted partners by their warlords.
Others were not. Some worked with hundreds or thousands of hardened
Afghan fighters; others found only inexperienced sometime-soldiers
quick to flee danger.</TE>
<TE>   These intimate, on-the-ground dealings with the Afghans proved
vital in directing warplanes to their targets. And not incidentally,
they nurtured the rise of Karzai to the post of interim prime
minister, where he represents a fragile hope for his country's
future. The Green Berets and their fellow Special Forces troops were
arguably the decisive single factor in the success of the war.</TE>
<TE>   They ate goat meat. They slept in crude huts. They drank green tea
laced with gingery cardamom seeds and swapped family stories with
bearded warlords.</TE>
<TE>   Then, when it came time to fight, they "brought the
magic"--calling down fire from the sky to destroy Taliban and Al
Qaeda forces.</TE>
<TE>   "More laser, more laser!" one Afghan commander cried as he peered
through a Special Forces laser sight and watched smart bombs destroy
enemy positions.</TE>
<TE>   Some see this teamwork between Special Forces and local fighters,
combined with air power and other advanced U.S. technology, as a
model for future conflicts, a prescription for confronting
adversaries who are beyond the reach of conventional forces.</TE>
<TE>   Others warn that the tactics that succeeded in Afghanistan, where
an entrenched opposition stood ready to accept U.S. help, may not
work as well in other trouble spots.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, there were failures, cases where plans went awry
or good advice was ignored with painful results--including the death
and injury of Americans in a November prison revolt near the northern
city of Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   And there were frequent reminders of how vulnerable the Green
Beret teams were, of the thin margin between survival and
catastrophe.</TE>
<TE>   When the system worked, the results were spectacular--and were
toasted in Afghan style.</TE>
<TE>   A skeptical anti-Taliban leader was gnawing on a huge piece of
roast goat as he waited impatiently for a promised airstrike. When it
came, with devastating effect, he got so excited he tore off a chunk
of meat and stuffed it into the mouth of an astonished Green Beret.</TE>
<TE>   The A-Team arrives with a plan and meets up with a band of ragtag
fighters. Almost too quickly, things go their way.</TE>
<TE>   The Karzai-Green Beret contingent began operations in Oruzgan
province near midnight on Nov. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Loading the mules, which one American said "looked more like
dogs," they set out through the mountains on a narrow trail with a
sheer drop of several hundred feet on one side. They tried to move
quietly, but the men swore aloud as they twisted their ankles on the
rough ground.</TE>
<TE>   Out ahead walked Afghan guides with flashlights. "If the Taliban
were planning an ambush," Amerine confessed, "I'd hoped they would
first hit my Afghans with the flashlights. Then we could take care of
the threat."</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, after climbing down a cliff and crowding into a
waiting van and a small truck, they reached a farming community. Its
30 families risked their lives to feed and shelter the exhausted
party.</TE>
<TE>   Amerine's unit was the standard Special Forces detachment of a
dozen men, counting the captain:</TE>
<TE>   * A team sergeant, the veteran executive officer who served as
"team daddy," since the captains who headed the teams rotated through
so quickly that some called them "Kelly girls."</TE>
<TE>   * Two weapons sergeants trained to operate and maintain an array
of foreign and domestic arms.</TE>
<TE>   * Two engineers who could handle chores ranging from demolishing
bridges to fortifying them.</TE>
<TE>   * Two communications experts, the team's lifelines to the outside.</TE>
<TE>   * An intelligence specialist who majored in maps, enemy tactics
and local mores.</TE>
<TE>   * Two medics.</TE>
<TE>   Often, as in this case, the A-Team included an Air Force combat
air controller who took the lead in arranging for close air support.</TE>
<TE>   Together, they carried a lot of firepower--M-4 assault rifles with
especially sophisticated sights; sniper guns; M-203 grenade
launchers; the M-249 squad automatic weapon; explosives and more. And
they had air support almost constantly on call.</TE>
<TE>   Their mission would reflect what is possible when a Special Forces
team establishes an exceptional level of trust with a foreign
counterpart who gives it free rein to manage the military side of
things.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike most other Afghan leaders, who considered themselves
accomplished field marshals, Hamid Karzai left most of the war-making
to his American advisors. War, after all, was their specialty.</TE>
<TE>   "The mission that we in theory are always training for is this
very mission," Amerine said. "Infiltrating deep behind enemy lines
and linking up with a totally disorganized force that has no
logistics capability at all and making things happen."</TE>
<TE>   With Karzai, the Americans had their chance. The man who in a few
short weeks would become Afghanistan's interim prime minister had
deep family roots in the southern province of Oruzgan. He devoted
himself to politics--dickering with village elders, inducing local
commanders to switch sides, establishing himself as the go-to man who
might pull a divided country together.</TE>
<TE>   Not long before Amerine's A-Team arrived, Karzai had been hunted
down and almost killed by the Taliban, as other prominent opposition
leaders were. A CIA-Special Forces rescue unit had airlifted him to a
temporary haven in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Now he was back, and the Green Berets had a long-range plan for
bringing down the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   One element, Amerine recalled, was "to feed all the impoverished
villages in the area ... and in so doing, we would both increase
Karzai's credibility and also they'd be saying that they weren't
getting anything from the Taliban--only starvation and tyranny."</TE>
<TE>   They had a military strategy as well: to demonstrate American
power and deliver weapons and even cash to win over local Afghan
leaders whose commitment to the Taliban was pragmatic rather than
ideological. Gradually, they would develop a fighting force capable
of seizing Oruzgan province and the city of Kandahar, the seat of
Taliban power, to the south.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected to be there for six months to a year at least,"
Amerine said. The Green Berets brought blankets and food for farmers
and villagers, as well as weapons and ammunition for local fighters.</TE>
<TE>   That was the plan as Karzai rushed out onto the landing zone. It
barely survived the night.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Nov. 15, as the Green Berets were bringing in more
supplies, they learned that the regional capital of Tarin Kowt had
revolted. With no Taliban garrison nearby, local leaders achieved the
coup with a single act of violence--hanging the Taliban mayor from a
lamppost.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai saw an opportunity; the Americans had no choice but to help
him seize it.</TE>
<TE>   "Tarin Kowt represents the Taliban's heart," he said. "Crush that
heart and we kill the Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   As they prepared to leave the village for Tarin Kowt, word spread
that the Americans were handing out weapons and food. Hundreds of
potential fighters streamed in. But this apparent windfall of troops
quickly vanished.</TE>
<TE>   "We first thought this would be the army, and were kind of happy
with the numbers," Amerine recalled. "But once we armed them, they
returned to their own villages."</TE>
<TE>   Only 60 ragtag fighters accompanied Karzai and the Americans as
they set out.</TE>
<TE>   What they didn't know was that the Taliban was raising an army,
one that dwarfed the 574th Special Forces team and Karzai's
irregulars. A convoy of about 100 vehicles was moving toward Tarin
Kowt, carrying as many as 1,000 men.</TE>
<TE>   With Karzai translating, local fighters explained that the most
likely Taliban approach would be along a road that led over the
mountains and into the valley where Tarin Kowt sits.</TE>
<TE>   At dawn, the Americans and two dozen local fighters loaded weapons
and communications gear into six pickup trucks and drove out to find
an observation site with a good view of the road.</TE>
<TE>   They chose a ridgeline that offered a perfect vantage point. Some
of the Americans positioned the irregulars. "You're gonna be here.
And you're gonna be here," they told the Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the communications specialists and the combat
controller established contact with F/A-18s and other warplanes
overhead. It promised to be a turkey shoot.</TE>
<TE>   As the vanguard of the Taliban convoy came into sight, a
half-dozen bombs ripped it up. But the Americans had not reckoned
with the impact such a blitz might have on their allies.</TE>
<TE>   Terrified by the thunderous explosions barely a mile away, and by
the sight of so many Taliban vehicles still moving toward them, the
local fighters jumped into the trucks and bolted for town.</TE>
<TE>   With much of their ammunition and other gear still in those
pickups, the Green Berets had no choice but to jump aboard too.</TE>
<TE>   The rush back to Tarin Kowt was like an episode of the Keystone
Cops. The Americans in one truck would persuade a driver to stop,
only to have panic overtake him at the sight of another local fighter
speeding past.</TE>
<TE>   By the time they reached Karzai's headquarters, the Americans were
livid. They forced the Afghan drivers out of the vehicles and headed
back alone.</TE>
<TE>   Too late. The observation post had been overrun by the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   The Green Berets, facing an overwhelming enemy, seized the highest
ground still available and went to work. By now, the sky was stacked
with American aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the pilots knew how dire a situation it was, because we
told them our position. It amounted to 11 guys on a small piece of
ground, and here comes this giant convoy," Amerine said. "They'd get
on the radio, calling to us, wanting a piece of the action."</TE>
<TE>   As quickly as the A-Team could call in coordinates, the pilots
unloaded their bombs, then dropped down through volleys of Taliban
rocket-propelled grenades to hose down the convoy with machine-gun
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the huge holes torn in their line, the Taliban forces kept
coming.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the fighting attracted a mob of now-emboldened townspeople
to the Special Forces' position. The Green Berets found themselves
surrounded by a milling crowd of children and elderly men. War,
Afghan-style.</TE>
<TE>   The Green Berets pleaded with the elders to take the children away
as the battle surged back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   A small group of Taliban fighters on foot managed to slip onto the
Green Berets' flank. They got within 400 yards of the Americans
before they were spotted by a crowd of townsmen, who somehow drove
them off.</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, the airstrikes broke the Taliban assault. About half
the attacking force was destroyed, radio intercepts indicated. Some
Taliban vehicles made it back to Kandahar. Others tried to hide and
were ferreted out by American pilots.</TE>
<TE>   By the skin of their teeth, the Special Forces had survived and,
with the help of their air power, prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the victory spread through the region. Almost overnight,
the campaign entered a strikingly different but equally important
phase for the Special Forces, and for Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   First, a group of religious leaders came to express their thanks
for the food and blankets, and for the defense of Tarin Kowt. Without
the Green Berets, the leaders of the uprising would have been
slaughtered, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Then, it seemed, every leader in the area wanted to talk to
Karzai. He sent runners to surrounding areas to invite leaders in,
and continually worked his satellite phone.</TE>
<TE>   As the Americans arranged for air drops of more supplies, all but
the hard-core Talibs could see the wind was shifting. Through long
afternoons and longer nights, large groups would arrive at Karzai's
mud-and-brick headquarters in Tarin Kowt to discuss switching sides.
Karzai, often with Amerine sitting beside him, would tip the scales
with offers of food or cash.</TE>
<TE>   One night, Amerine noticed an unfamiliar Afghan with Karzai. The
man was staring at the American and grinning broadly.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, he's Taliban," Karzai explained. Amerine and the Taliban
mullah, who was negotiating his own surrender, locked eyes and burst
out laughing.</TE>
<TE>   With his dual status as a native Pushtun, Afghanistan's largest
ethnic group, and bringer of American bounty, Karzai also received
urgent petitions on more mundane issues, including one from a man who
wanted money for a new bull. His old one had died.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd sit down with Karzai at these meetings, and all of these
tribal leaders are yelling at each other, and he'd look over in
amusement and tell me what they were fighting about. We'd kind of be
laughing at some of the silliness that went on," Amerine said.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd let it go and let it go, and then he'd make whatever
decision he had to make and everybody would abide by it."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the medics, weapons specialists and other members
of the A-Team were doing their part to cement relations with the
local tribes. They not only handled battle wounds but also brought in
medicine for a common local stomach malady and treated the locals'
other minor ailments.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai responded by going out of his way to chat with the soldiers
about their wives and girlfriends and their lives back home.</TE>
<TE>   There would be one more battle on the march to Kandahar--at
Showali Kowt, 10 miles from the Taliban's last stronghold. Three
Green Berets, including two from Amerine's team, died in a "friendly
fire" bombing there, and Karzai himself was slightly injured.
Kandahar fell two days later, Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the cooperation begun at Tarin Kowt that set the
dominoes falling.</TE>
<TE>   Two battle-scarred commanders team up with lethal intensity. But
their alliance cannot withstand one man's relentless ambition.</TE>
<TE>   If Hamid Karzai was a Special Forces dream, Gen. Mohammed Qassim
Fahim was something of a nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Warrant Officer David Diaz, 39, leader of the 555th Green
Berets, had seen a lot in 18 years of soldiering, including Iraq,
Somalia, and a previous stint in Afghanistan when the U.S.-backed
moujahedeen were fighting the Red Army. But he hadn't encountered
Fahim.</TE>
<TE>   Just getting to Fahim almost got Diaz killed twice. The first
time, navigating on a moonless night with poor maps, the heavily
laden U.S. helicopter almost flew into a mountain before turning
back. The next time, the crew aborted its mission after a Taliban
antiaircraft battery "locked on."</TE>
<TE>   And when they finally made it through, on Oct. 17, the welcome was
not especially cordial.</TE>
<TE>   At least there were no mules. Two CIA agents greeted them at the
landing site north of Kabul, the Afghan capital. Also on hand were
some Northern Alliance soldiers with old Soviet jeeps to haul Diaz's
team to Fahim's foothold at Bagram air base, some 40 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Fahim served up the obligatory huge introductory meal, but he did
not hide his anger at the United States for abandoning Afghanistan
after Soviet forces ended their 10-year occupation in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Heavyset, bald and clean-shaven, Fahim had served as intelligence
chief and right-hand man for the legendary Ahmed Shah Masoud, who
founded the Northern Alliance, fought the Soviets in the 1980s and
the Taliban in the 1990s--only to be killed by Al Qaeda suicide
bombers just before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Fahim had received his initial training from the Soviet KGB,
before joining the resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Now, at least in American eyes, he was a secretive, ambitious
schemer who meant to use-- but not serve--the Green Berets.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't trust Americans," Fahim said. "I know why you're here. If
it wasn't for Sept. 11, you wouldn't be here."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz, of modest size by Green Beret standards, was dwarfed by the
massive Fahim. The American, known as "the chief" and admired by his
men for his experience and what they consider an outsize command
presence, told the warlord that he had a point but that they could
still help each other.</TE>
<TE>   The first task was to capture Bagram, a former Soviet air base
with great strategic potential.</TE>
<TE>   The situation at Bagram was a stalemate out of World War I. From
trenches, Northern Alliance and Taliban fighters faced one another
across a no man's land that sometimes narrowed to 100 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Fahim was irritated that, for several weeks, U.S. agents had
promised air support that did not come.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, other anti-Taliban commanders were getting air support. Why
were the Americans shunning him?</TE>
<TE>   The day after the strained meeting with Fahim, Diaz and his Air
Force controller--wearing Northern Alliance garb, complete with
sabers, vests, scarves and caps--surveyed the situation from the
airfield's control tower, which stood on ground occupied by Fahim's
troops.</TE>
<TE>   From that aerie, targets were etched by sunlight.</TE>
<TE>   "That's 'me' over there," a smiling, potbellied general named
Babashan told Diaz, pointing to an enemy hut a mile away that was
occupied by his Taliban equivalent. The Taliban commanders' huts
could be identified by the large number of radio antennas bristling,
porcupine-like, on their roofs.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz nodded to his controller, an Air Force sergeant named Calvin.</TE>
<TE>   Quietly, Calvin radioed a bomber and gave a thumbs-up.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, sir," Diaz told Babashan. "At that target you pointed out,
where their general is, in exactly 30 seconds there will be a
2,000-pound bomb on it."</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, Babashan's face was a picture of doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Diaz recalled later, "All of a sudden this thing just
disintegrated."</TE>
<TE>   For 24 straight days, Diaz's men and U.S. warplanes laid waste to
enemy positions that had stood impregnable for three years.</TE>
<TE>   The carnage was all the greater because it claimed enemy leaders
from Kabul who often spent the night in the supposedly secure Bagram
bunkers. Accustomed to the Soviets' "dumb" bombs, they assumed U.S.
planes could not hit them without risking injury to their own troops
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, Northern Alliance soldiers used the radio to trick
Taliban commanders into revealing their positions, which the
Americans then bombed.</TE>
<TE>   Fahim's manner changed, suggesting the ice had broken. The Afghans
began placing their right hands over their hearts to express their
gratitude. Some insisted on walking hand in hand with their American
counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   To bolster morale among allied soldiers, the Berets would order
many times the number of bombs needed to destroy some targets,
especially those housing the fearsome "martyr units"--Al Qaeda
fighters who painted their faces to look more intimidating and fought
with abandon because, it was said, their families expected them to
die in battle.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lot of overkill," Diaz said. "We dropped numerous bombs
on a small area just for the psychological effect for our guys. And
we did it in daylight instead of at night so they could see it all.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good for the generals to see that they were eliminated. I
think sometimes for us too."</TE>
<TE>   The fall of Bagram would open the way to capturing Kabul, and Diaz
soon learned just how limited the rapport with Fahim really was.</TE>
<TE>   Never as accessible as Karzai, he became steadily more remote and
seemingly paranoid. Meetings with Diaz scheduled for 3 p.m. would be
held at 2 a.m.; locations changed without notice.</TE>
<TE>   "I never knew when we were meeting. He would just send a driver
for me. When I did meet him, I was frisked," Diaz said.</TE>
<TE>   For a country as ethnically fragmented as Afghanistan, the
question of which commander's soldiers entered the capital first was
an explosive one. Fahim, as an ethnic Tajik, could inflame ancient
tensions and complicate the U.S.-Afghan relationship after the war.
The issue was so important that Washington insisted that Fahim sign
an agreement with the U.S. commander, Gen. Tommy Franks, pledging not
to enter the city.</TE>
<TE>   In a candid moment, however, Fahim warned Diaz what was to come.</TE>
<TE>   "Gen. Fahim had told me once he gave the thumbs-up for the ground
offensive, there would be some ground commanders he could control,
some he couldn't," Diaz said. "It would be essentially a race to
Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to be the first in Kabul. He had no intention of
stopping."</TE>
<TE>   As the final push got underway, Taliban armor evaporated under
assaults by Special Forces and U.S. air power. Wholesale
side-switching followed.</TE>
<TE>   "I could literally see them, the same guys that were just shooting
at us an hour or so ago, were now on our side," Diaz said. "And they,
in turn, would point out who were Al Qaeda, if they didn't in fact
kill them themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Fahim split his army--now grown to nearly 8,000 men--as he
approached Kabul, and the Berets split too. Diaz decided that if
Fahim was going to roll in, they had no choice.</TE>
<TE>   As Fahim led the first convoy into Kabul, surrounded by huge
crowds, the Green Berets were screened by the tinted glass of the
commanders' vehicles, and by their native garb, long hair and beards.</TE>
<TE>   "So we went into the city," Diaz said. "We came rolling along, and
I'm thinking, 'OK, we'll roll in low-key, like we do in Special
Forces, kind of melt our way into the city and we'll find a place to
hole up.'"</TE>
<TE>   But as Fahim's efforts to establish sole control over Kabul became
more aggressive, Diaz separated his troops from him once and for all.
Fahim's bid to exclude other factions from Kabul, and thus ensure for
himself a place in the post-Taliban government, violated U.S.
policy--which the Special Forces were supposed to advance.</TE>
<TE>   Fahim's gambit succeeded: He became defense minister in the
interim government.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have stayed together," Diaz said, "but there were
things that he was starting to do, attempted to do ... that we just
needed to separate ourselves from. It was a lot of tribal fighting.
He was going to do whatever he needed to do to prevent anyone else,
any other ethnic Afghan unit or tribe, from getting into Kabul."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds formed over meals and on horseback melt away when the
bullets start flying. Ancient honor codes trump reason and caution.</TE>
<TE>   In a land less chaotic than Afghanistan, Americans would have
considered a man like Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum part of the problem,
not the solution.</TE>
<TE>   A burly, ethnic Uzbek originally trained by the Soviets, Dostum
was a maverick in the Northern Alliance, with a record of human
rights abuses and a history of betrayal and side-switching fit for a
Mafia don.</TE>
<TE>   But in the earliest days of the Afghan war, U.S. Army and Air
Force special operations personnel found themselves on horseback with
the fearsome Dostum and his troops for more than a week, on mountain
trails that were seldom more than 3 feet wide, along 1,000-foot drops
into the valleys below.</TE>
<TE>   It was cold and wet. The undisciplined horses, rebellious over
moving single file, looked for opportunities to push past one
another.</TE>
<TE>   Under such conditions, a skilled rider would have been tested.
Most of the Americans had little experience on horseback. All
struggled to stay upright in wooden saddles that inflicted pain with
every step.</TE>
<TE>   Out in front like a feudal baron rode Dostum, whose goal--backed
by American air support--was to capture Mazar-i-Sharif. A strategic
highway junction near the country's northern border, Mazar was
considered the necessary first step to toppling the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   During the first days, things went well.</TE>
<TE>   The trails Dostum and the Green Berets traveled passed above
valleys dotted with towns held by the Taliban. From the heights, the
Americans would "bring down a rain of bombs," as one combat
controller described it later. Then Dostum would order his men,
accompanied by Green Berets, to attack the dazed and fleeing enemy.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghans' delight at what air power could do was clear. "I
remember one instance, we hit a target directly and the Northern
Alliance commander happened to be eating a piece of goat at that
time," an air combat controller named Matt recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "He ripped off a big chunk of meat and shoved it in a Special
Forces guy's mouth because he was so happy."</TE>
<TE>   Between raids, Dostum was on the radio talking to his forces and
negotiating with opposition leaders. Air controllers, including a
26-year-old California native with long sideburns named Mike, were
coordinating airdrops of food, Gore-Tex gloves and warm jackets.</TE>
<TE>   Drinking water was delivered by young boys riding donkeys and
wearing boots with pointy rubber toes that reminded Mike of Aladdin's
footwear.</TE>
<TE>   At night, they slept in caves, out of the wind. When the horses
moved in the dark, sparks flew as their iron shoes struck the rocks.</TE>
<TE>   One night, bored with American field rations, Mike joined the
Afghan soldiers eating a mixture of meat, rice, grapes and carrots
called palau. He was sick for three days.</TE>
<TE>   But when Dostum and the Special Forces got into position to
assault Mazar-i-Sharif, such personal relationships seemed to melt
away.</TE>
<TE>   The Special Forces team and its assigned Afghan fighters
established a forward observation post on a hilltop and began calling
in airstrikes. But Taliban units spotted the post, and more than
three dozen enemy troops armed with machine guns, AK-47s and grenade
launchers came at it like angry bees.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghans bolted. Alone with his Special Forces teammates, Matt
remembered firing his M-4 with one hand and vectoring in more bombs
with the other.</TE>
<TE>   Only after they had escaped to a sheltering ravine did the
Americans find Dostum's men, waiting safely out of range.</TE>
<TE>   But Mazar-i-Sharif fell faster than anyone expected, and afterward
a nearby fortress became a prison for hundreds of captured enemy
fighters. Guns and grenades were clearly visible beneath their
clothing, but Northern Alliance fighters brushed aside the Americans'
requests that the prisoners be carefully searched.</TE>
<TE>   The prickly alliance between the Americans and Dostum was no match
for an Afghan honor code that held that respect for a vanquished foe
precluded searching him.</TE>
<TE>   Or for the religious and ethnic politics that led the Afghans to
keep some of the most dangerous prisoners out of American hands.</TE>
<TE>   The result was predictable. When the well-armed prisoners
revolted, CIA officer Johnny "Mike" Spann became the first U.S.
combat casualty of the war.</TE>

<HD>Schools' Use of Students as Clerks Draws Criticism</HD>
<DH>Learning: They earn credit, but time should be spent on
academics, some educators say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Matthew Rodriguez followed a script when he answered the main office
telephone at his Los Angeles school. "Good afternoon. Thank you for
calling Franklin High School. Student speaking." The 14-year-old
freshman also filed papers and ran errands for administrators during
a daily class period.</LD>
<LD>   And for that work, he received academic credit.</LD>
<LD>   His mother couldn't believe it at first, especially because she
had wanted him to take a college prep course in Spanish instead. He
told her he wound up in the student clerk position because there was
no room in the language class.</LD>
<TE>   "I take summons notes to classes, bring books to classes or help
parents find classes," Matthew explained after his mother picked him
up after school recently.</TE>
<TE>   "So, you're like a tour guide?" Rosalinda Rodriguez asked. "That's
kind of wasting his time. What are they learning?"</TE>
<TE>   Educators around the country are asking similar questions.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of thousands of other middle and high school students
nationwide earn academic credit for working as clerks in their
schools' attendance, counseling and main offices, as well as in
libraries and classrooms. They deliver mail, run errands, sharpen
pencils for standardized tests and even grade some quizzes.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to class credits, student aides receive needed lessons
in the work ethic and breaks from the academic grind. Problems
occasionally pop up, with some student workers tampering with
transcripts, trading confidential information or nabbing office
supplies. Still, the tradition has continued for decades--embraced,
winked at or just tolerated. The free labor eases drudgery for adult
staffers and saves schools lots of money.</TE>
<TE>   But as the nation's schools are pressed to boost standardized test
scores and send more graduates to college, academic experts
increasingly say students should not be given academic credit for
clerical work. And some districts, including Los Angeles, are
starting to put strict limits on how many credits a student can earn
that way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a kind of dirty little secret in education that a lot of
students have service and [teacher's assistant] classes, instead of
taking academic classes," said Phyllis Hart, director for the
Achievement Council of California, a nonprofit education organization
based in Los Angeles. "In an era of standards-based reform in this
country, we cannot afford for students--who are far behind in their
academics--to spend learning time assisting adults."</TE>
<TE>   Many who enroll as aides do so as seniors, after they have
completed college preparatory course work, and such classes do not
hurt their chances of being accepted at universities. But others
enroll as freshmen or sophomores, often because there is not enough
space in other classes or they simply want to earn easy credit. Many
are graded on such factors as attendance, behavior, work and
attitude.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon at Parkman Middle School in Woodland Hills,
eighth-grader Diego Aguilar filed envelopes in a teacher's box.
Another student assistant munched on pretzels and answered a phone:
''Parkman Middle School, student speaking.''</TE>
<TE>   Aguilar, 14, said the service period is the most laid-back period
of his school day.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better than any other class," he said. "It's an easy A on
the report card."</TE>
<TE>   Schools in Seattle, Philadelphia, New York City and Tampa, Fla.,
are among those offering academic credit to student workers. Few
systems, however, compare with the 736,000-student Los Angeles
Unified School District when it comes to the number of aides per
school.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, 33,000 middle and high school students in Los Angeles
Unified were enrolled as student assistants, according to Bud Jacobs,
director of high school programs for the district. An average of 180
students per middle school and 350 students per high school worked in
those campus positions last semester, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It does the school good and it does the kid good," he said. "It
sometimes lightens the load academically, takes some of the pressure
off. But it really is designed to give students the opportunity to
work with adults."</TE>
<TE>   However, Los Angeles Unified is cracking down on campuses that, in
some cases, allowed students to take as many as four semesters worth
of clerking. Other requirements for graduation are increasing, and
students will not be allowed to claim credit for more than two
semesters of office work, starting this summer, according to Merl
Price, deputy superintendent for instruction.</TE>
<TE>   John Muir High in Pasadena allows four semesters of service
credit. Cindy Gamble, a college-bound senior there, is taking five
academic courses this semester in addition to working as an office
assistant. She said she enjoys answering phones and running
photocopiers, and the chance to do homework when the pace is slow.
But Gamble, 18, who is in her second semester of clerking, says not
everyone should sign up for it.</TE>
<TE>   Many freshmen and sophomores are aides "because they don't want to
be in a regular academic class," she said. "There should be
restrictions.... I say go ahead and take your core courses first
instead of wasting your time."</TE>
<TE>   Allowing students to earn credits as gofers is not wise,
especially when the United States lags behind other countries in
reading, writing and math skills, said Michael Cohen, a senior fellow
at the Aspen Institute who wrote a report on transforming American
high schools.</TE>
<TE>   Because California requires all high school students to pass a new
exit exam, beginning with the class of 2004, students need all the
classroom time they can get, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifty years ago, you could get a good job and earn a decent
living because demands for skills were relatively low. Not anymore.
Everyone needs a higher level of education," Cohen said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why on Earth do they give students academic credit for that?
Those kids are being robbed of an education. If they need student
assistants to do filing, they should pay them."</TE>
<TE>   Objections arise from labor unions too.</TE>
<TE>   "You end up with student workers doing things that should be done
by adult staff," said Connie Moreno, a labor relations representative
for the California School Employees Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno said the union has brought up the issue with Los Angeles
Unified, for example, arguing that students should not be allowed to
work with confidential information or be used to fill gaps in adult
staff.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Reba Page, a professor of education at UC Riverside
who studies curriculum issues for the American Educational Research
Assn., said student aides can benefit from the experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It is sometimes the case that the jobs are given to students who
aren't very successful academically in school," she said. "They may
not be going to college, but could very well end up as secretaries or
clerks."</TE>
<TE>   She said she understands why some educators want to end academic
credit for clerking, but she argued that "schools are not just
academic institutions. They're supposed to help students become good
citizens and help students be able to do good work when they grow
up."</TE>
<TE>   Many students perform their clerical tasks conscientiously--and
sometimes save the day.</TE>
<TE>   At John Muir in Pasadena recently, a bilingual student aide helped
a distraught Spanish-speaking parent complete complicated financial
aid paperwork when the parent was close to missing the application
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   In an English class at Taft High School in Woodland Hills on a
recent Friday afternoon, a student assistant graded quizzes by
matching vocabulary words with definitions, allowing the teacher more
time to review the complex language of "Romeo and Juliet" with her
pupils.</TE>
<TE>   But trouble does arise.</TE>
<TE>   For example, at Marina del Rey Middle School on Los Angeles'
Westside, two student workers in the dean's office were suspended
last month after they stole a pad of hall pass slips from the dean's
desk. They intended to forge staff members' signatures and give them
to friends, the dean said.</TE>
<TE>   At Berkeley High in Northern California two years ago, 750
seniors' diplomas were temporarily withheld after 20 students were
suspended for paying a student aide to change grades in the computer
system, according to Guillermo Barcenas, a counselor there.</TE>
<TE>   Most seniors eventually did receive their diplomas, but the school
has since tightened access to records and office computers.</TE>
<TE>   Beverly Escoe, a secretary at Centennial High in Compton, said the
school had problems with assistants calling their friends--some even
making long-distance calls--until the school ended its long-distance
service in the offices.</TE>
<TE>   Other student aides say they are the first to hear gossip.</TE>
<TE>   Working in the dean's office at George Washington Preparatory High
School in South-Central Los Angeles, Amir Hasan, 17, knows which
student couple were caught kissing in the hallway, which girl got
sent to the dean's office because she fell asleep in class, and which
faculty members don't like each other, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many schools say they run the classes with high standards.</TE>
<TE>   For example, at Seattle's Roosevelt High, head counselor Wendy
Krakauer said student aides are "subject to the same attendance
requirement as other students, how well they do the job, what kind of
self-responsibility and self-initiative they show."</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Jones, assistant principal of counseling at Franklin in Los
Angeles, stressed that there are benefits for both the school and
student aides, even if some youngsters are enrolled as a way to fill
their schedules.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to give all of our students as much of an academically
challenging schedule as possible, so we don't choose service as our
first choice," she said. "But we do want to give students an
opportunity to give back to the school."</TE>
<TE>   Hart, head of the Achievement Council and a former counselor and
teacher in Los Angeles Unified for 18 years, disagrees. Many
administrators, she said, recently have realized they need to cut
back on student aides because the stakes in education are higher now.</TE>
<TE>   "The system needs to be based on what is good for kids," she said,
"not on what is good for adults."</TE>

<HD>Hospital Choice Grows Costlier</HD>
<DH>Health: New plans pushed by major insurers in the state
require co-payments for costlier medical centers. In one plan, daily
fees can be $400 a day.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking aim at escalating hospital bills, California's biggest
insurers are pushing new health plans that make it significantly more
expensive for consumers to use hospitals that insurers consider too
pricey.</LD>
<LD>   These health plans are the first broad attempt in the nation by
the insurance industry to group hospitals on the basis of cost, and
to apply that to establish co-payments and deductibles.</LD>
<LD>   Under one HMO option offered by PacifiCare, members who go to a
hospital on PacifiCare's preferred list pay nothing out of pocket.
But those who use other facilities in the network are required to
make co-payments of $100 to $400 a day.</LD>
<TE>   About half of PacifiCare's 230 contracted hospitals in California
are on its A-list, including academic institutions such as UCLA
Medical Center, but that list includes none of the specialty
children's hospitals in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups expressed concerns that higher co-payments will
steer people to hospitals that are overcrowded or provide
lower-quality care.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm afraid it could exacerbate a system that puts the people with
the biggest health problems and the poor in certain kinds of
facilities," said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a
consumer group in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance company executives, mindful of the backlash against
managed care, stressed that they are not restricting access with
these new tiered plans. Rather, they said, it highlights hospitals
that are more expensive and leaves it up to consumers whether they
want to spend extra for them.</TE>
<TE>   In concept, such health plans are similar to tiered prescription
drug programs, in which people pay more out of pocket for brand-name
drugs than generic substitutes. Both are part of a trend of greater
sharing of medical costs, which are surging, led by rising hospital
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Health insurers say tiered pricing will narrow the big and often
inexplicable variation in hospital charges, while preserving choice
for patients. But it is far from clear whether this will be widely
accepted or effective in slowing the pace of rising medical costs.
Only a couple of insurers in other states have recently tried
something like this, with mixed results.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to cause a lot of confusion, because patients don't
have a lot of information to make a decision about the quality and
the value of what they're spending their money on," said Bart Asner,
a pediatrician and chief executive of Monarch HealthCare, a large
independent physicians' association in Orange County. Health insurers
are now developing quality measures to include in their tiering of
hospitals, but Asner and others said there is no agreement on how
best to measure quality.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're entering into an era that is far more complex than
anything we've anticipated," Asner said of the new plans.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of companies in California have already signed up for
hospital tiering plans, and many others are considering them because
they can reduce an employer's premium increases by as much as 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Blue Shield of California this spring imposed a tiered hospital
co-payment arrangement for almost a million members insured through
small and mid-size employers; only large employers were given the
option of whether to accept tiered payments. The co-payments would
not apply to emergency room admissions.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought this was a fair and appropriate way to deal with"
rising costs, said Ken Wood, Blue Shield's chief financial officer.
He said focus groups overwhelmingly preferred tiering to the other
options considered: raising premiums even more for everyone, reducing
benefits or dropping high-cost customers.</TE>
<TE>   Wood said he has had few consumer complaints. Steven Fisher,
deputy director at the state Department of Managed Care, which
regulates health insurers, said Friday that so far it has received
one complaint about hospital tiering: a Blue Shield member in El
Dorado County who said there was no local hospital without the
co-payment. (That county has two hospitals, and neither is on Blue
Shield's preferred list.) Fisher said that complaint will be
investigated and that the department will review how these plans are
working overall in six months.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Blue Shield and PacifiCare, Health Net is rolling out
similar plans in New York and California this year. Blue Cross of
California, Cigna and some other national insurers are expected to
follow suit next year.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser Permanente operates its own hospitals and thus would not
employ a tiered pricing system.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy of tiering comes as many hospitals are struggling
with higher labor costs, new technologies and capital spending for
seismic retrofitting. But consolidation in recent years also has
strengthened the hand of some big hospital operators, enabling them
to negotiate bigger payments from insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   Health insurers, meanwhile, have been able to pass on those higher
hospital costs to employers and are enjoying some of the strongest
profit growth in years. But as in the early 1990s, when health
premiums soared and led to the proliferation of managed care, medical
insurers are facing increasing pressure from employers to hold down
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Wing, president of Health Net of California, said that about
20% of his contracted hospitals charged as much as double the average
cost for comparable services at other hospitals, and that 10% billed
triple or more. Health Net would not describe how it arrived at those
percentages but said the average daily cost for inpatient services
last year ranged from about $3,000 to more than $10,000--with
academic institutions generally at the top of the list.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital industry officials scoffed at such figures, saying it was
virtually impossible to determine the actual cost of services and
draw comparisons when hospital charges reflect quality, the
specialties they offer and fees that are negotiated with insurers.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no one dollar figure to compare apples to apples," said
Jan Emerson, a spokeswoman for the California Healthcare Assn., which
represents nearly 500 hospitals and health providers in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also point out that what may be too pricey in one
insurance company's eyes may not be to another. Indeed, a number of
hospitals in PacifiCare's more expensive group made Blue Shield's
preferred list. By Blue Shield's method, only 15% of the hospitals
fell into the too-costly category, compared with 30% for Health Net
and about 50% for PacifiCare.</TE>
<TE>   "It's rather inconsistent; there is no industry standard," said
Brian Hagadorn, executive director of managed care for Children's
Hospital of Orange County, which didn't make PacifiCare's select
list. He said the facility is not overpriced for "the level of
service complexity and special services we provide."</TE>
<TE>   At least one health insurer, Blue Shield, has tried to apply a
consistent formula. Blue Shield has developed a cost index for each
hospital, taking into account geographic differences and types of
facility. To make Blue Shield's preferred list, a hospital's cost
index cannot exceed 125% of the average of hospitals in its region.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital operators are waiting to see how tiered pricing might
affect their patient count. But some are clearly concerned. After
Blue Shield announced its preferred list, three hospitals that didn't
make the cut called the insurer to discuss price reductions, said
Blue Shield, which declined to identify them.</TE>
<TE>   In most rural areas, however, tiering isn't likely to have much
effect, simply because there aren't enough hospitals there to split
into groups. Even in urban centers, there are limits. Jamie Robinson,
a health economics expert at UC Berkeley, said that companies such as
Sutter Health, the dominant hospital operator in the Oakland-Berkeley
area, have the clout to tell a health insurer that it either adds all
of its hospitals to the preferred list or none at all. In fact, all
of Sutter's hospitals are on Blue Shield's top list.</TE>
<TE>   Sutter declined to comment for this article, as did Santa
Barbara-based Tenet HealthCare, the biggest for-profit hospital
operator in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   For many consumers, whether tiering becomes an issue may come down
to where they live. Which hospitals in their area are on the
insurer's preferred list? And which ones are their doctors affiliated
with?</TE>
<TE>   The staff at California Public Employees Retirement System, the
state's biggest purchaser of insurance, weighed hospital tiering as
an option in its recent renewal negotiations. Allen Feezor, CalPERS'
health administrator, said there was a concern over how tiering would
affect the doctor-patient relationship. What would happen, he asked,
if a member's referring physician did not have admission privileges
to hospitals on an insurer's preferred list?</TE>
<TE>   "It would subject me to a penalty, perhaps $200 a day, for going
to his hospital," Feezor said. "It's an issue of patient care
continuity. How do you justify the bind you put the enrollees in, in
regard to their doctors?"</TE>
<TE>   In the end, CalPERS rejected the tiered pricing plan, instead
accepting an average 25% hike in its HMO premiums next year, about a
third of which will be passed on to its 1.2 million members.</TE>
<TE>   Many employers cannot afford or are unwilling to absorb such hefty
premium increases.</TE>
<TE>   Verteq Inc., a Tustin supplier to the semiconductor industry, is
fairly typical of the bind that smaller companies face. Through much
of the 1990s, Verteq covered the annual premium increases for its
employees, largely for competitive reasons, said Catherine McLaren,
human resource manager. But in the last couple of years, as premiums
jumped by double digits, Verteq asked employees to pay more of the
cost. When insurance renewals came up this spring, McLaren said, it
didn't take long for the firm to go with PacifiCare's new plan,
called Select Hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "That one stood out," she said, noting that it cut her company's
premium increases by 20%.</TE>
<TE>   McLaren, a Fountain Valley resident, said she was happy with the
choice. All her favorite hospitals are on the preferred list. But
Jeanne Moore, a product marketing manager at Verteq, wasn't thrilled.
Moore, who lives in Corona, said she has only one hospital in
Riverside County that she can use without the $100 daily co-payment.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Moore said, she has a high regard for that hospital.
But it's still just one place, she said. "If you have only one
hospital, that means you don't have a choice."</TE>

<DH>Hollywood: Charismatic, yet unproven actors like Vin Diesel
and the Rock get rich as studios bid for the next Sly Stallone, Bruce
Willis or Arnold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dwayne Johnson and Mark Vincent are two of Hollywood's hottest
commodities.</LD>
<LD>   Who?</LD>
<LD>   Maybe you know them by the brand names the studios are trying to
sear into your consciousness--the Rock and Vin Diesel--action hunks
whose paychecks have jumped millions of dollars in a single bound.</LD>
<TE>   They are the leading men in the industry's latest gambit to
instantly create a new generation of action stars for movies that can
spawn sequels and prequels, generating hundreds of millions of
dollars around the world from ticket sales, DVDs, promotional tie-ins
and TV deals. In the business, these are called "franchise" movies.</TE>
<TE>   With escalating costs of producing and marketing films, the
entertainment giants that control Hollywood are frantically trying to
produce blockbusters that have the potential to just keep on giving.
To do so, the studios are engaged in a checkbook war to manufacture
successors to such aging action heroes as Arnold Schwarzenegger,
Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a corporate mentality among multinational companies that
we need brand names, whether it's Coke, Pepsi, Nike, Vin Diesel or
the Rock," said director Rob Cohen, whose surprise hit "The Fast and
the Furious" fuel-injected Diesel's career.</TE>
<TE>   The attitude in the industry these days, Cohen said, is: "We're
not going to wait for them to be stars, we're going to make them
stars, demand that the media treat them like stars and we'll pay them
like stars and ultimately some, in fact, will become stars."</TE>
<TE>   As Warner Bros. President Alan Horn put it: "It doesn't take five
pictures to grind your way to stardom if you have a distinct persona
like Vin Diesel or the Rock."</TE>
<TE>   The Rock, a 30-year-old wrestling superstar, was paid more than $5
million by Universal Pictures for his first starring role in the
newly released "The Scorpion King," a box-office hit that all but
guarantees him $20 million for the planned sequel.</TE>
<TE>   Not a bad bump for a guy who got $500,000 for his debut film, "The
Mummy Returns," last summer.</TE>
<TE>   The Rock's marketable name and memorable image are being exploited
to lure moviegoers unaware of his routines in the ring. His name
appears above the title of "Scorpion King" in every poster,
billboard, newspaper ad and TV spot promoting the new film, a prequel
to "The Mummy Returns."</TE>
<TE>   Vin Diesel, meanwhile, has seen his salary soar tenfold. The beefy
34-year-old actor with a throaty voice and shaved head was paid $1
million for the car-racing film "The Fast and the Furious," and he
wasn't even cast as the star. But the audience--young, multiethnic
and demographically desirable--went crazy over him. So did Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   In the industry's eyes, the actor who was once a bouncer at
hip New York nightclubs suddenly transcended the kind of ensemble roles
he played in such films as "Saving Private Ryan" and "Boiler Room."</TE>
<TE>   The transformation was not lost on Diesel.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the success of "The Fast and the Furious," he
left on vacation with instructions for his agent not to bother him
unless someone ponied up a whopping $10 million for his next picture.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Roth, the former head of Disney Studios who now runs
independently financed Revolution Studios, reluctantly stepped
forward with the money for an actor he acknowledged is "totally
unproven" as a star.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Roth concluded that Diesel would be perfect in the upcoming
summer spy thriller "XXX." The tattooed Diesel plays an extreme
sports rebel recruited by the government to infiltrate a Russian
crime ring.</TE>
<TE>   "I had ambivalent feelings about giving someone that giant of a
raise after one hit movie," Roth said. "But you're in a business of
taking risks. It's a business of hunches."</TE>
<TE>   And Roth has a hunch that Diesel is going to turn "XXX" into a
platinum franchise. Although the movie, directed by Cohen, doesn't
open until August, Diesel already has been promised $20 million for a
potential sequel.</TE>
<TE>   Roth can remember when the word "franchise" wasn't even part of
the Hollywood vernacular.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, the year before he became movie chairman at 20th Century
Fox, the studio's action film "Die Hard" with Bruce Willis had been a
huge success in theaters and on video. But to Roth's surprise, there
was no sequel in development. He had the idea of turning a book
titled "58 Minutes" into "Die Hard 2." It became a bigger hit than
the original.</TE>
<TE>   That scenario would not happen today.</TE>
<TE>   Now movie sequels are plotted far in advance, before the first
film is even shot, so they can be rolled out and repackaged.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Columbia Pictures has a slate full of them. They
include sequels to "Men in Black" and "Stuart Little," as well as two
films envisioned as franchises--"XXX" and "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   It appears that studio chief Amy Pascal gambled right on the
unlikely casting of dramatic actor Tobey Maguire as the star of
"Spider-Man," paying him $4 million for the first film and
guaranteeing him a combined $23 million for two sequels. Sources said
"Spider-Man" grossed an estimated record of $39 million on Friday
when it debuted, putting it on track to have the biggest opening
weekend in movie history.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to create stars; that's what the movies are about,"
Pascal said. "Hollywood decides that somebody is hot and everyone
clamors for them. The whole bet is getting in on the ground floor of
a rising star's career."</TE>
<TE>   And the anointed aren't complaining.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm the locomotive, the actor driving those sales, I want to
be paid for it," said entertainment analyst Jeffrey Logsdon. "This is
a business now where you can become a star overnight and the pay that
used to come over time comes immediately."</TE>
<TE>   For the studios, the stakes have never been higher. In a highly
competitive market, with as many as six films debuting in multiplexes
at the same time, studios are spending an average of $30 million to
promote each one of them, hoping for big opening weekend grosses to
help recoup their hefty investments.</TE>
<TE>   Movies that do not take hold fade quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Opening weekends also are crucial to studios because they get to
keep a larger percentage of the box-office receipts under their deals
with theater operators. For highly anticipated movies, which
exhibitors know will sell more tickets and popcorn, the studios can
use their leverage to keep as much as 70% of the proceeds during the
first two weekends. Later, their cut can shrink to as little as 35%.</TE>
<TE>   Some global franchises don't need star power to draw crowds on
their opening weekends. The phenomenal success of two movies last
year was propelled by best-selling books--"Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring."</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, George Lucas' legendary "Star Wars" series is a
cultural phenomenon whose good-versus-evil theme, colorful characters
and special effects keep millions of hard-core fans coming back.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are plenty of movies that need marquee names--whether
established or newly minted.</TE>
<TE>   "The pressures to break through the clutter and open a movie is
greater now than ever," said Warner Bros.' Horn. "Therefore, star value as
a component of the decision-making process has greater weight than ever."</TE>
<TE>   Although lesser-known in Hollywood than the Rock or Vin Diesel,
others have become beneficiaries, too.</TE>
<TE>   Rap artist DMX, whose given name is Earl Simmons, got a
multimillion-dollar, three-picture deal from Warner Bros. after he
helped make the studio's action movie "Exit Wounds" the top-grossing
film on its opening weekend in March last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The newcomers are emerging with a more accelerated pace than we
were accustomed to in the past," said Universal Pictures Vice
Chairman Marc Shmuger. "Not only do we view them as brands, they view
themselves that way and they understand what that means."</TE>
<TE>   The hunt for newcomers has become so frenetic that even
actors with bad track records can get stunning pay hikes, merely on the
chance that they are one hit away from breaking away from the pack.</TE>
<TE>   Witness Colin Farrell, the handsome young Irish actor whose
credits include the flops "Tigerland," "American Outlaws" and most
recently MGM's "Hart's War."</TE>
<TE>   But Spyglass Entertainment, which financed the supernatural
powerhouse "The Sixth Sense," sees something that audiences haven't.
The company thinks Farrell's popularity will rocket this summer when
he co-stars with Tom Cruise in another studio's movie, "Minority
Report," directed by Steven Spielberg.</TE>
<TE>   Based on that guess, Spyglass paid Farrell $5 million to star as a
young CIA recruit opposite Al Pacino in the thriller "The Farm,"
which will be released by Disney later this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The logic is very simple," said Spyglass Chief Executive Gary
Barber. "It's like buying stock or futures. It's in anticipation of
the price going up, and in a year's time, it's going to be worth more
than it is today."</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes the market goes south.</TE>
<TE>   Following the surprise success of her 1995 teen comedy "Clueless,"
18-year-old Alicia Silverstone landed a $10-million deal to star in
and produce two movies for Columbia Pictures. Instantly, she became
one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses.</TE>
<TE>   Only one movie was made, "Excess Baggage," and that died at the
box office. She got $5 million. The studio got left holding the bag.
Today, Silverstone is resurrecting her career on Broadway, playing
Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine, in "The Graduate."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood executives who have been around long enough know that
the high expectations surrounding hot new talent--so-called heat--can
sometimes be a mirage.</TE>
<TE>   "Heat is a tricky thing," said 20th Century Fox Co-Chairman Tom
Rothman. "Sometimes it can keep you warm, sometimes you can get
burned."</TE>

<HD>6 More Bombs Are Found in Midwest</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A rash of pipe-bomb incidents spread westward Saturday with the
discovery of explosive devices in six rural mailboxes in eastern
Nebraska. Federal agents descended on the region to investigate links
to bombs found a day earlier in Iowa and Illinois.</LD>
<LD>   None of the pipe bombs in Nebraska exploded, and no one was
reported hurt, authorities said. Fourteen pipe bombs have now been
found since Friday, widening what the FBI described as a "domestic
terrorism" investigation.</LD>
<LD>   At least one of the six pipe bombs found in Nebraska included a
note. Although it was damaged when authorities detonated the pipe
bomb, investigators suspect that the note may be similar to an angry,
rambling letter left with each of the Iowa and Illinois pipe bombs.
That note said the bombs were an "attention getter" to expose
government abuses.</LD>
<TE>   Federal authorities in Nebraska and Iowa called Saturday on
whoever planted the bombs to turn himself in before someone else gets
hurt. Six people were injured in Friday's attacks, one seriously, and
a 14-year-old girl in Iowa narrowly escaped injury when she was
delivering newspapers, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "To whoever is involved, very definitely they do have our
attention," Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns said at a news conference. "We
have heard you."</TE>
<TE>   The pipe bombs found Saturday in Nebraska--in Davenport, Ohiowa,
Scotia, Cairo, Columbus and Seward--appeared to be similar to those
discovered Friday in northwest Illinois and eastern Iowa, authorities
said. FBI agent Weysan Dun described the Nebraska devices as
"metallic pipes of roughly 1 inch by 6 inches long, in some cases
with wires or a battery."</TE>
<TE>   None of the bombs in any of the three states was sent through the
mail.</TE>
<TE>   But for the second time since last fall--when the spread of
anthrax through the mail on the East Coast killed five people and
sickened many others--postal authorities were warning people Saturday
to take extra precautions to guard against attacks. Postal officials
said people handling parcels in roadside mailboxes in rural
areas--the kind used in most of the attacks since Friday--should use
"extreme caution."</TE>
<TE>   "If customers see wires, strings or other suspicious materials on,
in, or around their mailboxes or see any suspicious activity around
mailboxes, they should immediately leave the area and contact local
law enforcement agents," U.S. postal officials in Iowa said.</TE>
<TE>   In Davenport, Neb., the pipe bomb was discovered Saturday when a
homeowner noticed that a package looked suspicious and appeared to
have something attached to it. He threw it in a ditch and called
police, neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   Although no one was hurt in Nebraska, residents were clearly
unnerved.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody around here is pretty shocked for a rural area
like ours to have such things going on," said a manager at a
Davenport grocery, who asked that her name not be used because "I
don't want someone to put one in my mailbox."</TE>
<TE>   At the grocery, people were speculating Saturday about whether the
culprit had headed west from Iowa along Interstate 80 or whether the
latest bombs might be the work of a copycat bomber. "We just don't
know what to make of this," the manager said.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess we all better keep on our toes," said Keith Hermann, 28,
of Grand Island, Neb., manager of a restaurant near another site
where a pipe bomb was found.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb found in Ohiowa, population 125, was the talk of the town
Saturday--and everybody was asking Cathy Meyer about it. She was
Ohiowa's postmaster until two weeks ago, when budget cuts hit and she
was laid off.</TE>
<TE>   "We're out in the middle of no man's land," Meyer said. "I don't
know what they're doing out here."</TE>
<TE>   The Seward bomb, which appeared to include a note, was found in a
residential area late Saturday night. It was similar to the other
devices and was detonated by the Nebraska State Patrol without
injury, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The pipe bombs did not prompt officials in Washington to take any
immediate steps to raise the threat level under a terrorist warning
system put in place after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon. The threat level stands at "yellow," third
in a five-tier system, signifying that there is a "significant" risk
of a terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Jimmy Orr said, "Authorities at all levels
are monitoring the situation."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to urging people to take precautions in handling mail,
authorities asked the public to carefully study the language used in
Friday's notes in the hopes of identifying who wrote them. That
investigative tool helped lead authorities to Unabomber Theodore A.
Kaczynski, whose brother recognized language that Kaczynski used in
an anti-government manifesto published in several newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   In Friday's notes, the suspect began his missive by saying:
"Mailboxes are exploding! Why, you ask?"</TE>
<TE>   The note went on to discuss death, wealth and freedom, and said:
"If the government controls what you want to do, they control what
you do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm obtaining your attention in the only way I can. More info is
on the way. More 'attention getters' are on the way," the note
warned.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials in Nebraska said they have been in contact with
their counterparts in Iowa and Illinois to coordinate their
investigations. Officials said they have "a number of promising
leads" but said their best hope is for the culprit to turn himself
in.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to assure this individual that we are actively listening
to what he has to say," said Charles W. Larson Sr., the U.S. attorney
for the northern district of Iowa, echoing sentiments expressed by
Nebraska authorities. "We hope he will take this opportunity to
resolve this situation without further injury or unnecessary loss of
life to innocent people."</TE>

<HD>Relatives Gather at Fatal Jail Fire</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAKERSVILLE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Families and relatives gathered Saturday at the site of a fire that
swept through a county jail in western North Carolina, killing eight
inmates and injuring 13 people.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators spent Saturday probing the cause of the blaze at the
Mitchell County jail in Bakersville, a small town near the state
border with Tennessee.</LD>
<LD>   The Friday night blaze engulfed the two-story, brick building in
dense smoke, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The cause of the fire was not known, although investigators
believe it began accidentally in a storage area of the 47-year-old
building, according to a statement from Mitchell County emergency
communications.</TE>
<TE>   Among the dead was an inmate on a weekend sentencing program and
another man who was soon to be freed.</TE>
<TE>   Mark and Melanie Thomas, parents of 20-year-old Mark Thomas, who
was serving in a weekend sentencing program for a drinking-related
offense, clutched each other on a street near the jail.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why they all had to die," said a weeping Melanie
Thomas. "He would get depressed to have to go to jail on the
weekends, but he said it was for his own good."</TE>
<TE>   Family and friends mourned Edmond Banks, 46, who had 21 days left
before finishing his sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "From what we heard, they did all they could do," said a family
friend, Wanda Yelton, of rescue efforts.</TE>
<TE>   But Banks' sister, Diane Farley, blamed authorities for not
renovating the aging building.</TE>
<TE>   "The place was not fit for a dog," Farley said, tears rolling down
her face. "They should have been spending time on rebuilding the jail
instead of building a new courthouse."</TE>

<HD>Air Show Is Infused With Newfound Spirit</HD>
<DH>Military: The crowds at the massive event in Florida feel a
special connection with the nation's defenders after the turbulent
events of the last eight months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>It bills itself as the nation's biggest thank you note to the
military, and this year, Americans clearly had reasons to be
grateful.</LD>
<LD>   This weekend, the skies and seas off this South Florida resort
city are filled with some of the latest in U.S. military hardware,
including the Navy's most recently commissioned aircraft carrier, the
Harry S. Truman, and the bat-winged B-2 Stealth bomber.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday afternoon, Marines in full combat gear rode on P7
amphibious assault vehicles and crashed onto the sandy beach in a
mock landing, and the Navy's Blue Angels performed high-speed
aerobatics.</LD>
<TE>   The spectacle brought tears to the eyes of Carol Kilroy, a
54-year-old sales representative from Windermere, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally awesome and I'm totally proud of all of them," the
Huntington Beach native said. "It gives you a clear eye as to what's
really going on and what they have to go through, being on the front
lines and all that."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, Fort Lauderdale was casting around for an event to
prolong its tourist season and replace spring break, the student
bacchanalia that had given the city the unwelcome nickname of "Fort
Liquordale," said Elaine Fitzgerald, a spokeswoman for the Air &amp; Sea
Show.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, an impresario from Chicago named Mickey Markoff organized
the first display of American military might here, with corporate
sponsors helping underwrite expenses.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 800,000 people turned out that first year. This
weekend, if organizers' estimates are correct, as many as 3 million
people could attend what's considered the biggest air show in the
world and the most lavish display of the contemporary equipment and
talents of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, according to Gordon
Bowman-Jones, a professional air show announcer.</TE>
<TE>   For the military, the show even has become a prime occasion to
troll for new talent. On Saturday, Army recruiters set up an
artificial rock-climbing wall near the A1A beachfront highway and
encouraged visitors to try to scale it.</TE>
<TE>   "This show is the biggest event as far as recruiting goes for the
U.S. Army," said Staff Sgt. Phillip Woolsey, 24. "People can see us,
and see what the Army has to offer."</TE>
<TE>   Recruiters were taking the names and phone numbers of climbers,
Woolsey said, and will call to see whether they're interested in
enlisting.</TE>
<TE>   This is the third year that Staff Sgt. Allen Murphy, 31, has
pulled duty at the Air &amp; Sea Show, and the veteran said he detected a
distinct change in visitors' attitudes toward the military this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been more positive," Murphy said. "People paying us
compliments, wanting to take their pictures with us. We've been
getting noticed."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's crowds, which gathered in sweltering sunshine along a
four-mile stretch of oceanfront, clapped and cheered especially
loudly for the hardware that has been used during Operation Enduring
Freedom in Afghanistan, including the B-52 bomber, the F/A-18 Hornet
fighter/attack aircraft and the F-14 Tomcat fighter. Streaking by at
an ear-splitting 500 mph, six Blue Angels in their F-18s dedicated
one maneuver to all American forces deployed to track down those
responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "In my 10 years with the Navy, I've always felt we had a strong
relationship with the community, but since Sept. 11, it's grown
stronger," said Lt. Chris Loundermon, a Navy spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "We were attacked in our own backyard and have been fighting for
our very freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Split-second coordination is required at the event, which also
features civilian stunt fliers and vintage aircraft, including a PBY
flying boat, B-25 bomber and F-86F Sabre fighter. Military aircraft
converge on Fort Lauderdale from numerous bases, with the B-2 flying
from its home field at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   "The pilots have to be within six seconds of the schedule,"
Fitzgerald said.</TE>
<TE>   Some participants sounded as enthusiastic as the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Two miles above the crowd, Staff Sgt. Calvin Fredlake, a member of
the Army's Golden Knights parachute team, jumped out of an aircraft
and rocketed earthward at up to 170 mph. Trailing an American flag,
the 31-year-old from Guttenberg, Iowa, landed precisely on a small X
placed on the sand. Fred- lake said he had felt that millions of eyes
were upon him.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so great to jump by the ocean with a crowd that you can see
forever, up and down the beach," he said. "I feel like a movie star
right now--that's what's going through my mind."</TE>

<HD>The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Ranter</HD>
<DH>Self-Exiled Hollywood Whiz Kid David Rosenthal Thinks He Knows the
Truth. The Question Is, Does Anyone Care?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET REITMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Here's the thing," says David Rosenthal, former television writer
and self-styled Hollywood whistleblower. "When you give up a job that's
paying $2.5 million a year, and you write a play that's full of very foul
language, and you do it without preparing your parents for it, some
people are going to freak out."</LD>
<LD>   Rosenthal laughs, picking at his fruit plate over breakfast at the
trendy Mercer Kitchen restaurant in New York, where he now lives.</LD>
<LD>   He's no stranger to freakouts. It has been almost two years since
Rosenthal, a member of Hollywood's inner circle of hot young sitcom
writers (his credits include "Ellen" and "Spin City") deep-sixed his
13-year television career by walking out on a lucrative development deal
at 20th Century Fox Television. Since then, the story of his crash and
burn--his divorce, his infatuation with supermodels, his disastrous foray
as a playwright, his decision to give huge sums of money to women he
barely knows--has been repeated so often in both L.A. and New York that
it has become something of an urban legend.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm under no illusions," he says. "I knew when I did this that people
were going to think I was crazy. But ultimately they're going to discover
that I'm not. And they're going to have to look at themselves and think,
'Huh! Why was I so quick to judge David? What was so threatening about
what David did?' And the answer is because the men who run Hollywood are
incredibly greedy people. To them, life is a zero-sum game.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember an agent telling me once, 'I will stab that guy in the
back in a minute for you.' Well, A) that's creepy; B) if he'd stab that
guy in the back in a minute for me, well, guess what, he'd stab me in the
back in a minute for that guy. And I thought, wow, I cannot trust these
agents, I will not trust them--they aren't interested in me, they aren't
interested in what I think or feel, they are only interested in their own
ego and their own power."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal pauses to take a breath. "It's appalling what goes on in
Hollywood, it really is. . . . I defy you to get people to disagree with
me."</TE>
<TE>   So begins a three-hour discourse on the evils of Hollywood. David
Rosenthal, in case you haven't guessed, is angry. He's also willing,
eager, to tell you about his anger. In depth. With gusto. It's a lonely
rant, and it probably won't matter very much in the long run, given that
most of Rosenthal's former colleagues have long since dismissed him as
troubled and irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Rosenthal believes that after 13 years in the trenches,
he is uniquely qualified to tell us a few hard truths about the TV
business.</TE>
<TE>   Truth #1: Hollywood is a cesspool of white male sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Truth #2: Agents are, by and large, "leeches." They care mostly about
money and prostitutes. Truth #3: TV writers can be coarse and
horrifyingly misogynistic. They tell bawdy and derogatory jokes at the
expense of female colleagues, and sink even lower when it's boys only.
Truth #4: Most executives couldn't care less about the interests of
minorities, which explains the dearth of Asian American or Latino sitcoms
on television. Overall, the entire town is riddled with terrible, awful
people. Loathsome, in fact.</TE>
<TE>   That's Rosenthal's Truth. The question is, do we care? Unsavory though
it may be, the hurly-burly world of entertainment bigwigs isn't exactly
Big News in Hollywood. Nor are the number of disaffected writers,
directors, actors, you-name-its who have fled the shark tank for safer
waters. Some, including the late Julia Phillips, have exorcised their
show-biz demons in books; others, such as Robert Altman, work it out
through their films. Rosenthal simply wants to talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal's former colleagues aren't interested in anything Rosenthal
has to say. Most are unwilling to discuss him at all, in fact. The few
who are willing to talk do so largely on the condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   From an anonymous agent at the Endeavor Agency: "Why are you even
writing this? It's an old, tiring story. Nobody cares."</TE>
<TE>   From a former associate at Dreamworks Television: "It's sad what
happened to David, it really is. He was smart. Really, really smart.
Maybe too smart."</TE>
<TE>   From Richard Weitz, one of Rosenthal's former agents: "I wish him the
best of luck."</TE>
<TE>   From Ari Emanuel, Rosenthal's other former agent: [Silence] So, then,
this is a story about wild success and total failure. And redemption.
Sort of.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal is a rabbi's son from suburban lawrenceville, n.j.,whose
biggest dream in life was to write successful sitcoms. He graduated from
the University of Pennsylvania in the spring of 1989 and soon afterward
bought a one-way ticket to Los Angeles. Through family friends, he landed
a job as a production assistant on the ABC sitcom "Anything but Love."</TE>
<TE>   Within a year he was hired as a staff writer. There he came to the
attention of "Wonder Years" creator Neil Marlens, at the time one of the
most influential producers in television. Marlens liked the kid, thought
he was funny. By age 24, Rosenthal was heading the writing department on
Marlens' new sitcom, "Ellen," starring Ellen DeGeneres. At 26, he was on
his own, developing comedy shows for Jeffrey Katzenberg. By 27, he was
writing for "Spin City." By 28, he was running the show. Four years
later, he married a fellow "Spin City" writer and was the owner of a
five-bedroom home with a pool. He had a convertible Porsche and new job
at Fox Television, where he was paid $2.5 million to, as one former
colleague says, "think funny."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal, in other words, was a young man living The Dream. Then he
woke up and decided his life was meaningless.</TE>
<TE>   What propelled Rosenthal into his downward spiral was the sudden
realization that all he really wanted from life was to have sex with
supermodel Heidi Klum, an occasional guest star on "Spin City" whom
Rosenthal describes as "the most beautiful woman I've ever met."</TE>
<TE>   He found Klum smart, sensitive, sweet, beautiful--yet another
revelation, given that, as an industry man, Rosenthal had previously
thought of beautiful women as "pieces of meat." He would marry Heidi
Klum, he realized, if only she weren't already married. The idea of that
was too much for him, so Rosenthal decided the sensible thing to do was
to quit Fox, divorce his wife, sell his Porsche and give more than $1
million, in $52,000 grants, to 20 young women, several of whom he'd never
met, but whose artistic pursuits he believed in.</TE>
<TE>   He labeled this giveaway a "scholarship program" and called it "The
Creators."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal then wrote a play which he called "Love" and laced it with
so much profanity that it carried an NC-17 rating. In it, Rosenthal
outlined his views on sex, marriage, sex, monogamy, even more sex, and
his desire to have sex with Klum. Rosenthal sent "Love" to Emanuel and
Weitz, his agents at Endeavor. They balked and promptly dropped Rosenthal
from their client list. He also sent a copy to his father in New Jersey,
who briefly had Rosenthal committed to the psychiatric unit at UCLA
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Most kids rebel when they're 15 or 16. I waited until I was 33,"
Rosenthal says now. "But it was worth it."</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, Rosenthal moved to New York, where he produced "Love" as
an off-Broadway play. It previewed last Sept. 13--two days after the
World Trade Center attacks--opened Sept. 20 and closed shortly thereafter
thanks to universally miserable reviews. (New York magazine called the
play "inane"; CurtainUp, an online theater magazine, considered it
"repetitive and tiresome" and suggested the playwright find a
professional to listen to his problems rather than "asking amateurs to
pay.")</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal remained sanguine. "I knew it was going to bomb," he says
today. "But it was my attempt at being honest. It's my truth."</TE>
<TE>   But now it's a warm february morning, the kind of day that draws the
lissome young women of Soho outdoors. Rosenthal sips his tea in one of
Mercer Kitchen's corner booths. Dressed in a gray turtleneck sweater and
jeans, he is checking out women, trying not to be obvious. A blond in a
long coat and sunglasses whooshes past our table and out the front door.
Rosenthal whips his head around.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Meg Ryan," he says. "I love her."</TE>
<TE>   He considers running out on the street to say hi. Then he pauses. He's
never met Meg Ryan, he admits. So he lets the moment pass.</TE>
<TE>   This, too, is all part of Rosenthal's New Truth. Since moving to New
York, he has tried to be "real,"--as best as he can. He finds the
anonymity of New York City a "huge relief" after the incestuousness of
Hollywood, and in keeping with that spirit, he has banished all reminders
of his past life. He has neither a cell phone nor an e-mail address, and
claims not to own a computer.</TE>
<TE>   He walks the streets of Manhattan in self-imposed exile, writes
(longhand) in cafes, takes in the museums and claims to have seen every
movie in town. He is "reassessing." He frequents local bookstores and
sits in Central Park. Recently, Rosenthal took a long walk in Queens--he
isn't sure where, exactly, but wherever it was, there was a really cool
coffee shop. "To me, New York represents the American Dream," he says.
"It's awesome."</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal uses the word "awesome" without a trace of cynicism. Now 34,
he exudes boyish wonder. He is genuinely excited by things most New
Yorkers find simply annoying, including the feel of the subway rumbling
beneath a movie theater, or the "village" (read: insanely crowded)
atmosphere of Soho.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, as much as he loves New York, Rosenthal hasn't left
Hollywood, not really. To leave means to move on. Rosenthal hasn't. He
has become an agent for social change--or so he'd like to think. His
mission  is to shame Hollywood executives into becoming more inclusive of
women and minorities, both in the boardroom and office suites, and in
terms of programming.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, the one thing that really resonated for me throughout my
entire tenure in Hollywood was the degree to which women are
disrespected," he says. "It was a shock to me."</TE>
<TE>   It's not surprising that the full dimensions of real-life gender
politics might have eluded a boy who became a player as young as
Rosenthal did. When he furrows his brow, the affectation makes him seem
at once anxious and sweetly naive.</TE>
<TE>   "So I got to sit and listen and watch and observe what goes on behind
closed doors when the only people in the room are rich white men. And
when it's only rich white men they're terrible. They're smug, they're
arrogant. And they're misogynistic."</TE>
<TE>   He details a few choice remarks made by TV writers at the expense of
female colleagues, including his ex-wife. He seems truly repulsed. "I
just saw all these women get eaten alive by the men and nobody cared, and
there was nothing anybody could do about it because it was so insidious.
And it's so much a part of the culture of television. The environment
that women have to go through to get to [any high position] is completely
unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Championing the cause of women in Hollywood is a noble idea, though
Rosenthal has no discernible plan of action other than to discuss the
inequities of the entertainment business with anyone who'll listen. What
he does have is money. He has, or so he claims, enough money to live
comfortably for the rest of his life. It has provided him with a New
Yorker's dream: a spacious apartment in a hip neighborhood, and the
ability to leave the city, as he did in January when he jetted off to
Hawaii on the spur of the moment.</TE>
<TE>   It also has provided 20 women with their dream: $1,000 per week for a
year to create art--any kind of art, from writing to painting to acting.
There is no quid pro quo. There are also no prerequisites, other than
that one must be female with a desire to create and no real opportunity
to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, I was like, 'What?' " says Creator scholarship recipient
Erica Clare, a 31-year-old actress. She was an office manager on
Rosenthal's floor at Fox Television. Many Creators came from the
assistant pool at Fox, she says. Others were recommended--sight
unseen--through friends.</TE>
<TE>   "It all happened within a couple of days. A friend called me and said
David wanted to give money to women so we could pursue our art, and he
was looking for diversity," says Clare, who is African American. She was
floored. "He seemed to be very angry that Hollywood was such a boy's club
and that women didn't have the same chances as men."</TE>
<TE>   After some thought, she decided to take Rosenthal up on his offer. "It
wasn't as if there was any selfish motivations. I've seen David with
people, and he's incredibly generous. I actually think David is kind of
compelled to be generous."</TE>
<TE>   Clare used the money to regroup and focus on her acting. She hasn't
gotten her big break, yet. Then again, she's decided she never wants to
be an office manager again, nor take any job that she doesn't love. Ever.</TE>
<TE>   Other recipients feel equally liberated. "It's not about money, it's
about shaping a young woman's perspective. And it did change my
perspective," says one 28-year-old woman, who asked that her name not be
used. She's a songwriter and feels that Rosenthal has given her "a room
of one's own."</TE>
<TE>   "All I'm saying is if you're going to give the opportunity to somebody
in our culture, young women are a great place to start," says Rosenthal.
"I really benefited from the system. I got totally rewarded for my work
and my effort and I felt the system was open to me. Now I want women and
minorities to feel the system is open to them."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's Rosenthal's point. Maybe that's enough. Maybe that's why
he wants to talk so much, because maybe the more you're hated, the more
people talk about you. Hatred breeds controversy. Controversy means
discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Is Rosenthal crazy? "Ask women," he suggests. "Some are going to say,
'Yeah, that guy is totally nuts and I completely disagree with everything
he said.' Or the women are going to say, 'You know what? He has a point.'
I have a point. I will shame them. Absolutely."</TE>

<DH>For Years a Giant Company Has Been Mining in West Virginia's Big
Coal River Valley, Heedless of the People Living There. Now the Process
Is Destroying the Mountains Themselves, and Residents Are Fighting Back.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER SLAVIN</AU>
<BD>Peter Slavin is a writer based in Oakton, Va. He has been following
events along the Big Coal River for seven years</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Judy Bonds, her daughter and grandson were the last ones out. They
packed up and left Marfork hollow early last year, the rear guard of more
than 50 families in a community that had existed for nearly a
century--until the A.T. Massey Coal Co. arrived on this stretch of the
Big Coal River in southern West Virginia. The company mined in Marfork
around the clock as if no one lived there, blasting their way into coal
seams, noisily loading more than 100 railroad cars at a time, blanketing
the town with black coal dust and discharging blackwater coal residue
into the stream that fed the water supply. "Living in a hellhole,"
neighbors used to say to Bonds.</LD>
<LD>   Above them, like the Sword of Damocles, stood a dam taller than the
Grand Coulee, holding billions of gallons of coal waste. Its collapse
would have sent a wall of blackwater to drown them.</LD>
<LD>   For years, residents gathered daily near Marfork's entrance to protest
conditions. Massey security guards filmed them. "They'd drive up and down
the hardtop road with their video cameras," recalls Roger Daniel, who
eventually moved to North Carolina. Massey also installed a number of
small, powerful cameras, which Daniel and others say were sometimes
trained on people's homes. The company installed outside lighting so
bright that there was no need to turn on lights inside houses. At the
time, they say, Massey was running TV ads calling itself a good neighbor.</LD>
<TE>   Bonds stayed as long as she could, partly on principle--she hated the
company--and partly out of attachment to Marfork. She found pleasure in
the blue jays and doves that flew in each day to their feeders, the same
woodpecker that returned every spring and the sounds of the Little League
park in the summer. A coal miner's daughter, she had lived in the hollow
virtually all of her life. Etched in her memory of childhood are a grove
of paw paw trees, her mother's hog pen, her grandpa's mule and the smell
of the earth in the freshly turned garden.</TE>
<TE>   She finally gave up when her grandson developed asthma, which the
doctor blamed on coal dust. The family moved 12 miles to a nice house
near Rock Creek hollow, perhaps the most beautiful place in the Coal
River Valley. But they could not escape Massey. The company was right
behind them, doing preliminary drilling in that hollow. The company, now
known as Massey Energy Co., has already blasted the top off Montcoal
Mountain. Now it plans to march down the valley with this form of strip
mining, one so marvelously efficient that over the last two to three
decades, Massey and other coal companies have begun relying on it
throughout Appalachia.</TE>
<TE>   Called mountaintop removal, it's a technique that devastates
everything in its path, decapitating mountains and filling the valleys
and streams with the rubble. The watchdog group American Rivers has twice
named Coal River (officially known as Big Coal River) one of the nation's
most endangered because of the massive amounts of debris dumped into its
tributaries.</TE>
<TE>   Massey CEO Don Blankenship rarely grants interviews, and would not for
this story. The company also declined to provide details about its mines,
which have yielded hundreds of millions of tons of high-grade coal but
left the valley with almost nothing to show for it--not even many jobs.
Massey, a notoriously anti-union firm, and its contractors prefer to
bring in miners from elsewhere--Virginia, Kentucky and other parts of
West Virginia--rather than hire local workers, apparently fearing the
valley's strong union tradition. This used to be United Mine Workers of
America country.</TE>
<TE>   A generation of unemployed young men has left the valley for work
elsewhere, accelerating the region's economic descent since the 1970s.
Merchants continually go under, leaving gas stations-cum-convenience
stores seemingly the only establishments that can make it.</TE>
<TE>   Schools have closed one by one as enrollment dropped, and citizens had
to get a court injunction to keep one of the two remaining high schools
open.</TE>
<TE>   Many locals believe Massey's strategy is to let things get so bad on
the river that virtually everyone will pull up and leave, permitting
mountaintop removal to proceed unchecked.</TE>
<TE>   How West Virginia can tolerate such economic and environmental ruin
might be puzzling to a Californian, whose state has the luxury of immense
wealth and economic diversity--not to mention strong environmental
sensibilities. But West Virginia is poor--always has been poor--and
vertical. Mountains stretch from border to border, ruling out most
industries other than mining, logging and, lately, tourism.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since 19th century land companies obtained mineral rights for a
song from people living in the mountains, coal companies headquartered in
Eastern cities have leased the mineral rights and dug the coal. For
decades, miners not only risked life and limb toiling underground but
also depended on the company for everything from food to medical care and
churches. Company towns and the legendary company stores held them in
thrall.</TE>
<TE>   In the capital, Charleston, officials eager to see the state's
resources tapped supported these colonial-like arrangements. Coal
operators were notoriously anti-union and fought the UMW's attempts to
organize. The years before and after World War I saw an epic sequence of
events: a gunfight at Matewan that took the lives of seven coal company
goons, two miners and the mayor; the assassination of Matewan's police
chief, a friend to the miners; and a UMW-led insurrection against the
coal companies and the state by 15,000 armed miners. These events were
part of West Virginia's "mine wars," and some of those fighting Massey
see their struggle as its sequel.</TE>
<TE>   While coal and its affiliated enterprises still form the heart of West
Virginia's economy, the old labor-intensive underground mining, which for
decades employed more than 100,000 miners statewide, has given way to
highly mechanized methods, including mountaintop removal. The
modernization is essential, the industry says, if coal is to compete with
foreign producers. Mountaintop removal can recover 100% of the coal,
compared to 60% at best from conventional underground mines. West
Virginia yielded more coal in the 1990s than in any previous decade while
the number of mining jobs plummeted to 15,000.</TE>
<TE>   Massey began operating in the Coal River Valley in 1981. There was
trouble from the start. The company wanted to mine "union free." The
opening of the Elk Run mine--the first of four massive complexes that
Massey operates in the valley--touched off violence between the union and
the company. Massey security agents had bunkers in the woods and big
dogs, but UMW members struck first, seriously injuring a security guard
and burning property. Scores of union members were arrested during a
months-long organizing battle. Afterward, a judge imposed long-term
restraining orders on the union and a number of members, curbing
organizing efforts for years.</TE>
<TE>   As time passed, Massey steadily replaced UMW miners with nonunion
workers. Others lost their jobs when low coal prices caused mines on the
river to close. In 1984, Massey withdrew from the Bituminous Coal
Operators Assn., which represents employers in industry-wide contract
negotiations, so it could bargain with the UMW mine by mine. The union
responded with a long, bitter strike, but the company prevailed. Massey
began shifting operations to nonunion subsidiary companies and eventually
made nearly all of the valley nonunion. The company also treated miners
well, with good wages, bonuses and perks such as family trips and
picnics, giving workers little reason to organize. Besides, the company
had carefully screened out those miners who had sympathy for the union.</TE>
<TE>   Things started changing in the mid-1990s. With no union to worry
about, Massey cut wages and medical insurance. It adopted a two-tier wage
structure, paying less to new hires and using more contractors who paid
low wages and brought in workers from elsewhere. Relying on contractors
let the corporation avoid the union and sidestep employer liabilities
such as unemployment and worker's compensation. The UMW has tried three
times since 1995 to unionize the work force but has failed narrowly on
each occasion.</TE>
<TE>   The election of George W. Bush proved a boon to the coal industry, as
did the rolling blackouts in California. Crucial to the razor-thin margin
of his victory was his upset in West Virginia, one credited to the
efforts of James H. "Buck" Harless, a West Virginia timber and coal
magnate; William Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Assn.; and
UMW official Dick Kimbler, an advocate of mountaintop removal. Harless
was rewarded with a place on Bush's transition task force on energy. Last
May he joined Massey's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's energy plan has championed coal as the best solution to the
nation's energy problems. "Bush has breathed air into the dead lungs of
the coal industry," says John McCormick, coordinator of the Citizens Coal
Council in Washington, D.C., which fights coal company abuses.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is now moving to preempt a legal threat to
mountaintop removal. The administration fears that a federal judge may
prohibit the dumping of mining rubble into streams and valleys in a
pending Kentucky lawsuit. The same judge created an uproar in 1999 when
he banned "valley fills" on a West Virginia mining project before being
overruled on a technicality that left the issue open. The challengers in
both cases argued that Army Corps of Engineers regulations prohibit such
dumping. The administration intends to simply rewrite those regulations.</TE>
<TE>   In West Virginia, coal continues its cozy relationship with elected
officials. Coal was the top donor in the last two elections to the
speaker of the House, the Senate president and former Gov. Cecil
Underwood, says Norm Steenstra, who directs a citizen lobbying group.
Indeed, there is a revolving door between the industry and government.
Underwood had been a coal company executive, and three of the last four
heads of West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection--mining's
chief overseer--have come from the coal industry. The agency long had a
reputation for carrying the industry's water and ignoring citizen
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   South of Charleston, state route 3 follows the coal river and a
tributary. Coming to this part of Boone and Raleigh counties is to step
back in time half a century. Virtually nothing visible is shiny or modern
or illuminated at night, save the coal facilities. Place names suggest
the valley's rugged history: Pettry Bottom, Dry Creek, Horse Creek,
Peachtree, Clay's Branch.</TE>
<TE>   Along Route 3, cars are hemmed in between the steep hillsides and the
river, sharing the two-lane shoulderless highway with huge coal and
logging trucks. The coal trucks run every day around the clock, often
hauling more than twice the legal weight--as Massey and other coal
operators recently admitted to the state Legislature. They beat up the
roads, crack house foundations, cross the center line on curves and
sometimes lose their brakes on steep hills. Until a recent police
crackdown, a coal truck rumbled through the town of Whitesville every two
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Trucks caused so many potholes and so much dust on one stretch of road
that homeowners sued Massey and forced the company to rebuild. But they
say Massey has let the road deteriorate again. In September, a brother
and sister died near Charleston when an overloaded coal truck rear-ended
their car, spinning it into the path of an oncoming coal truck. Since
then, three other people have died and four have been seriously injured
in collisions with coal trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Three towering sludge dams are a frightening reminder to valley
residents of two previous dam disasters in the region: the 125 lives lost
at Buffalo Creek, W.Va., in 1972 and the 250-million-gallon spill in
Inez, Ky., in 2000 that fouled streams, rivers and drinking water and
ruined aquatic life for miles. Should the Marfork dam break, for example,
the wave of sludge would stand roughly 25 feet tall when it reached
Whitesville, five miles away. The only plan in the event of collapse is,
literally, to head for the hills.</TE>
<TE>   Those risks aside, it is the settlements along Route 3 that tell the
story of modern coal. Most towns are badly run-down, and here and there
pockets of Appalachian-style poverty exist. There are many attractive
homes too, solid brick ramblers, but they usually belong to retired
miners, most with union pensions.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvester, which once was the place to live in the valley, seems to be
reliving Marfork's experience. The giant Elk Run mining site lies just a
few hundred yards away. Heavy dust from a coal preparation plant blankets
Sylvester homes inside and out. Trains make a racket, idling close by for
hours at a time. There is talk that Massey wants to build a conveyor belt
across one end of town, and the company has bought the homes of most
people there.</TE>
<TE>   Continuing south, Route 3 runs through Whitesville, the largest
settlement in the valley. It's only a shell of what it was 25 years ago.
People talk about the old days--the two movie theaters, department store,
two dozen restaurants, taverns, bowling alley and several doctors.
Sidewalks were crowded and parking was hard to find. Now many buildings
are shuttered and parts of town seem decrepit enough to blow away in the
wind.</TE>
<TE>   Montcoal, another huge Massey installation, is draped across a
mountainside south of Whitesville. A red and green conveyor belt runs
above Route 3 like an amusement park ride, then vanishes over the
mountain, carrying raw coal from Montcoal to Marfork for processing. A
small junior high and high school is near the mine.</TE>
<TE>   Sundial, farther south still, has another prep plant where coal is
washed, crushed, sized and blended--a computer-driven affair. A silo
holding the raw coal is 110 feet tall. This Massey facility is home to
the only remaining unionized work force on the river. "Production,
production, production" is the mantra, says miner Richard Scarbro. One
week last summer, he says, Sundial's 22 workers loaded six trains with
coal. Five pulled at least 75 cars.</TE>
<TE>   Close by is an elementary school. On the mountainside above, but hard
to see, is a sludge dam 400 feet high. It holds a lake full of coal
waste, chemicals and toxic heavy metals, including mercury and arsenic.
Remarkably, given what the dam's failure would mean for people below, it
was placed there long after the school was built. Most parents did not
realize it was there until they were shown aerial photos last year.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing remains of the Sundial Tavern, once a landmark and the only
place to get a drink for miles. Massey bought the tavern last spring and
demolished it in August. It had been owned by a harsh critic of the
company, the first community organizer on the river. His wife found the
tension too much, Massey offered a good price, and the couple bought
property in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Massey has kept residents at arm's length, unlike previous coal
companies in the valley. Many people speak warmly of Armco Steel in
particular. Duane Rorrer, a former miner, says Armco helped out in the
little towns, "and everyone from the superintendent on down lived right
in the community." Jim Wills, a radiologist  turned engineer, recalls
that when floods struck Coal River, Armco paid its heavy-equipment
operators to clear out creeks and rivers in their own communities.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, no important Massey official lives in the valley. The
company, the nation's fifth-largest coal producer, is based in Richmond,
Va. Its VIPs fly in by helicopter. So it may be no surprise that Massey
pulled 18.5 million tons of prized low-sulfur coal, worth more than $500
million, from this 20-mile stretch of the valley in 2000--but did little
to help the towns in its wake.</TE>
<TE>   Massey also has closed off the mountains, breaking an Appalachian
tradition that regards the mountainsides as "commons." People
historically have been allowed free rein there, regardless of who had
legal title. They would go into the mountains to hunt and gather nuts,
berries and other wild fruit--as well as ramp onions, ginseng and
medicinal herbs they might use or sell. Other coal operators honored this
tradition. Massey has erected gates and posted armed guards.</TE>
<TE>   "Massey Coal does not consider us human beings," says James A.
Scarbro, 70, a retired miner and former UMW official. "We're dogs. We're
in their way. I've lain in bed at night thinking about things I could do
to Massey."</TE>
<TE>   Jewel Rorrer, Duane's wife, says it was she who exposed mountaintop
removal on Montcoal Mountain. She showed residents photos and video
footage, and Massey has not forgotten. Rorrer and her husband's family
cemeteries are on the mountain, and they have a deed granting them
access. But Rorrer says that when she has gone on company property alone,
the guards have issued veiled threats. "That's why I never go up there
without a gun," she says. Once they let her go up to a cemetery without
warning her that workers were blasting nearby. An explosion knocked her
down.</TE>
<TE>   About four years ago, something happened to change the equation along
Coal River. After years of being silent because they had relatives who
worked for Massey or did business with the company and feared
repercussions, the residents began to speak out and organize. Meetings
began drawing crowds. Though they were small at first, upward of 100
people came to two gatherings last year in Sylvester and about 75
attended one on Clear Fork.</TE>
<TE>   In part, this is the fruit of efforts by Coal River Mountain Watch, a
handful of people who are willing to take on the coal companies and state
officials. The group challenges requests for blasting and dam permits,
testifies at public hearings and travels to the state capital and
Washington, D.C., for rallies. Judy Bonds, who is part Cherokee, has been
its driving force, though nothing in her past seemed to prepare her for
the role. After raising a daughter, Bonds worked as a waitress and
manager at Pizza Hut, then worked in convenience stores. But the Marfork
experience radicalized her.</TE>
<TE>   Now this friendly but tough 49-year-old woman carries an astonishing
number of details about mining in her head, serves as the group's
community outreach coordinator and is an inspiration to others. "It gives
people, especially women, courage when they see regular people like Judy
Bonds speaking out," says Janet Fout of the Ohio Valley Environmental
Coalition, an ally of Mountain Watch.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds is technically a part-time employee but says she puts in 75
hours a week. She receives $12,000 annually and is the only salaried
person at Mountain Watch, which operates out of a $200-a-month storefront
and makes do on a budget of $43,800 from three foundations and a
nonprofit group. "We're overwhelmed with issues," Bonds says. The small
group also tracks the work of two other giant firms, Arch Coal and AEI
Resources, which have subsidiaries nearby.</TE>
<TE>   For two years, Bonds had help from Donna Halstead, who lives over the
mountains. Until she was forced to stop to care for her ailing in-laws,
Halstead had driven 53 miles on narrow roads from her home to Mountain
Watch's office in Whitesville to volunteer at least three days a week.
Aversion to mountaintop removal spurred her. Expansion of an Arch Coal
operation threatens her family cemetery and "home place." Halstead is now
leading a group fighting overweight coal trucks and is running for the
state Legislature as a candidate of the new Mountain Party.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain Watch works closely with the like-minded Ohio Valley
Environmental Coalition, the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy and two
other citizens' groups. National environmental organizations have joined
in some protests against mountaintop removal, particularly Friends of the
Earth, the Izaak Walton League and Citizens Coal Council. But they have
not been able to make the cause a national issue.</TE>
<TE>   Help came last year from a surprising quarter. The UMW had been laying
low on community issues in the coal fields for years, supporting
mountaintop removal presumably for the sake of miners' jobs and industry
contributions to its pension fund. Suddenly last year, it launched an
anti-Massey campaign, condemning the company for many practices and
holding a rally and sit-in at Elk Run as well as community meetings. It
began working with Mountain Watch and the Sylvester activists. Last
month, the UMW bused 250 people to Richmond to protest outside a Massey
stockholders meeting. CEO Don Blankenship complained that West Virginia
is cracking down on Massey because of UMW pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The UMW started its anti-Massey campaign after residents unhappy with
Massey operations asked for the union's help, says Donnie Samms, the UMW
official directing the campaign. The underlying reason for the UMW
campaign may be to build public support for another bid to unionize
Massey operations. Still, the union is probably the strongest ally the
citizens can hope for.</TE>
<TE>   The state has gotten tougher with the industry under the
administration of Gov. Bob Wise, who took office last year. The state
recently took the extraordinary step of ordering Marfork shut down for
nine days for continued water pollution, a step for which Mountain Watch
can take some credit. While living near Marfork, Bonds regularly reported
blackwater spills to authorities. Massey is appealing the order. The
state also imposed an unprecedented 30-day suspension on a Massey mine
elsewhere in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Mountain Watch also can claim other small achievements--tighter
monitoring of permits, a better job by state inspectors, a growing number
of citizens willing to call in complaints to the state, and more honest
talk from environmental officials "because we've educated ourselves on
the law and regulations," Bonds says. State officials, she adds, "are
scrutinized a lot closer now, and they know it." In addition, politicians
and the news media, which had long ignored the valley's problems, have
started to pay attention.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners in Sylvester won a state ruling against Massey on the dust
issue, but they say the company did little about the problem for years.
Now, under state pressure, it is building a 105-foot-high dome to cover
the coal stockpile. Massey also was ordered to pay Sylvester $100,000,
but so far the town defiantly has refused the money. "We're not for
sale," Pauline Canterberry, leader of the local rebellion, has insisted.
Also pending are lawsuits against Massey by about 100  Sylvester property
owners.</TE>
<TE>   Massey was carving up Montcoal Mountain for two or three years before
residents knew it. Mountain Watch now learns in advance of plans for
mountaintop removal by tracking applications for mining permits. They
know that two new large permits have been approved by the state and two
others are being sought. Together, the four permits target the mountains
for miles along the river.</TE>
<TE>   "It would absolutely devastate Coal River," Donna Halstead says. Four
communities--Edwight, Sundial, Artie and Drews Creek--are in the path of
the mining, she says, and others are nearby. Sundial and Edwight are
within the authorized blast zone. She says Massey made most homeowners no
offer for their property, giving them the choice of leaving without a
penny or enduring the mining. "They buy out the most influential people
or the most outspoken people and then leave the rest of them to just get
blasted to bits," she says. Their communities are likely to go the way of
Blair in Logan County. That once-thriving community of 400 homes became a
virtual ghost town as residents were driven out by the roar, flying rock
and choking dust of blasting. Just 25 homes remain occupied.</TE>
<TE>   The largest two permits being sought--totaling four square miles--are
Massey's. One has been approved; Mountain Watch appealed, citing the
danger of blasting so close to the  schools and rock cliffs that line
Route 3. Bonds says car-sized boulders have come down in slides. One
closed Route 3 and three schools and led more than 600 people to sign a
petition asking the state to tear down the cliffs.</TE>
<TE>   At the September hearing on the appeal, a remarkable thing happened.
The state mine board, while upholding the permit, granted citizens
several major concessions. It designated a 12-mile stretch of the rock
cliffs a "structure," giving them some protection from blasting. It
ordered an engineering firm to investigate the cliffs' stability and
recommend the maximum strength for air blasts and ground vibrations. It
told Massey to protect the cemeteries on Montcoal Mountain against
blasting and to ensure visitors' privacy. The board's action was
unprecedented.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds says a board member called it the best case ever presented by
citizens. Mountain Watch could not afford an attorney for the hearing but
hired one to coach residents on how to testify. Massey was represented by
one of the state's premier law firms, Jackson &amp; Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   Massey has begun mining near the junior high-high school complex, but
Mountain Watch carries on. "We've put a chair against the door to keep
the wolves out," Bonds says. Still, she believes publicity and pressure
provide the only hope of stopping Massey. She calls what is happening on
Coal River "a dirty little secret. We'd like to get the word out." The
problem, she says, is Americans "don't seem to care about people from
Appalachia."</TE>

<HD>Ol' Blue Eyes</HD>
<DH>For Decades a Certain Eye Shadow Was for Teens and Trailer Parks.
But Things Are About to Change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILLARY JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>Hillary Johnson last wrote for the magazine about shampoo</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why does it seem like every woman I know labors under the illusion
that blue eye shadow was a curse peculiar to her own slice of teen
history? The truth is, blue eye shadow has been an adolescent rite of
passage since the 1950s, when Helena Rubinstein and Max Factor responded
to the advent of technicolor with what now seems an excess of zeal. If
you grew up in the '60s, you wore thick black eyeliner with your robin's
egg lids, just the way Ann Margret did, and if you grew up in the '70s
you remember the Maybelline logo that the company now refers to with
abashed humor as the "Big Blue Eye." In the '80s, it was blue mascara. My
own blue folly is immortalized, along with a very bad perm, in the only
family photograph that captures my mom, my grandmother, my
great-grandmother and me together.</LD>
<LD>   "I think blue eye shadow is all about coming of age," says my friend
Jane, who associates it with her '50s childhood (a former Wall Street
Journal editor, Jane is too sharp to have worn blue eye shadow at all).
"When the Berlin Wall came down, don't you remember seeing all those
Eastern European women in their blue eye shadow, and how shocking that
was? It seemed to reveal how far they had to go, culturally." Blue eye
shadow is the badge of adolescence, a rite of passage all growing girls,
and all maturing cultures, must endure. But in no era have women of style
and maturity worn blue on their faces.</LD>
<TE>   Well, this is about to change. I say this with authority, not because
the faces at the Oscars were more colorful than a baboon's bottom, and
not because Cameron Diaz wears blue eye shadow, and she can do no wrong.
No, my certainty that blue eye shadow is about to go respectable comes
from the fact that I recently found myself fixated on a pot of M.A.C
Satin Eye in a fantastic sci-fi color called Electric Eel, the sight of
which had me instantly hypnotized, rooted, riveted. I was lucky that the
thing I was staring at in that gripping, alarming, siren blue was only a
pot of eye shadow and not a car, because whatever it was, I had to have
it.</TE>
<TE>   Alone at home, I began to experiment with my Electric Eel and found
that the color I had purchased was as slippery as its namesake. Blue eye
shadow, while lighthearted, even glib, is very tricky to apply. It was
time to call in a professional.</TE>
<TE>   "Blue is a play color," cautions Lutz, a German-born makeup artist who
quotes Goethe from time to time, but also loves blue eye shadow. What he
means is, don't ever, ever wear it to work, whether you're a bus driver
or a Municipal Court judge.</TE>
<TE>   "I do a lot of celebrities, and most of the time they have a heart
attack when I pull out the blue," Lutz says. "They think I'm going to
make them look like that lady on 'The Drew Carey Show.' " But he always
manages to banish the screaming Mimis. "I love blue with orange," he
adds. "I make the face tan and shiny. A sparkly blue eyelid with beige
lips and orangy cheeks. There are three or four great, glittery colors
from I Nuovi. I used them on Denise Richards, and she went out and bought
some." He likes to put a bright blue on the lid, with a dab of icy blue
on the highest point in the middle, finished with a black liner.</TE>
<TE>   Bata, another mono-named makeup artist who ought to know his brights
since he often works on Elton John, says that the best way to make blue
modern is by wearing it in "one wash of color. I wouldn't do any liner,
just mascara and some violet or lilac gloss. My favorite is to wash the
entire lid, smudging all the way up to the brow. With a light blue,
especially on Asian skin, it's spectacular. And blue with lilac is
spectacular on green eyes."</TE>
<TE>   But the first challenge in attempting any vivid color, Bata says, is
to pick the right shade, based on whether your complexion is warm or
cool. Bata works with a new company called Three Custom Color
Specialists--3C for short. Every color that 3C makes--and they make more
than 100 of them--comes in both cool and warm versions. Trying the 3C
Warm Sky on one eyelid and the Cool Sky on the other, it is clear that I
am a "warm" despite being rather pale; the cool tone simply looks dull,
while the warm version sings.</TE>
<TE>   As for my intense Electric Eel, Bata suggests that an "interesting"
way to wear a bold color is "a little dab in the corner of your eyes. It
adds spark. Skin-colored eye shadow with a blue or green liner is also
good." Sure enough, when I dabbed the Electric Eel at the corner of a
beige eye with a new frosty, orange-pink Lorac shadow called Mesmerize on
the brow bone, I suddenly had a gestalt thing happening. And it's nothing
like my adolescent self would have worn.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if a color named after an 8-foot-long, 600-volt Amazonian fish
is too exotic for you, there are gentler, more dignified shades of blue
available. On the lighter side, a sheer, pearly eye shadow can give you
that Lee Remick saucy, nerves-of-steel look of cool sophistication that's
ready for the country club or a jewel heist. Creme eye shadows are back,
and they're the perfect medium for going gently blue. Estee Lauder's Go
Wink Liquid Eye Shadow in Liquid Sky is a robustly iridescent turquoise
blue, while M.A.C's Sheer Color Extract in Splash is a flattering, soft
robin's egg.</TE>
<TE>   Nars, which seems to offer more intense shades of eye color than a
peacock has tail feathers, makes a solid creme shadow that comes in a
mirrored compact. Their Carioca is a cool but vivid blue-green that goes
on very sheer and pearly, and which can be amped up to summer evening
intensity with a matching liquid liner called Neverland. Not long ago, in
the quest to jazz up a gray cashmere sweater I insisted on wearing to a
cocktail party (I had a cold and it was comfy), I added a hair's breadth
of the bright Neverland liner to gunmetal eyelids, and I looked so good
that I actually felt better.</TE>
<TE>   Navy is another wonderfully wearable shade. The In The Navy Blue
eyeliner pencil from the very Parisian-chic Lola Cosmetics boutique on
Robertson is a blue that Coco Chanel surely would have worn. (Ah, just
think what sought-after, high-priced places trailer parks would be if
only Coco had lived in one!) And Smashbox makes a creme eyeliner in a
shade called Picasso that can be painted on with a brush but is more
forgiving to the amateur artist than liquid liner. Last time I was at the
dentist's office, I saw Meg Ryan on a magazine cover wearing inky shadow
smudged all around her little pixie eyes--very '90s, except for the fact
that the eye shadow was dark blue, not black. To get there, Lanc0me's
Colour Focus Eye Shadow Darkroom is a true black powder with a very fine
infusion of blue glitter. But for high drama, Nars' China Blue powder
achieves something I would have thought to be an oxymoron: a neon-bright
shade of navy. And for less dramatic occasions (dinner in a bistro, not a
ballroom), Clinique's Blue Sky  High Impact Eye Shadow Trio for spring
includes a light navy shadow, along with dove and peach highlighters.
This is the first time I've ever owned a trio where I actually used all
the colors together, but someone thought this one out, and the sensible,
flattering color combo makes it perhaps the most wearable blue of all.</TE>
<TE>   And I confess, I do sometimes break the cardinal rule and wear Stila's
Lotus Infusion to work--it's a quad containing an astounding, unnamed
color I can only call David Hockney Swimming Pool. I get away with this
because, unlike Cameron Diaz, I work at home.</TE>

<HD>Climbing Queen</HD>
<DH>Clematis adds a colorful twist to Southern California yards</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN HEEGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Called "the queen of the climbers," clematis was cherished in
Victorian times as a drape of choice for a deep front porch. And while a
certain old-fashioned preciousness still clings to it, Southern
California gardeners have broadened their horizons beyond the jumbo
bloomers Victorians loved. An evergreen or deciduous climber and
scrambler, clematis grows wild across Europe and Asia and throughout
Central and North America. Its range of habitats, from cool mountaintops
to fertile river valleys to dry, hot Mediterranean islands, has produced
species that thrive in shade (alpina, macropetala), baking sun
(viticella, flammula), and even thin, poor soil (stanleyi). The popular
'Jackmanii,' born in 1862, with flowers half a foot wide, is only one
among hundreds. Marmoraria grows a mere four inches high; vitalba can
reach 50 feet. And to complicate matters, different clematis bloom at
different times of year--great for a garden, rough on the gardener who
has to figure out when to prune.</LD>
<LD>   But which clematis is right for your garden? Beyond their cultivation
needs (light, water), you need to know how big your favorites grow. No
matter how much you love 'Montana,' which gets very tall and very heavy,
you might not want it on your garage. In general, some of the shorter
types among the viticellas are a better choice for city gardens--and for
the Southern California climate.</LD>
<TE>   When you bring your plant home, site it carefully. Give climbers
something to cling to--stakes or trellising--and plan to tie them up as
they develop. Prepare a broad, deep planting hole, mixing in organic
compost and setting the rootball two to four inches below the soil
surface, a depth that will help the plant form new growth if attacked by
its major foe, clematis wilt. Keep soil moist but not soggy, shade roots
with organic mulch or a low-growing companion plant and feed monthly
during growth with a balanced, all-purpose food, such as a mild liquid
fertilizer.</TE>
<TE>   As to cutting back, resign yourself. English gardener and writer
Christopher Lloyd compares the look of unpruned clematis to "a
disemboweled mattress." And here's the program: To make them bushy and
strong, snip all young plants back to a foot above the  ground after
their first winter. After that, plants fall into three groups: those that
flower early on the previous year's growth (these include montana,
macropetala, alpina), those that flower in spring or summer on old growth
and sometimes rebloom later (many large-flowered hybrids), and those,
such as tanguticas and viticellas, that bloom only on new growth. Give
the first group a light clip after they bloom. Cut the second group back
at the end of winter by about 6 to 10 inches, taking out old growth and
separating stems. Prune group-three plants hard in early spring to about
2 1/2 feet, where new leaf buds are appearing.</TE>
<TE>   It sounds hard, but it's not once you get your schedule down. Your
reward is a plant that just might be your garden's star.</TE>

<HD>Food on the Fly</HD>
<DH>At the Lee Vining Mobil Gas Station, the Trapeze Artists Are as
Unexpected as the Gourmet Fare</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUDSON SANGREE</AU>
<BD>Hudson Sangree is a freelance writer based in Davis</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I first ate at the Tioga Gas and Gift Mart in Lee Vining two years
ago during a trip to the high desert and the Eastern Sierra. My
girlfriend and I were staying at a historic lodge that overlooked Mono
Lake, and we asked the owner where to dine that night. To our amazement,
she recommended Tioga Toomey's Whoa Nellie Deli inside the Mobil station
on the other side of town. "The chef there has been getting rave
reviews," she said.</LD>
<LD>   Skeptical but hungry, we headed across town past motels and filling
stations, pulling into the Mobil station's parking lot. An empty
flying-trapeze rig sat on the lawn beyond the gas pumps. Inside, beneath
bright fluorescent lights, a familiar assortment of six-packs and fishing
lures, quarts of milk and Yosemite T-shirts greeted us. In the far corner
was a deli counter and eight Formica tables, each with its own
squeeze-bottles of mustard and ketchup. The place was empty and didn't
look too promising.</LD>
<LD>   There was no table service, so we had to order at the counter. A
glance at the evenings' specials indicated we might do better than hot
dogs on metal rollers: Fried duck in a dark cherry chipotle sauce,
lobster taquitos, and buffalo meatloaf with port wine au jus were just a
few of the offerings. Dare we risk spending $16.95 on one of these
entrees, or should we play it safe and just order hot dogs?</LD>
<TE>   At that moment, Matt Toomey, a manic figure in a white chef's jacket
and baseball cap, hustled out from behind the counter. "Order something
good," he told us. We settled on the apricot- and wild-berry-glazed pork
loin and the top sirloin steak with a dozen grilled shrimp. We also asked
for dinner salads, which weren't on the menu, but Toomey said he'd whip
them up for us anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Our salads were the first surprise. Served in deep bowls and bursting
with color, the greens were topped off with a mountain honey and berry
vinaigrette. When our entrees were ready, Toomey just shouted: "Steak!
Pork loin!" We had to grab the plates from the pick-up counter ourselves.
Garlic mashed potatoes and crispy sauteed spaghetti squash accompanied
each dish, which was beautifully presented and cooked to perfection.</TE>
<TE>   To have one of the better meals of your life in a gas station is
bizarre. It leaves you staring at your plate for a moment or two in
disbelief. On one of several return visits, I watched two vacationing
German nurses gape at the racks of barbecued ribs jutting off the sides
of their plates. On another, a well-heeled lady from San Francisco pulled
out her camera and started taking photos of her brightly colored bowl of
grilled artichoke soup. "Can you believe we're eating this in a gas
station?" she asked her companions.</TE>
<TE>   I keep thinking the surprise will wear off, but on a recent visit to
the Mobilmart, as the locals call it, I ordered pan-seared ahi on a bed
of mixed greens. It came with a wasabi-soy vinaigrette and slices of
fresh mangos and papayas. There's another surprise on the menu every
time.</TE>
<TE>   Toomey, 36, is the former head chef at Whiskey Creek, Mammoth's
largest restaurant. About six years ago he quit his job to strike out on
his own, rode to Lee Vining on his Harley and persuaded the gas station's
owner, Dennis Domaille, to open a gourmet deli instead of a Pizza Hut
Express or other fast-food chain.</TE>
<TE>   Since then the Whoa Nellie Deli has become a favorite with locals and
tourists alike. People come for the food, but they also come to see
Toomey, whose charisma and sense of humor are reflected in his cooking.
He'll often emerge from behind his stove to banter with the customers.</TE>
<TE>   Need another reason to go? Try this. Trapeze performers give lessons
during the day to tourists, who swing by their knees 40 feet in the air
with an upside-down view of Mono Lake swooshing back and forth below.
While the gas station is open all year, the deli and trapeze rig are only
open from late April to mid-November.</TE>
<TE>   So if you're heading to Mono Lake or Yosemite this summer, stop in,
take a trapeze lesson and order something good from the specials board.
Toomey says that if it's what you really want, he'll even cook you a hot
dog.</TE>

<HD>The Power of One</HD>
<DH>Yujean Kang Seems More Focused Now That He's Back to a Single
Location</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Yujean Kang closed his West Hollywood restaurant late last
year, I've been to his Pasadena place several times for a Chinese food
fix. I've always preferred the original over the chilly elegance of the
Melrose Avenue Yujean Kang's, and I wasn't alone, if the empty tables at
the Westside location were any indication. I suspect Kang does, too,
because now that he's back here, this rumpled bear of a chef seems much
more at home.</LD>
<LD>   With its persimmon-colored walls, white-draped tables and savvy wine
list, Yujean Kang's is more an Asian-themed bistro than the usual
nondescript neon-lit neighborhood Chinese restaurant. The crowd, in fact,
comes from all over, not just Pasadena. Kang's elegant cooking is the
main draw, as the setting is modest (and in need of a touch-up). The
service is always good, and when Kang is in-house, you can count on
having an excellent Chinese meal.</LD>
<TE>   The Taiwan-born chef's style of cooking is informed by his knowledge
of historical recipes and techniques and a willingness to experiment. If
he thinks a nontraditional ingredient might work better, he doesn't
hesitate to make a serendipitous substitution. That's why you'll see
Parma ham instead of the Virginia ham most Chinese chefs use, which in
itself is a substitution for Yunnan's famous raw-cured ham. It's also why
he favors Blue Lake beans over Chinese long beans. When it comes to
seafood, he has slipped sea bass, salmon, Louisiana white shrimp or even
Mediterranean calamari onto his customers' plates.</TE>
<TE>   Yujean Kang's menu doesn't read like any other Chinese restaurant's.
As an appetizer, he offers playful miniature dumplings, about the size of
a fava bean, drizzled with a sizzling hot chile oil. They're delicious,
but they do call on all your chopstick skills to ferry them from plate to
mouth. He's updated the idea of "sweet and sour" with his julienne of
fish (the variety depends on the night) with puckery kumquat and a
sweet-tart passion fruit sauce. Don't forget a big bowl of Northern-style
wonton soup for the table, laden with pork wontons, plump rosy shrimp and
ribbons of soft, wrinkly cabbage with raw egg swirled in at the last
minute.</TE>
<TE>   Kang's cooking is clean and fresh, and he never uses MSG. I'm not big
on fried rice, though I have to say Yujean's is particularly appealing.
It's laced with all sorts of diced vegetables, shrimp, beef, chicken and,
of course, that all important egg.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know why, but it seems unusually hard to find a good version
of cold noodles in sesame sauce in L.A. Too often the sauce tastes like a
relative of peanut butter. Here the dish is beautifully modulated. The
noodles have a nice tooth, the complex sauce is sparked with a little hot
pepper, and the dish is cooled down with julienned cucumbers.</TE>
<TE>   His Chinese "polenta"--served with a stir-fry of fat shrimp, slivered
scallions and swatches of greens and mushrooms--is still a favorite of
mine. What looks like triangles of grilled polenta are really more like a
light corn custard deep-fried to present a thin golden crust. The texture
is seductive and the flavor intriguing. Another unusually delicate dish
is chicken in plum wine with silk squash and wisps of fried Parma ham. I
also like his sliced pork in a honey and chile sauce with pressed tofu,
black mushrooms and Chinese mustard greens.</TE>
<TE>   Call two days beforehand if you have your mind set on the traditional
Peking duck. When it's ready, the waiter will bring out the magnificent
mahogany-colored duck, then carve it and roll the meat up in crepe-like
Chinese pancakes with a dab of plum sauce and slivered scallions. Me, I'm
less interested in the pancake bundles than in gnawing on the crisp,
skinny duck wings.</TE>
<TE>   This is one Chinese restaurant that makes a real effort with the
desserts. The most unusual sweet is the pancakes filled with red bean
paste, served warm and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. There's
a fine mandarin orange cheesecake, too, paired with that passion fruit
sauce again. If you've already overindulged, Kang will send out a plate
of sliced kiwi or other fruit, with balls of pineapple or watermelon
sorbet.</TE>
<TE>   Before moving to Pasadena in 1991, Yujean Kang had a restaurant in
Berkeley. Back then, the idea of a Chinese restaurateur with a keen
interest in wines and the way they can enhance Chinese cuisine was
unheard of. Winemakers and wine buffs made it their hangout, and most
nights you could find tables covered with eclectic wines from Alsace,
Germany, Burgundy. When he moved to Pasadena, Yujean Kang's clean,
delicate cooking and phenomenal wine list quickly won him fans here, too.</TE>
<TE>   Except for Joss in Beverly Hills, which also has a large wine list,
most Chinese restaurants get by with a short list of popular, mostly
mediocre bottles. Though the second Yujean Kang's made inroads into what
was once a much more extensive wine list, expect to find enough
interesting bottles to make choosing just one difficult.</TE>
<TE>   For an aperitif, try Belgian ale served in a Champagne flute with
fresh peaches or cherries in season. The restaurant also offers a limited
but enticing selection of French Champagnes, including Alfred Gratien
Cuvee Paradis and a 1983 Salon Blanc de Blanc. Alsatian Riesling or
Gewurztraminer are terrific matches with Chinese food, too. Among the
Pinot Noir choices are several older vintages from Williams Selyem in the
Russian River Valley and a handful of French Burgundies.</TE>
<TE>   It's Yujean Kang's curiosity about food and wine that made his
restaurant fresh and interesting when it opened. Now that he's back at
home in Pasadena, I'm hoping he'll have the energy and interest to take
his menu even further.</TE>

<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>If there's one thing this town can do well, it's remember.</LD>
<LD>   And maybe it's fitting that the defining moment in San Antonio's
sports history was a loss. Soon after the Spurs finished celebrating
their first-round NBA playoff victory over the Seattle SuperSonics
and toasting Tim Duncan's superb effort four days after his father
died, the talk turned to the memories of last year--memories of the
Lakers' sweep of the Spurs in the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   The Spurs remember, all right. And unlike the fall of the Alamo,
it wasn't a tale of courage and defiance against overwhelming odds.
The Spurs had their hearts and character questioned from all
corners--including by their coach.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers came into San Antonio and took Game 1, then stole Game
2, and by the time the series got to Los Angeles the Spurs were ready
to roll over and go paws-up. They've heard about it ever since. Now
they get to do something about it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great," Duncan said. "I'm excited about it. We're all
excited about it. There's no way to forget getting swept last season
and ending the season on that note. We feel we have as good a chance
[of beating the Lakers] as anybody."</TE>
<TE>   "Every time you play them, you think about [the sweep] somewhat,"
backup guard Antonio Daniels said. "And that gives you a little bit
more motivation."</TE>
<TE>   It's not as though you had to be with the Spurs last season to
have incentive against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody who's played the last couple of years, you've lost to
L.A. because they've won the championship," said guard Steve Smith,
who spent the previous two seasons in Portland.</TE>
<TE>   "They swept myself when I was in Portland. They swept this team.
In life, you're always going to get another chance. It's great to get
a chance to go back there."</TE>
<TE>   So they're hyped and ready.</TE>
<TE>   But why should this year be any different than last?</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe lightning doesn't strike twice," forward Malik Rose said.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, they have enough personnel changes to alter the way they
can attack the Lakers. The main differences: Derek Anderson, Sean
Elliott, Samaki Walker and Avery Johnson are out; Smith, Tony Parker,
Bruce Bowen and Mark Bryant are in.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a completely different team than we had a year ago," Daniels
said. "We've got the 19-year-old point guard [Parker] who's extremely
quick. We've got the defensive stopper in Bruce. We've got a deadly
shooter in Smitty."</TE>
<TE>   The only element they might be missing: the guy who's been with
them the longest, David Robinson. His back is acting up, he couldn't
play in the last four games of their series against Seattle and the
Spurs keep using the word "doubtful" about him.</TE>
<TE>   The good news for the Spurs is that Rose is in full bloom. He had
18 points and 13 rebounds in Game 5, coming off a career-high 28
points in Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   The most noticeable difference is Parker. He replaces the
slasher/penetrator they lost in Anderson, with the advantage that he
already has the ball in his hands most of the time.</TE>
<TE>   If you want a comparison, the Dallas Mavericks' Shooters Galore
concept works because Steve Nash can break down defenses and then
find the open man.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's running around trying to keep up with this guy," Spur
Coach Gregg Popovich said. "I don't know what level Parker's going to
get to, but he's our version of that."</TE>
<TE>   That has been a problem spot for the Lakers, because Derek Fisher
hasn't been as adept at stopping opposing point guards as he was last
season. It didn't become a major issue last series because Portland's
Damon Stoudamire completely lost his shooting touch. But Parker just
finished holding his own (and then some) against Seattle star Gary
Payton.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone keeps waiting for those rookie jitters to kick in. Hope
you're not in a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   "I love that pressure," Parker said. "Big games. Big series. It's
great.</TE>
<TE>   "That's going to be nice, play a playoff series against the
Lakers."</TE>
<TE>   "I think he just brings another depth to our team," Rose said. "No
one can really stay in front of this guy. He's probably the fastest
guy in the league, end line to end line."</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later, the Spurs will get the ball to Duncan. He's one
of the most reliable options in the NBA. Horace Grant was able to
keep him in check for a half at a time last year, but now he's gone
and the task is up to Walker.</TE>
<TE>   You'll notice Duncan is a little more animated these days. He'll
clap and playfully pat Parker on the head, or argue with referees on
behalf of his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "We may not be as wise out on the court as far as veteran
leadership, but I think that's where Timmy has really made a case for
MVP and stepping up and being a more vocal leader," Rose said.</TE>
<TE>   Most Valuable Player? For the Lakers, it's Shaquille O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   He ceded the stardom in last season's conference finals to Bryant.
Exploiting the absence of an injured Anderson, Bryant went wild,
averaging 33 points, seven rebounds and seven assists.</TE>
<TE>   With Robinson out or limited by his injury, look for O'Neal to
reclaim his dominant role and for the Lakers to advance.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs at least have a chance to reclaim some dignity, simply
by showing up for four consecutive games. That would be a step in the
right direction.</TE>

<HD>Mariners Rally Past Yankees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bad throw by Mariano Rivera to second base on a bunt. A bloop
single to shallow center. A blown game in the final inning.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Yankees had seen all of this before. Only one
consolation Saturday--this time, it didn't cost them the World
Series.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Cirillo took part in an early home run derby, then hit a
tiebreaking single against Rivera in the ninth inning that gave the
Seattle Mariners a 9-5 victory over the Yankees at New York.</LD>
<TE>   "Is that deja vu again?" Yankee Manager Joe Torre asked.</TE>
<TE>   In a game featuring six home runs, the Mariners won their third in
a row. They rallied from a 5-0 deficit, and took advantage of
Rivera's mistake to score four times.</TE>
<TE>   For Rivera and the Yankees, it was an eerie repeat of the ninth
inning of Game 7 of the World Series. Arizona rallied for two runs
that November night, winning, 3-2, on a soft single by Luis Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, Rivera made a wide throw to second base on a bunt,
setting up a go-ahead single that landed in the grass barely beyond
second base.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened is in the past. That's how I treated it," Rivera
said. "I was focusing on this game, not on other games."</TE>
<TE>   Desi Relaford singled against Steve Karsay (1-1) to start the
Seattle ninth. Rivera relieved and, after fielding Ben Davis' bunt,
made a tailing throw to shortstop Derek Jeter.</TE>
<TE>   After a bunt by Luis Ugueto and an intentional walk to Ichiro
Suzuki loaded the bases with one out, Cirillo singled for a 6-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Sierra followed with a tapper in front of the plate that
also went for a run-scoring single when Rivera and catcher Jorge
Posada each backed off, and John Olerud hit a two-run single.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 10, Oakland 2--Jose Valentin drove in five runs and Ray
Durham homered as the White Sox roughed up Tim Hudson at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson (3-3) had a 1.87 earned-run average before the game,
second-lowest in the American League. But he matched his career high
by giving up nine earned runs in 61/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 3, Detroit 2--Cristian Guzman's infield single drove in
the winning run in the ninth inning, leading the Twins to their 10th
consecutive victory at home.</TE>
<TE>   Guzman spoiled the major league debut of reliever Fernando Rodney
(0-1).</TE>
<TE>   Guzman's chopper with the bases loaded and two out was fielded by
second baseman Damian Jackson, who was too deep to make the force out
at second.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 7, Tampa Bay 5--Shea Hillenbrand's two-out, pinch-hit grand
slam capped a five-run ninth inning at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The towering drive to left field off Victor Zambrano (1-2) struck
one of the catwalks that ring the outfield at Tropicana Field--about
120 feet above the field.</TE>
<TE>   The loss was the ninth in a row for Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 10, Kansas City 0--Rodrigo Lopez gave up five hits in
seven innings, and Melvin Mora and Marty Cordova hit three-run homers
at Baltimore as the Orioles dealt the Royals their fifth consecutive
loss.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 3, Texas 0--Bartolo Colon dominated for eight innings
and Omar Vizquel homered at Cleveland as the Indians ended a losing
streak at six.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oakland activated infielder Randy Velarde from the 15-day disabled
list and optioned outfielder Mike Colangelo to triple-A Sacramento.</TE>

<HD>Fullmer Able to Provide First Option for Scioscia</HD>

<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>If Brad Fullmer can play first base, the lineup options multiply for
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia. For a guy who wasn't supposed to be able
to play first base very well, Fullmer's defense has been
satisfactory. And he's hitting .417 when he starts at first base and
.213 as the designated hitter.</LD>
<LD>   "It makes no difference to me," Fullmer said. "But sometimes it's
good to focus your attention on something other than your at-bats."</LD>
<LD>   With Fullmer at first base Saturday, Scioscia used outfielder
Garret Anderson at designated hitter and gave him a day off the
artificial turf. The Fullmer option would allow Scioscia to use other
regulars at designated hitter and use others at designated hitter in
favorable matchups.</LD>
<TE>   But, while Scioscia praises Fullmer's defensive improvement, the
Angels are wary of needing to remove him for defensive purposes in
the late innings of a close game, losing his bat. After Saturday's
game, Scioscia called Fullmer "our primary DH."</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer played the last two seasons for the Blue Jays. Some
Toronto fans remembered him Saturday by hoisting a banner that read,
"CAN'T BREAK ME," the tattoo on one of Fullmer's arms.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The career performance of Ramon Ortiz had been erratic at best
when the Angels signed him to a four-year contract in March, one that
could be worth as much as $11.7 million. But Ortiz, 29, whose age
increased by three years when his true birth certificate was
uncovered over the winter, appears to have matured as smoothly as he
has aged.</TE>
<TE>   He ranks fifth in the league with a 2.55 earned-run average. He
starts today, and he took great joy after his last game in discussing
how he has learned to pitch without trying to strike out everyone in
clutch situations.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few young pitchers come onto the scene like [Seattle's
Freddy] Garcia or [Oakland's Tim] Hudson or [Mark] Mulder," Scioscia
said. "There's a seasoning that goes into guys executing pitches in
tough situations."</TE>

<HD>Angel Win Streak Runs Aground in Toronto</HD>

<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>The last thing you want to do is walk up to Scott Schoeneweis, hand
him a stat sheet and point to his numbers.</LD>
<LD>   "If I looked at that, I'd retire," he said.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels' eight-game winning streak ended here Saturday, in a
4-1 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays that was far uglier than the score
indicated. Schoeneweis and the strike zone were barely acquainted in
the first inning, the defense was abominable and the offense failed
in a dozen chances to deliver a clutch hit.</LD>
<TE>   Schoeneweis has made six starts this season, winning one and
losing four, with a 6.03 earned-run average. He was not awful
Saturday, giving up four runs in seven innings, but he showed yet
again why he is a pitcher with virtually no margin for error.</TE>
<TE>   He elicits ground balls, lots of them. He gives up lots of hits
too, because some of the ground balls go through the infield.</TE>
<TE>   So, for him to succeed, two things must happen: He must throw
strikes, because he cannot afford to give up walks lest all those
hits drive in runs. And his defense must play flawlessly behind him,
turning all those ground balls into outs and preferably into double
plays.</TE>
<TE>   Neither happened Saturday. Schoeneweis threw more balls than
strikes in the first inning--20 to 17--hitting the first batter of
the game, Homer Bush, and walking Carlos Delgado. Sure enough, Bush
and Delgado scored, as the Blue Jays turned two otherwise harmless
hits into a 2-0 lead and took advantage of Schoeneweis making as many
pitches in one inning as he ought to make in three.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis did not give up a home run. But the Blue Jays put 14
runners on base against him in seven innings, on nine hits, four
walks and the hit batter.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept the ball on the ground for the most part," he said. "I'd
like to have a 1-2-3 inning here and there, but that's how I pitch."</TE>
<TE>   He did get 13 of 21 outs on ground balls. Toronto's Justin Miller,
making his second major league start, earned the victory by holding
the Angels to four hits over seven innings, in the process ending the
Blue Jays' nine-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Miller got 14 of 21 outs on ground balls, and his defense made no
mistakes behind him.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels did turn two double plays behind Schoeneweis, but they
committed two errors and made two other poor defensive plays. Third
baseman Troy Glaus sailed a throw wide of first base for one error,
and shortstop David Eckstein dropped a throw from Schoeneweis,
turning what should have been a 1-6-3 double play into another error.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Glaus bobbled another potential double-play ball,
forcing him to settle for a force play, and right fielder Tim Salmon
tried to throw out a runner at home plate but tossed the ball halfway
between the plate and the on-deck circle.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I look at it is, when you get a lot of chances, errors
are going to happen," Schoeneweis said. "I do rely on my defense
quite a bit, but everybody relies on their defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I don't strike anybody out, ever. For me to get outs,
they're on balls in play."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' defense has stumbled, and not just when Schoeneweis
pitches. No team in the American League has made more errors,
including nine during the eight-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were encouraged when Glaus cut his errors from 33 two
years ago to 19 last season. But he has committed six errors one
month into the new season, five in the last nine games.</TE>
<TE>   "Just not catching it cleanly," he said. "That's about it."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels closed ranks behind Schoeneweis after the game. Manager
Mike Scioscia said the futile offense was "more of the story" than
Schoeneweis, who despite the flaws kept the Angels within striking
distance.</TE>
<TE>   The team started the day hitting .307 with runners in scoring
position, second to the Boston Red Sox among major league teams, but
went 0 for 12 in that situation Saturday. So, when reporters gathered
around pitching coach Bud Black to discuss the struggles of
Schoeneweis, Black subtly suggested the offense could have bailed out
the pitcher but did not.</TE>
<TE>   "If we score 21 runs, we're probably not talking," Black said.</TE>

<LD>Playing the kind of game they so often lost in their first two Arena
Football League seasons, the Avengers overcame their errors to squeak
past the Dallas Desperados, 52-51, before 15,196 at American Airlines
Arena in Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   The Avengers--who led, 28-27, at halftime--improved to 2-1 despite
amassing 18 penalties for 96 yards. Last season the Avengers led the
league in penalties, with 122 for 889 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Dallas (1-2), an expansion team playing its first home game,
failed to convert three extra points. The last one followed a
two-yard touchdown pass from Andy Kelly to Dialleo Burks with less
than a second to play. A bad snap on the point-after attempt cost
kicker Jason Wells a chance to tie the score.</LD>
<TE>   Avenger Chris Jackson, the league's leading receiver, caught eight
passes for 127 yards and three touchdowns. The last one was a 22-yard
reception with 13 seconds to play.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Tony Graziani completed 23 of 34 passes for 312 yards
and five touchdowns. He was intercepted once. Receiver-linebacker
Greg Hopkins had a huge night, catching nine passes for 134 yards and
two touchdowns. He also returned an interception for a touchdown.</TE>

<HD>Managerial Hot Seats Heat Up</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So, Jim Lefebvre, would you like another managing opportunity, even
though you have been burned by the increasingly hotter seats under
all major league managers and fired by the Seattle Mariners, Chicago
Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers?</LD>
<LD>   Lefebvre, now the hitting instructor of the Cincinnati Reds, folds
his arms as he watches batting practice at Dodger Stadium and
answers, "Not really, unless it's the right situation. Of course, who
knows for sure what the right situation is anymore?"</LD>
<LD>   Well, Joe Torre--fired three times himself--may know now, but then
even the New York Yankee manager is never far from owner George
Steinbrenner's hot line.</LD>
<TE>   Who knows for sure, indeed?</TE>
<TE>   Tony Muser, formerly of the Kansas City Royals, became the fourth
manager to be fired in April last week, joining Phil Garner of the
Detroit Tigers, Davey Lopes of the Brewers and Buddy Bell of the
Colorado Rockies. If you add Joe Kerrigan, fired by the new owners of
the Boston Red Sox in spring training, that's five before May.</TE>
<TE>   There had never been more than two managers fired in the first
month, and now, in varying degrees, the sharpened ax also threatens
Jerry Narron of the Texas Rangers, Buck Martinez of the Toronto Blue
Jays, Don Baylor of the Chicago Cubs, Larry Bowa of the Philadelphia
Phillies and Charlie Manuel of the Cleveland Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Hall of Fame manager Sparky Anderson watches the upheaval from the
green fairways of Thousand Oaks and wonders if Muser, Garner, Lopes
and Bell got dumber over the winter.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys had managed enough for people to know one way or the
other about them," he said. "Why wouldn't you make that decision
about them in the winter, rather than going through all kinds of
off-season discussions with them about your team, watching them
through six weeks of spring training, and then firing them 15 or so
games into the season?</TE>
<TE>   "The clubs like to say, 'Well, we wanted to go through spring
training and see how we started.' Common sense tells you it would
have been a miracle if any of those four teams had started any other
way than they did."</TE>
<TE>   Managers have always been hired to be fired, but corporate
ownership and escalating payrolls have increased expectations and
pressures.</TE>
<TE>   In the hopeless situations of Kansas City, Milwaukee, Detroit and,
to a lesser extent Colorado, the fired four were simply scapegoats.</TE>
<TE>   Amid early attendance falloff, maybe management could divert the
spotlight and convince skeptical fans that something was being done.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a tremendous amount of pressure now to win from the
start," Lefebvre said. "It's all about putting people in the seats."</TE>
<TE>   The venerable Anderson didn't disagree, but he laughed and said:</TE>
<TE>   "What they say every time is, 'Well, our attendance was falling.'
Do you think by changing those guys they're going to change their
attendance?</TE>
<TE>   "Those are bad clubs, and they fired those guys to save their own
hides. It's that simple. Besides, most of the guys running clubs now
are bean counters, and what does a bean counter know about running a
baseball club?"</TE>
<TE>   In reality, instability is rampant. There is constant turnover at
all levels, and no real job security in the multiyear contracts being
given managers at salaries ranging into millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   In four tumultuous years under Fox, for instance, the Dodgers have
employed four general managers and four managers.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman Bob Daly has intentionally slipped out of the media
spotlight now, hoping to let General Manager Dan Evans and Manager
Jim Tracy put the spotlight back on baseball and restore stability.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy's contract was extended through 2004 at the end of last
season.</TE>
<TE>   He believes it essential for an organization's success and a
manager's survival that the people who hold the gun avoid the
tendency to put too much influence on one series or even one month of
early games.</TE>
<TE>   "If an organization doesn't have that one person who understands
how a 162-game schedule works and won't be swayed by public
perception or a difference of opinion internally, then you're likely
to find people pulling the trigger on a situation a lot quicker than
they should have and wishing later they hadn't," Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that 14 years in managerial and instructional capacities
at all levels of the game have made him aware that he basically has
to be his own man.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope to last a long time in this job because I like it a lot,"
he said. "I also like to be liked and feel I've accomplished some of
that, but if I'm going to go about it only on the basis of trying to
keep my job, I'm going to fail miserably.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been hired to please the public or anyone outside my
work area. I've been hired to be fired, and I'll ultimately be judged
on my performance. I think that's the way it's always been for every
manager."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but the environment has also changed
dramatically--economically and otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a totally different job now," Lefebvre said. "People have no
idea what it's like. There's greater pressure to win from the start,
and you have to spend so much time with the media, front office and
fans that you keep getting further away from what you need to do on
the field."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he said, the annual roster turnover is so extensive
that players don't get to learn what the manager is all about, and
the manager--who spends as much time managing agents and contracts as
he does players--seldom gets the three or four years necessary to
implement a program with the same nucleus of players.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think my firings had anything to do with my managerial
ability," Lefebvre said. "You have to have thick skin and you can't
take it personally. It's strictly the way the game is. I mean, all
any manager can do now is stay focused, build a philosophy for the
future, and hope they give you enough of a future to make it work."</TE>

<LD>The truth about those rumors that friends of Ken Griffey Jr. were
lobbying for a trade that would send him back to the Seattle Mariners
is that there was no truth.</LD>
<LD>   Did they really think the Mariners would send Mike Cameron back to
Cincinnati, or move him out of center field to make room for Griffey?
Maybe if the Reds had thrown in another player or two.</LD>
<LD>   Funny how the perspective has changed.</LD>
<TE>   Cameron is now the Gold Glove center fielder drawing national
attention with his home run accomplishments, even if he hit his
attention-grabbing homers all in one game.</TE>
<TE>   And it's the Reds who face an outfield quandary when Griffey,
sidelined by a torn knee tendon, comes off the disabled list soon.</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake, Griffey will return to center, but who goes, who
stays and who plays where is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of Austin Kearns and Adam Dunn, the Reds' top two
draft choices from 1998 and two of the most touted young sluggers in
baseball, compounds an outfield logjam that includes two other
talented young players, Juan Encarnacion and Ruben Mateo.</TE>
<TE>   Kearns is the least experienced and probably will be sent back to
triple A, with Griffey flanked by Dunn and Encarnacion.</TE>
<TE>   There has been speculation, though, about a trade that would send
Encarnacion and closer Danny Graves to Cleveland for starting pitcher
Bartolo Colon, providing the Reds are convinced that Kearns is ready
and they are able to lure former Dodger closer Jeff Shaw out of
retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw, who lives in a Cincinnati suburb, rejected the Reds'
contract offers during the off-season, but he indicated a willingness
to resume his career last week, even saying he would agree to serve
as a setup man for Graves.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing I want to do is cause turmoil on the team," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Jim Bowden is scheduled to continue talks with
agent Joe Bick over the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, as the Reds took two of three from the Dodgers in Los
Angeles to sustain their strong start in the National League Central,
it's hard to decide which is more impressive, their array of young
hitters or their resemblance to the linebacking corps of the
Cincinnati Bengals.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn is 6 feet 6 and 240 pounds, Kearns is 6-3 and 220, and first
baseman Sean Casey is 6-4 and 225.</TE>
<TE>   Casey was obtained in a trade with the Indians, but the drafting
of Kearns and Dunn, and other muscular young Reds, was part of
Bowden's game plan.</TE>
<TE>   When there's a choice, Manager Bob Boone said, Bowden likes bigger
over smaller--and power best of all. It stems from the general
manager's first spring, Boone said, when the New York Yankees arrived
for an exhibition game and towered over the Reds physically.</TE>
<TE>   In the cases of Kearns and Dunn?</TE>
<TE>   "Talent is the most important thing," Boone said. "They just
happen to be big and strong."</TE>
<TE>   At that, the manager suggested, you ain't seen nothin' yet.</TE>
<TE>   Congestion in the Reds' outfield and weight room will become even
greater next year, if not earlier, with the probable arrival of
20-year-old Wily Mo Pena, the most physically imposing of all the
Reds, Boone said, at 6-3 and 220.</TE>
<TE>   Pena was obtained from the Yankees for third-base prospect Drew
Henson and outfielder Michael Coleman, and boasts more power, Boone
said, than anyone he has ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   "I kidded him in spring training that he shouldn't be in baseball,
that he should be training for the heavyweight championship," Boone
said.</TE>
<TE>   If the young Cincinnati hitters continue to mature, the Reds could
be playing for a championship a year ahead of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "So much has been made of 2003, when we move into the new park and
our financial position will be strengthened, but we came into the
season thinking 2002, not 2003," Boone said.</TE>
<TE>   "People also like to say we've been in a good streak, but what I
say is that we're not in a streak, we're in the season. I expect us
to continue playing like we have every night."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Colorado Rockies opened a weekend series at Philadelphia,
after sweeping the Phillies and Pittsburgh Pirates at Coors Field to
go 6-0 under new Manager Clint Hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   Most impressive is that Colorado starters were credited with all
six wins and had a 1.08 earned-run average in the Coors sweep. Denny
Neagle, with ninth-inning help from Jose Jimenez, and Mike Hampton
even pitched consecutive shutouts, a Coors first for the Rockies.</TE>
<TE>   Said Neagle: "I'd love to see us change the aura and stigma about
Coors, and I think we can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Cubs opened their weekend series against the Dodgers
with a disappointing 9-17 record, trailing the Reds by 71/2 games in
the NL Central, but President and General Manager Andy MacPhail,
providing the Reds and Pirates with bulletin-board material,
suggested his club was only three back because St. Louis is still the
team to beat.</TE>
<TE>   "At the risk of antagonizing people, I really [didn't] think the
Pirates [were] going wire to wire," he said. "I generally keep an eye
on St. Louis and Houston, and the fact that they haven't gotten off
to great starts gives you some solace.</TE>
<TE>   "Cincinnati can be troublesome for us because they have good
position players, but health and how their pitching holds up is going
to be the key barometer for them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A 9-18 April that left the Phillies' surprising success of last
year a distant memory, also wreaked havoc on Manager Larry Bowa's
pyrotechnic nerves.</TE>
<TE>   "I started the season with a long fuse, but I don't have much
left," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On one hand, Bowa wanted to let off his customary steam. On the
other, he was afraid of losing the team, having already had some
high-decibel confrontations in his two years at the helm.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some fragile egos," he said. "The guys lack mental
toughness. I would love to go off, believe me. I don't want to sound
negative, but we have some people who might just crash if I did
that."</TE>

<LD>Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times, commenting on China's 7-foot-5
center Yao Ming, who recently worked out for NBA officials:</LD>
<LD>   "He's a nice young man and an interesting basketball player. But
the hype is killing me. 'Yao Ming doesn't belong to any team,' said
one of Yao's translators. 'He belongs to the world.'</LD>
<LD>   "Please. Until further notice, he's an 18-minute-a-game backup."</LD>
<TE>   More Ming: Li Yao Min, the general manager of the Shanghai Sharks,
told the New York Times that Yao Ming "will be better than Shaquille
O'Neal, especially now in the free throw. If they bet steak for free
throw, Shaquille O'Neal will invite Yao Ming every time."</TE>
<TE>   Comment from Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle: "Maybe
so, but Shaq wouldn't go hungry. In games, he'd be having Yao for
lunch."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NBA single-game playoff record for
assists?</TE>
<TE>   Ouch! Jeff Gordon of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch writes that new
Colorado Rockies' Manager Clint Hurdle was nicknamed "Hurricane" as a
player with the Kansas City Royals.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon recalled one incident in particular:</TE>
<TE>   "The Royals Stadium artificial turf was blistering on hot summer
days. So the Hurricane decided to insulate his feet with aluminum
foil before putting on his spikes.</TE>
<TE>   "Uh-oh! The foil literally cooked his feet, causing the skin to
peel off the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Say what? Receiver Kevin Johnson of the Cleveland Browns, who is
pushing the team to give him a long-term contract after he caught 207
passes in his first three seasons, told the Akron Beach Journal:</TE>
<TE>   "I know what I can and can't do, but when the game's on the line,
I guarantee you want the ball to go through my hands."</TE>
<TE>   Look out! Tommy Bolt, newly chosen World Golf Hall of Fame member,
on his reputation for having an explosive temper:</TE>
<TE>   "I've been blown out of proportion. I don't think John Dillinger
was as mean as I've been portrayed to be."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not, Tommy, but Dillinger didn't throw clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Ding-dong: Pittsburgh Pirate catcher Jason Kendall drove in four
runs in a game shortly after sustaining a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had known this was going to happen," Manager Lloyd McClendon
said, "I would've hit Jason over the head a few days ago."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1925, Detroit's Ty Cobb had a
six-hit, three-homer game against the St. Louis Browns, setting a
modern major league record with 16 total bases.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1978, Cincinnati's Pete Rose

<KH>128TH KENTUCKY DERBY</KH>
<HD>War of the Roses</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: After being sold three weeks ago, War Emblem
leads all the way, giving Baffert his third Derby victory in six
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>The Kentucky Derby is many things, one of them a race that's not
supposed to be won by a horse who runs on the lead. Front-runners in
the Derby usually wind up on the slag heap, exhausted from trying to
set the pace in a grueling 11/4-mile endurance test.</LD>
<LD>   But sometimes the conditions are right and the Derby turns into
heresy. Saturday was one of those days. Before 145,033, on a
perfect-weather day at Churchill Downs, War Emblem and his
cool-as-ice jockey, Victor Espinoza, went to the front leaving the
gate and were never headed. At the finish, War Emblem, a 20-1
longshot, was four lengths ahead of Proud Citizen, another longshot,
and trainer Bob Baffert had won his third Derby in six years. His
other two winners, Silver Charm and Real Quiet, were bought cheaply;
this one came Baffert's way three weeks ago, when his major client,
Prince Ahmed Salman of Saudi Arabia, paid $900,000 to acquire the
Illinois Derby winner.</LD>
<LD>   Neither Baffert nor the prince apologized for winning a Derby with
a newcomer, a colt the white-haired trainer had never run before.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody [who wins] buys their Derby winner," Salman said. "If
you raise a horse, you're spending money to do that. So even that
way, you're buying a Derby winner."</TE>
<TE>   Baffert and Salman were crushed last year when Point Given, the
Derby favorite, finished fifth. That Point Given went on to win the
Preakness and Belmont Stakes, the other Triple Crown races, and
didn't lose the rest of the year did little to soften the memory.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Baffert sneaked up on the opposition. Before he was
sold on April 11, by Chicago industrialist Russell Reineman, War
Emblem had won two consecutive races at Sportsman's Park by 17
lengths, but because the Chicago track is perceived as a
speed-favoring oval, those victories failed to impress Derby bettors.
War Emblem, reaching the wire in 2:01, paid $43 for $2 as he earned
$875,000 from Churchill and another $1 million from a Sportsman's
bonus for winning the Illinois and Kentucky Derbies.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how Salman and Reineman will divvy up the bonus.
Baffert said that he would split his share of the
bonus--$100,000--with Frank "Bobby" Springer, the colt's former
trainer.</TE>
<TE>   The 128th Derby figured to be a bizarre affair. At 6-1, Harlan's
Holiday went off as the highest-priced favorite ever. The Florida
Derby and Blue Grass winner ran seventh in the field, which was
reduced to 18 Saturday morning when Baffert scratched his other
horse, longshot Danthebluegrassman, after he cramped up following a
routine jog.</TE>
<TE>   The first three finishers came out of the Illinois Derby, the
Lexington Stakes at Keeneland and the Spiral at Turfway Park--hardly
big-ticket preps for Churchill Downs. Perfect Drift was third,
three-quarters of a length behind the Wayne Lukas-trained Proud
Citizen. Medaglia d'Oro was fourth, another 31/4 lengths back. The
rest of the order of finish was Request For Parole, Came Home,
Harlan's Holiday, Johannesburg, Essence Of Dubai, Saarland, Blue
Burner, Castle Gandolfo, Easy Grades, Private Emblem, Lusty Latin,
It'sallinthechase, Ocean Sound and Wild Horses.</TE>
<TE>   The exacta on War Emblem and Proud Citizen, who was 23-1, paid
$1,300.80. Perfect Drift, at 7-1, joined the first two for an
$18,373.20 trifecta. The superfecta on the first four finishers
returned $91,764.50.</TE>
<TE>   The last gate-to-wire winner of the Derby was the filly Winning
Colors, who caught a field similar to Saturday's in 1988, when no
other speed pressured her. Before Winning Colors, Spend A Buck in
1985 had also won a Derby on the front end, but before him Bold
Forbes, in 1976, was the most recent.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not hard," said Espinoza, who had ridden Baffert's
Congaree to a third-place finish in his Derby debut last year. "I had
a lot of horse left down the lane. When we cleared the first turn, it
was easy to go around there after that. I just focused on my horse. I
felt like I was sleeping."</TE>
<TE>   Buddha, the Wood Memorial winner and one of the horses who might
have challenged War Emblem early, was scratched Friday because of a
bruised foot. Another horse with early foot, Medaglia d'Oro, broke
slowly and was taken out of trainer Bobby Frankel's game plan. Proud
Citizen and his jockey, Mike Smith, just sat behind War Emblem all
the way, and didn't have any punch through Churchill's 1,2341/2-foot
stretch.</TE>
<TE>   The fractions for the first mile were :23, :47, 1:113/5 and
1:363/5, on a track that was playing fast for earlier races.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the half-mile time, Jerry Bailey, who rode Castle
Gandolfo to his 12th-place finish, said: "A 47 is pretty soft for
good horses. But the winner still ran very good."</TE>
<TE>   Baffert said War Emblem would be his only starter in the Preakness
at Pimlico on May 18. More than Churchill Downs and Belmont Park,
Pimlico is considered a track that especially favors front-runners,
but Bailey issued a warning of sorts:</TE>
<TE>   "War Emblem won't be waltzing around there in the next one."</TE>
<TE>   When Danthebluegrassman ran last in the Santa Anita Derby a month
ago, Baffert seemed to be out of Derby contenders. It was only as an
afterthought that Baffert entered Danthebluegrassman for the Derby
last Wednesday. After the Santa Anita Derby, Salman suggested to
Baffert that they shop around for a Derby prospect. Coincidentally,
Baffert received a call the same day from a bloodstock agent
mentioning that War Emblem might be available.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert and Richard Mulhall, Salman's chief racing advisor, flew
to Lexington, Ky., to inspect War Emblem at Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   "He was supposed to have been sold before, but he didn't vet out,"
Baffert said.</TE>
<TE>   When he eyeballed War Emblem, Baffert was impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't even X-ray him," Baffert said. "I didn't care about
that. I buy a lot of horses without X-rays. Real Quiet was another
one."</TE>
<TE>   Reineman, 84, and Springer would have skipped the Derby and aimed
for the Preakness had they not sold the son of Our Emblem and
Sweetest Lady, a Lord At War mare. Our Emblem, unloaded by Claiborne
Farm in Kentucky because his stud career started slowly, stands at a
Maryland farm for a $4,000 breeding fee.</TE>
<TE>   That's a fee that will be going up substantially next year, thanks
to Baffert's short-order Derby magic.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you think that's the best and shortest training job of my
life?" Baffert said.</TE>

<HD>Pincay Is Caught in a Traffic Jam</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>The plan was for Medaglia d'Oro to run closely behind War Emblem in
the Kentucky Derby.</LD>
<LD>   But Laffit Pincay, who at 55 could have supplanted Bill Shoemaker
as the oldest jockey to win the Derby, had to go to Plan B after
Medaglia d'Oro broke awkwardly. Pincay's colt was also bumped by
Essence Of Dubai, who broke from the stall inside Medaglia d'Oro.</LD>
<LD>   "We got squeezed back," Pincay said. "So instead of being close to
pace like I wanted, I found myself behind a lot of horses. I couldn't
get him out of the jam in time."</LD>
<TE>   Pincay found his horse seventh after three-quarters of a mile.
Essence Of Dubai got in his way again in the stretch, bumping
Medaglia d'Oro at the three-sixteenths pole. Medaglia d'Oro finished
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "After he broke bad, he got stopped on the [far] turn," said Bobby
Frankel, who trains Medaglia d'Oro.</TE>
<TE>   Proud Citizen, who finished second, beaten by four lengths, was in
pursuit of War Emblem all the way but never made up any ground.</TE>
<TE>   "My horse was getting over the ground well, but not real well,"
said Mike Smith, who rode Proud Citizen. "[War Emblem] was relishing
it. I tried to stay within striking distance of him. He just kicked
on away from us."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Anita Derby winner Came Home finished sixth under Chris
McCarron.</TE>
<TE>   "War Emblem took a little heat from Proud Citizen, but he was able
to shake him off and kept on marching," McCarron said. "War Emblem
ran a legitimate pace."</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Frank "Bobby" Springer, who won four out of seven races
with War Emblem before the colt was sold, wasn't bitter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tickled to death for that horse," Springer said. "He's just a
wonderful colt and I'm very glad that he did well. There is still a
lot of pride in it for me. This is like having one of your children
succeed."</TE>
<TE>   In winning the Illinois Derby, War Emblem was ridden by Larry
Sterling Jr., who was riding him for the first time. Sterling said
that after War Emblem was sold, he tried to contact the new trainer,
Bob Baffert, but that Baffert didn't return his call. Sterling has
never ridden in a Derby.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the race before the Derby, favored Beat Hollow, ridden by Alex
Solis for trainer Bobby Frankel, was a 11/4-length winner over With
Anticipation in the $452,500 Woodford Reserve Turf Classic.... In the
$171,450 Churchill Downs Handicap, Snow Ridge won by a neck, but was
disqualified in favor of D'wildcat when the stewards ruled that
Smith, aboard Snow Ridge, had struck the runner-up in the face with
his whip in the final strides.</TE>

<HD>Ishii Still Not Losing Any in Translation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii sometimes throws in the batting cage or
into a screen between innings of games he's pitching to keep his arm
loose. He'll often pitch out of the stretch with no runners on base
because he's more comfortable from that position. Sometimes he'll
throw twice in the bullpen between starts instead of once.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii's methods might seem unorthodox, but what worked for the
left-hander in Japan has translated well in the U.S.--he remained
unbeaten after pitching the Dodgers to a 3-2 victory over the Chicago
Cubs before 47,381 in Dodger Stadium on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Despite control problems that led to five walks, Ishii gave up two
runs and four hits in seven innings, striking out seven, to improve
to 6-0, becoming the first pitcher since division play began in 1969
to begin his major league career as a starter and win his first six
games.</LD>
<TE>   Only former Dodger Fernando Valenzuela, who made 10 relief
appearances before starting, won more consecutive starts at the
beginning of his career, going 8-0 to open the 1981 season.</TE>
<TE>   Giovanni Carrara pitched a perfect eighth for the Dodgers, closer
Eric Gagne struck out pinch-hitters Corey Patterson and Roosevelt
Brown with a runner on second to end the ninth for his 10th save in
10 opportunities, and leadoff batter Dave Roberts had a career-high
four hits, knocked in two runs and score a run.</TE>
<TE>   But as it was in his previous five starts, much of the postgame
focus was on Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   "He battles," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said of Ishii, who has a
2.95 earned-run average. "One thing is safe to say after seeing him
for six games--this guy knows how to make big pitches and get big
outs when he needs them."</TE>
<TE>   Never was that more apparent than in the fifth inning, when Sammy
Sosa, who hit his major league-leading 13th homer in the first,
singled in a run to pull the Cubs within 3-2, and Moises Alou
doubled, putting runners on second and third with one out.</TE>
<TE>   But Ishii struck out Fred McGriff, who homered twice Friday night,
looking at a slow curve and blew a 94-mph fastball by Alex Gonzalez
for strike three to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at the scoreboard and he's throwing 86, 87 mph, and as
soon as there are guys on base, wow, he's up to 93, 94 mph," catcher
Paul Lo Duca said. "He really turns it up a notch. That's what he did
tonight, and he did it against some very good hitters."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii pitched exclusively from the stretch to begin the sixth--he
did the same thing after struggling early in his last start against
the Cubs last Sunday--and retired the next six batters before giving
way to Carrara to start the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "He picked up steam as he went along," Tracy said. "He had some
deep counts early in the game, and that kept you on the edge of your
seat. His pitch count [114] was up there, but the quality of his
pitches improved as the game went on."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii got some defensive help--right fielder Shawn Green gunned
down Gonzalez at the plate with a strong one-hop throw to Lo Duca in
the second--and Roberts had a hand in all three of the Dodgers' runs.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts' average dipped to .216 on April 21, and he appeared to be
slipping into a center-field platoon with Marquis Grissom, but he has
been on a roll ever since, batting .500 (13 for 26) with a .618
on-base percentage in his last nine games, pushing his average to
.312.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts slapped a single to left to open the first, stole second
and scored on Lo Duca's double. Adrian Beltre doubled to open the
second and eventually scored on Roberts' two-out drag bunt.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers made it 3-1 in the fourth when Eric Karros and Mark
Grudzielanek singled, Karros took third on pitcher Jason Bere's wild
pickoff throw to second, and Roberts flared an RBI single to left.</TE>
<TE>   "He's gotten better as a leadoff man," Tracy said. "He's mixing in
walks, bunts for hits, and he's starting to drive the ball the other
way. He definitely changes the entire perspective from the opposing
dugout when he's on base because he gives you so many more chances to
score runs. ... He's the catalyst this club hasn't seen for the last
few years."</TE>

<HD>Jordan Won't Run From Blame</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Left fielder Brian Jordan can't wait to get to his home in Atlanta on
Monday because he'll get to see his wife and three kids, including
his 9-week-old son, for the first time in a month. "He doesn't even
know what his daddy looks like," Jordan said of his newborn.</LD>
<LD>   He wouldn't have recognized him Friday night. Jordan, who prides
himself on hustle and hard-nosed play, on running out every ground
ball, failed to run out an infield popup with a runner on first in
the fifth inning. Cub third baseman Mark Bellhorn dropped the ball
but had enough time to throw to first, starting a double play.</LD>
<LD>   That was the low point of the Dodgers' 8-3 loss to Chicago and a
third consecutive 0 for 4 game for Jordan, and come to think of it,
Jordan was glad his son wasn't on hand to witness it.</LD>
<TE>   "He didn't get to see Daddy's worst game of his major league
career, thank goodness," Jordan said. "I swear, I thought that was an
infield fly. Maury [Wills, roving base-running instructor] is going
to kick my butt because we've been through that 100 times in spring
training. But that's me. When it rains it pours."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, for some reason, thought there were runners on first and
second and that the infield fly rule was in effect.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball went up, I took five steps and thought, 'Shoot, I'm
automatically out,'" Jordan said. "When he dropped it, I thought,
'Man, wasn't that an infield fly?' I must have messed up here. It was
just salt thrown on the wounds."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan was so upset about the gaffe he barely slept Friday night.
When he arrived at Dodger Stadium on Saturday he apologized to
Manager Jim Tracy, his teammates, "and I'll probably apologize to Vin
Scully because he had to watch that," Jordan said. "That's the worst
play I've ever made, because I run everything out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, in an 0-for-18 slump, has played the last three weeks
despite patella tendinitis in his left knee, a condition that has
caused him to sit out two games and will require surgery after the
season.</TE>
<TE>   The injury is similar to the one former Dodger reliever Matt
Herges experienced last season and the one Cincinnati Red center
fielder Ken Griffey has this season. Herges played through the
discomfort and underwent surgery last winter, while Griffey
aggravated his knee early this season and is now on the disabled
list.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan plans to play through the pain but may need a few more days
off than he's used to.</TE>
<TE>   "It shouldn't limit me too much," said Jordan, a former NFL
defensive back who has never undergone knee surgery. "But as far as
sliding and taking out catchers, I may limit myself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have done a horrible job bunting lately--in the last
10 games, Dodger pitchers failed to advance runners with sacrifice
bunts nine times, and Mark Grudzielanek struck out trying to advance
two runners with a bunt in a crucial sixth-inning situation Friday
night.</TE>
<TE>   But Tracy has no plans to scrap his little ball approach and adopt
Earl Weaver's philosophy. Tracy will not sit back and wait for a
three-run home run because the Dodgers simply aren't built for that
kind of attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't let [failures in the bunting game] affect decisions in
the future, because that's something that is necessary for our club
to be successful," Tracy said. "I've played for the big inning
before. If we hit that ground ball that leads to a 6-4-3 double play
[instead of bunting with runners on first and second] I'll be
interested to hear what kind of questions I'll get the next day."</TE>

second--he has a career .462 average (six for 13) against Clement,
the Cub right-hander who was acquired from Florida in a
spring-training trade.</TE>

<HD>Turbulence in the Air</HD>
<DH>With TV Ratings Down and New Technologies Emerging, Sports
Is Just Another Business Scrambling to Sustain Profits</DH>
<SE>FUTURE OF PRO SPORTS The first in a three-part series:
Television ratings are down, attendance is sluggish and the younger
generation seems preoccupied by everything from Nintendo to
skateboarding. Beset by tough times, the major sports are looking to
reinvent the way they do business and the way fans watch at home and
in the stands.</SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It could have been a funeral, men arriving in dark suits, rain
falling glumly on the city. As the leaders of professional
sports--league commissioners, television executives and team
owners--gathered for an unusual conference at the Waldorf-Astoria
hotel, a few said they might not have come if business were good.</LD>
<LD>   Business is not so good.</LD>
<LD>   Crowds have thinned at ballparks across the nation this spring and
research suggests kids are losing interest in traditional sports.
Television ratings have slipped to the point where a prominent Wall
Street firm estimates the networks will lose billions on everything
from football to stock car racing.</LD>
<TE>   All of this comes as a jolt to an industry that considered itself
recession-proof.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in the next five years you're going to see bankruptcies,"
Tim Leiweke, president of Staples Center, told the roomful of
executives. "You're going to see a league or two that's going to
Armageddon."</TE>
<TE>   But the World Congress of Sports was no wake, not for a business
so practiced at making money. Inside the Waldorf's elegant ballrooms,
appropriate for their sense of entitlement, the power brokers chose
to look beyond gloomy forecasts and focus on strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Discussions sometimes grew heated, opinions differing, but the
talk kept returning to television--the engine that drives pro sports
and the medium by which most fans watch games. The buzz at the
conference was about a broadcast revolution sparked by those shaky
ratings.Two recent deals signaled the shift.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA signed a six-year, $4.6-billion contract that moves the
heft of its schedule, including the All-Star game, to cable. Arena
football agreed to forgo any rights money whatsoever in exchange for
putting its league on NBC each Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "The red flag went up," Fox Sports President Ed Goren said. "Who
would have believed a year ago that the NBA would be a cable sport
and Arena football would be a network sport?"</TE>
<TE>   With the landscape in flux, the Internet and emerging technologies
might be in position to grab a bigger piece of the action. As
Washington Capital owner and AOL executive Ted Leonsis mused at the
World Congress in March: "I'm not so sure there will be an ABC or an
NBC or a CBS.... Everything is going to change."</TE>
<TE>   A New Kind of Deal</TE>
<TE>   It all began with Pete Rozelle, who proved that a keen businessman
is as important to sports as a star quarterback. The late NFL
commissioner turned his league into a television juggernaut, its
rights fees exploding from a reported $300,000 in 1960 to more than
$2 billion next season. Basketball stoked the flames with help from
Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Michael Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   The networks complained from time to time, especially during
recessions and labor disputes, but the money seemed endless. Then
came the February announcement that News Corp.--which owns Fox--was
taking a $909-million writedown on its contracts with football,
baseball and stock car racing. Weeks later, the investment bank
Morgan Stanley predicted similar losses for ABC, CBS and, to an
extent, NBC.</TE>
<TE>   What changed? Industry observers point to something beyond a soft
advertising market and reverberations from the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Though more people watch sports than ever before, the audience is
spread across what NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue called a
"wilderness of channels." Ratings have been diluted and networks
cannot sell enough commercials to recoup their massive investments.</TE>
<TE>   Some television executives dismiss such losses, arguing that big
games draw attention to their networks and prime-time shows, a value
not easily measured. But Goren acknowledged at the World Congress
that "there is no question network sports have taken a hit."</TE>
<TE>   Thus the NBA deal.</TE>
<TE>   At a crossroads where analysts wondered if rights fees might
finally shrink, the industry came up with a new formula. The
incumbent, NBC, was outdone by ABC and no fewer than three cable
partners: ESPN, TNT and a network to be formed by the NBA and AOL
Time Warner.</TE>
<TE>   The economics make more sense. ABC takes only 15 games in the
regular season, a few in the playoffs and the entire NBA Finals,
giving it a better chance to turn a profit. The partners handle most
of the load, as many as 300 telecasts, because they can generate
revenue in two ways, by selling commercials and  by charging fees to
the cable operators that carry their shows.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the league assumes an expanded role. No longer
free to sit back and count money, the NBA will share the risks and
rewards with AOL Time Warner when they launch their tentatively named
All Sports Network next fall.</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for Arena football. Starting with the 2003 season,
its teams will benefit from greater exposure on NBC but won't see
cash from the deal unless the telecasts attract sufficient viewers
and sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "The networks are tired of losing money and being put in a
position to bid against each other," AFL Commissioner David Baker
said. "What this did, it made us true partners."</TE>
<TE>   The Good and Bad</TE>
<TE>   What does it mean for fans?</TE>
<TE>   More partners means more games for anyone with cable or satellite
service. If such deals spread throughout major sports, there will be
fewer instances such as a recent Sunday when neither the Dodgers nor
the Angels could be found anywhere on theTV dial.</TE>
<TE>   The reshuffled landscape might also lead to more variety. NBC's
deal with Arena football suggests the traditional networks might be
open to newer--read: inexpensive--sports.</TE>
<TE>   At the very least, heightened competition has sparked technical
improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Ewert, an executive producer for CBS Sports, recalled that
no matter how often he explained football to his wife, she never
quite grasped the rules. Then his network superimposed the "1st &amp;
Ten" line on screen and she told him: "You know, I kind of get that."</TE>
<TE>   Television has since added rotating replays and effects that
highlight everything from the trajectory of a curveball to the break
of a green.</TE>
<TE>   But bigger and better doesn't come cheap. Over the course of two
days at the Waldorf, where the SportsBusiness Journal assembled a
series of panels, there was frank talk about who pays and how.</TE>
<TE>   As cable networks spend more on rights fees, they will charge more
to operators and that increase could end up on monthly cable bills.
In other words, as several panelists noted, sports have inched into
the realm of pay-per-view.</TE>
<TE>   Other costs are less obvious. Logos of car manufacturers,
insurance companies and breweries clutter every halftime show,
scoring update and graphic. Virtual ads appear on screen while play
is underway. Even some advertisers are upset.</TE>
<TE>   "To put Ally McBeal's face behind home plate at the World Series
is the kiss of death for sports," said Tony Ponturo, an
Anheuser-Busch vice president. "Quality is still part of the
equation. Do you want John Madden promoting prime-time shows rather
than setting up the next play?"</TE>
<TE>   Equally worrisome are deals that could further blur the line
between sports and entertainment. As partners with leagues, might
television have a say in the rules of the game? Relationships become
even more entangled with mega-corporations such as the Tribune Co.,
which owns the Chicago Cubs and the cable network, WGN, that
televises Cub games. It also owns The Times and the Chicago Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   Does that mean WGN sportscasters might hesitate to criticize
players who work for the same company? Might the same be true for
affiliated sportswriters? Will News Corp.--which owns Fox, Fox Sports
Net and the Dodgers--put its team on national television even if a
better game is available that day?</TE>
<TE>   "You have to put your blinders on and say, 'I'm not going to treat
the Dodgers any different than I do the Texas Rangers,'" Fox Sports
Net President Tracy Dolgin said.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how carefully executives proceed, there is the matter of
perception. Goren noted: "The public will be looking for things and
we'll be vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   Specific Tastes</TE>
<TE>   When considering this tectonic shift, Geoff Reiss recalled the
nascent days of cable when viewers asked why they should pay for more
channels when they already received 2 through 13 for free. People
wondered if they really needed sports or news around the clock.</TE>
<TE>   "It turns out we're not happy if we don't have half-a-dozen sports
channels," Reiss said. "Cable taught us to have very specific
tastes."</TE>
<TE>   As a senior vice president at ESPN.com, he believes the Internet
and emerging technologies can likewise succeed with their ability to
satisfy those tastes. These newcomers were invited to sit beside
conventional media at the World Congress, where Leonsis predicted the
dawning of an "on-demand world."</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, that world is already here.</TE>
<TE>   Pay-per-view packages offer every game in the nation on a given
day, with season-long subscriptions ranging from $49 for the WNBA to
$179 for the NFL. Personal video recorders such as TiVo allow viewers
to pause, summon a slow-motion replay, then resume where they left
off. The Internet also is venturing beyond its norm of updated scores
and statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Some new features complement television, such as NASCAR.com's
"Racecast." For $4.95 a month, subscribers can watch races on TV
while using their computers to access instant data on any car and
even listen to radio conversations between drivers and crew chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   Other developments pit new against old.</TE>
<TE>   Web sites feature video clips that allow a Philadelphia fan to
summon 76er highlights without sitting through a wrap-up show. Too
busy to watch the Angels for three hours? Pay $4.95 a month to
MLB.com to see 20-minute "condensed games" that feature part of every
at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   Even more programming will become available as leagues digitize
their archival footage.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's say you have a 12-year-old son and you want to tell him how
great Magic Johnson was in the '80s," said Jimmy Lynn, AOL's director
of account services. "You'll be able to pull up a full selection of
Magic Johnson highlights."</TE>
<TE>   Much depends on how quickly new technologies become commonplace in
American homes.</TE>
<TE>   High-speed connections might allow the Internet to stream video of
everything from European soccer matches to Olympic ski jumping. With
interactive set-top boxes, fans could choose their own camera angles
and receive only those commercials suited to their preferences. Ads
could be reduced to icons--if the viewer is interested, he or she
points and clicks for information.</TE>
<TE>   Reiss offers a word of caution about the future.</TE>
<TE>   "It's neat to think in Buck Rogers terms that, gee, we'll have a
gizmo that pours you a beer right out of your TV set," he said. "But
people have been talking about this stuff being two or three years
away for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever innovations come along, the industry will no doubt try to
profit from them. As Jerry Colangelo, chairman of the Arizona
Diamondbacks and Phoenix Suns, said: "We can't keep raising ticket
prices."</TE>
<TE>   Game of the Week</TE>
<TE>   With so much in the works, real and imagined, traditional networks
want to be clear about one thing: They are not giving up on sports.</TE>
<TE>   The proliferation of media has made big games even more valuable
to them. Ratings are diluted across the board, including
entertainment and news, and nothing else delivers the desired
audience of 18- to 34-year-old men in such numbers.</TE>
<TE>   So the NFL, the flagship league, remains highly attractive. The
Super Bowl, with its gargantuan ad revenues, will not switch to
pay-per-view anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   But if discussions at the World Congress were any indication, the
days when a nation gathers around its sets for the game of the week
on network television are dwindling. And the transition might not be
entirely smooth.</TE>
<TE>   Cable will assume more programming as emerging technologies champ
at the bit to be part of the deal--one could almost see it in the way
Reiss fidgeted on the dais while listening to more conventional
viewpoints.</TE>
<TE>   The networks will put up a fight. Fox, for instance, has
approached baseball executives with concerns about losing viewers to
MLB.com's "condensed games." Leagues, teams and players also want a
say.</TE>
<TE>   Billions of dollars are at stake.</TE>
<TE>   "What the landscape will look like five years from now is hard to
imagine," Colangelo said. "There is a hesitancy in going forward, in
conducting business as we always have."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that is why the World Congress was well attended, an
unprecedented mix of top executives. A sports business consultant
compared it to an intervention where the industry finally admitted it
has a problem.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a complicated world," Tagliabue said during his keynote
address. A world, he predicted, "that's going to change in
extraordinary ways."</TE>

<HD>Glinton Gets Quick Results</HD>
<DH>Soccer: After sitting in regulation, the rookie forward's
goal early in overtime gives Galaxy 2-1 victory over Kansas City.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 90 minutes Saturday night, Gavin Glinton, nursing sore ribs, sat
on the Galaxy bench, watching his team waste numerous scoring
opportunities.</LD>
<LD>   Inserted into the lineup to start overtime, it took the rookie
forward all of 2 minutes 17 seconds to make a difference.</LD>
<LD>   Glinton's golden goal in the third minute of overtime gave the
Galaxy a 2-1 victory over the Kansas City Wizards at Arrowhead
Stadium in Kansas City.</LD>
<TE>   Taking a long pass near midfield from Sasha Victorine, Glinton
sped up the left sideline before feeding midfielder Mauricio
Cienfuegos on the run. Without missing a beat, Cienfuegos returned
the favor with a perfectly timed pass to Glinton, who, with fresh
legs, easily beat midfielder Francisco Gomez.</TE>
<TE>   Glinton's left-footed shot flew past goalkeeper Bo Oshoniyi to end
the match, which was the Galaxy's 10th consecutive overtime game,
dating to last season.</TE>
<TE>   Glinton's goal was the first of his career and only the second
Galaxy score this season not to be scored by first-year forward
Carlos Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   In the 12th minute, forward Brian Mullan gave the Galaxy a 1-0
lead on a goal on which the ball never touched the ground.</TE>
<TE>   With Craig Waibel inbounding, he threw in a long pass to Alexi
Lalas near the top left of the penalty box. Lalas redirected the ball
with a header to a streaking Mullan, who was coming in from the
right, and Mullan sent a left-footed volley past Oshoniyi.</TE>
<TE>   Mullan had nearly scored twice before but his shots in the sixth
and 11th minutes were directly at Oshoniyi, who easily deflected them
away.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy dominated the first 15 minutes, getting off eight shots
to the Wizards' one.</TE>
<TE>   "It was getting a little ridiculous there," Mullan said of not
being able to score early. "I'm just glad somebody else could get it
in besides Fish [Ruiz]."</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City tied the score, 1-1, in the 29th minute when Preki
blasted a left-footed penalty kick past a diving Matt Reis. Preki's
score was set up when midfielder Tyrone Marshall was called for a
penalty in the box.</TE>
<TE>   The goal was the 60th of Preki's Major League Soccer career,
making him the first player in league history to get 60 goals and 60
assists.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning a five-game road trip, the longest in franchise history,
the Galaxy improved to 3-1-2 and the Wizards fell to 1-2-2.</TE>

<HD>Choi Clings to One-Stroke Lead</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>K.J. Choi, trying to become the first South Korean winner on the PGA
Tour, finished the third round of the Compaq Classic at New Orleans
where he started--at the top of the leaderboard.</LD>
<LD>   "He says he will pray, he will eat well, he will sing some songs
and he will have a good sleep," Choi's translator said.</LD>
<LD>   Choi had three birdies and two bogeys Saturday in a one-under-par
round of 71 that left him at 12-under 204, a stroke ahead of John
Rollins (68) and tour hopeful Bryce Molder (69).</LD>
<TE>   "It was tough," Choi said, wiping his face after the round.</TE>
<TE>   Choi birdied the fourth hole, but dropped a stroke with a bogey on
No. 9. He birdied Nos. 12 and 14 before closing with a bogey.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning he tried very hard to maintain his lead and his
composure from yesterday," Choi's translator said. "But he noticed
that the greens were a little harder for him to read, but as the day
progressed, he kind of got the feel for the course."</TE>
<TE>   First-round leader Dan Forsman had a 72, leaving him two shots off
the pace at 10-under 206. Billy Andrade (68) was nine under, and
Chris DiMarco (70) topped a five-player group at eight under.
Defending champion David Toms (71) was at seven under, and Phil
Mickelson (71) was at six under.</TE>
<TE>   Molder, a four-time All-American at Georgia Tech who set the NCAA
record for career scoring average (70.69), is trying to play his way
onto the PGA Tour through sponsor exemptions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alabama native Larry Nelson shot two six-under 66s on Saturday to
take a one-stroke lead over defending champion Hale Irwin in the
rain-soaked Bruno's Memorial Classic at Hoover, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin birdied the final four holes and tied a tournament record
with his second-round 63. He played 24 holes Saturday. The first
round was suspended because of thunderstorms Friday, and play was
delayed two hours early Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Rachels birdied six of his final seven holes to move within
two shots of the lead after a second-round 64.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The fourth rain delay in two days prompted LPGA Tour officials to
shorten the Chick-fil-A Charity tournament from 54 holes to 36 as 81
players, including leader Kelly Robbins, didn't even get on the
water-logged course at Eagles Landing Country Club in Stockbridge,
Ga.</TE>
<TE>   Robbins shot an eight-under 64 on Friday, then sat around Saturday
hoping to get on the course. She takes a two-shot lead into today's
final round. At six under are Laura Diaz and Juli Inkster.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Malcolm Mackenzie, an English journeyman who hasn't won in 509
European tournaments, held a one-shot lead after the third round of
the $1.8-million French Open at Versailles, France.</TE>
<TE>   Mackenzie shot a seven-under 65 with an eagle, six birdies and one
bogey over the Golf National course to move to 14-under 202. He is
one shot ahead of overnight leader Trevor Immelman, who had a 71, and
defending champion Jose Maria Olazabal, who shot a 67.</TE>

<LD>While Churchill Downs will be dark this afternoon after its signature
event Saturday, there will be plenty of racing around the country for
those who cannot get enough.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood Park's nine-race card is headed by the $100,000-added
Inglewood Handicap at 11/16 miles on the turf and Aqueduct will
conclude its meet with the $100,000 Beaugay Handicap, also at 11/16
miles on the grass.</LD>
<LD>   Forced out of the $6-million Dubai World Cup because of problems
with his feet, Redattore, who was last seen winning the San Antonio
Handicap on Feb. 3 at Santa Anita, will return to the turf in the
Inglewood, a Grade III being run for the 62nd time.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Luis Alfredo Taunay and trained by Richard Mandella, the
7-year-old, who was bred in Brazil and made his first 11 starts in
South America, has won seven of 13 on the lawn. His victories in 2001
on the surface included the Grade I Eddie Read Handicap at Del Mar
and the San Francisco Handicap, a Grade II, at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel is scheduled to send out Sumitas and El Gran
Papa, and Seinne will try for his second consecutive victory for
trainer Ron McAnally. The Chilean-bred won the Arcadia Handicap a
month ago at nearly 13-1. The Inglewood lineup is completed by
longshots Night Patrol, Gallant and Kerrygold.</TE>
<TE>   At New York, Voodoo Dancer is the filly to beat in the Beaugay.
Trained by Christophe Clement, the 4-year-old Kingmambo filly has won
six of nine on the turf and will be ridden by Jerry Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Surya won't be any price in today's sixth at
Hollywood Park, but the Unbridled filly looked like a future star
when she made her U.S. debut last summer at Del Mar and it will be
interesting to watch her comeback for trainer Bobby Frankel.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Martin Pedroza. The rider warmed up with three
victories Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Caesar Bisono. The jockey lost with 39 of his first 41
mounts at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four singling Surya in the sixth and
Benderosa in the seventh, using all in the eighth and Mr. Will,
Treasured Note, Klem and Danceascore in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 0/21. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $0/$114. Total money bet: $156.</TE>

Model series feature race but held on for the victory Saturday night
in front of 4,872 at Irwindale Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Green, who won his second consecutive race and third this season,
held off a surprising Kazuto Yanagawa and Tommy Fry, with Ben Walker

<LD>   In the 30-lap Vista Paint Super Stock feature race, Will Cottrell
broke the four-race winning streak of Darren Cheek, holding off
Andrew Phipps and Julianne Seeley for his first victory this season.
Cheek finished in seventh place.</LD>
<TE>   Greg Tucker benefited from a late crash to take the 30-lap
Modified 4's Feature race, and 16-year-old Ricky Wildman won his

<TE>   Costa Mesa Speedway motorcycle races are usually won at the start,
and usually won from the inside starting gate. But with a
reconfigured track, the one-eighth of a mile dirt oval played into
Josh Larsen's luck.</TE>
<TE>   Larsen, the defending points champion, started from Gate 4,
carried more speed through Turn 1 on the start, and went on to win
the season-opener at the Orange County Fairgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   "My luck is that I always draw the outside starting positions,
which most of the time is a bad spot to be," Larsen said. "Tonight it
played into my favor for once."</TE>
<TE>   Larsen swept past Costa Mesa Speedway national champion Chris
Manchester, who started from Gate 1 and had to make a harder turn
into Turn 1. After Larsen got past, Manchester and the rest of the
field was finished.</TE>
<TE>   Manchester, who reached the scratch main via the last-chance
qualifier, finished second, ahead of Bakersfield's Randy DiFrancesco,
Foresthill's Bart Bast and Brea's Shawn McConnell.</TE>
<TE>   In the eight-lap handicap main, Ojai's Eddie Castro won by going
from third to first with an outside pass of Shaun Harmatiuk and Bast,
who were battling each other for the lead. Bast finished second,
followed by McConnell and Larsen.</TE>

<HD>Walker's Assignment Isn't Tiny</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Samaki Walker practiced Saturday afternoon without a brace on his
bruised left knee and shot effortless three-pointers, which would be
wonderful for the Lakers if Tim Duncan weren't coming and Walker were
a guard.</LD>
<LD>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson said he believed Walker would be
available for his 15- to 20-minute assignment against Duncan, and
that Walker's knee would be sound enough to fend off the leaning,
spinning, drop-stepping Duncan, or at least try.</LD>
<LD>   There's a lot of room between stopping Duncan and trying to, as
Walker knows, and as of Saturday he was resigned to the pain he was
sure would come with the assignment.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to be extremely sore," Walker said. "There's nothing
we can do about it, just go out and play. The thing we're trying to
do right now is keep it from getting worse. We feel we've done that."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for the Lakers, Robert Horry, their other front-line
power forward, healed quickly from the bleeding beneath his abdominal
muscle and apparently will be available to play extra minutes. Also,
Jackson said he liked how aggressively Mark Madsen worked against
some of the San Antonio forwards and centers, particularly Malik
Rose.</TE>
<TE>   Walker, in an attempt to keep his knee loose, probably will ride a
stationary bike when not on the court.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio center David Robinson is listed as doubtful because of
a sore lower back.</TE>
<TE>   He played seven minutes against Seattle in the first-round series,
all in Game 1, and didn't score.</TE>
<TE>   In four games against the Lakers this season, Robinson averaged
8.8 points and 8.5 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers haven't played for a week, since finishing off the
sweep of Portland. It is the fourth time in two seasons they've had a
rest of at least five days, the price of sweeping series.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, after rests of six, five and nine days, the Lakers were
2-1. Their only loss in the past 20 postseason games came after the
nine-day respite, to the Philadelphia 76ers in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   After those three breaks, before series against Sacramento, San
Antonio and the 76ers, the Lakers shot better than all but
Philadelphia, outrebounded every team and had fewer turnovers than
every opponent. The breaks suited Shaquille O'Neal; he averaged 38.7
points and 17.3 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of practicing," Brian Shaw said. "It's a lot of going
over all the fundamental stuff we did at the beginning of the season.
But, we wouldn't trade it for playing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saddened by the passing of William Duncan, Tim's father, this
week, O'Neal and the Lakers made donations in William's name to The
Tim Duncan Foundation, which benefits nonprofit organizations in the
areas of education, health awareness and research, and youth sports.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had intended to send flowers to St. Croix in the U.S.
Virgin Islands, but the family asked that flowers not be sent.</TE>
<TE>   Also this week, the club and O'Neal made separate donations in the
name of David March, the sheriff's deputy killed Monday in Baldwin
Park.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, on why he didn't see any of the other playoff series: "TV
corrupts the mind."</TE>
<TE>   If he watched television, he'd know his Burger King commercial
runs about eight times an hour.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Show How Tough It Is at Top</HD>
<DH>NBA playoffs: Spurs, seeking revenge for last season's
sweep, should be aware of the resilience of the champions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was halfway through a series against the same San Antonio Spurs a
year ago--in the Western Conference finals--when Shaquille O'Neal
called Kobe Bryant his idol, and the best player in the NBA, and that
was that.</LD>
<LD>   When it was met with suspicion in the manner of
what-are-you-up-to-now expressions, O'Neal widened his eyes and shook
his head.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, he reserved the place for most dominant player in the
league for himself, which seemed fair to everyone, because there was
no arguing that he was the largest man on the largest team on the
planet.</LD>
<TE>   A lot has happened since, most of it good for the Lakers, who did
the parade thing again and added a ring and a banner. Somewhere along
the way they lost Jerry West, but added five championships from
Minneapolis, and suddenly they're right behind the Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   If it looked easy, maybe it's because it was. But, as the Lakers
open yet another best-of-seven series against Tim Duncan, who could
be named most valuable player within the month, and the Spurs, maybe
it looked easy because few appreciate just how tough the Lakers can
be.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs don't have a reputation for being particularly hard, but
they won't lack for inspiration. Last time they were in Los Angeles
for a couple of playoff games, they lost by 39 points on a Friday
night and 29 on a Sunday afternoon, making for a very unkind 36 hours
and a terribly long summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're thinking revenge," said Samaki Walker, a Spur
then and a Laker now. "Being swept, obviously, left a bad taste in
their mouths. I think it's an opportunity to bury that humiliation.
To finish the season the best team overall last season and then to be
swept, that was bad."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it is time the Spurs were freed of their burden.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was the Lakers who were too good too often, who were too
strong and too single-minded. It is they, after all, who have won 19
playoff games in 20 tries, not all because O'Neal is most dominant
and Bryant is most talented. They win because O'Neal wants them to
and because Bryant won't relent, because Derek Fisher and Rick Fox
are dogged, and because Robert Horry has no conscience for losing.</TE>
<TE>   In a town where wearing the baseball cap backward while driving
the Beamer is considered keeping it real, it is difficult to carry a
reputation for grit. It doesn't help either when every national
interview is done with Marina del Rey's yachts and sailboats in the
background. But, these are the same Lakers who fought back from 15
down to the Portland Trail Blazers in the fourth quarter of a seventh
game two years ago, who have won a record nine consecutive road
playoff games, and who keep showing up as favorites, and keep
winning.</TE>
<TE>   They also are the Lakers whose minds wander far enough to lose
regular-season games to Chicago (twice), among other atrocities of
focus, and throw unwarranted punches (O'Neal at Brad Miller, Bryant
at Reggie Miller). But this is their time of year, their time to push
and be pushed, and to breathe deeply and allow Coach Phil Jackson to
ooze into their psyches.</TE>
<TE>   "Resilience, I think, more than anything else, is what I see as
toughness," Jackson said. "It's not physical brutality or strength,
or being able to come back and retaliate against an opponent. It's
more the resilience to take tough situations on the court--bad calls,
a situation that didn't work out--and respond to it. The toughness
is, in my eyes--and this goes along with what I'm teaching the
team--is about being able to read what a defense or an offense is
throwing at you. And to make adjustments on the move and work it out
on their own. That's what this team that was together last year could
figure out. We have very resilient players, there's no doubt about
that."</TE>
<TE>   They aren't Pat Riley's Knicks or Chuck Daly's Pistons. They just
don't quit in little places, Fox on Peja Stojakovic, or Fisher on a
charge, or Bryant to the rim, O'Neal with half a team on his neck.
Still, the strategy before every series is to be physical with the
Lakers, for the Spurs to send Bruce Bowen aggressively at Bryant, as
Ruben Patterson was, for Malik Rose and Mark Bryant to spend their
six fouls freely on O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has played us every other way, other than trying to beat
us up," Fox said. "You look at the regular season when that was
tried, and to a degree it worked, because Shaq lost his head and Kobe
lost his head and they were thrown out of games.</TE>
<TE>   "People talk about playing us physical. They play physical and
hope we respond negatively. I got kicked in the head [by Portland's
Dale Davis]. Part of me wanted to jump up and go at Dale. The other
part of me started laughing. I said to myself, 'This is the point
where I lose my head or I laugh and recognize the part of the game
where I go beyond them.'"</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers won that afternoon by a point, the width of a technical
foul free throw.</TE>
<TE>   "All the teams L.A. has had have been touted as not being
physically tough," Horry said. "It's just because we're in
California, the nature of where we're from.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at me. I'm a power forward and I'm not a typical power
forward's size. And everybody else is not really big except for Shaq,
so they feel like the way they get to us is muscle us and wear us
down that way."</TE>
<TE>   Now they're going on three championships in a row, in part because
the largest man on the largest team has their backs. In part, it
would seem, because they have his too.</TE>

<HD>SCOUTING REPORT</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>STARTERS</LD>
<LD>   No one can guard Shaquille O'Neal and no one can defend Tim
Duncan. They both averaged more than 25 points and 10 rebounds in the
regular season, and did it again in their first-round series.
Statistically, they play each other to a standstill, which puts the
emphasis on the eight other players on the court. That's why the
Lakers are working on three championships in a row and the Spurs are
trying to remember theirs, which came immediately before the Lakers'.
Kobe Bryant averaged 33.3 points and made more than half of his
field-goal attempts in last season's Western Conference finals
against the Spurs. He also averaged seven rebounds and seven assists
in a Laker sweep, which avenged the San Antonio sweep two years
before. The Spurs won't forget Derek Fisher this year. He made 15 of
20 three-point attempts in the sweep. Tony Parker, the Spurs' rookie
point guard, was effective penetrating against the Lakers, who often
are vulnerable to small, quick players. He averaged 15.3 points in
the series, 20 in the March 31 game at Staples Center. The Lakers get
experience and playoff know-how with Rick Fox and Fisher, but they'll
need Samaki Walker to play better than he did against Portland,
bruised knee or not. The Spurs could be better with the smaller,
quicker Malik Rose at center than the injured David Robinson, who
played only seven minutes in the first round.</LD>
<LD>   Edge: Lakers.</LD>
<TE>   BENCH</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry is rangy and can bother Duncan with his savvy
defense, and his perimeter shooting can draw Duncan out of the middle
and therefore out of the double-teams against O'Neal. Laker Coach
Phil Jackson tries to pace Horry, so he'll ride Walker as long as he
can. By late in the third quarter and early in the fourth, Horry and
Walker usually have switched roles. Horry is on the court to stay,
and Walker spells O'Neal at center for those critical four or five
minutes. Brian Shaw is smart and eager to please O'Neal. Lindsey
Hunter has not shot well but is sound defensively, which will give
Fisher an occasional break against Parker. Rose has brought edginess
to the Spurs, who often play with the stoicism of Duncan and
Robinson. In Robinson's absence against Seattle, Rose averaged 16.6
points and 9.4 rebounds. Terry Porter and Danny Ferry are three-point
shooters, though Ferry has an injured right hand and was limited in
the first round, and Mark Bryant can help against O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   OFFENSE</TE>
<TE>   There's a well-worn story about Robinson dissing a young,
autograph-seeking O'Neal. True or not, O'Neal seems to believe it, so
Robinson continues to pay for the slight. O'Neal takes great delight
in muscling Robinson around the basket, and the Spurs often swamp
O'Neal with defenders. Sometimes it works: O'Neal averaged 22 points
and shot well below 50% in three regular-season games against the
Spurs. Still, the Lakers scored more points and shot at a higher
percentage than the Spurs in the regular season. If you're looking
for an unlikely scorer, try Slava Medvedenko. He got into two games
against the Spurs, one a blowout for the Spurs in San Antonio, and
averaged 11.5 points. The Spurs revolve around Duncan and his
low-block and medium-range game. Parker has given them a penetration
threat and Robinson--if he plays and plays effectively--gives the
Spurs another option from the elbow in. Steve Smith hasn't done much
against the Lakers lately, part of the reason the Spurs averaged only
93.8 points against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   DEFENSE</TE>
<TE>   Walker played two seasons in San Antonio before signing with the
Lakers last summer and frequently worked against Duncan in practice.
That familiarity was useful at times for Walker, but mostly Duncan
did what he wanted. If Horry or Walker can't handle Duncan alone,
Jackson might have to break down and run a double team at Duncan,
which Jackson hates because it frees the Spurs' perimeter shooters.
When the Lakers are healthy and motivated, their team defense is as
good as any in the West. O'Neal is bothered by an arthritic toe,
however, so he is slower and the Lakers are more vulnerable to
aggressive moves to the basket. Bryant was named to the league's
All-Defensive second team and likes to gamble. He is very dangerous
when he roams and helps, but can be beaten in that way too. The Spurs
use small forward Bruce Bowen to guard Bryant, but that didn't always
work so well. Bryant made nearly half of his field-goal attempts
against the Spurs and averaged 26.5 points. Rose and Mark Bryant
often log lots of minutes in the middle. Robinson missed all but a
few minutes of the first-round series against Seattle because of a
lower-back sprain. Bryant started Game 2 and Duncan started Game 3 at
center, with Rose starting at power forward in the latter game.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   COACHING</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing comfortable about the Lakers' three-game sweep
of the Portland Trail Blazers, in which Jackson plotted against small
lineups and matchup quandaries. Gregg Popovich looked bad in the
Western Conference finals last year, when it appeared his team gave
up on him in the face of the runaway Lakers. Still, the biggest win
of that series was in Game 2, when Jackson was ejected with 16
minutes remaining and the Lakers outplayed the Spurs down the
stretch, causing Fox to observe: "We've matured to a point where we
maintained our composure. Outside of Phil." Jackson has 144
postseason coaching victories and could overtake Red Auerbach before
June is over. Popovich has 30.</TE>
<TE>   Edge: Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   KEY TO THE SERIES</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said it's health. If O'Neal's toe doesn't slow him too
much on a tighter schedule than the first round, if Walker's bruised
knee does not have him overrun by Duncan, if Robinson's back allows
him to play at all, if Ferry's hand allows him to shoot. That's
discounting any new injuries in a series that should be physical by
Western Conference standards. If O'Neal can move, and there are
indications he is feeling better, the Lakers have the advantage. The
Lakers won the season series, 3-2, after sweeping the Spurs in the
conference finals by an average of more than 22 points a game.</TE>

<LD>When DDF De Great Saiga finished third in the fifth race Dec. 29, it
was the Idaho-bred filly's seventh loss in nine starts in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Things have been much different so far this year. Owned by Miguel
Martinez and trained by Adan Farias, DDF De Great Saiga is unbeaten
in 2002, having won four races.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-year-old filly will try to keep the streak going this
evening when she meets five others in the seventh race, a $12,300
allowance at 350 yards.</LD>
<TE>   DDF De Great Saiga began her roll with a 11/2-length victory
against $6,250 claimers on Jan. 13, returned to win by a head two
weeks later when stepping up to the $10,000 level, returned a month
after that to win a starter allowance by three-quarters of a length,
then on April 5 won by a remarkable 23/4 lengths as the 3-5 favorite.
The field includes two other fillies who are coming off recent
victories.</TE>
<TE>   Rustys Quickid won for trainer Paul Jones in her first start of
2002 on April 14 and Taste My Cleat prevailed against $10,000
claimers on Feb. 16.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Shewin. 2. Crocodile Hunter. 3. Triumphs Ace. 4.
Tinys Royal Hugger. 5. Home Bird. 6. Oh To Win. 7. DDF De Great
Saiga. 8. Famous Cartel. 9. Lanes Fortune.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Single Shewin in the first, use Crocodile Hunter and Local
Edition in the second, Concorde CS, Virgule, Seyvilla Tri-Sama, Mach
II and Triumphs Ace in the third and Tinys Royal Hugger, Loves To
Dash and Red Hot Winds in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Loves To Dash is a first-time starter for
trainer Christopher O'Dell in the fourth and it's not a strong field.
Uwinthegreen could be a threat from behind in the sixth for trainer
Gus Turner.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>They Didn't Know Jerry as a Non-Laker</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, we always knew he wasn't exactly normal.</LD>
<LD>   Forty-two years later, it's hard to remember how perfect it was
... the Lakers arriving in 1960 with this All-American boy/Olympic
hero/fledgling great ... whose name was Jerry West ... the problem
being, he could never believe he was this icon they said he was.</LD>
<LD>   He lived, died inside and rose again annually to go on another
quest but with no idea what one would do with the grail.</LD>
<TE>   Uh, put it on the mantel?</TE>
<TE>   In 1972, when he won his only NBA title in his 12th season, his
teammate and close friend, Pat Riley, who had danced him off the
floor, noted that West just "came into the locker room, had a sip of
champagne, shook a few hands and left."</TE>
<TE>   West and Riley returned in the '80s for Showtime, five titles'
worth, after which West picked up the pieces when Magic Johnson left
in 1991 and had a new superpower up and running by 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Only the great Red Auerbach, whose Celtics came back to win in
1974 and 1976 after their long run had ended in 1969, ever had a
turnaround that good, and if these Lakers turn out to be an actual
dynasty, no one did.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, as Laker publicist John Black, who is close to West,
notes of that period:</TE>
<TE>   "You know Jerry. He was happier when we were miserable than when
we were on top."</TE>
<TE>   His friends always say that--"You know Jerry"--when he does
something incomprehensible ... like walking away from a $3-million
put-your-feet-up- and-accept-the-congratulations job because his
nerves are so shot, he can't even watch the games ... or return two
years later for mission impossible, moving his wife and 13-year-old
son from Malibu to Memphis, just in time for the start of the annual
humidity festival.</TE>
<TE>   We definitely know Jerry. There was no way to miss him.</TE>
<TE>   As a player, he might as well have pinned his beating heart to his
jersey.</TE>
<TE>   His longing and anguish were so palpable, you could feel them from
the last row of the Sports Arena or the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Celtics loved him. Everyone else, they might (or might
not) have respected, but with West, there was always more emotion,
coming and going.</TE>
<TE>   After he became the only Finals MVP from a losing team in 1969,
John Havlicek embraced him on the floor, saying, "I love you, Jerry."
When West retired in 1974, Bill Russell, who'd ruined six of West's
postseason excursions, attended the ceremony, noting before a Forum
crowd that quivered with emotion:</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry, if I could have one wish granted, it would be that you
would always be happy."</TE>
<TE>   Well, that was going to be easier said than done.</TE>
<TE>   After all the years, all the triumphs and all the hints about
going elsewhere that went nowhere, the end of the Laker part of
West's NBA career--a phrase I never expected to use--was awkward.</TE>
<TE>   A rift opened in the dark days of last season's Shaquille
O'Neal-Kobe Bryant standoff, with Coach Phil Jackson and O'Neal
allied on one side and the retired West and Bryant on the other.</TE>
<TE>   West, ever fractured, helped talk Bryant into rejoining the
program and admired Jackson, while worrying that the coach's
relationship with Jeanie Buss meant Jackson would inherit the
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, in turn, wondered where the leaks were coming from, once
surmising to friends that an aggressive writer was "a West guy."</TE>
<TE>   There could be no going back. West wouldn't move in on his
protege, Mitch Kupchak, and besides, nobody was asking him to.</TE>
<TE>   In retirement, West all but disappeared. At his request, there was
no mention of him among the executive profiles in this season's Laker
media guide. He wasn't even listed in the directory.</TE>
<TE>   However, charismatic executives are in short supply and other
teams kept calling, making it impossible for him to put the game
behind him.</TE>
<TE>   One insider says as many as 10 teams called in two years. West
kept saying he wasn't interested ... and the offers kept getting
bigger.</TE>
<TE>   If the Grizzlies don't sound like the "optimal situation" he
insisted on, they have an upside with Pau Gasol, Shane Battier, a
high draft pick coming and Jason Williams, whom West thinks he can
talk down off the high wire.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the compensation package, thought to be even higher
than the reported $5-million salary--perhaps even including the piece
of the team West always dreamed of.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the price, it's a coup for Grizzly owner Michael Heisley,
who hadn't had any previous revelations, which is why they're capped
out through 2004 and West has a $2-million-a-year assistant, Dick
Versace.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, organizations from New York to Golden State, which
wanted new leadership but neglected to pursue West, are already
hearing about it.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, West will have to move more than mountains--it's more
like a whole range of them--to get his new team into the playoffs in
a conference dominated by his old team, plus assorted Kings, Spurs,
Mavericks, Timberwolves, Trail Blazers, SuperSonics, Jazz and
Clippers (if they survive this summer).</TE>
<TE>   "If he didn't go, he would always have wondered if he should
have," Black says. "If it doesn't work out, he'll go away again, come
back here, play golf and gin and enjoy his family."</TE>
<TE>   Black choked up reading a newspaper story about West's departure,
but what else is new? West was probably wiping away tears halfway to
Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Lakerdom will never be the same. East is East and so is West. As
always, he's emotional and so are we.</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   How do you say, "The air just went out of the balloon" in Chinese?
Chinese wonder center Yao Ming worked out for officials from 26 teams
in Chicago, showing he's athletic and skilled but a long way from
being a franchise player. Also, instead of being a mammoth 7 feet 5
and 270 pounds, as reported, he was measured at a reedy 7-5 and 236.</TE>
<TE>   West, asked to compare Yao to greats such as O'Neal, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar or Bill Walton: "He's not any of those guys. [Rik] Smits
is a good comparison. This guy is big but he's more of a finesse
player at this point. Everyone would like to see him play closer to
the basket. His biggest challenge will be on the defensive end." Yao
is still considered the best big man in the draft and is expected to
go in the first two or three picks. West is expected to take him if
the Grizzlies get the chance.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe I could have phrased that better: Toronto center Antonio
Davis' wife, Kendra, taunted Detroit people in the hallway outside
the Pistons' dressing room after the Raptors, who had trailed, 2-0,
tied the series, 2-2, declaring, "Y'all celebrated too soon." Replied
Detroit's Chucky Atkins, "With all respect to Antonio Davis' wife, I
respect her for saying what she did, but she won't be on the court
tomorrow night. Know what I mean?"</TE>
<TE>   Only you, Reggie Miller: Now the scourge of the entire New York
metropolitan area, the 36-year-old Pacer star averaged 24 points,
leading all scorers, banked in a 40-foot three-pointer at the end of
regulation in Game 5, flew down the lane for a dunk in the first
overtime, then blamed himself for the double-overtime loss to the
Nets: "I know a lot of people talk about me out there like I'm the
boogie-man in the playground, like I'm a myth or something and I come
up with all these plays. I didn't come up with the big one tonight."
... Oh yeah, TV replays showed Miller's three-pointer shot was late,
making it even more certain the refs will use them next season, a
good move because it's one thing they can resolve definitively.</TE>
<TE>   Look for Jazz brass to scatter most of their eight free agents to
the winds. Coach Jerry Sloan called it "the most selfish team I've
ever coached." They won't trade Karl Malone--unless he forces them
to--but Mailman's head was a problem too, as suggested by his
14-point, three-rebound performance in the finale. He got his
nickname because he delivers, not because he mails games in, but, as
an insider noted, "There were a lot like this this season." Malone is
looking around, as usual: "I'd definitely like to know who's coming
back and what their plans are for me. Until I get those answers, it's
hard to give the public an answer about what's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   After six consecutive first-round exits, the Timberwolves' press
corps is bored, bored, bored, which may be why it overlooks the
team's never having been favored and never having had the home-court
advantage. "I've also been here when we've won 19 games," GM Kevin
McHale said. "There's just no absolute way you're going to flush
everything down the toilet and say, 'I'm going to throw away 50
wins.' ... I'd call for Shaq every day if I thought I could get him.
But they ain't trading Shaq."</TE>
<TE>   Spur guard Terry Porter, after learning that Tim Duncan wouldn't
play in Game 4: "Our room for error just left the building." More
than that left the building. The Spurs lost by 12.... There goes the
neighborhood: Either out of frustration with Antoine Walker's shot
selection, or just because he wanted the ball, Boston's Paul Pierce
fumed when Coach Jim O'Brien called a play for Walker in Game 4 of
the series against Philadelphia. "It's good to want the ball," said
teammate Kenny Anderson, "but [Pierce] has to learn, and learn well,
that you can't win by yourself." ... Orlando's Grant Hill, on his
rehab: "I'm the black Mark Spitz. I'm always in the pool."</TE>

<LD>Coach Larry Brown plans to return to the Philadelphia 76ers. Allen
Iverson's future isn't so clear.</LD>
<LD>   A day after the 76ers were eliminated by Boston, Brown indicated
that Iverson, last season's most valuable player, could be traded if
he doesn't change his ways.</LD>
<LD>   "My problems with Allen have been the same for six years," Brown
said Saturday. "I love him, his competitiveness. I'm proud of the way
he tries in every game. The issues are things he has control over and
he'll have a problem with me if he doesn't take care of it. He has to
be at practice. He has to set an example."</LD>
<TE>   Iverson, who refused to speak to reporters, often missed practices
this season, sometimes using what were considered lame excuses.</TE>

<TE>   Charlotte forward Jamal Mashburn is not expected to play today
when the Hornets open their Eastern Conference semifinal series
against New Jersey at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Mashburn is sidelined with the lingering effects of a virus and a
vitamin deficiency. The Hornets also will be without Jamaal Magloire,
who was suspended for a game for a flagrant foul.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston and Detroit failed to win a road game in the first round of
the playoffs. That will have to change if the Celtics expect to
defeat the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons have the home-court advantage in the series, which
begins today in Auburn Hills, Mich. The teams split the season
series, 2-2, with each team winning twice on its home court.</TE>

<LD>Venus Williams beat Martina Hingis, 6-3, 7-5, Saturday to reach the
final of the Betty Barclay Open at Hamburg, Germany, and remain the
world's No. 1 player for another week.</LD>
<LD>   Williams dominated with her power tennis, despite the slow clay
courts, and converted her fourth match point to win.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt in control the whole time," Williams said. "Sometimes it's
definitely my weakness keeping the ball in play, but today I just
felt like I definitely put power on the ball and kept it in the
court."</LD>
<TE>   The 21-year-old American, who was taped but showed no signs of an
ankle injury, is seeking her third title at the $585,000 event after
winning in 1999 and last year. She will face Kim Clijsters, who
advanced past an injured Jelena Dokic, in today's final. Dokic
withdrew because of a strained thigh while ahead, 6-4, 4-4.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who regained the top ranking from Jennifer Capriati this
week, is trying for her fifth title of the year. The first-place
prize money of $93,000 would move her within $76,000 of $10 million
in career earnings. Capriati could regain the top ranking next week
at the German Open.</TE>

<TE>   Iva Majoli, the No. 4 seed from Croatia, beat Libuse Prusova, 6-7

$170,000 tournament, will play Aasa Svensson. Svensson cruised past
Tathiana Garbin, 6-3, 6-2, in the other semifinal.</TE>

<TE>   Gaston Gaudio will face Jarkko Nieminen in the final of the
Mallorca Open clay-court tournament after their semifinal victories

4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (3).</TE>
<TE>   College Football</TE>
<TE>   Four Colorado football players had their scholarships revoked
after attending an off-campus recruiting party that was the center of
a rape investigation. A university spokesman confirmed Saturday that
Coach Gary Barnett revoked the scholarships of Marques Harris and
three other players. The university declined to identify the other
players.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett reportedly informed the players of his decision to revoke
their scholarships in late January and February. On Friday, Harris,
Allen Mackey, Ron Monteilh and Corey Alexander were charged with
contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The four are accused of
giving alcohol to high school recruits they were assigned to
supervise. Monteilh was charged with distributing marijuana, said his
attorney, Stephan Wall. Each player's attorney denied their client
was involved in wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Three Notre Dame football players and a former player accused of
raping a female student are being expelled from the university, their
attorneys told the South Bend Tribune. St. Joseph County Prosecutor
Chris Toth told the newspaper Friday that he would decide by May 15
whether to file charges.</TE>
<TE>   The men, whose names have not been released by the school, were
notified of their expulsions Thursday. They were expelled for alleged
sexual misconduct.</TE>

<TE>   Jaromir Jagr scored a second-period goal and Martin Prochazka had
a goal and an assist for the Czech Republic, which edged the United
States, 5-4, at the World Hockey championships in Jonkoping, Sweden.
The game was played pressure-free as both teams had already qualified
for the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   In other games, Finland defeated Russia, 1-0, to win Group E, and
Sweden routed Ukraine, 7-0. Despite the loss, Russia remains in the
hunt for a quarterfinal berth.</TE>

third longest game in Maple Leaf history.</LD>
<LD>   Roberts got to a loose puck off a faceoff in the Ottawa zone and
fired a wrist shot between goalie Patrick Lalime's pads to tie the
Eastern Conference semifinal series, 1-1.</LD>
<LD>   "It was kind of wide open there for two minutes there, end-to-end
rushes, turnovers, it looked like someone just wanted to end it,"
Roberts said. "We're fortunate to get the win."</LD>
<TE>   Travis Green and Darcy Tucker also scored for the Maple Leafs,
while goaltender Curtis Joseph stopped 54 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "We're lucky Cujo saved us," Roberts said.</TE>

<TE>   Colorado was sluggish in a 6-3 loss in Game 1 with just one day of
rest after a physical seven-game series with the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to redeem ourselves," Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley said.
"The players deserve a lot of credit because they prepared
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   It was the most goals by Colorado in the playoffs since they beat
Florida, 8-1, in Game 2 of the 1996 Stanley Cup Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, St. Louis 2--Steve Yzerman scored on the first shot of

<HD>Jensen, Bonds Do the Job for Giants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ryan Jensen had an idea he would pitch early Saturday. What happened
after was a surprise.</LD>
<LD>   Jensen helped the San Francisco Giants take a combined no-hitter
into the eighth inning before beating the Cincinnati Reds, 3-0,
Saturday at San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't feel like I had the kind of stuff where I thought I
could get everybody out, but it was the best stuff I had all season,"
Jensen said.</LD>
<TE>   Barry Bonds homered for the 400th time in a San Francisco uniform
as the Giants won their third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen (2-2) took over from Jason Schmidt with two out in the
first inning and carried a no-hitter into the eighth. Jason LaRue
broke up the bid with a solid single into left field.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just glad we had R.J. strong in the bullpen," Giant Manager
Dusty Baker said. "He was our minuteman today. We had him on alert
after Jason warmed up in the bullpen. I knew Jason wasn't right."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds established yet another major league standard when he hit
his home run. He became the first player ever to hit 400 for one team
and 100 for another. Bonds hit 176 home runs with the Pittsburgh
Pirates before signing with the Giants as a free agent after the 1992
season.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 3, Pittsburgh 0--Kevin Jarvis came off the disabled list
to strike out eight in 51/3 scoreless innings at San Diego and Ryan
Klesko hit his 200th homer.</TE>
<TE>   The Pirates, who've scored the fewest runs in the majors, were
shut out for the third time in five games.</TE>
<TE>   Jarvis (2-3) was sidelined with a strained elbow and hadn't
pitched since April 17.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 6, Montreal 5--Reserve catcher Rod Barajas, a .167 hitter
playing in his 11th game, hit a game-winning infield single in the
11th inning at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Finley, who led off the inning with a single off Graeme
Lloyd (0-2), scored from third on Barajas' stinging grounder, which
caused third baseman Fernando Tatis to stumble and fall after
fielding it.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 6, Florida 4--Ben Sheets overcame a shaky start to win
for the first time since opening day and Richie Sexson drove in three
runs at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Sheets (2-3) ended a losing streak at three and Milwaukee won for
only the second time in 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 3, New York 1--Carlos Hernandez held the Mets to four hits
over seven innings to lead the Astros at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez (3-0) tied his career high with eight strikeouts and
walked three, and gave up one earned run.</TE>
<TE>   Houston took a 2-0 lead in the first inning after Craig Biggio was
hit by a pitch and scored on Brad Ausmus' triple. Jeff Bagwell
followed with a sacrifice fly to score Ausmus.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 6, Colorado 5--Marlon Anderson tied his career high
with four RBIs and Doug Glanville hit a tiebreaking sacrifice fly in
the sixth inning at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Rollins went four for four with two triples, a double and
two runs scored for the Phillies, who handed the Rockies their second
consecutive loss after a six-game win streak under new Manager Clint
Hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona right-hander Todd Stottlemyre, unable to bounce back
between regular turns in the rotation, was put on the 15-day disabled
list.</TE>
<TE>   In a corresponding move, the Diamondbacks recalled left-handed
reliever Greg Swindell from a rehabilitation assignment with triple-A
Tucson and activated him from the 15-day disabled list.</TE>

<HD>Rookie Is a Cure for Cardinals</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>A 28-year-old rookie gave the pitching-strapped St. Louis Cardinals a
huge lift.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Simontacchi, signed as a minor league free agent in the
off-season, worked seven strong innings in his major league debut in
a 3-2 victory over the Atlanta Braves on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "He was just relentless," Manager Tony La Russa said. "He didn't
have a lot to work with so the pressure was always on him. The
composure was outstanding and the quality of his pitches was
outstanding."</LD>
<TE>   Kerry Robinson, Tino Martinez and Placido Polanco drove in a run
apiece for the Cardinals, who have won only six of their last 19 but
ended the Braves' three-game win streak. The Cardinals have six
pitchers, five of them starters, on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals purchased the contract of Simontacchi, 28, from
triple-A Memphis to fill the latest vacancy in the rotation and
optioned another rookie, Josh Pearce, to Memphis. Simontacchi, the
11th starting pitcher the Cardinals have used in 30 games this
season, gave up two runs and five hits with four strikeouts and one
walk.</TE>
<TE>   "I started getting the jitters when I came out of the game,"
Simontacchi said. "I wasn't nervous, I was more excited to get the
job done."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Isringhausen worked the ninth for his fifth save.</TE>

<LD>UCLA catcher Stacey Nuveman set the NCAA softball record for home
runs when she hit a solo drive Saturday in a 10-1 Pacific 10
Conference victory over Oregon State at Corvallis, Ore. It was the
86th in her career.</LD>
<LD>   Nuveman, a 6-foot senior from La Verne, has 16 homers this season
and moved past Arizona All-Americans Leah Braatz and Laura Espinoza,
who had 85.</LD>
<LD>   Tairia Mims, who drove in four runs, and Crissy Buck, who had two
runs batted in, each hit home runs for UCLA (46-6, 14-3 in conference
play), the top-ranked team in the nation and the Pac-10 co-leader
with Arizona. Amanda Freed (19-2) gave up three hits in seven
innings. She struck out five and walked four.</LD>

<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>The racing world screams.</LD>
<LD>   A fiancee cries.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not a textbook win," said Jill Moss. "But Bob is not a
textbook guy."</LD>
<TE>   The racing world snorts.</TE>
<TE>   A good buddy snorts back.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't print what I want to say," said Mike Pegram. "But Bob
can take the heat."</TE>
<TE>   The racing world can't believe what happened here on a brilliant
Saturday, when its rascal trainer took a potential masterpiece and
turned it into a rose-colored finger painting.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Baffert could give a rip what the racing world believes.</TE>
<TE>   "We came here through the back door," Baffert said with a grin.
"But we're leaving through the front door."</TE>
<TE>   More like, a trap door.</TE>
<TE>   He stole a horse. Then he stole an entry position. Now he stole
the Kentucky Derby?</TE>
<TE>   Even if you don't like Bob Baffert, you must admit one thing.</TE>
<TE>   The man is good.</TE>
<TE>   Good enough to win the Derby Saturday with War Emblem, a 20-1
longshot he had never touched until a month ago.</TE>
<TE>   Smart enough to win it with Victor Espinoza, a jockey who had
never won a Derby and never ridden this horse.</TE>
<TE>   Savvy enough to beat back 17 other mostly faster horses and
countless critics and bad karma that chased him all the way to the
post parade at overflowing Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob Baffert is a genius," said owner Prince Ahmed Bin Salman.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the descriptions applied to him this week, that was a new
one.</TE>
<TE>   He was a vulture for arranging the purchase of War Emblem the
moment he discovered the Illinois Derby winner wasn't going to run
here.</TE>
<TE>   He was a charlatan for also entering Danthebluegrassman at the
last minute, knocking out several other more worthy entries.</TE>
<TE>   He was a snake for scratching Danthebluegrassman on Saturday
morning for a muscle injury that could not be proven.</TE>
<TE>   But then, Saturday afternoon, beginning with his homestretch
screams and ending with his fiancee's postrace tears, he was
something else entirely.</TE>
<TE>   For the third time in six years--a Derby record for trainers--he
was a champion.</TE>
<TE>   "When they were turning for home, and I'm starting to yell, it's
an incredible feeling," Baffert said. "You see your horse and you
know it's going to win, and you want those last 100 yards to last
forever."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the last few days, which haunted Baffert as he was forced
to constantly defend himself and his unusual practices. Nobody asked
if he thought he would win. Everyone was too busy wondering why he
was even here.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there are a lot of people who think it's not fair that we
were even in the Derby," Baffert said. "But this is how I make my
living."</TE>
<TE>   While many think that job description mostly involves pinching
noses and inflating whoopee cushions, Saturday illustrated his
ability to do a little horse training.</TE>
<TE>   "This day proved his greatness," said Pegram, who owns horses that
Baffert trains.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as Thursday morning, Baffert couldn't even recognize
War Emblem when he summoned a reporter to the rail to watch him work.</TE>
<TE>   But then Thursday night, in his hotel room, Baffert and some
friends watched a tape of the Illinois Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob saw something in that race," said friend George Jacobs. "We
could tell. He knew the horse had a chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   After mulling over the strategy for a day, Baffert phoned Espinoza
early Saturday morning and summoned him to the barn. There, together,
they watched the same tape, and Baffert issued the orders.</TE>
<TE>   Espinoza was supposed to rush to the lead immediately, then remain
steady while all the other horses bunched up behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Call it the Sit For the Roses.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me, don't move, don't move, even at the top of the
stretch," recalled Espinoza. "It was so hard. I did not want to do
it. But Bob was right."</TE>
<TE>   And, as usual, when Baffert is right, other people are angry.</TE>
<TE>   "The lead horse moved so slowly, we couldn't get through to catch
up," said Laffit Pincay Jr., who could push charging Medaglia d'Oro
to no closer than fourth place. "Lots of horses who didn't belong in
this race hurt the ones who did belong."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bailey, whose Castle Gandolfo broke 15th and ended up 12th,
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The fast horses were stuck behind the slower horses," he said.
"We couldn't get around the pack to make a run."</TE>
<TE>   So there sat War Emblem, only the 22nd horse in 128 years to lead
the Derby from wire to wire.</TE>
<TE>   And there sits Bob Baffert, having won more Derbies than all but
three other trainers, smiling, handshaking, sneaky great.</TE>
<TE>   Like Tiger Woods, he plays a different game than his opponents.
Like Shaquille O'Neal, he's not afraid to talk about it.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert's biggest crime is that of being a modern man in an
ancient sport. All you antiques and throwbacks? Pay attention, or
risk becoming cobwebs.</TE>
<TE>   The hardest part for Baffert's critics came after the race, when
he was asked about the future.</TE>
<TE>   "No way I was thinking about the Triple Crown for this horse,"
Baffert said. "But now, I'm thinking, yeah, Triple Crown."</TE>
<TE>   Thus reminding them that, however painful, watching his horse run
for two minutes will be far easier than listening to him wax for the
next two weeks.</TE>

<LD>Garden Grove Pacifica reaffirmed its position as the No. 1 softball
team in The Times' rankings with a 3-0 victory over No. 7 Santa Ana
Mater Dei in the championship game of the Anaheim Canyon tournament
Saturday at Canyon High.</LD>
<LD>   Brittany Weil (18-0) pitched a two-hitter and struck out nine to
earn the victory for Pacifica (23-2-1), which two weeks ago defeated
Mater Dei, ranked No. 1 at the time, to move into the top spot.</LD>
<LD>   Jessica Marical's run-scoring double in the bottom of the first
inning gave Pacifica a 1-0 lead. She later scored on a wild pitch.
Pacifica added a run in the fourth inning when Jamie Waldecker
doubled in Jennifer Orpatelli.</LD>
<TE>   Sheila McKorkle had both hits for Mater Dei (21-5), which never
advanced a runner past second base.</TE>
<TE>   Royal 6, Thousand Oaks 0--Tournament most valuable player Kirstie
Kenton (8-2) pitched a four-hitter, struck out four and did not walk
a batter for No. 16 Royal (21-5-1) in the Thousand Oaks tournament
Green division final.</TE>
<TE>   Nichole Mears, chosen best offensive player, hit a solo home run
for Royal and Heather Erickson and Andrea Ramirez each had two hits
and drove in a run. Thousand Oaks, ranked No. 12, falls to 20-7-1.
The teams meet again Tuesday with the Marmonte League title on the
line.</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo 5, Crescenta Valley 1--Richelle Villescas (17-3)
pitched a two-hitter with nine strikeouts and one walk as El Segundo
(20-3) won the championship game of its tournament. Villescas has 76
strikeouts in her last six games.</TE>

<HD>Kings Put Royal Hurt on Dallas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Steve Nash slumped in a metal folding chair in front of his locker.
He looked as if he had just been slam dunked, which is sort of what
happened to all of the Dallas Mavericks in Game 1 of the Western
Conference semifinals Saturday at Arco Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Something strange happened to the Mavericks, said Nash, who was
able to trace most of it to a 108-91 thumping administered by the
Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<LD>   "We weren't ourselves tonight," Nash said.</LD>
<TE>   Just who they were isn't clear, except possibly to the Kings, who
found the Mavericks pretty useful as something to pound on for a
while, like tenderizing steak.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are fortunate because they can fill the space under the
basket with some heavy furniture, such as Chris Webber and Vlade
Divac. Meanwhile, the Mavericks can really counter only with Raef
LaFrentz, who is not known for his physical presence, and Wang
Zhizhi, a 7-foot-1 curiosity most comfortable hoisting
three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   It's not as though the Mavericks didn't know they were going to be
tested inside, it's just that there really wasn't much they could do
about it. Divac had 18 points and 16 rebounds, nine in the first
quarter, and Chris Webber had 20 points and 10 rebounds even though
he played only 35 minutes because of fouls.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks countered inside with Dirk Nowitzki, who had 14
rebounds and 24 points even though he missed two-thirds of his 24
shots, but Eduardo Najera and LaFrentz, the other two front-line
starters, had seven points and nine rebounds between them.</TE>
<TE>   Webber fouled out with 4 minutes 9 seconds to go, but the Kings
hardly missed him, safely ahead, 98-86, and cruising toward Monday
night's Game 2 at Arco Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Webber said it's not as if the Kings played a perfect game or
anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure we can get better in a lot of areas," he said. "You can
always be more focused next time."</TE>
<TE>   There could have been a little more focus in the first half, at
least on shooting the ball, because neither team did that very well.
Peja Stojakovic had 16 of his 26 points in the first half, which
ended with the Kings ahead, 55-50.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Webber wasn't doing much--three for 11, three
fouls, two turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "I was personally frustrated," he said. "I tried not to think
about not playing well and I went into the locker room at halftime
and really just tried to relax."</TE>
<TE>   It must have worked, because Webber scored 13 points in the second
half and set the tone under the backboards in concert with Divac. The
Kings were ahead, 91-81, with 9:11 to go, then watched as the hapless
Mavericks went exactly seven minutes without scoring a field goal.</TE>
<TE>   And when they did, it was too late. The Kings' lead was 14 points
on Doug Christie's three-pointer with 1:44 left, which meant the only
thing left to do was figure out what Game 2 is going to mean.</TE>
<TE>   For the Kings, they're going to try to forget losing at Arco to
Utah in the first round. For the Mavericks, they're going to try to
forget shooting 38.9% as they they did Saturday and figure out how to
jump-start their cutting, slashing, fluid offensive style of play.</TE>
<TE>   "None of our guys are going to look at this game and say 'Let's
put that up on the front of the fridge,'" said Maverick assistant Del
Harris. "We all figured this to be a seven-game series, which means
everybody is going to get beat sometime."</TE>
<TE>   It's going to be very difficult for the Mavericks if they lose
Monday night at Arco, but they are secure in the knowledge that they
had won three in a row at the arena before Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who were 36-5 at home during the regular season,
believe their defense will hold the key to their success.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to try to make them take shots over people and put
pressure on people," King Coach Rick Adelman said.</TE>

<HD>Winning Derby System Brings a Tear to His Eye</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I had War Emblem to win the Kentucky Derby.</LD>
<LD>   Now you might be asking yourself: "How does the genius do it?"</LD>
<LD>   To be honest, I got a tip from our own handicapper, Bob
Mieszerski, who wrote in Saturday morning's newspaper that War Emblem
"is much more likely to finish last than he is to win."</LD>
<TE>   That officially made War Emblem a "sure thing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SO I called the Grocery Store Bagger and asked if he wanted to
make a wager on the Kentucky Derby. I'm always surprised when I find
him awake.</TE>
<TE>   He thought I was calling to bet against him, because that's what
I've been doing for the past three years. So instead of pooling our
money on War Emblem, right away the wise guy tells me Harlan's
Holiday, Came Home or Perfect Drift is going to win, and for $20 I
can have all the other horses.</TE>
<TE>   My daughter is going to marry this guy. It becomes clearer and
clearer to me every day I'm going to have to work the rest of my life
to support them. I hope Mieszerski keeps writing about horse racing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN THE horses came out onto the track, NBC announcer Tom Hammond
proclaimed this "the most sentimental moment in sports," and then
added, "even the horses get misty eyed" when everyone begins singing
"My Old Kentucky Home."</TE>
<TE>   It must be frustrating to get misty eyed and have to keep all four
hooves on the ground with no chance of wiping your eyes before
running 11/4 miles at full speed.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if trainer Bob Baffert read some of Bill Plaschke's
columns to War Emblem to prepare him to run with tears in his eyes?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO HORSE in the previous 127 years of the Derby had ever won from
post position No. 19, where Easy Grades was slated to start. Jockey
Gary Stevens abandoned the mule, and experts said Eric Karros could
outrun the horse.</TE>
<TE>   One of our editors, Vic Seper, bet Easy Grades to win, and
included him in his trifecta and superfecta wagers. Easy Grades
finished 13th. I suspect Seper was a bagger at one time in his life.
I might end up having to support him too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SPORTS EDITOR Bill Dwyre urged me to try to sign up Saturday
morning for TVG, the new betting service on the Internet that allows
you to stay home and bet on races. Personally, I wouldn't authorize
using company money to bet on horses, but I thought I would try
something new, and listen to Dwyre.</TE>
<TE>   I found the service responsive and without any hitches. I also
found it a little scary, because you can just keep betting company
money all day long, which Dwyre is going to have to explain to
somebody at some point.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DO NOT, however, watch racing from Hollywood Park on Fox Sports
Net. Twice in the past week--the only times I watched--the horses
were being loaded into the starting gate after the big buildup from
Fox commentators, and then came the apology: "It's the top of the
hour and we're going off the air before the race starts."</TE>
<TE>   Someone at Fox probably thinks they are producing "Who Shot J.R.?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DODGER OUTFIELDER Brian Jordan goofed Friday night, didn't run out
a pop fly, and had to answer to the media. He did so with sincere
regret, humor and class, so I asked Manager Jim Tracy if Jordan's
locker could be placed adjacent to Kevin Brown so maybe he could
learn something.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ANY TIME Tracy talks a lot without taking a breath or making much
sense, it's because someone has asked a question that he can't/won't
answer honestly. That's why he was going on and on about the fact
Andy Ashby's inability to bunt had not hurt the team the other night.
Forget for a moment, as he hopes you do, the team's pitchers can't
bunt and it's disgraceful.</TE>
<TE>   With runners on first and third and no one out Saturday, about an
hour after Tracy's filibuster, pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii bunted into a
double play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DODGERS' offense might be anemic, but the team presently has
11 players hitting better than Gary Sheffield (.207).</TE>
<TE>   WHATEVER THEY are paying Maury Wills to work with Dodger leadoff
hitter Dave Roberts, they should double it based on recent results.</TE>
<TE>   I HOPE 76er fans are still interested enough in basketball to
watch the NBA Finals on TV. Before they begin, this would be an
excellent time to get out of Philadelphia, and take that vacation in
Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   THE REDSKINS, the team that had fans paying to watch training camp
practices, are now going to have rotating advertising signs behind
Coach Steve Spurrier every time he has a news conference. One of the
sponsors is Budweiser, which will make a great photo opportunity when
Spurrier has to talk about one of his players being arrested for
drunken driving. It's the NFL, it will happen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IF YOU listened to Joe McDonnell, Doug Krikorian and Bob Golic on
sports talk radio talking about the return of the NFL to L.A., I hope
you understand they have no idea what they're talking about. Of
course, that doesn't make them much different than Tim Leiweke, the
point man for the Anschutz Empire.</TE>
<TE>   The Chargers have been targeted by Leiweke, although he won't
admit it, and the other day he was talking about changing the team's
name. He had no idea they were once known as the Los Angeles
Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from George:</TE>
<TE>   "That was a pretty clever shot taken at you in the Saturday sports
letters; he really got you good. Any chance it was written by the
bagger?"</TE>
<TE>   As far as I know, we don't accept letters written in finger
paints.</TE>

<LD>Four weeks from today, defending champion France and first-time World
Cup participant Senegal will step onto the field at the largest
soccer-only stadium in Asia and 64,677 fans at the Sangam World Cup
Stadium in Seoul, South Korea, will ask:</LD>
<LD>   "Where are all the gnomes?"</LD>
<LD>   If that seems absurd, it is, but it's no more bizarre than a whole
host of peculiar happenings occurring in the run-up to Korea/Japan
'02, the first World Cup to be held in Asia.</LD>
<TE>   Here's a quick look at just some of these odd doings, beginning
with the lawn ornaments:</TE>
<TE>   Gnome Game</TE>
<TE>   In the French village of Hemin, residents awoke last week to find
the local soccer field decorated with 202 garden gnomes of all
shapes, sizes and colors.</TE>
<TE>   Police investigating the matter found a note that read: "France's
team for 2002, chosen by the NFNLJ--202 good guys."</TE>
<TE>   The NFNLJ, as most gardeners in Europe know, is the Garden Gnome
Liberation Front, whose purpose is to relocate the figurines from
private gardens to forests, which the organization says is their
natural habitat.</TE>
<TE>   French citizens who could tell one gnome from another spent the
rest of the day reclaiming their property.</TE>
<TE>   Aussie Bovines</TE>
<TE>   Because Japan will not allow European beef to be imported, for
fear of mad-cow disease, the chefs who will prepare meals for Italy's
World Cup team have turned to Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors from the Italian soccer federation--no doubt after
extensive testing at expensive restaurants--determined that Aussie
beef was closest in taste and texture to Italian and thus will import
steaks from Australia, to go along with the crates of pasta, parmesan
cheese and olive oil they're bringing from Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Thai One On</TE>
<TE>   The Italians made no mention of wine, but over in soccer-mad
Thailand, where games at the May 31-June 30 tournament will be
televised in prime time, sales of TV sets and beer are expected to
soar.</TE>
<TE>   The inventive Thais are also using the World Cup in a sort of
carrot-and-stick experiment to keep prison inmates on their best
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer fans who find themselves behind bars--as opposed to in
them--during the tournament will be allowed to watch games only if
they conform to prison rules.</TE>
<TE>   Thailand's overcrowded jails, combined with the June heat, make
for unbearable conditions, and allowing well-behaved inmates to watch
the World Cup is a way of decreasing stress, officials believe.</TE>
<TE>   There is no truth to the rumor that those who behave badly will be
allowed to watch only the U.S. team.</TE>
<TE>   Just Say No</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to what they see as "prejudice" by foreigners, South
Korea's dog-meat restaurants intend to bite back by offering free
samples outside the Seoul World Cup Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "We plan to develop canned dog-meat juice, which football fans can
enjoy in their stadium seats," restaurateur Choi Han-Gwon told Agence
France-Presse.</TE>
<TE>   "They will enjoy it instead of Coke."</TE>
<TE>   Don't bet on it.</TE>
<TE>   The Korean tradition of dining on dogs has raised the hackles of
animal rights activists, among them former actress Brigitte Bardot,
who wants the French team to boycott the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Don't bet on that either.</TE>
<TE>   Kangaroo Update</TE>
<TE>   Players who speak out against the practice of raising dogs for
human consumption had best check their feet first.</TE>
<TE>   A British animal-welfare group recently suggested that England's
captain, David Beckham, teammate Michael Owen and other players throw
away their boots because they are made from kangaroo skin.</TE>
<TE>   Vegetarians' International Voice for Animals (VIVA) said the
kangaroos are cruelly slaughtered, but a spokesman for the German
sportswear company that makes the boots said the kangaroos were
killed humanely.</TE>
<TE>   Paper Pushers</TE>
<TE>   Fans will not be allowed to bring all sorts of things into the 20
World Cup stadiums in Japan and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The verboten list includes such obvious items as alcohol,
firearms, fireworks, bottles, stones, poison, drugs, swords, knives,
helmets and anything frozen.</TE>
<TE>   It also includes two less easily understood items: umbrellas and
confetti.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that June is the third-wettest month of the year in
the region, the ban on umbrellas seems unreasonable.</TE>
<TE>   "Normal umbrellas will be confiscated," one organizer said.
"Unless fans want to get wet, they should bring nylon raincoats or
small folding umbrellas so as not to obstruct people."</TE>
<TE>   As for confetti, it was considered a clean-up problem. Which leads
to this question: How are those same crews going to deal with the two
million paper cranes--birds, not hoists--that will be dropped onto
the International Stadium in Yokohama during the closing ceremony?</TE>
<TE>   Temple Training</TE>
<TE>   If all that Australian beef doesn't help Italy, perhaps Buddhism
will, even if Coach Giovanni Trapattoni decides not to include
Italy's most famous Buddhist, Roberto Baggio, on his team.</TE>
<TE>   The Italians have been given an exclusive invitation to the
Koshoji Buddhist temple in Sendai, site of their training camp north
of Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   "The temple will remain closed to all other nations participating
in the World Cup," said a spokesman for the Italian-Japanese
Friendship Assn. in Sendai.</TE>
<TE>   So there.</TE>
<TE>   Cheery News</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's Ministry of Administration and Home Affairs has
established squads of cheerleaders, each squad featuring 500-1,000
volunteers, whose duty it will be to support each of the World Cup
teams.</TE>
<TE>   It will be interesting to see just how enthusiastic the squad
assigned to the U.S. is when the Americans play in Daegu on June 10.</TE>
<TE>   Their opponent that day is South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Art Nouveau</TE>
<TE>   South Korea has a long tradition of creating ceramic works of art
and the World Cup has prompted one Seoul artist, Cho Kyung-Soo, to
turn out sets of porcelain soccer balls in varying sizes.</TE>
<TE>   There's not much practical value in such objects, of course. Then
again, perhaps it would give those gnomes something to play with in
France.</TE>

<HD>Saberhagen's Gem Was Magical Moment</HD>

<LD>Whether you were a player, coach, parent, fan, umpire, peanut vendor
or even a sportswriter, all who were present 20 years ago on a warm
June night at Dodger Stadium knew they had witnessed history.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a moment I tell my kids about and will tell my grandkids
about," umpire Larry Obar said.</LD>
<LD>   On June 14, 1982, Bret Saberhagen of Reseda Cleveland High pitched
the only no-hitter in the 44-year history of the City championship
baseball game. He retired 21 of 22 batters in a 13-0 victory over
Palisades.</LD>
<TE>   Next month, on June 4, the 2002 City champion will be crowned at
Dodger Stadium in the 64th City final. It's a place where dreams are
made and fantasies fulfilled, as Saberhagen can attest.</TE>
<TE>   "The big thing everybody wants to do is play at Dodger Stadium,"
Saberhagen said. "That's all we thought about."</TE>
<TE>   Leo Castro was Cleveland's 31-year-old second-year coach when his
team arrived at Dodger Stadium in a bus.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing was going to be special," he said. "We were in
awe. We were in heaven."</TE>
<TE>   Saberhagen began the game as the top pitcher in the City. He was
8-0 after overcoming early-season shoulder problems. One doctor had
told him to have surgery. Instead, he took time off and came back
stronger than ever. He was selected in the 19th round of baseball's
amateur draft by the Kansas City Royals. Some scouts thought he was a
better prospect as a shortstop than a pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   But opinions changed after Saberhagen's performance in the most
pressure-filled game of his high school career. He never felt more
comfortable or at ease. He was pitching on the hallowed mound that
produced Hall of Famers Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale and hardly
acted like a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   "For a big game, playing at Dodger Stadium, it was amazing how in
control he was," said Obar, who called the balls and strikes. "He was
in his own little zone. It was like he was mature beyond his years."</TE>
<TE>   Yet no one expected that a throwing error by second baseman Tom
Brandt on a ground ball in the first inning would result in the only
baserunner for Palisades and prevent Saberhagen from finishing with a
perfect game. He struck out eight and retired the last 20 batters in
order.</TE>
<TE>   Brandt felt badly about the error.</TE>
<TE>   "It kind of stayed with him and was something [bothering] him for
years," Castro said.</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Mark Markland wishes he had been able to catch
Brandt's throw. But Markland wasn't going to let an error detract
from the game of a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   He was the one who approached Saberhagen in the dugout in the
fifth inning and did something you're not supposed to do in baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "I mentioned, 'Hey, Sabes, you're throwing a no-hitter, dude,'"
Markland said. "He kind of didn't want to think about it."</TE>
<TE>   Saberhagen was doing his own teasing. He got thrown out trying to
score from second on a wild pitch with two out in the bottom of the
sixth, denying Kenneth Marden, who was batting at the time, a chance
to improve on his four-hit game.</TE>
<TE>   "He complained if I didn't get thrown out, he would be five for
five and the big story of the game," Saberhagen said.</TE>
<TE>   When catcher Glen Newhouse fielded a bunt and threw out the runner
to end the game, the no-hitter was complete.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unbelievable," said Markland, who's a financial planner
living in Manhattan Beach. "We could have played anybody in the
country and could have beaten them. Our bats were alive and
[Saberhagen] was throwing some serious heat. It was awesome."</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland finished with 16 hits. Among Palisades' players was
Steve Kerr, who'd go on to play on four NBA championship teams.</TE>
<TE>   Saberhagen was thrust into the media spotlight. He was handed the
phone in the Dodgers' dugout.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody said, 'Hey, the president is on the phone,'" Saberhagen
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was KNBC calling. It wanted Saberhagen to appear live with
sportscaster Stu Nahan on its 11 p.m. telecast. It was the finishing
touch to a dreamlike day.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone had told me he was going to throw a no-hitter,
everybody would have laughed," Castro said. "For him to do it at
Dodger Stadium and in that setting, it was a fairy tale."</TE>
<TE>   Saberhagen would experience many more fairy tales. He twice won
the Cy Young Award, twice was the comeback player of the year and was
voted the most valuable player of the 1985 World Series.</TE>
<TE>   He retired this year after spending 18 years in the major leagues
and has moved back to Calabasas so he can be closer to his three
children.</TE>
<TE>   On weekends, he dresses in pinstripes as a member of the L.A.
Yankees, part of an over-30 adult baseball league. He plays
shortstop. He also pitches batting practice occasionally at Calabasas
High, where his oldest son, Drew, is a sophomore first baseman.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season, Calabasas played Verdugo Hills. On one team
was Saberhagen's son. On the other was Obar's son, Stephen. Twenty
years later, the star pitcher and the veteran umpire were reunited in
the stands, reminiscing.</TE>
<TE>   Castro, 50, who teaches physical education at Los Angeles Lincoln
High, is planning to break out his photographs and videotape of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing was magical," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marden, who lives in the Bay Area, is expecting his first child in
October. He can't wait to tell the story of playing at Dodger Stadium
on a night when the remarkable happened.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one cool moment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a 23-year-old sportswriter sitting in the Dodger Stadium press
box, trying to write a front-page story under deadline pressure, I
found my own composure tested by Saberhagen's benchmark performance.</TE>
<TE>   In 25 years of covering high school sports, I haven't seen anyone
top that no-hitter.</TE>

<LD>If watching a lot of supposedly smart people looking very dumb on
national television is your idea of edge-of-the-seat entertainment,
then, yes, of course, by all means, Saturday's Kentucky Derby was
(all together now) the most exciting two minutes in sports!</LD>
<LD>   When was the last time all the experts, every last one of them,
with no exceptions, guessed wrong when trying to predict the outcome
a sporting event this big?</LD>
<LD>   (OK. Besides the most recent Super Bowl.)</LD>
<TE>   Bob Baffert's War Emblem won the 128th Derby, and if you had any
clue he would, you're a far better man or woman than anyone NBC or
ESPN shoved in front of a camera Friday or Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a crazy Derby," NBC's Tom Hammond said just before the
race, considered by the pundits to be the most wide-open Derby in
years. "You can have an opinion and you can't be wrong, perhaps."</TE>
<TE>   Oh yes you can.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN, going with the if-you-throw-enough-darts approach, rounded
up four experts on Friday's handicapping show and five more on
Saturday's prerace show.</TE>
<TE>   Three went for Perfect Drift, who wound up third.</TE>
<TE>   Five others cast single votes for Harlan's Holiday (who finished
seventh), Essence of Dubai (ninth), Saarland (10th), Medaglia d'Oro
(fourth) and Private Emblem, who possibly could have been confused
with War Emblem, at least until they got to the gate. Private Emblem
finished 14th.</TE>
<TE>   A special citation goes to Chris Fowler, who boldly offered four
names he thought could contend--Harlan's Holiday, Perfect Drift,
Medaglia d'Oro and Lusty Latin. Why stop there? As we quickly
learned, he should have just kept going, ticking off more names,
maybe round it off to a top 16.</TE>
<TE>   NBC had Mike Battaglia and Bob Neumeier take their shots.
Battaglia went for Perfect Drift, Neumeier tabbed Saarland.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's sports Web site polled its on-line legions of "cyber
cappers." Top four favorites: Perfect Drift (13% of the vote), Came
Home (12%), Saarland (12%) and Medaglia d'Oro (11%).</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem, a 20-1 longshot, was scarcely mentioned, despite his
connection with Baffert, who has now won the Kentucky Derby three
times in the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   Why?</TE>
<TE>   One reason: His connection with Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   It hasn't yet been a month.</TE>
<TE>   With his 2002 Kentucky Derby prospects looking unusually bleak,
Baffert watched War Emblem win the Illinois Derby on April 6 and had
an epiphany: If you can't win the big one the old-fashioned way--you
know, hard work, sweat of the brow, actually earning it, that sort of
thing--you can always go out and buy it. George Steinbrenner's been
doing it for years.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert persuaded Prince Ahmed Bin Salman to join him on a quick
poach of the horse, spending a reported $1 million to make sure he
had an entry at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   This did not sit well with the national horse racing media, which
appears to have grown tired with Baffert, a one-time white hat among
trainers, and figured a good way to crack back on the prodigal one
was to ignore him in the prerace buildup.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Finley of ESPN.com summed up the general mood Friday with an
immediate dismissal of War Emblem.</TE>
<TE>   "The way he won the [Illinois Derby] is an indication of how this
horse likes to run--right to the front, sets slow fractions and was
able to win," Finley said. "That's not going to happen Saturday. He
got away with a 48-[second]-and-change half in Illinois--forget about
that. He's going to get roasted early. Mr. Baffert's going to have a
long afternoon."</TE>
<TE>   Finley was half right. War Emblem ran a similar race
Saturday--took the lead early, never lost it, never was really
threatened. He wasn't roasted.</TE>
<TE>   Was it exciting?</TE>
<TE>   For Baffert and the Prince, no doubt.</TE>
<TE>   But the "most exciting two minutes in sports?"</TE>
<TE>   They weren't even the most exciting two minutes in sports on
television Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, via pay-per-view, Arsenal defeated Chelsea to win
England's F.A. Cup, 2-0, on spectacular goals by Ray Parlour and
Fredrik Ljungberg. Two pretty exciting minutes, those.</TE>
<TE>   Later, the Sacramento Kings and the Dallas Mavericks met in the
second round of the NBA playoffs, engaging in what Marv Albert
described as "racehorse basketball." Pick two minutes from that game,
any two minutes. Better yet, pick a winner. Unlike the Derby, you'd
have a 50% chance of being right.</TE>
<TE>   How exciting is it to watch the same name win again by simply
buying the championship? To a certain extent, it's all relative. Last
year's World Series was considered a classic, largely because the
Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the New York Yankees in seven games,
largely because the Diamondbacks bought the two best pitchers in the
world.</TE>
<TE>   It happens. "A lot of members of the media knocked [the prince]
for buying Baffert a Derby horse instead of bringing one up himself,"
Hammond said. "I don't think it matters much. The Baffert magic works
again."</TE>
<TE>   I suppose you can call it that. Right about now, the horse racing
media would like to call the whole thing off, but the Preakness is in
two weeks. Handicapping can be dangerous, but, odds are, Baffert will
be there.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Doubles Its Wins Over USC</HD>

<LD>Monique Henderson started it.</LD>
<LD>   Tiffany Burgess continued it.</LD>
<LD>   Sheena Johnson ended it.</LD>
<TE>   Those three UCLA track and field athletes strung together a trio
of the fastest collegiate times in the nation this year during a
35-minute stretch Saturday afternoon to help the Bruins to a 111-92
Pacific 10 Conference dual-meet victory over visiting USC at Drake
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   USC outscored UCLA, 64-55, to win its first NCAA women's title
last spring. But UCLA won its 10th consecutive dual meet against the
Trojans before 8,094 to take a 16-3 lead in the series.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA men defeated USC, 121-81, for their 23rd victory in the
last 24 dual meets against the Trojans. USC leads the series, 39-30.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the most incredible team meeting last night," said
Burgess, a junior who cut more than two seconds off her previous best
in the 800 meters when she ran 2 minutes 3.73 seconds. "We talked
about everyone doing their part to help the team win. So all I
wanted, really, was to do my part. I figured if I win, I'll have a
fast time. If I win, I'll score points to help our team."</TE>
<TE>   Henderson, a freshman who set a national junior (age 19 and under)
record of 50.74 in the 400 while at San Diego Morse High in 2000, won
that event in 51.33 on Saturday to give UCLA a 58-49 lead after 10 of
19 events. Her 51.7-second anchor leg in the 1,600 relay gave UCLA a
come-from-behind victory and a season-best time of 3:32.02 in the
final women's event of the meet.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just thinking about the win and getting the points for our
team," Henderson said of her 400 showdown with USC's Nakiya Johnson.
"She had run 52.30 earlier this season so I knew I was going to have
to run well to beat her."</TE>
<TE>   Burgess said that watching Henderson win the 400 got her
adrenaline flowing and Sheena Johnson said that watching Burgess and
Lena Nilsson finish first and second for the Bruins in the 800 had
the same effect on her.</TE>
<TE>   "After watching them do that, I figured why not go for a
national-leading mark in the 400 hurdles," said Johnson, whose 56.56
clocking surpassed the previous national best of 56.64 by Lashinda
Demus of South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's victory gave UCLA an 87-75 lead after 15 events. The
Bruins clinched the victory when Nilsson and freshman teammate
Alejandra Barrientos finished first and second in the 1,500.</TE>
<TE>   Angela Williams, the three-time defending NCAA champion in the
100, paced the USC women. Williams won the 100 in 11.30 and the 200
in 23.56. She also ran the first leg on the victorious 400 relay team
that tied for the NCAA lead with a 43.71 clocking.</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA men, who lost to USC by a point last year, won 14 of 19
events. Bruin senior Scott Moser won the hammer throw with a
career-best 210 feet 11 inches and the discus with a toss of 200-3.</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Juaune Armon won the long jump with a school sophomore
record of 26-3.</TE>

<HD>Hawaii Breaks Hex, Service of Pepperdine</HD>
<DH>Volleyball: Warriors win NCAA championship by defeating
Waves for the first time this season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hawaii had lost three times this season to Pepperdine in men's
volleyball, but the Warriors stepped forward when it counted most,
defeating the Waves in four games Saturday at State College, Pa., to
win the NCAA championship.</LD>
<LD>   The 29-31, 31-29, 30-21, 30-24 victory gave Hawaii its first NCAA
title in any men's sport. Hawaii lost to UCLA in the 1996 volleyball
final, its only other appearance in the men's title match. The Hawaii
women's volleyball team has won four national titles.</LD>
<LD>   Pepperdine's usually dominant service game fell through, with 19
service errors paving the way for a Hawaii victory.</LD>
<TE>   "I tell these guys, there are no little things," Pepperdine Coach
Marv Dunphy said. "We made some service errors, but that's the way it
goes. Hawaii was the better team tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Costas Theocharidis, a 6-foot-3 junior outside hitter from Greece,
had 19 kills to lead Hawaii (24-8), which lost to Pepperdine twice in
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation regular-season matches and again
in the MPSF tournament final last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Ching, a junior outside hitter, had a season-high 17 kills
for the Warriors and Eyal Zimet, a junior hitter from Israel,
finished with 13 kills and 13 digs.</TE>
<TE>   Theocharidis, the 2001 national player of the year, was chosen the
tournament's outstanding player, but he credited his teammates for
coming through in the final.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always nice to have other people step up and [Ching] played
like an All-American tonight," Theocharidis said. "It's great to have
the pressure taken off. Tonight was a team effort--it was
unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii lost the first game, came back to win a close Game 2, then
dominated from there.</TE>
<TE>   "From Game 2 on, we played our best match of the year, and it
couldn't have come at a better time," Hawaii Coach Mike Wilton said.
"Costas was money tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine (29-5) was seeking its fifth national championship, but
instead was runner-up for the fifth time. Freshman Sean Rooney had 18
kills, including seven in the first game, for the Waves and Lance
Walker, a senior, added 17.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine trailed, 20-16, in the final game, but pulled to within
23-22 when a block attempt by Ching sailed out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   Hawaii then scored the next three points to take a 26-22 lead and
finished off the Waves on a Theocharidis kill.</TE>
