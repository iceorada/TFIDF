<HD>British DJ Sasha Looks for His Groove at the Mayan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BALTIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sasha's sold-out appearance Wednesday night at the Mayan Theatre
should have been a slam dunk. The British DJ was playing his first
set in L.A. since the release earlier this month of his triumphant
debut CD of original material, "Airdrawndagger."</LD>
<LD>   But as Paul Oakenfold did at the Mayan earlier this summer when he
celebrated his first "artist" album, Sasha ignored his own material.
In fact, the set was uncharacteristic of Sasha in many ways.</LD>
<LD>   He was at a quick disadvantage in starting an hour later than his
scheduled midnight show time. Even in the nocturnal world of dance
music, that's unusually late for a Wednesday night.</LD>
<TE>   When he finally did take his place behind the decks, he
concentrated on vocal-heavy tunes, an interesting choice given that
part of "Airdrawndagger's" appeal is the way it communicates his
vision using no vocals.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being rich in singing, the early song selection
Wednesday reflected more obvious techno and fast-paced beats rather
than his usual choice of large, synthesizer-heavy trance grooves.</TE>
<TE>   The set did pick up about 40 minutes in, after Sasha stopped the
music for the first time. Perhaps responding to the crowd's
adoration, he appeared to become more interested in the set. Still,
his mixing lacked the effortless fluidity his fans have come to
expect.</TE>

<HD>Life Is Full of Surprises in 'The Chateau'</HD>
<DH>Bittersweet comedy puts a new spin on unpleasant Americans
vs. stuffy French culture clash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With "The Chateau," writer-director Jesse Peretz comes up with enough
fresh twists to the ugly American vs. surly French confrontation to
sustain this delightfully bittersweet culture-clash comedy. If what's
funny is frequently hilarious, then what's nasty truly stings, and
the film is honest enough not to tie up everything with a ribbon.
Everyone by the end emerges wiser, though not necessarily friends.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Rudd stars as Graham Grandville, a sweet-natured, curly
haired slacker from Lawrence, Kan., caught up in his latest therapy
and New Age-ish thinking that includes vague dreams of a career in
counseling. His older adopted African American brother Allen (Romany
Malco), who has decided he wants to be called Rex, is a slick L.A.
entrepreneur. The Grandville brothers were orphaned early and are not
close, but are swiftly reunited when they receive word that the noble
French relative they never knew, their great-uncle, the Count Jacques
de Grandville, has died, and that as his nearest relatives they have
become the unexpected owners of his ancient, moated chateau, its
contents, and all its dependencies and land.</LD>
<TE>   Making their way, not without difficulties, to the chateau in
rural France, they find their existence is unknown by the chateau's
staff, headed by a formally dressed butler, Jean (Didier Flamand), a
tall, silver-haired man with a superior air but also thankfully
fluent in English. Jean is not at all glad to see them but
reluctantly accepts the authenticity of their documents and claim to
the estate. What Graham and Rex had not anticipated is that the
chateau, a superb 18th century structure with 15 bedrooms built on a
14th-century foundation, is in a decrepit state and that the Count
was virtually penniless. Besides Jean, the staff consists only of an
older couple, Sabine (Maria Verdi) and Pierre (Philippe Nahon); the
groundskeeper; and a young maid, Isabelle (Sylvie Testud), the single
mother of a baby.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the well-meaning Graham can be disastrously obtuse, he
is enchanted with the shabby-elegant estate, while Rex is not
unreasonably figuring how they can unload their property as fast and
profitably as possible. Both are attracted to the demure Sylvie,
albeit with different motives.</TE>
<TE>   Language and cultural barriers arise swiftly, however, especially
when the chateau's tiny staff learns that the brothers are looking to
sell it. They don't trust Graham's agreeing with them that any buyer
should keep them on for life, and the offended Sabine and Pierre set
out sabotaging every possible sale. As tension builds at the chateau,
Graham behaves more and more like a jerk and Rex like an unsavory
seducer and con man. As complications multiply, Peretz throws a
curve, a clever surprise at the film's climax that allows for an
ending likely to satisfy audiences more than its characters.</TE>
<TE>   Peretz has a way with his cast (that includes a glorious Donal
Logue as the worst possible prospective buyer) and with dialogue and
a plot that is alternately and sometimes simultaneously hilarious and
painful. "The Chateau" is a small film shot resourcefully on digital
that shows Rudd and Malco to good advantage and comes as a satisfying
surprise.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong language. Times guidelines: In addition
to some strong words there are adult themes and situations.</TE>

<HD>Boxing Tale 'Undisputed' Is in Fine Fighting Shape</HD>
<DH>Director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giler help draw
full characterizations of fighters in prison, played by Ving Rhames
and Wesley Snipes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter Hill's "Undisputed," a boxing/prison picture as smart as it is
brawny, shows what seasoned Hollywood pros can still accomplish
without pretensions and overwhelming special effects.</LD>
<LD>   "Undisputed" is a compelling entertainment because of Hill and
co-writer David Giler's adroit cinematic storytelling skills and the
powerful presence of Wesley Snipes and Ving Rhames, whose talent and
intelligence are as impressive as their physiques. Those are the
actors themselves fighting in a movie with no lack of visceral
impact.</LD>
<LD>   Rhames' massive Iceman Chambers is the current world heavyweight
boxing champion, considered one of the sport's great fighters, but
he's been brought low by a six-to-eight-year sentence for a rape he
insists he did not commit. Despite this dire turn of events, he
arrives at a new maximum-security prison in the Mojave Desert with
his arrogance undiminished. Not surprisingly, he responds with
contempt when he learns that the prison has its own champion boxer,
Monroe Hutchen (Snipes), who has a record of 67 wins and no losses in
the Inter-Prison Boxing Program.</LD>
<TE>   Mendy Ripstein (Peter Falk), a Meyer Lansky cohort from way back
to Batista's Cuba and a boxing aficionado serving a life term for tax
evasion, nevertheless believes that Monroe is just the guy to melt
the Iceman.</TE>
<TE>   Hill and Giler set up their story with much wit and ingenuity, and
take pains to paint full-length portraits of Monroe and Iceman that
are ultimately sympathetic to both yet devoid of special pleading.
Monroe is a man who is proud of a life-long self-control that lapsed
calamitously just once. A California state champion on the verge of
the big time, Monroe lost it when he caught his woman with another
man and has wound up with a life sentence without the possibility of
parole. He builds pagodas and bridges out of matchsticks and says he
has learned to live in his head.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath his veneer of arrogance, Iceman is honest and self-knowing
enough to admit to himself and others that he has always relied on
solving everything with his fists and continues to do so because, as
he explains, everyone is always trying to a get a piece of the
champion. (Hill and Giler suggest how hard it is for a world champion
to defend himself against a rape charge, but leave it up to us to
consider whether he might be innocent.) But resorting to his fists at
every provocation behind bars can only make more trouble for him at a
time when he desperately needs to stay on good behavior to qualify
for a work leave in 18 months to two years.</TE>
<TE>   He's made zillions, but it's the old story: many ex-wives, an
entourage, an inept and/or crooked business manager, the prospect of
a $75-million civil suit filed by the woman who successfully accused
him of rape, and a legal bill already up to $2 million and climbing,
have not exactly left the champ, already age 35, sitting pretty. Is
it any wonder that his manager (Daton Callie) and his attorneys want
him out of prison as fast as possible?</TE>
<TE>   Hill and Giler are highly imaginative in the way they have
"Undisputed" play out with humor, suspense and unpredictability. They
are especially adroit at never letting us know or see anything more
than we need to, and this economy contributes to the film's leanness
and vigor. Giler's witty in-depth characterizations extend to Michael
Rooker as the prison's head guard, as eager for the match as Mendy;
Jon Seda as Mendy's key protector in the prison; Wes Studi as
Iceman's shrewd cellmate; and Fisher Stevens as Monroe's canny
manager.</TE>
<TE>   Mendy might have been written especially for Falk, so perfect is
the fit, with Falk missing none of the old gangster's durable smarts
and dark sense of humor. Master P heads a prison rap group that
performs before the Inter-Prison matches.</TE>
<TE>   Filmed at the Nevada's new High Desert State Prison, "Undisputed"
is a great-looking film, shot and assembled with style and an easy,
vital flow.</TE>
<TE>   For a prison film, it is remarkably free from violence, and the
expertly staged boxing scenes (famed real-life fight trainer Emanuel
Steward worked with Snipes) are classic tests of skill and strength
free of gratuitous gore.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong language. Times guidelines: Aside from
the language, the film is suitable for older teens.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rosemarie Soltis is terrified of flying. Just the thought of getting
on an airplane makes her tremble. But the prospect of spending a few
precious moments with John Ritter is giving the 55-year-old
Bolingbrook, Ill., resident the fortitude to hop on a plane today for
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Cheryl Free, 43, of Fort Wayne, Ind., is also flying to Los
Angeles today to visit Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure
for the first time. But that adventure pales next to her hope for a
hug and a picture with Jim Belushi.</LD>
<LD>   Holland Lehto of San Antonio is also traveling today to Los
Angeles, with her father, for a weekend jaunt at the Magic Kingdom.
But the real thrill for the 13-year-old will be meeting comedian Ryan
Stiles of the ABC improv series, "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" She hopes
she doesn't get tongue-tied.</LD>
<TE>   These three, along with a throng of other fans from near and very
far, are expected to make a pilgrimage to Disney's California
Adventure on Saturday and Sunday to rub shoulders and cheer more than
70 ABC stars featured in the network's current and upcoming
prime-time lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The ABC Primetime Preview Weekend represents synergy at its
purest--stars of the Disney-owned network promoting their shows at
the Disney-owned amusement centers. Those wishing to bathe in the
yellow glow of ABC must shell out the $35 to $45 admission price for
the theme park.The stars getting up close and personal with fans
include Dennis Franz and Mark-Paul Gosselaar of "NYPD Blue," Damon
Wayans of "My Wife and Kids," Dylan McDermott of "The Practice" and
Drew Carey and Stiles of "The Drew Carey Show." The casts of all the
new dramas and comedies such as "8 Simple Rules" with Ritter and
Katey Sagal; "Life With Bonnie," starring Bonnie Hunt; "Less Than
Perfect"; and "MDs" will be introduced, and several of the shows will
be screened.</TE>
<TE>   Among other highlights are two live performances of "Whose Line Is
It Anyway?," several ABC Happy Hour Trivia challenges, a daily
"parade of stars" and musical performances by Belushi ("According to
Jim") and his Sacred Hearts band.</TE>
<TE>   Even bands marching in the daily parade will have that ABC flavor.
The Rubidoux High School Marching Band will perform selections from
"The Music Man"--which is one of the original offerings this season
on "The Wonderful World of Disney." The remake stars Matthew
Broderick.</TE>
<TE>   The preview marks the first time a network has sent most of its
prime-time talent out at one time to meet viewers. ABC, along with
Disney World and California Adventure, previously has sponsored
highly popular weekends featuring its daytime soap stars. This
weekend's event is primarily designed to hype the new season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a big movie opening," said Jeff Bader, executive vice
president of ABC Entertainment and the overseer of ABC's synergy
initiative with other Disney divisions, including theme parks. "It
won't make an immediate impact on ratings, but with the press
interest in the event and the buzz surrounding it, it's really
getting the word out. It's all about awareness."</TE>
<TE>   But he admitted that in addition to ABC's being in an unusual
position to host such an event--its parent company owns theme
parks--any increase in visibility is a boost for the troubled
network.</TE>
<TE>   ABC executives acknowledged that the network needs all the
hype--and help--it can get to recover from last year's dismal
showing, when it lost 20% of its prime-time audience and fell to
fourth place among viewers 18 to 49, the group advertisers pay the
most to reach. Industry insiders have speculated that the fate of
embattled Disney chief Michael Eisner may rest on the network's
performance this season.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bader: "Yes, we do need this now more than ever."</TE>
<TE>   California Adventure could also use the boost. The park next to
Disneyland has drawn disappointing crowds since opening in February
2001.</TE>
<TE>   George Lopez, star of "George Lopez," said he thinks the preview
is a great idea. "These kinds of things are what needs to happen for
ABC to get back to where it needs to be. ABC needs Disney, and Disney
needs ABC. It's a great time to come together and do this. And all
the performers are jazzed about doing this. There seems to be this
united togetherness and spirit to lift the network up."</TE>
<TE>   Still, all of the talk of synergy and corporate concern
surrounding the weekend is meaningless to fans such as Free, Soltis,
Lehto and others who are spending up to thousands of dollars to make
the trek.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to do everything on the schedule," said Free, an office
manager in Allen Superior Court in Fort Wayne. "I watch ABC all the
time, and I'm so totally excited about going to see the stars. I
don't like cable. I always watch network television. Unlike people
who say they can't find anything to watch, I always find something."</TE>
<TE>   Free said she is particularly excited about seeing Wayans and
Belushi: "They really make me laugh. And I've always been a fan of
Jim Belushi. Now I can see him on TV, not just film."</TE>
<TE>   An obsessive fan of sweepstakes, Free won an all-expenses-paid
trip to the preview in a network-sponsored contest. Her companion on
the trip will be a fellow sweepstakes addict, Angela Hresan, 40, a
retired probation officer who lives in Powhatan, Va. The two women
have corresponded for several years by e-mail but have never met.
They plan to hook up in Detroit today and fly to California together.</TE>
<TE>   Hresan said, "I feel like I've won twice! I won the opportunity to
meet my friend and this trip. And I've never been west of Texas, so
this is awesome."</TE>
<TE>   Hresan operates a Web site that teaches people how to save money
and "shows them how to live lavishly for less money." Although
excited, she said that she is not nearly as big a TV fan as Free.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not star-struck," she said. "Half of those people could
probably walk up to me and I wouldn't know them. But I'll be a bigger
fan of TV after this trip. And it will be great to meet them. After
all, they're just like me. I'll bring my business card and say, 'If
you need to save money, let me know.' "</TE>
<TE>   Soltis, who also won her trip in a sweepstakes, said she didn't
think she had a chance of winning: "I'm still in disbelief."</TE>
<TE>   She declared that ABC is indeed her favorite network. "I'm not
just saying that. It's our station of choice. I like the way they
have all the sporting events. Everything is for the family. I'm not
afraid to have my grandchildren watch it."</TE>
<TE>   And there are a lot of grandchildren. "I have 12, and 13 will come
while I'm gone," she said with a giggle.</TE>
<TE>   Her biggest dream is to meet Belushi. "I want to tell him he's
absolutely great," Solis said. "I want to tell him I love all his
movies and to please give me a hug so I can take a picture."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there's still the matter of getting on that dreaded
airplane. "My husband says it's just a question of mind over matter,"
she said. "I've got medication." She quipped, "A friend told my
husband he should take a mallet with him if I get too boisterous."</TE>
<TE>   Other fans are paying their way to the preview. Thirteen-year-old
Young bid $1,925 in an online auction for a package that will allow
her to meet the "Whose Line" cast and participate in some improv.</TE>
<TE>   Asked who her favorite comedian on the show was, she paused. "I
don't like to choose favorites," she finally said. "But I think Ryan
is the funniest. I hope I don't get too nervous when I meet him."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's Primetime Preview Weekend takes place Saturday and Sunday at
Disney's California Adventure. For information, call (714) 781-7290.</TE>

<HD>Shock-Jock Antics Stir Up More Tough Talk by FCC</HD>

<LD>Making up reports about the death of Britney Spears, castrating a pig
or having a lewd conversation with a porn star--shock jocks are
continually pushing the limits to show that nothing is sacred. But
after a stunt in which a couple were charged with having sex during
Mass in St. Patrick's Cathedral, a pair of New York DJs are finding
out that their bosses and regulators think otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   WNEW-FM afternoon hosts Opie &amp; Anthony, who had been off the air
all week, were fired Thursday, while their bosses at the New York
talk station have been suspended by Infinity Radio, the outlet's
parent company. the Federal Communications Commission launched an
investigation Thursday in response to a complaint from the Catholic
League for Religious and Civil Rights.</LD>
<LD>   "I expect this complaint to be on the fast-track at the
commission," FCC Commissioner Michael Copps said in a statement,
adding that he's received "many outraged e-mails and phone calls"
about the incident.</LD>
<TE>   "The FCC has a responsibility to ensure that the indecency laws of
the United States are being vigorously enforced. If these complaints
and press accounts prove true, this commission should consider the
strongest enforcement action possible against this station, up to and
including revocation of the station's license."</TE>
<TE>   But apart from some notoriety and possibly a fine, Infinity
probably won't be effected by the incident, said Christopher H.
Sterling, professor of media and public affairs and of
telecommunication at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Copps is right, but he is in a minority in a strongly
deregulatory commission," said Sterling, who added that he'd be very
surprised if the four-member FCC voted a hearing or threatened the
license renewal for WNEW. "It just isn't going to happen, short of a
huge public or congressional uproar."</TE>
<TE>   The St. Patrick's stunt was part of an ongoing contest at the
"Opie &amp; Anthony" show, in which points and prizes were awarded to
couples having intercourse in the riskiest places. On Aug. 15, during
a Mass celebrating the Feast of the Assumption, New York police
entered the cathedral and arrested a Virginia couple and comedian
Paul Mercurio, who was reportedly giving WNEW listeners a
play-by-play of the assignation via cell phone. The couple, Brian
Florence, 37, and Loretta Lynn Harper, 35, were charged with public
lewdness, while Mercurio was cited with acting in concert.</TE>
<TE>   Gregg "Opie" Hughes and Anthony Cumia were back on the air the
next day but then were replaced by reruns this week. WNEW vice
president and general manager Ken Stevens and program director Jeremy
Coleman were suspended. On Thursday, a statement from Infinity said
that the show had been canceled "based on recent events."</TE>
<TE>   An earlier statement from the company had said that neither
Infinity nor WNEW "in any way condone the actions that took place
last week."</TE>
<TE>   "We have taken steps to ensure that this type of incident does not
happen again.... Once again, we apologize to all of those who were
offended," continued the release from Infinity, which owns more than
180 stations nationwide, including KFWB-AM (980), KNX-AM (1070),
KCBS-FM (93.1), KTWV-FM (94.7), KLSX-FM (97.1), KRTH-FM (101.1) and
KROQ-FM (106.7) in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But the company and station hired the duo specifically because
they're outrageous, said KABC-AM (790) morning host Ken Minyard, who
railed about the incident on his program and in an interview added
that he, too, expects little to come of it.</TE>
<TE>   "To lay all the blame on these two guys is missing the point," he
said, contending that the station was aware of the ongoing contest
and knew what they were getting with Opie &amp; Anthony.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the FCC fined the duo $21,000 for three broadcasts
dealing with incest, child abuse and teen sex.</TE>
<TE>   The pair were fired from a Boston station in 1998 after an April
Fool's joke in which they said Mayor Tom Menino had been killed in a
car crash. Fatal accident hoaxes seem to reach the threshold for pink
slips. Last year, a Dallas radio station sacked a pair of DJs who
said Spears was dead and that her then-boyfriend, singer Justin
Timberlake, was comatose after a car crash. Panicked fans inundated
L.A.-area hospitals and emergency agencies with calls.</TE>
<TE>   Animal activists were aghast, but a DJ in Florida was acquitted of
cruelty charges in March after a pig was castrated on his show.</TE>
<TE>   And Chicago DJ Erich "Mancow" Muller has racked up $42,000 in
fines from the FCC since April 2001 after complaints about lewd songs
on his program, graphic talks with an adult-film actress and other
women, along with other incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Minyard noted that, after Opie &amp; Anthony got fired in Boston, they
went to a bigger market in New York--"they got a promotion." And,
until Thursday, the show had been broadcast in 17 other cities too,
including Cleveland, Dallas, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Washington,
D.C., and Boston, on a different station.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless there are consequences, this is going to keep happening.
What are the limits? Until the public gets sufficiently outraged, it
will keep happening," said Minyard, who has been at KABC for all but
three of the past 33 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I have had a chance to see the changes in broadcast over the
years," he said. "There's never been a time when, if you wanted to go
that next step, you couldn't have found an audience. It's part of the
coarsening of our culture."</TE>
<TE>   In February, Copps--the most outspoken member of the commission
regarding indecency and obscenity issues--challenged broadcasters to
clean up their act and self-regulate, before the FCC or Congress has
to step in. At the time, he accused them of trolling "the depths of
decadence" and engaging in a "race to the bottom." Nothing happened.
The National Assn. of Broadcasters said members already abided by its
"statement of principles," which urges broadcasters to avoid
exploiting violence, glamorizing drug use or airing "prurient or
morbid" sexual material.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Race to the bottom' is, unfortunately, a good way to put it,"
Sterling said. "I think that race will continue until and unless
there is some kind of enforcement action, which seems very unlikely."</TE>
<TE>   Copps has criticized his own agency for having "a dismal record of
going after offenders" and forcing listeners to collect the evidence
needed to bring a complaint against a broadcaster. And Sterling said
broadcasters will continue what they're doing unless faced with
drastic consequences. He noted that Infinity only settled the record
$1.7 million in fines levied against Howard Stern in 1995 when the
FCC held up action on station ownership changes.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the programs make vastly more money than the puny fines.
And few listeners even hear about the fines, let alone care,"
Sterling said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that the larger owners, including Infinity, see such
fines as merely a cost of doing business. As long as the threat is
minor, and not to the license itself, this will continue."</TE>

<HD>Humorless 'Crop Circles: Quest for Truth' Finds Only
Believers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You saw them in "Signs," you read about them in Scientific American,
now those mysterious geometric patterns that irritate the heck out of
farmers have a film all their own. It's called "Crop Circles: Quest
For Truth," and you can tell by the title that it means business.</LD>
<LD>   With its portentous David Hamilton score and numerous interviews
with true believers ("a rare glimpse into the inner sanctum of crop
circle experts and aficionados," the press notes grandly call it),
the film seems on its face best suited for the Discovery Channel or
as an agricultural episode of "X-Files."</LD>
<LD>   But "Crop Circles" producer-director William Gazecki was
Oscar-nominated for his meticulous multi-hour documentary "Waco: The
Rules of Engagement," and that has given his new film an air of
seriousness that only a theatrical screen is big enough to handle.</LD>
<TE>   In truth, these crop circles do look lovely and amazing from the
air. Hundreds have popped up all over the world in a boggling variety
of elaborately worked patterns. A straightforward examination of what
they might be and where they might come from would certainly be of
interest, but that's not what we've got here.</TE>
<TE>   Rather "Crop Circles" turns out to be a film that's interesting in
spite of itself. It's less an impartial investigation than an
advocacy film, having been hijacked by the members of the "inner
sanctum" mentioned above. These folks are major talkers who believe
body and soul that the circles were created by extraterrestrial
intelligences, perhaps trying to communicate with a noticeably dense
human race.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, some of these crop patterns are so amazing that alien
assistance seems a distinct possibility, but filmmaker Gazecki's
notions of ferreting out the truth don't seem to include letting each
side of an issue have its say.</TE>
<TE>   So although there are several dismissive references to those who
think the circles are the result of malicious hoaxers, no one speaks
to that point on camera. There is no lack of screen time for zealots
who are furious that anyone could so much as harbor a doubt about the
outer space connection, but there is not a single spokesman,
articulate or otherwise, for a more skeptical point of view. It's a
puzzling omission, a frustrating one as well.</TE>
<TE>   What we get instead are a lot of vintage videos, some nearly two
decades old, that capture the crop circles shortly after they appear.
There's a lot of pointing and measuring to be seen, numerous
intricate diagrams being drawn, and frequent noticing of the complete
lack of any footprints or other signs of human activity.</TE>
<TE>   Those who work in the crop circle field also talk a lot about how
thrilling it can be to have these formations in your life. "Totally
amazing" is a typical comment, with one person exclaiming, "The sheer
wonder and excitement are almost too much to bear."</TE>
<TE>   Regrettably, except for the visual power of the circles, very
little of that excitement makes its way into this rather dour, deadly
earnest work, which doesn't have a fraction of the sense of humor
that characterizes "Signs."</TE>
<TE>   Putting things in the sanest perspective is not anyone associated
with the film's august "inner sanctum" but a farmer affected by the
phenomenon. "It's nice," he says, "to have one or two mysteries left
in life."</TE>
<TE>   No MPAA rating. Times guidelines: not for the skeptical.</TE>

<HD>The Clerk as Creep</HD>
<DH>'One Hour Photo' is an underdeveloped snapshot of a worker,
today's invisible man.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A horror story about a soft-spoken psychotic looking for love in all
the wrong places, Robin Williams' new film, "One Hour Photo," is
certainly more downbeat than many of the actor's earlier works, even
if it's nowhere as dark (or as scary) as the terrifying "Mrs.
Doubtfire" or the genuinely fear-inspiring troika of "Patch Adams,"
"Jakob the Liar" and "Bicentennial Man."</LD>
<LD>   The unfortunate truth is that, however talented, Williams has been
giving many of us the creeps for years, long before he started
hitting his stride by playing affable killers in films such as
"Insomnia." This hasn't always been his fault: He's worked with some
rotten directors, most of whom have seemed intent on suppressing
Williams' intelligence as a performer and a thinker (much in evidence
in his recent HBO concert special), leaving him to wallow in abject
sentimentalism.</LD>
<TE>   Films such as "Bicentennial Man" showed him at his bathetic worst
but suggested that after a series of high and low comedies the actor
was seeking to widen his emotional register. The problem with
professional jokers, though, is that they can't go for long without
the audience's love. So while one part of Williams was trying to do
the serious acting thing, the other part relentlessly, often
exhaustively rallied for our devotion with fidgety bits of business
and ingratiating smiles that bordered on the desperate, anxious
reminders of the clown beneath the tears.</TE>
<TE>   In "One Hour Photo," Williams barely sheds a tear as Sy, a
photo-machine technician in a suburban store called SavMart, where he
wields an eager-to-please mien that's as lethal as a knife. One of
those one-stop emporiums in which neither the lights nor the smiles
are ever turned off, SavMart is Sy's home away from home, namely
because it's where he's the happiest. Under the store's fluorescent
glare, he tenderly processes his customers' photographs, and
daydreams about their lives, taking in their vacations and
anniversaries, joys and embar-rassments with the hunger of a man
starved for a human connection that doesn't involve the words "Thank
you, please come again." Mostly, though, Sy loses himself in the
Yorkins, an upscale young family of three with an apparently
unlimited appetite for self-documentation.</TE>
<TE>   As it happens, Nina and Will (Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan)
are so busy maintaining their designer lifestyle that they don't give
much thought to the weirdly insinuating clerk. Neither do they find
it troubling that he seems overly familiar with the intimate details
of their lives, including the date of son Jake's ninth birthday, that
he always orders one more set of photos than Nina asks for, and,
perhaps as disturbing, dresses exclusively in shades of putty. Which
is why it takes the Yorkins awhile to realize that Sy the friendly
photo guy isn't just an average monochromatic creep, he's their very
own personal stalker.</TE>
<TE>   It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the
abyss, and that's more or less how it plays out. Yet, as written and
directed by Mark Romanek, a music video director here making his
second feature, "One Hour Photo" initially comes across as having
more ambitions than the usual "Psycho" retread.</TE>
<TE>   By zeroing in on a service industry worker and juxtaposing Sy's
reality with that of some of his picture-perfect customers, Romanek
offers up a few ideas about how we live and work, and he does so, for
the most part, without condescending to his characters. In vivid
contrast to the Yorkins, Sy spends his free time in a grim cell of an
apartment in which the only color is supplied by his stash of
purloined photos. But if the technician doesn't have enough, his
idealized family seems to have too much for its own good. In one of
the script's sharpest exchanges, Will berates Nina for her profligate
ways, fuming that if she wants to live in a house that looks like a
magazine layout, she needs to understand his long work hours. She, in
turn, accuses him of emotional negligence, an accusation that has the
sting of the modern age but which Romanek fails to amplify in any
meaningful manner.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think this is a job for a clerk," Sy says of his job,
but "there's more to it." The pathos of his self-deception (there
isn't more to it) imbues "One Hour Photo" with a sense of pained
humanity you don't often find in even more ambitious art-house
thrillers. It doesn't last long.</TE>
<TE>   All too predictably, as if obeying some rule of genre, the
director trades in his more involved ideas about alienation and
voyeurism for an eruption of violence, then tags on some nonsense
about marital fidelity that indicates that while his influences
include Stanley Kubrick and Michael Powell, he's also taking notes
from Adrian Lyne.</TE>
<TE>   If only Romanek was as committed to his characters, to getting at
their fears and desires, as he is to lighting a scene and tending to
the impeccable production design. The director elicits fine
performances from his cast, but more impressive still is the
geometric precision with which items are lined up on the shelves when
Sy fantasizes that he's alone in the SavMart. By then, Sy is a goner,
although Williams keeps us tethered to the character longer than we
might expect.</TE>
<TE>   Doing his best to smother his inner Mork, the actor flattens his
features into a mask, taming their wild animation. It's a relief and
it's also smart, because by quieting his face and relieving us of its
distractions, the actor gives us the space to figure out Sy for
ourselves, to discover if he's a genuine bad guy or simply another
stray. Achingly lonely and deeply strange (those Velcro-secured
sneakers set off screeching alarms), Sy is one of those people you
don't always see when you collect your change and drive through the
tollgate. Although he loses sight of him eventually, Romanek invites
us to see this invisible man and consider the costs of a world in
which video monitors track our every move and signs exhort workers to
"Check Your Smile." Sy is watching the Yorkins, but he's being
watched too, smiling his way into oblivion.</TE>

<LD>An actor-musician with a "severe allergy to poverty," Rik Reppe left
behind his starving artist roots, took a PhD in economics and started
his own successful management consulting firm. Happily occupied with
the pursuit of prosperity, Reppe found his life rudely interrupted by
the events of Sept. 11, a day that left him grasping for answers,
reassurance and a renewed sense of connection with his fellow
countrymen and women.</LD>
<LD>   Taking a leave of absence, Reppe went on a cross-country odyssey
that culminated in visits to the Pentagon, ground zero and that
lonely stretch of Pennsylvania where Flight 93 took its fatal plunge.
En route, Reppe interviewed Americans--all struggling, like himself,
to come to terms with that senseless, shocking day.</LD>
<LD>   Reppe's solo show "Staggering Toward America," now at the Globe
Playhouse in West Hollywood, is a frequently witty and highly
personal assessment of the post-Sept. 11 American landscape, with a
particular emphasis on what, exactly, it means to be an American.
Reppe's encounters en route to the disaster sites are heartening,
humorous and occasionally moving.</LD>
<TE>   Under the direction of Jack Rowe, Reppe comes across as a wry,
engaging performer with a residual twang and a sardonic folksiness
that serve him well. Sometimes, though, Reppe slips into blatant
sentimentality, as in his heartfelt but saccharine story of a girl
who offers her favorite teddy bear for the Sept. 11 victims.</TE>
<TE>   Reppe's belabored suggestion that we should all "find our teddy
bears and give them away," metaphorically speaking, is too precious
to wield any true emotional clout.</TE>
<TE>   More affecting and far more apt is Reppe's rousing description of
an impromptu karaoke Christmas concert at an Indiana truck stop. That
hilarious and heartwarming incident, in which singers of all colors
and religions came together in joyful celebration, makes a serious
point about egalitarianism and inclusiveness--virtues that are alive,
well, and flourishing in these United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Staggering Toward America," the Globe Playhouse, 1107 N. Kings
Road, West Hollywood. Thursdays-Sundays, 8 p.m. Ends Sept. 15. $25.
(310) 941-2063. Running time: 2 hours.</TE>

<LD>An artist envisions a memorial sculpture in the form of two figures
aligned like the former World Trade Center towers, a tribute to the
victims and the survivors.</LD>
<LD>   He lends his pick and hammer to the mother of a man who was
working on the 104th floor of the second tower destroyed on Sept. 11,
inviting her to chip away. It feels good to do something, she says
after a few strokes.</LD>
<LD>   In Middletown, N.J., a commuter town 20 miles from ground zero,
everyone heals in his own way. In one of the first--but far from the
last--anniversary shows marking the terrorist attacks, a "48 Hours"
episode called "Middletown, USA" chronicles the longest year in the
life of an American town. Middletown lost 32 residents in the
attacks, more than it did in World War II and Vietnam combined.</LD>
<TE>   In detailing the resiliency of widows, children, friends and
neighbors in this seaside community, the show strikes a hopeful tone
without getting overly hokey.</TE>
<TE>   One group of Middletown residents gathered toys, food and gift
certificates for the families of victims, as well as volunteers to
help with chores.</TE>
<TE>   A group of widows has been lobbying Congress for an independent
investigation of the attacks. When the measure finally passed the
House, one widow remarked, "Small victories help fill the void."</TE>
<TE>   At the local high school, where 11 students lost family members, a
freckle-faced girl is joining the Marine Corps to defend her country.
"I'm not afraid, I'm just eager," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Therapists are helping littler kids understand what happened.</TE>
<TE>   An illustrator is drawing portraits of individual victims, free
for anyone who sends in a photo. At a pace of one a day, she has
finished 180, with 270 on the waiting list and her phone still
ringing with requests.</TE>
<TE>   The story of Susan Buhse, a widow at 32, may best exemplify the
painful but necessary healing process.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just living our life, doing what you're supposed to do,"
she recalls with disbelief. "We didn't think about what someone else
was doing somewhere else and how that would affect us."</TE>
<TE>   If her two children ask, she sets a place at the table or fastens
an extra seat belt for their dad.</TE>
<TE>   When ground zero was cleared eight months after Sept. 11, she held
a party in her husband's honor, a celebration of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Buhse still feels cheated and angry, but she knows that she and
her kids must make a new life.</TE>
<TE>   "In time I'm going to need something new to do," she says. "I
can't be a 9/11 widow forever."</TE>
<TE>   Although the next couple of weeks will be difficult, Buhse feels
stronger than ever. "Sept. 12 will be a great day, a day of victory,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   "48 Hours" airs at 8 tonight on CBS.</TE>

<HD>Two Great Groups and a Place to Play</HD>
<DH>The Clayton-Hamilton and Carnegie Hall bands, which no
longer have regular venues, joined in a spirited Bowl evening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irony was in the air Wednesday night at the Hollywood Bowl with "Big
Band Blast," a program featuring two ensembles--the Clayton-Hamilton
Jazz Orchestra and the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band--that have lost
significant performance platforms.</LD>
<LD>   The Clayton-Hamilton aggregation, once the resident jazz ensemble
at the Hollywood Bowl, ended its three-year franchise at the close of
the 2001 season and was making its only Bowl appearance of 2002. The
highly praised Carnegie Hall band, led by trumpeter Jon Faddis, was
finishing its final season after having been dropped from the
Carnegie roster earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   Yet despite the oddly similar circumstances surrounding their
joint appearances, both groups played with spirit and enthusiasm. If
they were concerned about their future playing opportunities--or, in
fact, about their very continued existence as musical units--it
didn't show.</LD>
<TE>   The Clayton-Hamilton orchestra, opening the evening, displayed the
stylistic versatility that has always been one of its most valuable
assets. Among the high points of the set: the saxophone section
romping through Sonny Stitt's "Eternal Triangle," brimming with
intensity in the ensemble passages, ripping off one solo after
another by each of the section's five members; co-leader and music
director John Clayton's touching bass solo on "Nature Boy"; and--best
of all--a spunky, hard-driving Clayton original, "Shout Me Out,"
featuring an extraordinary trombone battle between Ira Nepus and
Isaac Smith.</TE>
<TE>   The Carnegie Hall band followed with its own extraordinary effort.
It relied far more on repertory material such as "Shiny Stockings,"
"Giant Steps" and "Sing, Sing, Sing" than the Clayton-Hamilton group
did. But in each case, what the Carnegie Hall band did with the
familiar numbers was creatively transformative. Arrangements by
gifted writers such as Slide Hampton, Frank Foster and Mike Abene
grabbed the familiar themes and positioned them as brand new works.</TE>
<TE>   The soloing by the Carnegie band's impressive cadre of all-star
musicians--especially Faddis, saxophonists Dick Oatts and Frank Wess,
trombonist and conch shell player Steve Turre, and pianist Renee
Rosnes--was expansive enough to add vital improvisational contrast,
and the rhythm section cooked with the simmering intensity so
characteristic of East Coast players. (It was very difficult to
understand, by the way, how the Bowl program could manage to list
hundreds of donors to the Philharmonic Assn. while failing to provide
the names of the individual players in either of the jazz bands.)</TE>
<TE>   Wrapping up the evening with a joint performance of three numbers,
climaxing with all the players from both ensembles lined up across
the front of the Bowl stage, "Big Band Blast" finished with a blend
of excitement and poignancy--excitement over the marvelous musical
stimulation provided by these superb groups; poignancy over the
question of when we will see and hear them again.</TE>

<HD>Forget Sept. 11? Just Try</HD>

<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>That old line about media setting the public agenda--telling us not
what to think, but what to think about--is pretty much on the money.</LD>
<LD>   On the one hand, piling it on somehow fit the subject of this
month's crush of Elvis gushers noting the 25th anniversary of his
death. His personal life was defined by excess, from overuse of
prescription drugs to his garish Graceland house in Memphis.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, television's Sept. 11 bandwagon is already
buckling under the tonnage of its good intentions, as the one-year
anniversary of that national calamity approaches.</LD>
<TE>   Broadcasters are hardly alone in turning up the wattage. This
newspaper and others, along with magazines, are cooking up their own
shebangs, keyed in part to elaborate ceremonies New York is planning.
President Bush is expected to address the nation that night as well.</TE>
<TE>   No one in the U.S. media wants to be left out, motivated in part
by competitive pressure and concern that doing too little to
commemorate Sept. 11 (however that is measured) would be construed as
dishonoring the nearly 3,000 who died in those attacks. Being called
disloyal is not on anyone's agenda, especially when Americans are
urged now to present a united front against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Yet how much is too much when noting a dark event that's already
been circled indelibly on the calendar? Try this.</TE>
<TE>   Too much is several dozen one-year memorials airing on TV almost
shoulder to shoulder, not counting the few already dribbling in, such
as tonight's "48 Hours" on CBS, about Middletown, N.J., pulling
together after losing 32 residents on Sept. 11 (see review, Page F2).</TE>
<TE>   Too much is at least a third of these being compressed into
Anniversary Day, on outlets as diverse as Court TV and Turner Classic
Movies. And programming ranging from UPN's 60-second hero tributes to
CBS' 13 hours of live coverage capped by an interview with Bush on
"60 Minutes II."</TE>
<TE>   Too much is when the combined weight of these densely packed
retrospectives and other specials threatens to flatten the intended
message through sheer, numbing repetition, and reduce Sept. 11 to
something as generic as an area code or phone call for help. Mention
it enough times in close proximity and the intensity diminishes.</TE>
<TE>   It's possible that TV's thickening clot of Sept. 11 shrines will
be seen globally as the U.S. stiffening its back and flipping off
terrorists in an act of good old-fashioned American resolve. There
are better, more lethal ways of doing that, however.</TE>
<TE>   As we know, Sept. 11 is no one-night stand, another case of the
media hopping into the sack for quickies on Cinco de Mayo or National
Boss Day. Nor is it a musty relic packed away in mothballs for nearly
a year, the equivalent of Black History Month or Holocaust Month, for
which TV routinely dusts off obligatory testimonials that are later
returned to the attic after getting 30 days of light.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Sept. 11 has bled yearlong, its memory becoming America's
throbbing ache. Our heads are swimming in it, our brains are tattooed
by it. Not that you'd know that from the title of NBC's two-day Sept.
11 bloc: "America Remembers." Get real. America never stopped
remembering.</TE>
<TE>   There are no amnesiacs present, no memory buttons that need
pushing. Not a day has gone by that TV, radio and newspapers have not
referred to ground zero again and again in some way: Here is Bush
commenting on fighting terrorism and bringing down Saddam Hussein.
Here are talking heads on the meaning of Islam. Here are Rudy
Giuliani updates. Here are security induced travel snafus. Here are
victims' families filing a trillion-dollar lawsuit against those they
hold responsible for Sept. 11. Here are TV's familiar bags of bull
handicapping the fate of Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   And this week, also, here are CBS, and especially showboating CNN
("Terror on Tape!") airing pre-Sept. 11 video of Bin Laden and his
henchmen declaring holy war on the U.S., and his Al Qaeda network
training for violence and appearing to conduct poison gas experiments
on dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Then on Wednesday, as if on cue, boom! Cable's joined-at-the-hip
news channels fixed their live cameras on a Miami International
Airport concourse being evacuated because of mysterious fumes that
were causing breathing problems.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda-released fumes? Before TV's breathless commandos could
strap on their gas masks, authorities had blamed a leaky pepper spray
can in what they called a non-criminal matter.</TE>
<TE>   Given the attention it drew, it was surely a Sept. 11-memory
matter.</TE>
<TE>   That's because all of this is ongoing, all of it tied to terrorist
attacks on New York and Washington that Americans have hardly
forgotten.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's no headline when entertainment becomes an escape,
there may be something symbolic about last week's hefty Nielsen
ratings for the banal likes of "American Idol," "Dog Eat Dog," "Meet
My Folks" and "Big Brother." Their popularity may affirm that
millions prefer even the fiction of TV's most witless "reality" shows
to dwelling on the cratered post-twin towers realism the media expose
them to daily.</TE>
<TE>   No dishonor of Sept. 11 intended.</TE>

<HD>Domestic Drama Unfolds Against Backdrop of 9/11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F. KATHLEEN FOLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One suspects that "September 10," Art Shulman's world premiere drama
at the Lonny Chapman Group Repertory Theatre in North Hollywood, is
an early entry in what will be a teeming field of 9/11 plays.</LD>
<LD>   Shulman's workable but occasionally cloying premise unites two
stories--the small, personal tale of one couple's domestic
disintegration, and a dramatic re-creation of the massive,
world-altering events of Sept. 11, with a particular emphasis on the
Twin Towers' collapse and aftermath.</LD>
<LD>   The cloying bits crop up in the domestic saga. On Sept. 10, Jodi
Baker (a game Jules Roenitz) admits to husband Dan (a stiff and
unconvincing Chris Winfield, miscast here) that she has had an
extramarital fling. The global upheaval of Sept. 11, which quickly
follows, only partially distracts the couple from their continuing
marital crisis. After much bickering and recrimination, Dan pays a
visit to ground zero--a pilgrimage that finally allows him to expiate
his own resentment and fully forgive his repentant wife.</LD>
<TE>   Although overly simplistic and at times crudely expository, that
story serves as foreground for the essential business of the
evening--a swirling, nonlinear treatment of Sept. 11. While Dan and
Jodi are hashing out their own problems, actors eddy on-and offstage,
dramatically re-creating familiar episodes from ground zero. A
fireman searches for his missing brother in the rubble. A teacher at
a school near the site describes the effect of the tragedy on her
terrified students. The bereaved hold out posters of the missing,
pleading for any information as hope fades.</TE>
<TE>   The performers in the 9/11 scenes are a tightknit group, adept at
monologues and ensemble scenes. Too often, however, Jack Kandel's
speciously stylistic staging hampers our emotional connection with
the material. Kandel has the actors wear half masks throughout the
action, a particularly onerous choice that sadly depersonalizes the
characters and victims--perhaps the last thing that Kandel and his
cast intended.</TE>
<TE>   "September 10," Lonny Chapman's Group Repertory Theatre, 10900
Burbank Blvd., North Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3
p.m. Ends Sept. 14. $16. (818) 769-7529. Running time: 2 hours.</TE>

<HD>Romanek's Avante-Garde Visual Sense Aided in Developing
'Photo'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before making the new psychological thriller "One Hour Photo,"
writer-director Mark Romanek was best known for his stylized,
avant-garde rock videos for such stars as Michael Jackson, Janet
Jackson ("Scream"), Macy Gray ("I Try") Madonna ("Bedtime Story") and
Lenny Kravitz ("Are You Gonna Go My Way?"). But perhaps his most
famous video was for Nine Inch Nails' "Closer," which features a
monkey grimacing in what appears to be pain while hanging from a
crucifix.</LD>
<LD>   Romanek brings the same daring visual sense and disturbing style
of that video to "One Hour Photo," which stars a hauntingly creepy
Robin Williams as a lonely photo developer named Sy who works at an
antiseptic discount megastore. For a decade, he has developed the
snapshots of what he believes is a picture-perfect family, the
Yorkins (Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan and Dylan Smith), and becomes
obsessed with them.</LD>
<LD>   Though the film is dressed up to be a thriller, "at its heart it's
a character study," says Romanek, 42, who manages to be
simultaneously quiet and intense. "I was thinking of it as almost a
very sad love story. Sy is desperately in love with this family. Not
even one element in the family--he is just in love with this idea. It
was just crushing to him that they don't live the same lives as the
snapshots. I found that sort of sad and pathetic."</LD>
<TE>   On this hot afternoon, Romanek is sitting in a cabana poolside at
a retro-trendy Beverly Hills hotel. With his untrimmed beard and
low-key demeanor, Romanek doesn't look like a typical film director.
And despite the fact that it is hotter than blue blazes outside,
Romanek is bundled up in a jacket.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to "One Hour Photo," Romanek had written a few screenplays,
including a biopic about photographer Diane Arbus, the great
chronicler of the absurd and the grotesque. "I also had worked with
writers on some other pieces," he says. "The protagonists of those
projects had a lot in common with Sy. It seems that there was a
common thread as I look back. They were all about outsiders who
aren't comfortable being outsiders. They are struggling with being on
the fringes."</TE>
<TE>   Romanek came up with the idea for "One Hour Photo" a few years
ago. "There was a guy who worked in the Rexall where I lived in West
Hollywood," he explains. The man, he recalls, was overly effusive
with his customers. "He was trying too hard. The way he was dressed,
he was out of touch. He was a perfectly nice guy, but there was
something compelling and sad about him."</TE>
<TE>   With that character in mind, Romanek needed only three weeks to
write the screenplay. Upon completion, he gave it to producers Pamela
Koffler and Christine Vachon of "Boys Don't Cry" renown.</TE>
<TE>   Koffler admired the script for its "clear cinematic vision." She
also found it refreshing that Romanek knows "what he wants, but he's
extremely open to a collaborative way to get there and always open to
an idea that might make it better."</TE>
<TE>   Besides being a "fantastic" character piece, says Koffler, the
film works as a thriller. "It really felt very contemporary in that
it wasn't obvious what he was doing with the genre," she says. "The
premise was fascinating. In the script I was really struck by how
sensitively the characters were drawn--certainly Sy. Your heart
breaks for him so many times during the film. As much as you might be
repelled by what Sy does, I never stopped feeling his loneliness."</TE>
<TE>   Early in the casting process, William's manager got hold of the
script, recalls Romanek. "He said, 'I want to show this to Robin. He
is looking for new challenges. I think he might respond to it.' "</TE>
<TE>   He did. A week later, Romanek was having lunch with the Oscar
winner, and 45 minutes into the meeting, Williams agreed to play the
part. "We were both from Chicago," says Romanek. "I think we both
have a very kind of unjaded, no-nonsense outlook about things."</TE>
<TE>   Williams is almost unrecognizable in the film, with his blond,
balding pate, glasses and nondescript polyester wardrobe. "I told him
initially he needed to change his look physically, so the audience
would have the opportunity to forget they were watching a big movie
star," Romanek says.</TE>
<TE>   "There is paradox for any actor playing this part," says Romanek.
"He has to be compelling and moving enough to carry the whole movie
and charismatic enough to hold your interest. Yet the character is
essentially meant to be this hyper-banal, forgettable man who almost
blends into the woodwork. That is a paradox for any actor, and it's
even harder for a movie star."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Romanek was afraid to tell Williams how he envisioned
the character. "I didn't want to step on his toes. But he said, 'No
tell me what you see.' I said, 'I think he's pale. He's never in the
sun. I would like him to be very pale so he disappears. His hair
should be blond, balding.' "</TE>
<TE>   In terms of how to play the scenes, says Romanek, from the very
first rehearsal Williams read the lines the way he had imagined them
in his head.</TE>
<TE>   "He understood there was no room for sentimentally," says Romanek.
"He started to find the bittersweetness in his character. He knew
there was no place for his particular improv and humor."</TE>
<TE>   Nielsen (who played Lucilla in "Gladiator") says Romanek knew
exactly what he wanted on the set. "He would be very specific," she
says. "It is really kind of great to work when you are with someone
who knows what they want."</TE>
<TE>   Romanek surrounded himself with the same cinematographer (Jeff
Cronenweth), production designer (Tom Foden) and costume designer
(Arianne Phillips) he has worked with on his music videos. The only
major new player to the mix was editor Jeff Ford. "I wanted to change
the rhythms from the video rhythms, which can be very
hyper-accelerated. I wanted someone who was going to help me focus on
the integrity of the characters."</TE>

<HD>A Country in Turmoil, Two Hearts in Tumult</HD>
<DH>In the luminous 'Lan Yu,' Stanley Kwan tells a story of
unexpected passion amid the wrenching political and economic changes
in 1980s China.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One evening in 1988, in a tasteful upscale bar in Beijing, a man
playing pool takes notice of the arrival of a handsome younger man.
The latter is an impoverished architectural student who is about to
prostitute himself with the bar's owner. But the pool player, a
decisive, aggressive businessman, claims the student for himself.</LD>
<LD>   It is the unexpected beginning of a tempestuous love affair, set
against a time of rapid change and unrest in China, in the terse yet
romantic "Lan Yu." Assured, vital and well wrought, the film is,
arguably, the most accomplished work to date from Hong Kong's
versatile Stanley Kwan.</LD>
<LD>   "When two people get to know each other too well, it's time to
separate," warns Hu Jun's virile businessman, Chen Handong, after a
passionate night of love with Liu Ye's Lan Yu.</LD>
<TE>   Lan Yu has never hustled before and has done so out of
desperation; indeed, he may never before have been sexually involved
with a man. Since the attraction between them is intensely mutual,
the two meet many times.</TE>
<TE>   It's clear that Lan Yu, essentially an idealistic country boy, has
fallen in love right at the start, but true to his words, Handong
remains determined in his detachment and instead showers Lan Yu with
gifts and financial aid beyond what he needs or wants.</TE>
<TE>   Neither may realize it, but they're now on an emotional seesaw.</TE>
<TE>   Handong is driven to risk losing Lan Yu forever before he is able
to acknowledge that he loves him in return, and his life threatens to
turn upside-down before he can even think of committing himself to a
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Tiananmen conflict occurs and the market
crashes, wrecking Handong's heretofore rapidly expanding trading
company and exposing him to the dangers of resorting to shady tactics
to stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, "Lan Yu" is an implicit criticism of the
ruthless, greedy materialism fostered by a freer market economy; on
the other, it is a reminder of the transitory nature of life and all
the quirks of fate that go along with it.</TE>
<TE>   Expertly adapted by Jimmy Ngai from an anonymous Internet novel,
"Lan Yu" has remarkable scope and passion for a film that runs a
brisk 86 minutes. Yet it is a quite sufficient length of time to
explore a rocky romance in depth and to evoke various currents
coursing through a Chinese society that is simultaneously undergoing
the stresses of brutal political repression and dizzying economic
expansion. It's not the most conducive time for a gay man to come
out, especially when passing for straight is automatic for a man as
thoroughly masculine as Handong.</TE>
<TE>   Widely regarded in China as the leading stage actor of his
generation, Hu is best remembered on the screen as the policeman in
Zhang Yuan's provocative "East Palace, West Palace," while "Lan Yu"
marks Liu's first leading role in a film.</TE>
<TE>   Both give notably powerful, far-ranging portrayals, backed by a
supporting cast as sharp and succinct as they are.</TE>
<TE>   Yang Tao's graceful, gleaming camera work and Zhang Yadong's spare
yet dramatic score underline Kwan's characteristically easy, flowing
style and sensitivity to shifting moods and emotions.</TE>
<TE>   Kwan has said that he was attracted to the novel upon which "Lan
Yu" is based in part because it offered the chance to see if he could
make complicated elements less so and its simple aspects even
simpler. A consummate storyteller, he has succeeded with a film of
exceptional accessibility and clarity.</TE>

<HD>Babasonicos Glams It Up in L.A. Debut</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ernesto Lechner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Babasonicos lead singer Adrian Rodriguez strutted on stage at
Hollywood's Sixteen-Fifty club in a glittery, fringe-heavy outfit
Wednesday, it was hard not to think of Freddy Mercury and Queen.</LD>
<LD>   In its Los Angeles debut, the Argentine band showed that the
rambunctious, androgynous spirit of glam rock is at the core of its
eccentric sensibility. The show also helped explain the sextet's
rising critical status in rock en espanol.</LD>
<LD>   Glam rock and its liberal use of quirky synth sounds are not the
only elements in the group's eclectic compositions. In "Jessico," the
band's most recent effort, you'll also hear touches of lounge exotica
and strains of spaghetti western soundtracks.</LD>
<TE>   In concert, Rodriguez is the group's soul, stretching his skinny
arms in regal, Roman-emperor fashion, exploiting his feminine side
for shock value and singing with a whiny accent that adds credibility
to his surreal stories of capricious gods ("El Loco") and hot-blooded
girls ("Los Calientes").</TE>
<TE>   At times, the band's emphasis on loud, straightforward rock
drowned its art-school ambitions in a sea of heard-them-all-before
riffs. When it focuses on creating cohesive pop mini-symphonies,
however, Babasonicos shines brighter than most Latin rock bands out
there.</TE>

<HD>Strong Cast Reveals Aching 'Secrets'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lurking beneath a sentimental surface and a treacly
hearts-and-flowers score, Blair Treu's "Little Secrets" offers some
genuine substance for youthful audiences.</LD>
<LD>   It's just lamentable that some filmmakers still feel that in the
name of wholesomeness, family pictures must take place in
perfect-looking, picture-book worlds, fitted out with cutesy-poo
kiddies providing comical touches.</LD>
<LD>   Luckily, "Little Secrets" has a sure sense of reality at its
core--if often not around its edges--and three talented and
accomplished young actors, all TV series veterans, to head the cast,
which includes an outstanding Vivica A. Fox in a key adult role.</LD>
<TE>   Evan Rachel Wood stars as a beautiful, poised violinist with a
bright future. The young teen lives with her loving parents in an
upscale neighborhood, where the little kids so look up to her that
she sets up a stand a couple of times a week during summer vacation
to hear out their secrets. Invariably, she responds with words of
reassurance.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this summer will be different for a number of crucial reasons.
First, Emily will acquire a baby sister before the season is over and
face an audition with the local symphony orchestra. And then two
brothers, Philip (Michael Angarano), 12, and David (David
Gallagher),15, who has been off to summer camp, move next door.</TE>
<TE>   Philip is a highly intelligent, challenging youngster whose
initially edgy friendship with Emily leads him to tell her a secret
that has unintended reverberations for her. She's also becoming
jealous of her soon-too-arrive sibling, which makes her increasingly
moody and irritable. The neighborhood's renowned secret-keeper has a
secret herself that has begun to gnaw at her.</TE>
<TE>   What Treu and writer Jessica Barondes are doing with considerable
deftness is asking youngsters--and parents too--to think about the
wisdom of keeping the kinds of secrets that do harm to one's self and
others.</TE>
<TE>   As Emily's spirits darken, we come to see her secret-keeper role
in a new light. The children who trust her are innocents, but much of
the advice Emily gives them involves how to cover up minor
transgressions and thereby evade trouble. Emily can hardly be said to
be corrupting kids, but she is encouraging falsehoods and the
avoidance of responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   These small fry are presented as a bunch of eccentric little
mini-kooks, apparently for easy, affectionate laughs. It's artificial
in effect yet fortunately does not fully undermine Treu's more
serious, thought-provoking intentions. Besides conversations with
Philip and, later, David, Emily has some discussions with her parents
that ring true. Most authentic, however, is her relationship with her
violin teacher (Fox), a most impressive role model and mentor.</TE>
<TE>   There are moments when Wood as Emily is a tad actressy, a bit
mannered, but she is a radiant talent who carries the film with quiet
authority. She and Gallagher are most promising, but Angarano has a
wryly quizzical, reflective personality that makes him seem already
special. Its greeting card look and feel aside, "Little Secrets" is
an otherwise worthy family entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for thematic elements. Times guidelines: suitable
for all ages.</TE>

<HD>As Chef Lets Her Hair Down, Who Needs Food as Metaphor?</HD>
<DH>'Martha's' recipe omits the spice while peppering working
women with a heavy dollop of angst.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the most persistent and endearingly silly subcategories of the
woman's picture is the Symbolic Hair Story, those cautionary tales of
uptight ladies with upswept tresses in which a woman's journey
directly corresponds with the downward trajectory of her chignon.</LD>
<LD>   Actress Olivia de Havilland modeled a number of impressively tight
buns in such films as "The Heiress," but even better is the glorious
swirl worn by Kim Novak in "Vertigo," that spiral of platinum into
which James Stewart's character almost literally swoons.</LD>
<LD>   In his new film, "Possession," director Neil LaBute references
Novak's irresistible vortex with a shot of Gwyneth Paltrow's flaxen
hair done up in a knot as tight as a fist, a knot that, of course,
will invariably be undone by love. Once she appears with a chopstick
piercing her suddenly sloppy-chic twist, it's only a matter of time
before both hair and defenses tumble.</LD>
<TE>   Although the new German romantic comedy "Mostly Martha" is being
sold as a food-as-metaphor-for-life story, it is in truth another
chapter in the never-ending hair story, one in which a woman's
happiness isn't just measured by how far she lets down her hair, but
as for Rapunzel, is predicated on its release.</TE>
<TE>   The film's title character (Martina Gedeck) wears her hair piled
high on her head mainly, it seems, because she doesn't have anyone
who can tuck an errant strand behind her ear or blow a few feathery
tendrils off her neck.</TE>
<TE>   Written and directed by Sandra Nettelbeck without a suggestion of
personal style, "Mostly Martha" centers on a chef whose entire being
is subsumed by her profession. No matter if she's in front of a stove
or stretched out on her analyst's couch, Martha is either cooking
food or rhapsodizing about ingredients and technique, from the proper
way to prepare pigeon to the most humane way to kill a lobster (never
boil!).</TE>
<TE>   Her therapist doesn't think this especially odd, and once we crack
the film's code, neither do we.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, it's all in the metaphors. Nearly friendless,
Martha is lonely and isolated and so, as she explains in voice-over,
"in the tank, a lobster eats itself from the inside out."</TE>
<TE>   Martha doesn't like the new sous-chef, Mario (Italian Sergio
Castellitto, clumsily dubbed into German) and grumbles when the
restaurant owner wants to add gnocchi to the menu.</TE>
<TE>   Says Mario of the dumplings, while shooting a knowing look at
Martha (whose hair is starting to billow), "They tend to be tough and
inedible if you don't try your best."</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes until Martha gets not just a kid (her recently
orphaned 8-year-old niece, Lina) and a love interest (guess who), she
gets something like a life--that is, if only the filmmaker knew what
one looked like.</TE>
<TE>   It's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women--or at least this
working woman--for whom she shows little understanding; there's a
puritan, even punitive, cast to the way she sees her character, whose
pathology she digs at with the tenacity of a truffle hound.</TE>
<TE>   First Nettelbeck sets Martha up as an eccentric, then she throws
her a tragedy, amping her punishment (and ours) with a merciless
jazzy score. Instead of being allowed to heal, Martha is continually
taken to task for not being an instant good mother.</TE>
<TE>   Nettelbeck lards the film with scenes of the chef's failure to
nurture her niece, underscoring Martha's frowns even as she's denied
a moment of contemplation, say, reading a book or just relishing the
quiet of her apartment. The woman can't even cook a meal for herself,
much less have a good cry.</TE>
<TE>   When the inevitable turnaround happens, it isn't because Martha
has experienced some sort of epiphany (like hiring a decent
baby-sitter for some peace of mind), it's because Mario has won over
the niece with spaghetti and conquered a rival with a mysterious
concoction.</TE>
<TE>   The Italian thaws the German and transforms her into the mother
and lover she never knew she wanted to be. In other words, Martha
finally lets down her hair. Gag me with a spoon.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for thematic material and mild language. Times
guidelines: some intimidating haute cuisine, but that's about it.</TE>

<LD>   Apparently, Michael Now Leads Jackson 4</LD>
<LD>   The bomb was dropped at a recent Siegfried &amp; Roy concert in Las
Vegas. Ducking backstage, Michael Jackson had three children in hand.</LD>
<TE>   The older two were his 5-year-old son Prince Michael and
4-year-old daughter Paris. And the last? "This is my third child,"
the singer announced, according to the Sept. 2 issue of People
magazine. Producer Gary Pudney, who met the boy in April, says the
child is named Prince Michael II--though Jackson often refers to him
as "No. 3."</TE>
<TE>   Other than that, mystery shrouds the 6-month-old infant, as it
does much of Jackson's life. A close friend told the publication that
the child was not adopted but "conceived the natural way."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there has been no word on the identity of the toddler's
mother. Speculation has focused on Jackson's second wife, Debbie
Rowe, with whom he had his first two children. The ex-dermatologist's
assistant accompanied him on two recent trips to Las Vegas, helping
him ring up a tab of $7,000 at a local magic shop.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Jackson's publicist, Dan Klores, said the firm
does not comment on the singer's personal life.</TE>
<TE>   Mills Accepts Damages</TE>
<TE>   in Charity Libel Suit</TE>
<TE>   Former Beatle Paul McCartney's new wife, Heather Mills, has
accepted $76,000 in damages from a British newspaper that claimed she
was being investigated for charity irregularities, her lawyer said
this week.</TE>
<TE>   The money was offered to settle her libel claim after a May 12
article in the Sunday Mirror alleged that the Charity Commission was
investigating her over money collected on behalf of an Indian
earthquake victim in 2001. The newspaper will also pay Mills' legal
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Mills, a former model who married McCartney in an Irish castle in
June, turned to raising money for the limbless after losing her left
leg below the knee in a motorcycle accident in 1993. More recently,
she and McCartney have campaigned against land mines.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Mills' lawyer said that his client felt vindicated
and planned to donate the damages money to the charity
Adopt-a-Minefield UK.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Mirror spokesman Chris Wade said the newspaper published
the story in good faith. "We accept that aspects of it were not
correct, and we are happy that we've now been able to resolve that
matter."</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   Europeans Heading Out to See More Film Fare</TE>
<TE>   The European film market, boosted by rising living standards and
increased leisure spending, is experiencing a surge in box office.</TE>
<TE>   According to a new report, 1 billion tickets were sold in 2001,
and the upward spiral is expected to continue for the next four
years.</TE>
<TE>   Though "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" and "The Lord of
the Rings" were the most successful films in the international arena
last year, home-grown films also performed well. "Contrary to popular
belief, multiplexes have not caused further Americanization of
European cinema," Dodona Research reports.</TE>
<TE>   According to the BBC, more than 75% of the admissions were
concentrated in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.
Still, the biggest strides were made in the smaller nations. From
1995 to 2001, Portugal's box office skyrocketed by a hefty 255%, the
Czech Republic by 229%, and Poland by 214%.</TE>
<TE>   The average increase among all European nations during that
stretch was 76%.</TE>
<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Underground Museum Coming to Beijing?</TE>
<TE>   Over the last five years, caretakers of Beijing's Forbidden City
drew up secret plans for a three-story museum under the sprawling
palace, to display some of the 1,052,653 imperial artifacts currently
in storage.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to avoid criticism, they lobbied behind closed doors for
approval and a budget, according to the London newspaper the
Independent.</TE>
<TE>   But when Southern Weekend, a Chinese weekly newsmagazine, exposed
the project, the critics weighed in, saying the proposed construction
would weaken the foundation of the city's most famous landmark.</TE>
<TE>   The project's proponents are standing firm. They argue that
building underground has been successful in Paris' Louvre Museum and
in Beijing's own subway system--and that because it eliminates the
need for air conditioning and external decoration, it's very
cost-effective.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Goldwyn Films has acquired North American rights to the
controversial Mexican film "The Crimes of Father Amaro," the tale of
a priest who impregnates a young woman. The movie, which had a
record-setting opening in Mexico last weekend, is expected to be
released here later this year....Danny Huston will star as one of two
detectives investigating crime in Los Angeles in Dick Wolf's new
version of "Dragnet," premiering on ABC in January....USA Network has
renewed "The Dead Zone" for a second season....Gil Cates, producing
director of the Geffen Playhouse, will direct his first play since
1999: David Eldridge's "Under the Blue Sky," opening Sept. 18. A tale
of love and sexuality among academics, it will star Sharon Lawrence
and Willie Garson....A guitar once burned onstage by Jimi Hendrix and
later owned by Frank Zappa is being sold at a London auction house in
September, priced at $535,000.</TE>

<HD>A Breathless 'Blast!' of Pure Exhilaration</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until science comes up with something better, narcoleptics must be
satisfied with "Blast!" to keep them awake. If ever a title qualified
as truth in advertising, the moniker of this Tony Award-winning
investigation of outdoor pageantry does, with deafening impact.</LD>
<LD>   Developed by artistic director James Mason out of Bloomington's
world champion Star of Indiana competitive drum corps, "Blast!,"
which began its limited Los Angeles premiere engagement at UCLA's
Royce Hall on Wednesday, is ostensibly a blood relation of
international sensations "Stomp" and "Riverdance."</LD>
<LD>   Like those similarly unclassifiable constructs, "Blast!" operates
as exercise in pure kinesis, eschewing narrative and meaning in favor
of form and function. Movement, music and design are amalgamated for
the sake of doing so, with visceral response the objective.</LD>
<TE>   However, the parameters of "Riverdance" are determined by the
traditions of Irish clog dancing, the boundaries of "Stomp" by
combining industrial materials and post-Savion Glover street moves.
Internal variations notwithstanding, both shows essentially examine
single disciplines to stupendous extremes. But "Blast!," although
basically a celebration of the drill team's art, is a
multi-directional display of ensemble virtuosity approaching the
superhuman.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout a breathless two hours, all 54 touring company members
prove world-class instrumentalists, dancers, gymnasts, jugglers
and/or clowns, at once.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the opening image of a single drum centering Mark Thompson's
effective grid-patterned setting is deceptively simple. Then a
white-clad figure appears, proceeding to trace the unmistakable
rhythmic underpinnings of Ravel's "Bolero" with brash confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Others join in, simultaneously playing instruments while executing
pinpoint choreography approximating a Super Bowl half-time staged by
the late Bob Fosse. As additional drummers appear in the aisles, the
abridged reading builds to a frenzy, leaving the audience riotous.</TE>
<TE>   By the blazing finale, Ernesto Lecuona's "Malaguena," the program
touches on blues, jazz, techno-pop, rock, tribal music and musical
theater ("Gee, Officer Krupke" from "West Side Story," done here in
an uproarious Rube Goldberg turn). The clockwork precision
encompasses the entire venue from apron to balcony with dazzling
aplomb.</TE>
<TE>   The star is the ensemble, most of whom are college-age, all of
whom are amazing. Adam Rapa's stratospheric blues trumpet stands out,
as does Nicholas E. Angelis and Christopher "Kit" Chatham's snare
drum sorcery in the show-stopping "Battery Battle."</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Mangione's "Land of Make Believe" benefits from soloists
Frank Sullivan (fluegelhorn), Amy M. Sanchez (French horn) and
Matthew A. Banks (tuba). Deborah Barrigan and Jeremiah T. Huber are
notable featured dancers.</TE>
<TE>   This heroic crew's maneuvers are expertly overseen by directors
George Pinney and Jonathan Vanderkolff, sharing choreographic credit
with Jim Moore. Musical director James Prime's arrangements
seamlessly take in everything from euphonium to didgeridoo.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson's bipolar set acts as an easel for his primary-accented
monochromatic costumes, and Hugh Vanstone's lighting is a
breathtaking show in itself, from backlights to black lights.</TE>
<TE>   This is specialized stuff, including the liabilities. Tom Morse's
ultra-hyped amplification borders on oppressive, even in the
gracefully choral-laden "Simple Gifts" theme from Copland's
"Appalachian Spring."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is "Blast!" really substantial beneath the glittering facade,
with a sense of repetition developing early in Act 2.</TE>
<TE>   For all the thrills, it is also exhausting, like an especially
ornate roller-coaster ride, as apt a simile for this rafter-raiser as
any.</TE>
<TE>   "Blast!," Royce Hall, UCLA, 405 Hilgard Ave., L.A.
Tuesdays-Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 and
7:30 p.m. Ends Sept. 1. $42-$67. (310) 825-2101, (213) 365-3500,

<LD>What is left out of a work of art can often command as much attention
as what is put in. This is certainly the case in Deborah Lefkowitz's
work, which hinges on silence, absence and loss.</LD>
<LD>   Lefkowitz, based in Riverside, has worked in documentary film,
dance and installation, often directly engaging aspects of Holocaust
history and legacy, but also diffusing the specificity of her imagery
to negotiate space in a more abstract way, concentrating on how light
reveals and shadow conceals. Her new installation at Chaffey
College's Wignall Museum/ Gallery is extremely spare yet marvelously
rich.</LD>
<LD>   It has no sound, no recognizable imagery, barely any form to speak
of. Yet with the barest of means--fabric, light and
darkness--Lefkowitz has staged a compelling experience, a sort of
private, self-enacted theater.</LD>
<TE>   In the large, squarish gallery space, she has hung 20 or so
floor-to-ceiling panels of translucent netting and opaque white
fabric. The panels hang singly and in angled pairs, spaced throughout
the room like columns to be wandered among. Light sources in several
different parts of the gallery shift on and off in a subtle cycle,
intensifying and dimming, alternately spotlighting particular areas,
falling in crisp streaks or softly flooding the whole. The fabric
panels nearly disappear in the darkness, then gleam when light
catches in their weave.</TE>
<TE>   The effect is elegant, entrancing. Within a monochrome palette of
warm whites and charcoal grays, Lefkowitz has created a perceptual
massage, a vivid stillness within which the senses are fully engaged.
Where they wander remains personal; Lefkowitz's installation leaves
ample room for meditation of both intimate and historical scope.</TE>
<TE>   The least visible but most potent element Lefkowitz uses to
structure the space and our experience of it is time. Time doesn't
just elapse here in an automatic, unconscious way. Lefkowitz uses
light to frame its passage.</TE>
<TE>   The light raking through the panels can speak one moment of dawn
and promise, the next of nostalgia and sorrow. It illuminates the
vacancy of the space and our transient movements within it.</TE>
<TE>   Pointing to that quiet, charged intersection of light and time,
Lefkowitz calls her installation "In the Shadow of the Hourglass."</TE>
<TE>   She has sculpted space here, as she writes in her statement for
the show, and offered us a luminous opportunity to engage with the
fullness of emptiness and the presence in silence.</TE>

Cucamonga, (909) 941-2702, through Oct. 27. Closed Saturdays.</TE>
<TE>   'Diary' Depicts the U.S. With Its Flags and Foibles</TE>
<TE>   Posting the American flag on everything from car windows and
storefronts to baby strollers and backpacks has become standard
behavior since Sept. 11. The walls at Fahey/Klein Gallery walls are
papered with flags, but not as a byproduct of knee-jerk patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   The show, "Americana: A Diary," touches on pride but also on the
country's shame. Through 50 vintage photographs from the New York
Times Archives, the show chronicles moments in the last century that
encapsulate major episodes in U.S. history. There are icons and
idiosyncrasies, heroes and hostilities. Like any diary, it is by
definition incomplete, but it is also unavoidably gripping.</TE>
<TE>   Although the flag does appear in nearly all of the pictures on
view, it dominates in just a few. In a 1937 image, bystanders look
like tiny specks next to what was billed as the largest flag in the
country, stretched out on a field by the side of the road. A poignant
photograph made on Memorial Day 1945 shows Boy Scouts planting small
flags on the graves at Brooklyn's National Cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   The flag is, indeed, this country's most enduring symbol, and it's
been used and misused, raised aloft by parties with vastly different
agendas. It waves, for instance, from a parade of thousands of hooded
Ku Klux Klan members near the Capitol building in Washington in a
picture from 1925. In another, from 1976, a white protester uses the
flag on its pole as a spear to poke and prod a black bystander at an
anti-busing demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   Memorable somber moments--Jackie Kennedy and the kids at the
funeral, no less--are leavened by images conveying a sense of America
as one huge three-ring circus, always ready to spotlight a crazy
antic. There's a car crossing an Oregon river on a tightrope, an
inventor wearing engine-powered roller skates. There's Gerald Ford
campaigning, raising his arms to acknowledge the crowd--or possibly
to regain his balance.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the pictures are credited generically to "Staff
Photographer" at the New York Times or one of several picture
agencies. A few familiar names--Chester Higgins Jr., Fred Conrad--are
responsible for some of the more recent shots. This is a show that
celebrates the power of the published photograph to galvanize public
emotion, in its day and even much, much later.</TE>
<TE>   Although it doesn't examine the role of the photographer as
reporter or editorialist, it does include one picture that serves as
tender acknowledgment of their efforts. The 1927 photograph shows a
row of news photographers lined up at a courthouse awaiting a trial
verdict. They stand shoulder-to-shoulder, press cards tucked into
hatbands, fingers on cable releases, smiling, as one of their own
elevates them, for just an instant, to the status of news.</TE>

<TE>   Thought-Provoking Ideas in a Crate of Dirt</TE>
<TE>   Roman Vasseur offers the least to look at but by far the most to
think about of the three artists in the Raid Projects show "Earth
Works." His installation consists simply of a large wooden crate on
the floor and a sequence of texts and correspondence hung in a row on
the wall. The first few pages lay out Vasseur's plan: to transport 1
cubic meter of earth from the Borgo Pass in Transylvania to London,
where the project was originally shown earlier this year, and
ultimately to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   What seems at first both an absurd and banal act gathers
tremendous metaphoric and political steam through the course of its
implementation and documentation. Vasseur, who lives in London,
describes his objectives soberly, including the purposely
self-defeating intention to avoid, during the course of the
transaction, any "direct reference to myths and fictions commonly
associated with this region of Eastern Europe." Dirt in a crate from
the land of Dracula? Let's not go there, he proclaims.</TE>
<TE>   Then he goes there, letting the project's paper trail spin a tale
of political asylum and fear of cultural contamination. He remains so
coyly straight-faced that it's impossible to tell whether the entire
project is a work of fiction and the crate just an empty prop. It
doesn't really matter. The concept is what counts here, and the
cascade of questions and reconsiderations it generates.</TE>
<TE>   Both Chris Tallon's and Evan Sugerman's contributions to the show
take up far more space, but they feel slighter.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A.-based Tallon has constructed a fallen forest out of
cardboard and glue. "The Nature of Substitutions" consists of fat
cylindrical stumps and slimmer curving logs illuminated by standing
industrial fixtures. A path passes through the simulated landscape
but takes us nowhere worth remembering.</TE>
<TE>   Sugerman's "Harvest Space" fills its own separate room with 7 tons
of dirt, a water tank, tangles of hoses, a set of pumps and
batteries, microphones, speakers and an oscilloscope.</TE>
<TE>   It's a pseudoscientific mess, curious and indulgent. Fine shoots
of grass rise from the dirt in patches, water drips from a knot of
"grass pods" and the speakers buzz with amplified vibrations of all
the processes at work.</TE>
<TE>   The unnaturalness of it all is striking, even a bit disturbing,
and is part of the fleeting curatorial point of the show.</TE>
<TE>   Vasseur, however, does make an enduring impression, and his work
sends broad messages--that art is but a box we fill with our own
projections. It's a story that we choose either to believe or reject,
and a smuggling act that calls for subversion, subtlety and surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Raid Projects, 602 Moulton Ave., L.A., (323) 441-9593, through
Aug. 31. Open Saturdays and by appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Photos Distort Reality Without Probing It</TE>
<TE>   Michael Childers, a successful commercial photographer for 30
years, wanted to stretch himself by producing a body of work
generated more from within than by assignment. The result,
"Distortions in My Mind," at Louis Stern Fine Arts, is a stretch in
the most literal sense, but not enough of one aesthetically.</TE>
<TE>   The images are primarily of nudes that Childers has posed near
curved mirrors that turn the bodies into pliable elastic.
Photographing the reflections, Childers produces images that are all
about stretching the familiar into disorienting, impossible shapes.</TE>
<TE>   Bodies distend and collapse. Certain parts are multiplied and
others eliminated, so that a body appears to have two sets of legs
but no head, and another two heads but no legs. The human form
becomes a fantastic, fluid sculpture in alabaster white against
dense, velvety black.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the pictures nearer neighbors to Childers' celebrity
portraiture than he might have had in mind is their slickness and
superficiality.</TE>
<TE>   The prints abound in visual acrobatics but stop short of emotional
resonance. They depend solely on the gimmickry of the mirror, without
penetrating into the murky psychological terrain such distortions
might suggest.</TE>
<TE>   Photographers Andre Kertesz (1894-1985) and Bill Brandt
(1906-1983) both explored that territory provocatively in their own
work with the distorted nude. In addition to Kertesz, Childers counts
the painter Francis Bacon and the sculptor Henry Moore as influences,
but he has assimilated only the externals of their style and none of
its deeper meanings.</TE>
<TE>   Although many of Childers' photographs are compelling, at least
momentarily, he'll have to stretch a bit further if he wants to
generate some actual feeling.</TE>

<HD>'Serving Sara' Does No Service to Anyone, Viewers Least of
All</HD>
<DH>Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection
for its characters, the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet
humor, ethnic slurs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANOHLA DARGIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The crushingly unfunny new comedy "Serving Sara" raises the question:
Can you kill something that's already dead? One of the more cynical
and insulting Hollywood offerings in recent memory, the film was
nominally directed by Reginald Hudlin (best known for "House Party")
and ostensibly written by Jay Scherick and David Ronn, who show
either guts or foolishness in keeping their names on this odoriferous
mess.</LD>
<LD>   In brief, the story involves a sneery process server named Joe
(Matthew Perry) and the beautiful woman (Elizabeth Hurley as Sara) to
whom he's trying to serve divorce papers. Married to a philandering
rich Texan (Bruce Campbell), the avenging wife strikes a deal: If Joe
serves the husband first (a move that will increase the amount of her
divorce settlement), Sara will pay him a million-dollar commission.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, the plan comes equipped with various obstacles,
including Sara's husband and his assorted henchmen, as well as Joe's
aggressively stupid rival (Vincent Pastore) and belligerently
short-tempered boss (Cedric the Entertainer). The even bigger
obstacles, however, are the excruciating script and the transparent
fact that both the director and his two leads would rather be
anywhere but here.</LD>
<TE>   In an apparent bid to raise the gross-out stakes, Scherick and
Ronn pad the bare-bones plot with a surfeit of toilet humor,
embellishing the stink with a number of moronic ethnic jokes
("Wop-Along Cassidy") and an interminable scene in which Joe tickles
a bull's prostate. The sight of the actor sticking his arm up the
animal's backside is certainly distasteful, but worse yet, it's not
even funny.</TE>
<TE>   As with far too many of their peers, the writers have taken their
gonzo cues from the Farrellys without grasping that what elevates the
brothers above the comic crowd isn't just a genius for the grotesque
but love for their characters.</TE>
<TE>   Of course it helps if there are actual characters in the first
place, as opposed to ciphers like these.</TE>
<TE>   Smiling through the wreckage, Hurley recites her lines with
unmodulated cheeriness, feigning obliviousness to a camera that
alternately hovers next to her miniskirt like an overheated dog and
narrows its sights on the words "Trailer Trash" emblazoned across her
T-shirted chest. Meanwhile, Perry, an agreeable small-screen presence
seeking a large-screen future, barely registers. It's been widely
reported that the "Friends" star suffered health problems during
production (causing him to exit the set for several months), and
although that may explain the listlessness of his performance, it
can't account for the shoddiness of his material. It's no wonder the
actor throws away his lines like a guy tossing out the trash.</TE>
<TE>   Hudlin isn't the worst director to work in Hollywood ("House
Party" at least had oomph), but it's clear that somewhere along the
line on this one, he threw in the towel. His setups have all the
animation of a dusty museum diorama, and he doesn't exhibit an iota
of affection for his two leads, neither of whom is photographed to
advantage. It's instructive that Perry is repeatedly shot from low
angles that treble the size of his chin, bringing to mind the cruel
glee with which John Huston framed Sydney Greenstreet's considerable
mass in "The Maltese Falcon."</TE>
<TE>   The director's antipathy for the project would be palpable even if
he didn't also give himself an uncredited cameo in which he seems to
trash his own movie. When Sara loses her suitcase at an airport, she
tears open dozens of other suitcases to cobble together a new outfit,
leaving a mountain of disgorged clothes in her wake. The baggage
handler who stumbles in on the damage is Hudlin, who, after taking
one look, says, "I ain't cleaning it up." Obviously, he's made good
on his promise.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA guidelines: PG-13, for crude humor, sexual content and
language. Times guidelines: Every other line seems to be a
scatological joke or an ethnic slur.</TE>

<HD>An Adrenaline-Charged and Gleeful 'Virginia Woolf'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 40 years since it was first produced, Edward Albee's "Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" has carved itself so indelibly into the
minds of American theatergoers that it can easily fall victim to
familiarity.</LD>
<LD>   From the braying sonorities of Mike Nichols' 1966 film, starring
Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, to those countless acting
classes where it is standard fare, Albee's dialogue has become so
well known that it can verge on camp. Even Albee, whose own 1989
staging of the play at the Doolittle Theatre starred John Lithgow and
Glenda Jackson, couldn't break free of that sheer predictability.</LD>
<LD>   But just when you thought you never wanted to sit through Albee's
three-hour-plus play again, along comes a production at the Blank
Theatre in Hollywood that vividly reminds you just how brilliant the
drama was, is and shall forever remain--given the right combination
of circumstances.</LD>
<TE>   In the Blank outing--a reprise of a recent San Diego Repertory
production--that circumstantial combination is perfection, a wry,
witty and gripping rendition featuring a dream cast, impeccable
technical elements and Todd Salovey's subtly revisionist staging,
which reinvents and reinterprets the play's timeworn cadences without
altering a word of text.</TE>
<TE>   Real-life husband and wife Mike Genovese and Ellen Crawford
(perhaps most familiar as nurse Lydia Wright on the series "ER")
play, respectively, George, a disappointed history professor, and
Martha, his harridan missis, who never misses an opportunity to
publicly humiliate her spouse.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Friedrich and the wrenchingly funny Ginger Williams ably
round out the cast as Nick and Honey, the new professor and his wife,
whom George and Martha invite over for an evening of drinks and "get
the guest."</TE>
<TE>   Nick and Honey are the fools and foils who galvanize the action,
but the meat of the evening is, of course, George and Martha's
twisted marriage, a clash between two worthy adversaries locked in a
battle till death-do-they-part.</TE>
<TE>   Never lapsing into caricature, Genovese and Crawford keep capital
F-U-N in their marital dysfunction. Underneath George and Martha's
weary cynicism lies the giggling excitement of adolescents pledged to
a fatal game of chicken. Their verbal jabs are gleeful,
adrenaline-charged and surgically precise. Giulio Cesare Perrone's
sterile, off-white set is the perfect operating theater for their
ongoing evisceration, a cutting-edge procedure that still fascinates
and repels.</TE>

<TE>   Missed Opportunities</TE>
<TE>   Mar Amusing 'Reunion'</TE>
<TE>   Tracing the course of characters' lives through three successive
10-year high school alumni gatherings, "Reunion," from Chautauqua
Theatre Alliance, delivers plentiful laughs and some touching moments
along the way. Ultimately, however, the piece amounts to little more
than overextended sketch comedy, falling short of the potential in
its ripe premise.</TE>
<TE>   The frighteningly familiar assortment of oddballs, goof-offs,
wannabes and losers assembled each decade in the Sweeney High School
gym are the creations of the 10-member cast. Each actor plays
multiple roles, creating the sense of a crowd, even though only two
or three are usually onstage at any given time for the quick episodic
exchanges that make up the show's structure.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these characterizations are merely quirky exaggerations,
but the most effective ones also strike a note of poignant
authenticity amid their idiosyncrasies. Standouts include a gay man
adjusting to his sexual identity and the surly event organizer
(co-directors Michael Caldwell and Rachel Winfree); a desperately
cheery chatterbox cheerleader and her morose identical twin (both
played by Victoria Delaney); the football star (Stefan Umstead) who
crashes back to earth when an injury cuts short his pro career; the
aspiring actress (Christina Welsh) whose Broadway dream eludes her;
the painfully awkward wallflower (Irene White) who tries in vain to
dispel rumors that she died; the leather-jacketed tough (Damon
Shalit) with feet of clay; and a crabby spinster (Cindy Benson,
filling in for Denise Moses). Tom Bottelsen turns in particularly
memorable portrayals of a clueless nerd and an alcoholic financier
trying to figure out where his life went wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Although the characters' circumstances evolve between their 1986,
1996 and 2006 reunions, the performances give little sense of
physical aging. Other than period music, opportunities to tie in
historical context are largely ignored.</TE>
<TE>   While the ensemble creates generally engaging narrative arcs for
the characters, the "scripting by committee" approach lacks the focus
and direction of a true playwright's vision. The piece plays like a
performers' showcase, with an obligatory need to cycle through
people, regardless of whether they're worth spending time with--not
unlike an actual high school reunion, but here the hyperrealism has
no aesthetic payoff.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a summer of discovery for lovely, sensitive, 16-year-old Vicky:
During her annual vacation stay on Seven Bay Island, she finds that
she prefers a serious scientist-type guy to last year's bad-boy
crush, her grandfather nurtures her gift for poetry ... and she
learns that she can communicate with dolphins.</LD>
<LD>   Madeline L'Engle fans will notice changes in the TV adaptation of
her novel "A Ring of Endless Light" (8 p.m. Disney Channel)--Vicky is
only torn between two guys, not three, for instance.</LD>
<LD>   But a strong dash of the tale's poignant spirit survives, thanks
to Mischa Barton's luminous presence as Vicky and the venerable James
Whitmore as her tender and wise grandfather.</LD>
<TE>   Vicky's empathic tie to dolphins, discovered through her contact
with young dolphin researcher Adam (Ryan Merriman), sparks a couple
of dramatic near-drowning rescues and helps end an illegal drift-net
fishing operation run by the dysfunctional dad of rich kid Zachary
(Jared Padelecki). It also reveals the dolphins' mysterious link with
the universe.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between Vicky and her dying grandfather, however,
is the heart of this coming-of-age movie. Their resonant connection
is underscored by Whitmore's moving reading of the verse by 17th
century poet Henry Vaughan that inspired L'Engle's book and its
message:</TE>
<TE>   "I saw Eternity the other night/ Like a great ring of pure and
endless light.... "</TE>

<HD>'Simone's' Premise Is as Fake as Its Synthetic Star</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given that he's prone to overacting when he has flesh and blood
performers to contend with, co-starring Al Pacino with a
computer-generated actress in "Simone" is asking for trouble. And
trouble is definitely what resulted.</LD>
<LD>   Inexplicably written, directed and produced by Andrew Niccol, who
did an admirable job scripting "The Truman Show," "Simone" is such a
tedious Hollywood farce, so unpleasantly glib and relentlessly
shallow, that Pacino's excessive performance is not even the worst
thing about it.</LD>
<LD>   That would be the film's flimsy premise, maybe strong enough for a
short but way too anemic to sustain a two-hour-plus feature. A thesis
constructed to make a point, "Simone" has nowhere of interest to go
after its introductory minutes, and even those are not as funny or
clever as the film would like to think.</LD>
<TE>   A toothless take on our culture's mania for celebrity as well as a
tired satire on the demanding nature of performers, "Simone" shares
"The Truman Show's" interest in the question of illusion versus
reality, but that's where the comparison ends. It's painful to see
bright people make a dim movie, but that's the case here.</TE>
<TE>   Pacino plays Viktor Taransky, an Oscar-nominated director
introduced removing offending cherry-flavored Mike and Ikes from the
treat bowl of a very picky actress. That would be A-list brat Nicola
Anders (Winona Ryder in a cameo), who appears on screen only to quit
Taransky's movie. Already occupying the biggest trailer on the lot,
she's offended because someone else has one that's taller, so she's
walking.</TE>
<TE>   Furious at being at the mercy of "a supermodel with a SAG card,"
Taransky doesn't pay much attention to wacky inventor Hank Aleno
(Elias Koteas) when he starts bragging about his accomplishments. Not
that Aleno's unintentional double-entendres ("I licked her, I licked
her skin, I licked every part of her") wouldn't be enough to turn off
anyone.</TE>
<TE>   As Taransky eventually finds out, what Aleno is talking about is
solving a problem, not seducing a woman, and the "her" he's referring
to is not a person but a computer-generated actress called Simone,
short for "Simulation One."</TE>
<TE>   Completely desperate, Taransky uses Simone in place of the
temperamental Nicola Anders and finishes his comeback film, "Sunrise,
Sunset." Although nothing we see on screen makes this plausible,
Simone is a huge success, putting Taransky back in the good graces of
studio head Elaine Christian (Catherine Keener), also his ex-wife,
and their noticeably sane (because no one else is) daughter, Lainey
(Evan Rachel Wood).</TE>
<TE>   As if on cue, the press goes crazy over Simone, whom Taransky,
desperate to keep the truth a secret, presents as a private, media
shy artiste. "She is about the work," he intones. "And only the
work." Naturally, this makes the tabloid operatives, especially
sleazy Max Sayer (Pruitt Taylor Vince), who claims, "I had something
on Mother Theresa once," go even wilder as they attempt to catch a
glimpse of the reclusive star.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the intrinsic limitations of this feeble scenario,
which largely involve Taransky telling increasingly elaborate lies to
keep his shell game afloat, "Simone" has several other problems it
has nowhere near the resources to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   First, and most critically, Simone (whose features includes
elements of Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly and other actresses) looks
like exactly what she is: a computer simulation. The idea that she
could fool even the innately gullible entertainment media, let alone
become an international sensation, is preposterous on its face. And
hers.</TE>
<TE>   Also, judging by what we can see of "Sunrise, Sunset" and its
successor, the magnum opus "Eternity Forever," Viktor Taransky is a
perfectly dreadful director whose films would be lucky to go straight
to video. This might be Niccol's inside joke to himself, but the film
can't admit it because that would make "Simone" even more pointless
than it already is.</TE>
<TE>   Which leads to the final difficulty. Taransky, the man we're
supposed to identify with as a filmmaker of artistic vision, turns
out to be something of a jerk, a pompous fool given to making
overblown statements about art and truth. Even a blind hog can find a
truffle now and then, and when Hollywood decided Taransky was over
the hill, they got that right.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13 for some sensuality. Times guidelines: fairly
mild.</TE>

<HD>'Ziggy': How Glam I Am</HD>
<DH>D.A. Pennebaker's restored 1973 concert film offers a bold,
inspired vision of David Bowie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On July 3, 1973, David Bowie performed as Ziggy Stardust with the
Spiders From Mars band for the last time at the Hammersmith Odeon, a
vast old London movie palace. D.A. Pennebaker, the already renowned
documentarian and cinema verite pioneer, especially celebrated for
his 1966 "Don't Look Back" with Bob Dylan, was drifting on a raft
along the Mississippi River when he was hastily summoned to London to
film the concert.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike "Don't Look Back," which is legendary for capturing a
prickly warts-and-all Dylan off stage, "Ziggy Stardust" is strictly a
concert film punctuated with glimpses of the pale and thin Bowie
exchanging one outre costume for another. (During one such break,
Ringo Starr can be glimpsed in Bowie's dressing room.)</LD>
<LD>   But "Ziggy Stardust" is an excellent example of its genre, with
Pennebaker capturing the excitement of what was a very special,
emotion-charged occasion, with Bowie and the Spiders winding up an
acclaimed world tour that stretched from the U.S. to Japan and back
to their home country. Pennebaker strategically placed his fleet of
cameramen to enable him to get a variety of highly mobile footage
that he assembled in a dynamic but never busy or distracting fashion
that reflects the swift pace and high energy of the show.</LD>
<TE>   The film's restoration and 5:1 remix by Tony Visconti was
undertaken to mark the 30th anniversary of the release of "The Rise
and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars," cited in a
Rolling Stone poll as one of the greatest albums in rock history.
Cowboy Pictures made available its restored and remixed "Ziggy
Stardust and the Spiders From Mars" film for presentation at the John
Anson Ford Theater as part of the recent Los Angeles Film Festival,
and now it returns for a regular run.</TE>
<TE>   Fronted by Bowie in his high-androgyny, pioneering glam-rock
phase, the show is tight and crisp, with everyone giving his all to a
richly varied array of songs, including some of Bowie's greatest
hits: "Changes," "All the Young Dudes," "Oh! You Pretty Things,"
"Suffragette City," "Rock 'n' Roll Suicide" and "Ziggy Stardust." For
good measure, Bowie includes a fast-tempo version of Mick Jagger and
Keith Richards' "Let's Spend the Night Together" and a searing take
on Lou Reed's "White Light/White Heat."</TE>
<TE>   The concert opens with Beethoven's Ninth Symphony (arranged and
performed by Wendy Carlos), and Edward Elgar's familiar "Pomp and
Circumstance" serves as exit music. The Spiders From Mars are
sensational in their own right, and much play is given to virtuoso
guitarist Mick Ronson.</TE>
<TE>   It is impossible to watch Bowie's Ziggy without realizing what a
clear inspiration he was for "Hedwig and the Angry Inch." Ziggy's
costumes are a bold, inspired cross between Flash Gordon and the
Cockettes, and are tight, colorful and show a lot of skin.
Accessories range from a crystal earring to a feather boa to fabric
bracelets thick as doughnuts--and of course an array of thick-soled
boots.</TE>
<TE>   Bowie sported a red mullet haircut and white geisha make-up
highlighted by rouged cheeks and dark, mascara-encircled eyes. Bowie
is completely at ease in this gender-bending look, and his audience
of largely teenage girls listens to him with rapt, ecstatic
attention. Yet if Bowie were to sing these rock numbers and plaintive
ballads today, dressed as simply as Bruce Springsteen, they surely
would seem every bit as potent.</TE>
<TE>   There is a certain irony in listening to Bowie as Ziggy singing of
mortality as well as love. Fragile-looking Ziggy might not have
seemed long for this world, but many incarnations later, Bowie keeps
on going, exploring new paths.</TE>

<LD>"One of the things that has happened is that I'm less and less able
to talk about the door itself," said Robert Graham, standing near the
entrance to the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. "It's a good
thing to let it go ....It was a long process."</LD>
<LD>   Graham, who spent the last five years creating the cathedral's
doors, hosted a party Tuesday outside the cathedral to celebrate
their completion. The fete also celebrated the publication of "Robert
Graham: The Great Bronze Doors" (Wave, 2002), three essays by Jack
Miles, Peggy Fogelman and Noriko Fujinami, describing the religious
and historical context of the doors and their technical realization.</LD>
<LD>   Mostly, though, guests at the angelic soiree, including Sidney
Poitier, MOCA director Jeremy Strick, gallery owner Peter Goulds and
environmentalist/actor Ed Begley Jr., had come to toast Graham.</LD>
<TE>   Harry Dean Stanton walked around the plaza, asking, "Anybody seen
Bob?" Possibly obscured by a ring of autograph-seekers, Graham was
standing only a few feet away. Stanton was one of several hundred
denizens from the worlds of arts and movies, Venice and Hollywood,
who sipped wine and marveled as the 25-ton bronze doors opened and
closed.</TE>
<TE>   As day gave way to evening, Brooke Shields admired the shadow play
on the tympanum behind the Virgin Mary above the doors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like wings, or God's hands," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Shields, who gave the artist a Brooke Shields doll, had been
sitting as a model for Graham recently. "It's a time for creative
things," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony was shaking hands with every
person in sight.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal was not among the guests who joined Graham and his
wife, Anjelica Huston, Lauren Bacall and Kelly Lynch at the private
rooftop party at the downtown Standard hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere in Sight</TE>
<TE>   The star count was low, the buzz higher at a low-key Hollywood
screening for "Hysterical Blindness," director Mira Nair's new film.</TE>
<TE>   Nair, who won acclaim earlier this year for "Monsoon Wedding,"
about an Indian nuptial, was on holiday in Africa. Executive producer
and star Uma Thurman was in China working with Quentin Tarantino. So
it was co-star Juliette Lewis who chatted up the industry types
Tuesday night at the Cineramadome.</TE>
<TE>   Set in 1980s Bayonne, N.J., the character-driven film depicts two
working-class women, played by Thurman and Lewis, in their desperate
attempts to find love in the dive bars and row houses of their world.
For Nair, the setting and costuming of the picture played a large
role in keeping the story honest. "There is something extraordinarily
fascinating about '80s banality," Nair said in an interview with HBO.
"It's so easy to characterize this and to make it a cartoon thing
....But it has to feel truthful. The truthfulness of the film was
very much the foundation." Indeed, the authentic costuming in the
picture (particularly Lewis' white body suit with turquoise pumps and
Thurman's intricately sliced rock T-shirts) warranted a few chuckles
from the audience. "I call it 'American Bleak Bollywood Style,' "
Nair said. "It's not your usual piece of Hollywood bonbon."</TE>
<TE>   After the screening, the talk was of Thurman's performance. "She
just totally inhabits the character," said one man to a friend. "It's
kind of spooky." The movie debuts Sunday on HBO.</TE>
<TE>   Running Mate</TE>
<TE>   Life in the White House can change a guy. Stress can take a toll,
and so can things like impeachments and pork rinds (case in point,
Bill Clinton in jogging shorts.) But the rigors office may have an
upside. With George W. Bush set to appear as October's cover boy for
Runner's World magazine, there's talk that he might be the fittest
U.S. president ever.</TE>
<TE>   "There's absolutely no question," said Amby Burfoot, the
magazine's editor, before backtracking. "He's certainly the fastest
runner ever." And a stark contrast, the magazine pointed out, to
Jimmy Carter who was photographed collapsing from heat exhaustion in
a 1979 10K in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, in a rare interview, sat down with Runner's World to talk
about how running helps clear his mind and how he's setting an
example for the rest of us. "No excuses," he told the magazine. "If
the president of the United States can make the time, anyone can."</TE>
<TE>   When a magazine editor ran alongside Bush in the President's
Fitness Challenge three-mile race in Washington in June, Bush, who is
56, posted a time of 20 minutes, 29 seconds--which put him in the top
3% of all 5K finishers of any age in the U.S. Runner's World readers
couldn't believe it and flooded the magazine with calls and e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's doctor says he's in "excellent" health--in the top 1% of
men his age as far as his heart is concerned. His resting heart rate
is 44, putting him in the range of elite marathoners--and ready,
presumably, for that long run in 2004.</TE>

<LD>A THREAD ACROSS THE OCEAN</LD>
<LD>   The Heroic Story of</LD>
<LD>   the Transatlantic Cable</LD>
<TE>   by John Steele Gordon</TE>
<TE>   Walker &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   240 pages, $26</TE>
<TE>   These lines from Longfellow serve appropriately as an epigraph to
"A Thread Across the Ocean," which describes a splendid Victorian-age
feat of technology, capitalism and unbounded optimism:</TE>
<TE>   Let us, then, be up and doing,</TE>
<TE>   With a heart for any fate;</TE>
<TE>   Still achieving, still pursuing,</TE>
<TE>   Learn to labor and to wait.</TE>
<TE>   John Steele Gordon, a deft and fluent writer on business history
for American Heritage magazine, briskly tells how in 12 short years
in the mid-19th century American entrepreneur Cyrus Field made a
common dream his own. To lay the first transatlantic cable that would
unite by electric telegraph Europe and America, he assembled the
engineers, raised the capital and provided the direction and the push
that overcame the several daunting obstacles that stood between his
goal and its consummation.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the money and much of the technology that finally finished
the project in 1866 came from Great Britain, then still the richest
and most advanced industrial society in the world. But some of the
skill was from a surging America--Samuel F.B. Morse, the inventor of
the telegraph, was instrumental--and the enterprise was an equal and
cooperative venture between the two nations through their navies.</TE>
<TE>   Into "A Thread Across the Ocean" Gordon weaves many engaging
snapshots of men and technology in the rapidly developing industrial
world during the great European peace of 1815-1914. There is William
Thompson, later Lord Kelvin, who first articulated the Second Law of
Thermodynamics. He came into the picture because of his interest on
electric currents, then not fully understood but necessary to the
transmission of electric impulses across a copper cable under the
sea. There is, on the American side, Peter Cooper, successful New
York entrepreneur, investor in the transatlantic cable and,
incidentally, founder of the Cooper Union for the free education of
New York working men.</TE>
<TE>   There is the fascinating, towering British engineer Isambard
Brunel, who designed the Great Western Railway from London's
Paddington Station to Bristol and suspension bridges, water towers,
prefabricated field hospitals, tunnels and ships. It was Brunel who
drew the plans for the colossal ship the Great Eastern, launched in
1857, the largest ship afloat until the launching of the ill-fated
Lusitania in 1907. And it was the Great Eastern that finally laid the
cable that tied together Europe and North America.</TE>
<TE>   A combination steam-powered paddle wheel and sailing ship, the
Great Eastern was built large to carry the coal it needed to power
voyages throughout the British Empire. And because of her size, she
was able to store in her hold all the cable needed to thread the
Atlantic from western Ireland to eastern Newfoundland.</TE>
<TE>   When Field's venture began, the Great Eastern was not yet afloat,
and attempts were made by the British and American navies to lay the
cable from their respective ships. It didn't work. The engineers had
trouble getting the tension on the cable laying machines right, and
the cables broke. Violent storms nearly swamped the chief British
ship. The cable kept snapping or mysteriously going dead. And then,
when it was nearly laid, they lost it, deep into the Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   It was typical of the enterprising spirit of the age that setbacks
and accidents did not deter the project and its sponsors. Field was
asked at the outset by his British sponsors what he would do if he
failed. "Charge it to profit and loss," he replied, "and go to work
to lay another." Which is exactly what he did.</TE>
<TE>   "A Thread Across the Ocean" tells of the men who conceived and
engineered and directed and finally put through the great project.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gordon does mention the fearsome labors of the men
building the telegraph line across Cape Breton Island toward
Newfoundland, he does not linger with those whose strong arms and
backs created the great wealth that drove the singular enterprise
forward. This is a book about a chapter in the story of successful
capitalism and its enterprising managers.</TE>
<TE>   The undertaking, said Salmon P. Chase, secretary of the Treasury
and chief justice of the United States, was "an enterprise worthy of
this day of great things." Gordon captures with verve the
adventuresome spirit of the age and the absorbing details of this
imaginative technological achievement.</TE>

<LD>Ellen Feiss is famous because her dad's computer ate her homework.
Not famous in a can't-walk-down-the-street-without-being-noticed kind
of way, but famous in that Warholian
everybody-will-have-their-15-minutes sense.</LD>
<LD>   Feiss, a student, is one of the stars of Apple Computer's "switch"
ad campaign, which features real people who have switched from PCs to
Macintoshes. During her 30-second spot, she describes her PC
experience as "kind of a bummer" and imitates her "berserk" computer
going "beep beep beep."</LD>
<LD>   Interest in Feiss is intense; information about her elusive. Apple
won't divulge any details, aside from verifying she is a real
teenager, but that hasn't stopped thousands of admirers from
discussing her online, building tribute Web sites and selling
T-shirts, Frisbees, wall clocks, mouse pads, mugs and wallpaper--all
emblazoned with her image.</LD>
<TE>   Dressed slacker casual in a zip-up sweatshirt, her wind-swept hair
pulled back from her face to reveal clear skin, full lips and
cocker-spaniel eyes, Feiss would probably have slipped under the
radar if she weren't so darned cute. But there's another reason for
her popularity: Her slightly slurred speech and reddish eyes have led
to much speculation online as to whether or not she is stoned on
marijuana--something that has made Feiss even more popular.</TE>
<TE>   "We just thought she seemed like a cool, funny girl who deserved a
little shrine," said Jake Brown, 30, founder of the Chicago-based
Ellen Fan Club at ellenfeiss.glorious noise.com. "I wanted to build a
place for all the other Ellen lovers to share their thoughts with
each other."</TE>
<TE>   And share they have, posting comments that are pro-Feiss and
anti-Feiss, pro-drug and anti-drug, pro-Mac and anti-Mac.</TE>
<TE>   "Does anybody know if she's available to book for parties?" asked
one fan on the Glorious Noise site.</TE>
<TE>   "Ellen Feiss for president! Woohoo!" declared another.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the 'really good paper' she is referring to are her
Zig-Zags," deadpanned another.</TE>
<TE>   "That's it? For this she's famous? Save often, lady," wrote one
skeptic.</TE>
<TE>   Ad Never Made It to TV</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to believe so much has been read into a 30-second
commercial, especially one that has never aired on television. The
spot debuted at the MacWorld Expo on July 17 and has appeared only on
the Apple Web site since. But, thanks to postings on various Web
logs, Web sites and news groups that link to Apple's site, the Feiss
video is making the rounds.</TE>
<TE>   About 25,000 people have visited Brown's fan site since he set it
up last month, but Brown isn't surprised. "It's one of those things
that people love to talk about," said Brown, who is careful to point
out that he is happily married and not a "stalker maniac weirdo."
"The Ellen ad is like a sweet, harmless version of 'The Osbournes' or
'The Anna Nicole Smith Show.' "</TE>
<TE>   Michael Grant, a 22-year-old network administrator in Houston, saw
the Feiss ad two weeks ago after finding a link to it online.
Thinking the ad was very funny and that Feiss is "cute in the
extreme," he downloaded the wallpaper from the Glorious Noise site so
that every time he logs on to his computer, Feiss is staring at him
from his computer screen.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Caballero, a 19-year-old computer major at Texas A&amp;M
University, also saw the ad a few weeks ago, but he took his
appreciation one step further. He set up the ellenfeiss.net fan site.</TE>
<TE>   Like many of her fans, who are, not surprisingly, young and male,
Caballero was hoping he might get an e-mail from her. In the three
weeks his site has been up, he's received hundreds of messages from
fellow fans, but he hasn't heard from Feiss. He's still hoping.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice," said Caballero. "I've never met any
celebrities before."</TE>
<TE>   Not Releasing Details</TE>
<TE>   Apple is cautious in releasing information about Feiss, probably
because she is a minor.</TE>
<TE>   "She's just a teenager who loves her Mac," is all the company will
say. An Apple spokesperson initially indicated Feiss was from L.A.
but later recanted.</TE>
<TE>   Apple's refusal to release any additional information has just
fueled Feiss' fans, prompting one of them to create a fake interview,
another to make a video remix of the commercial and some people who
know her in real life to post old yearbook pictures online.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's hard to know who Feiss is. What's more amazing is that
people even care, but reality--or the imitation of it--is in, as the
popularity of shows such as "Survivor," "The Bachelor" and "Fear
Factor" can attest.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the difficulties for marketers is that kids are real hip
to being marketed to," said Tobi Elkin, a technology reporter for
Advertising Age magazine. "[They] have to sort of do this
anti-marketing marketing, and the use of real people may just be in
that vein."</TE>
<TE>   And Feiss is nothing if not real. The way she looks, talks and
acts does not seem at all contrived, which is why she has been so
embraced. But whether Feiss' 30-second ad spot can extend her fame
beyond 15 minutes--or whether she has any interest in that
happening--remains to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   "It all depends on Ellen now," said fan club founder Brown. "If
she would like to come forward and talk about herself, I'm sure she
could be in the public eye for a long time."</TE>

<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>At the Pavilion Gabriel, a glass-walled building across from the
American Embassy near Place de la Concorde, an array of black-clad
men and women alternately lingered over a catered gourmet lunch and
blinked into laptops before plowing through dozens of racks holding
John Galliano's new fall collection.</LD>
<LD>   These are the power brokers of retail fashion, executives like
Hila Ekelman, a couture buyer for Neiman Marcus, who decide on which,
if any, runway looks will make their way to customers around the
world. Ekelman was part of a 10-person buying team from the
Dallas-based specialty store. These style arbiters decided back in
March which items from Galliano, and other designers, would be
available in the 31 Neiman stores beginning this week.</LD>
<LD>   It's a high-stakes, high-dollar ritual, repeated season after
season in every design house here and in fashion centers around the
world. What appeared four days earlier on Galliano's runway--42
extravagant ensembles that could clothe an Eskimo geisha in
Mongolia--is notably different from the 450 garments tantalizing
buyers in the showroom.</LD>
<TE>   The showroom collection offers hundreds of variations of
Galliano's runway looks, forcing buyers to piece together their
purchases like an intricate puzzle. The options are so vast, that
it's unlikely that the collection will look exactly the same in any
one store. Even a single garment can change for a store.</TE>
<TE>   The process of editing Galliano's over-the-top runway shows into
wearable and more affordable clothes illustrates how a top designer
manipulates product and perception to build an identity and a
business.</TE>
<TE>   Galliano made his runway bow at Theatre de l'Empire in an
interpretation of the collection--shimmering gold lame pants, fur
mukluks and a rugged shearling vest, but the designer is nowhere to
be found among the buyers. Like any good showman, he's loath to pull
back the curtain to reveal the gritty, unglamorous and sometimes
ingenious necessities of doing business.</TE>
<TE>   In the showroom, a representative from his office nervously
circled a freely roaming newspaper photographer. The designer had
commanded that only close-up details of the clothes be photographed.
It is so forbidden to publicize this more commercial side of the
business that a publicist warned she could be fired for a violation.</TE>
<TE>   On the runway, famous models with feathers glued around one eye to
resemble an exotic mask wore layer upon layer of richly embroidered
coats, dresses and pants while balancing oversized parcels on their
heads like some sort of coiffure a la papoose. For the buyers,
unknown models sported natural makeup and hairstyles, wore a minimum
of layers and had trouble walking in 4-inch heels.</TE>
<TE>   Where the catwalk is flash and excitement, the showroom is
scrutiny and logic, but the two merged in a pair of suede-like
salmon-skin hip-hugger jeans. Their overwhelming luxury and
unmistakable craftsmanship awakened a lust for ownership in all who
saw them. But this one-of-a-kind pair, made to radiate an idea on the
runway, were not to be had. Like a master seducer, Galliano created
desire with the exotic skin jeans and arranged to satisfy it with
more salable, though still pricey, approximations in decorated cotton
denim.</TE>
<TE>   The runway version of a thick sweater adorned with the season's
new rustic Galliano logo and 17 handmade, fur-trimmed snow star
appliques costs $3,325 retail. To allow buyers to stretch their
budgets, Galliano also offered a two-star version that would sell for
$1,000 less. The elaborate embroidered dragon emblem that appeared on
a ball gown also was translated onto an embroidered T-shirt that is
an "entry level" purchase into the Galliano world.</TE>
<TE>   Those $430 T-shirts and $700 embroidered jeans arrived on the
sales floor this week and are selling well. Many of the line's most
expensive pieces are destined for L.A., where Galliano's bold designs
help make the collection at Beverly Hills Neiman Marcus one of the
largest selections anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "We always buy over-the-top pieces for L.A.," said Ekelman. "The
more fantasy there is in them, the better the clients love them."
With a laptop to record her purchases, Ekelman bought at least one in
every size from 4 to 12 of a $4,800 (retail) hand-painted shearling
jacket and a similar $4,500 skirt, and a significant number of $2,200
denim skirts. She calculated her budget from a complex matrix of
wholesale prices that she was careful not to reveal.</TE>
<TE>   With so many stores across the country to fill, Ekelman had a wide
latitude to buy more extreme looks with their five-figure retail
prices, though she concentrated the wildest looks in a fashionably
thin size 6 or 8. Only one piece, a $10,000 cream-embroidered black
leather jacket, was purchased with one specific client in mind,
though company policy forbids naming her.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of the customers as a group," Ekelman said. "Usually, if
it is good for one customer, there is another customer somewhere in
the U.S. who will buy it."</TE>
<TE>   As the buyer worked throughout a long afternoon, her team shrank
and swelled, with as many as 10 people focused on a single garment.
Politely, they offered opinions on each item's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see someone at the Academy Awards in that," fashion
director Joan Kaner said as a model minced past in a corseted tuxedo
dress. Catherine Bloom, the personal shopper for the Beverly Hills
store, had flown in to study collections for her best customers,
several of whom will show up on red carpets. Stars from Nicole Kidman
to Cate Blanchett became awards-show fashion plates in their
Gallianos; rocker Gwen Stefani became a sophisticate in his custom
designs.</TE>
<TE>   If history is any guide, Los Angeles customers will buy even
Galliano's heavy winter coats and jackets, including furs with
five-figure price tags. "Price isn't an issue when it's something
special," said senior vice president and general merchandise manager
Ann Stordahl.</TE>
<TE>   Galliano made his name with exotic showstoppers. Now, he's making
money by infusing the air of their mystique into less expensive
items. The silhouette of a huge, $13,000 mink coat is reinterpreted
in a shorter black shearling coat to create a look that's more casual
and slightly less expensive. The Oriental brocade of his evening wear
is interpreted as a print on cashmere twin sets or a chiffon
camisole. He's cleverly woven the roughhewn, appliqued logo he'd
created for this collection into the clothes and the company's image.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of his usual gothic-lettered logo, the Galliano name was
spelled out in rough suede strips across a bulky sweater, a shearling
handbag and even the length of a wide belt. When that yard-long belt
was scanned life-size to become his show's invitation, perceptive
fashionistas didn't need smoke signals to get the point. The designer
had revealed the direction of his show and fanned desire for his
latest status logo.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by the buyers' enthusiasm for his fall collection, it is
easy to understand why Galliano's creative reach and commercial clout
have never been as pervasive. He produces four collections a year for
his signature label and even more as Christian Dior's designer. Under
both labels, his clothes sell in hundreds of stores around the world,
including the Maxfield boutique in West Hollywood and New York's
Bergdorf Goodman. Not only has Dior become one of the few profitable
luxury firms, with sales steadily increasing, the trademarks of his
signature collection have also become recognized in global fashion.
His way with luxury military wear, bias-cut slip dresses and powerful
prints of everything from newspapers to Indian chiefs has inspired
lasting trends that show up at other luxury ateliers and on $10
swap-meet styles.</TE>
<TE>   As Ekelman and her colleagues bridge the fantasy of fashion and
the reality of business, they seem to operate in a world that is
neither. Though few of the executives wear Galliano's exotic $10,000
and $20,000 creations, their jobs depend on knowing the women who do.
It's not a world open to many, but Galliano's design--and shrewd
marketing--make his clothes seem accessible.</TE>
<TE>   When even the tamer versions of his clothes show up on store
shelves or, eventually, on markdown racks, they manage to retain the
electric energy of his runway spectacles. Galliano and the store
buyers know that whether customers spend $300 or $3,000, they're not
just buying apparel. They're buying excitement.</TE>

<LD>Create an</LD>
<LD>   Armchair Adventure</LD>
<LD>   Summer is a time when many families go on vacation. Whether or not
you go somewhere, it is always fun to create an "armchair adventure."</LD>
<TE>   Activity</TE>
<TE>   To get started, you'll need to make a "suitcase" for your trip.
Get a file folder or make your own by folding in half a piece of
construction paper. Find some old newspapers and magazines and ask
your parents if it's OK to cut pictures out of them. Find a place
that looks interesting to visit. Then find clothes and other things
that you will need for a trip to that place. What would you need for
a trip to Death Valley? What about Alaska or Hawaii?</TE>
<TE>   Cut out the pictures of what you want to take and paste them
inside the folder. Then paste the pictures of the place you want to
visit on the outside of your suitcase. If you can't find the right
pictures, draw your own.</TE>
<TE>   Make a handle out of construction paper for the top of your
suitcase and close it with paper clips or fasteners. Share your
vacation suitcase with friends and family members. Describe your
armchair adventure to them.</TE>
<TE>   Whether you get on a plane to take a vacation or travel to distant
shores only in your mind, a good place to get information is your
local library. Take your "suitcase" with you and look for books that
tell about your destination. You can also find magazines that have
stories and pictures from all over the world.</TE>
<TE>   If you go to a Los Angeles Public Library, you can also join the
"Pop Up for Reading! Club" and get a free pop-up folder. Don't miss
"Pop Up! 500 Years of Movable Books: Selections From the Waldo Hunt
Collection" on view at the Central Library in downtown Los Angeles,
Saturday through Jan. 12.</TE>
<TE>   To find the closest library, visit www.lapl.org or check your
local telephone directory.</TE>
<TE>   This Learning Link was written by Ilene Abramson, director of
children's services for the Richard J. Riordan Central Library, 630
W. 5th St., Los Angeles.</TE>

<LD>The Al Qaeda training and propaganda videotapes airing on CNN and CBS
may or may not shed additional light on the terrorist network's
activities. But the questions raised about their provenance are a
window on the murky issues that arise when journalists pay for what
they report as news.</LD>
<LD>   The tapes aired thus far show pre-Sept. 11 footage of Osama bin
Laden posturing, various terrorist training exercises and the killing
of a dog with what some analysts believe may be a chemical weapon.
After initial denials, the cable network now admits it paid a still
unnamed intermediary in Afghanistan $30,000 for 64 tapes with more
than 100 hours of recorded material. CBS purchased 30 tapes from the
Magnum photo agency for what a network spokesman calls a "pretty low"
sum.</LD>
<LD>   Spokesmen for both CNN and CBS have repeatedly said their
organizations are certain that none of the money went to Al Qaeda or
anyone associated with it. Given their unwillingness to divulge
details about the tapes' source, it is assurance that, so far, must
be taken on faith.</LD>
<TE>   It is an accepted principle of American journalism that reporters
should not pay for information. Doing so, most journalists believe,
creates a situation in which sources are encouraged to deceive or
sensationalize in hopes of receiving a better price for their wares.
However, broadcasters and magazines routinely purchase videotapes and
photographs from freelancers. When they do so, however, the source is
almost invariably identified in an accompanying narration or photo
credit.</TE>
<TE>   The two networks' failure to do that and their initial reluctance
to acknowledge paying for the material "raises a big set of
questions," said Michael Parks, the Pulitzer Prize-winning former
foreign correspondent who now directs the School of Journalism at
USC's Annenberg School for Communications.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that makes this hinky," said Parks, "is that we
don't pay for news as a matter of principle. There are, of course,
harmless exceptions. When a reporter takes a source out for drinks
and dinner, that could be construed as a kind of payment. Networks
and local stations buy freelance footage and photos without much
control over its origin, though we expect them to make a judgment
when they see it. But there is a general agreement that when we allow
news to become a commodity to be sold, we are distorting the
reporting process and injecting an incentive to falsify."</TE>
<TE>   CNN and CBS, according to Parks, a former editor of The Times,
"created this problem when they failed to disclose their payments.
Their viewers have a right to know how they came by these tapes and
from whom. Their viewers have an absolute right to that information.
Transparency is the first consideration here because where the money
went is a question of public interest. I don't think any news
organization wants to be in the position of financing Al Queda or its
allies, but by not disclosing forthrightly who precisely was paid and
how much, they've raised that question and put themselves on
absolutely treacherous ground."</TE>
<TE>   Novelist's Enemies</TE>
<TE>   Poet and novelist Michel Houellebecq, French literature's reigning
enfant terrible, once remarked that "the truth is scandalous."</TE>
<TE>   So, too, apparently is speaking one's mind.</TE>
<TE>   At least that is the contention of four Muslim organizations that
have sued Houellebecq for defaming Islam in his new novel,
"Plateforme," and in an interview with the literary magazine Lire.</TE>
<TE>   The 44-year-old Houellebecq, who one French critic has described
as "the Camus of the information generation" is no stranger to
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Various of his stories and poems have outraged the religious
right. His 1998 novel "Les Particules Elementaires"--called
"Atomised" in its English translation--enraged the French left with
its scathing portrayal of the "generation of 1968."</TE>
<TE>   Last May, however, when an international panel of judges awarded
"Atomised" the $100,000 Impac Dublin award for new fiction, they
called the book "darkly brilliant."</TE>
<TE>   The protagonist of Houellebecq's new novel says that he
experiences a "quiver of glee" whenever "a Palestinian terrorist" is
killed.</TE>
<TE>   The story's climactic scene involves an assault on a resort by
Muslim terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   In the Lire interview, the author called Islam "the stupidest
religion" and said he found reading the Koran "so depressing."
(Houellebecq has been hospitalized several times for depression.)</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia's Mecca-based World Islamic League, the National
Federation of French Muslims and the Paris and Lyon mosques have
joined in a suit alleging the novel and interview defame their
religion and violate French laws on tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   If they prevail, the author could be sentenced to a year in jail
and fined more than $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   Houellebecq, who lives in Ireland, has declined to comment, though
he intends to testify when the case comes to trial in September.</TE>
<TE>   However, his lawyer, Emmanuel Pierrat, compares his client's
situation to that of British writer Salman Rushdie, who was placed
under a fatwa, or death sentence, by the Ayatollah Khomeini for his
novel "The Satanic Verses."</TE>
<TE>   According to Pierrat, "the two cases are very similar.... Both
Salman Rushdie and Michel Houellebecq are great writers. We are not
dealing with small-time provocateurs."</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Joan Didion's most recent books are "Political Fictions" and "The
Last Thing He Wanted":</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fact-checking a book that seemed finished and now is in
pieces, scattered around my office. I don't know when it will be
done. Knopf has talked about putting it on their fall 2003 list, but
to do that I'd have to give it by the first of November.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something I began in the early 1970s, when I started
writing what I thought was a book about California. I never got very
far with it. I'm not sure why I didn't. Part of it was that other
things became more urgent. But I suspect that part of it was that my
mother and father were alive and to continue would have meant
actually addressing certain things I must not have wanted to get into
with them. A lot of what the book was about was the difference
between what I had been told and had believed growing up in
California and what I now observed about the state. At the center of
it was the whole myth of redemption in the crossing of the continent,
though what we had been redeemed from was never spoken of.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyway, over the past 10 or 12 years, I did a couple of long
pieces, and it seemed to me that they were actually about the same
thing and that I still hadn't resolved it. So I picked it up again
last year, coming at it from a different angle. My father was dead
and though my mother was still alive, she died in May of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I had to set it aside again to make some money. I picked it
up again right after Christmas and have worked on it off and on ever
since. This summer it was finished--in a manner of speaking.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even have a title, which shows how unclear I am that I've
actually finished it. No title is quite right for what it is. If I
could grasp that, I'd have a title. I started going through my
family's journals of their crossings and arrivals in California, and
that's where it starts now. The reading that I've done as part of
this that was most stunning for me was Josiah Royce [the 19th century
philosopher and California historian]. He is amazing, so troubled. He
never came to terms with California--with what he had wanted it to be
and what he found it to be. I notice now that the person I keep
quoting most to make whatever point I'm making is Josiah Royce.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking of calling this book 'Where I Was From.' John
[Gregory Dunne, her husband] doesn't like it because it sounds too
much like a memoir, which would be misleading. It's not a memoir;
it's really a contemplation of California."</TE>

<LD>Jamie Lee Curtis, whose celebrated bod starred in such films as
"Perfect," is doing what few actresses would dare: She's showing the
world how she really looks.</LD>
<LD>   In the September issue of More magazine, on newsstands next week,
the 43-year-old poses with no makeup, no manicure, no professional
coif, no diamond jewelry and no designer duds--wearing nothing but a
sports bra and her skivvies.</LD>
<LD>   Reached by phone in L.A. on Thursday, Curtis said her forthcoming
children's book, "I'm Gonna Like Me: Letting Off a Little
Self-Esteem" (Joanna Cotler Books), inspired her to suggest the
unflattering shot, paired with a second one that illustrates the
transformative power of 12 stylists, a $1,000 dress and photo
touch-ups.</LD>
<TE>   "I figured if I was putting this message out for children, I had
better practice what I preach," she said. "I'm not a weight activist;
if anything, I'm just trying to shed a little light on what I think
is a lack of self-esteem that a lot of people have. The best way I
can approach this is by writing books for children and starting a
dialogue, because body-image issues start in your youth."</TE>
<TE>   Curtis has had liposuction and Botox. She diets and exercises,
though not obsessively, and has sworn off alcohol since admitting
past substance abuse. Friends call her the Energizer Bunny.</TE>
<TE>   "The photo I challenge any paparazzo to get is of me hanging out
on a couch somewhere," she quipped. Still, despite the feverish pace,
attention to health, nips and tucks, she insists she's not perfect
and wouldn't have it any other way.</TE>
<TE>   "I spend a lot of time with my kids.... If I chose to spend five
hours a day on my body, I'd look great. I'd look amazing. But I'm
trying to live a real life." The standard of beauty perpetuated by
the media is set by women who have personal trainers and chefs, she
added.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently a TV pitchwoman for wireless provider VoiceStream,
Curtis doubts she would have been able to pose for the revealing shot
if she still held the position. "It's not what they hired me to do.
I'm not saying they hired me to walk around in my underwear, but they
hired me to rep a youth-oriented market."</TE>
<TE>   Before posing, she considered how the photo would affect the
prospect of future acting roles. "I am hoping that I can continue to
do all kinds of work being who I am today. I'm very lucky ...
although I'm not financially independent, I'm comfortable. I'm not
sure I would have been able to do this when I was younger."</TE>
<TE>   Fashion magazines benefit from the same larger-than-life glamour
as Hollywood. But More editor in chief Susan Crandell said she wasn't
worried about Curtis upsetting the beauty mystique. "I don't see why
fantasy and reality can't coexist. ... I think it's courageous of
Jamie to say that reality is different but it's not worse.... I can
imagine women looking at the picture and saying, 'Boy, Jamie Lee
Curtis' stomach and thighs look like mine.' "</TE>
<TE>   A Photographer's</TE>
<TE>   Hip-Hop History</TE>
<TE>   When Jamel Shabazz was snapping pictures of African American men
and women dressed in Jordache jeans, Adidas sneakers with fat
shoelaces, and oversized rectangular eyeglasses in 1980s New York
City, he had no inkling that what he was documenting would grow into
the cultural behemoth that is hip-hop style. Or that Dior's John
Galliano would show boombox-shaped purses on a Paris runway, that
kids from Tokyo to Torrance would adopt "old school" Pumas and track
suits as their everyday uniforms, or that Samuel L. Jackson and other
celebs would one day wear felt Kangol hats to glitzy Hollywood
premieres.</TE>
<TE>   Shabazz's book of photos, "Back in the Days" (Powerhouse Books,
2001), has become a cult favorite of those nostalgic for the fashion
innovation that preceded today's wholesale "bling-bling" world. After
stops in London and New York, an exhibit of the stylish shots will be
on view for the next three weeks at the gallery at Les Deux Cafes in
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   To mark the event, Urban Outfitters has teamed up with exhibit
sponsors Dazed &amp; Confused magazine and Kangol to showcase images from
the book in store windows beginning Monday. For a limited time the
chain also will offer the "Bermuda Casual" hat popularized by LL Cool
J. The toppers come with a free CD of "Uptown Sounds" chosen by
Shabazz and Fab 5 Freddy.</TE>

<LD>Dear Fashion Police: Black tie, black-tie optional, business attire
.... I've gotten a flurry of invitations with different dress
requests. Here's my pressing issue: When and where can a white dinner
jacket be worn?</LD>
<LD>   --STEPPING OUT</LD>
<LD>   Dear Stepping: Thank you, Mr. Social Butterfly, for reminding us
that attire requests can be confusing, even when the directions are
clear, i.e. "black tie" or "business attire." Since society has
gotten much more casual there are fewer and fewer formal events, and
invitations requesting formal attire are often greeted with a giant
freak-out from men and women over what to wear. Tuxedo? Dark suit?
Long dress? Cocktail dress?</LD>
<TE>   When hosts decide to get creative with the dress code and offer
such bizarre and unhelpful directions as dressy casual, party attire,
festive fun clothes or elegant black tie, that giant freak-out can
turn into a mega-gargantuan freak-out. That's why we've admonished
party-givers in the past to keep it simple. And we'll do it one more
time: Keep it simple.</TE>
<TE>   As for the white dinner jacket, it's appropriate during summer
(roughly Memorial Day through Labor Day) at formal events held in
more relaxed settings, such as a resort or a country estate, or when
you're impersonating Humphrey Bogart in "Casablanca." It should be
worn with black tuxedo pants. When in doubt, a black tuxedo or dinner
jacket is always appropriate when black tie is called for, but choose
a lightweight wool for warmer months.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I enjoy swimming. However, even one-piece
swimsuits reveal more than I would like to show. Are there any
attractive, fashionable swimsuits under $30 in size 22 or 24 that
cover the knees and elbows and do not cling too closely to the arms
and legs? I don't want a suit good only for splashing around in the
water or a Gibson Girl bathing-beauty costume that would have been
fashionable in 1902. I want to swim laps in this swimsuit year-round
without getting waterlogged.</TE>
<TE>   --POOL HEARTY</TE>
<TE>   Dear Pool: We found a few suits that have some of your
requirements, but not all. Many suits for plus sizes offer some
coverage for the lower body, but all are sleeveless. The only thing
with sleeves we found was the new Speedo Fastskin, which looks like a
long-sleeve unitard, but it's about $300 and fits like a second skin.
Any kind of top that's not clingy, like a T-shirt, is going to create
an enormous amount of drag when you swim. We also didn't do too well
on your under-$30 price range. But here goes:</TE>
<TE>   PlusShop.com has a swim-dress with an empire waist, halter top and
full skirt that covers the upper thighs ($98.95, www.plusshop.com, or
call [818] 889-4096).</TE>
<TE>   Junonia offers a step-in tank suit with attached shorts that come
to about mid-thigh. The shorts have a waistband made of swimsuit
fabric, and the tank is a racer-back style with a cutout in the back
($99, www.junonia.com, [800] 586-6642.</TE>
<TE>   Several styles of full-skirted swim-dresses are available at
SwimsuitsJustForUs.com. A style by It Figures! has a square neck and
belted empire waistline ($89). A color block suit also from It
Figures! has striped color blocking on the bodice with a dark navy
bottom ($69, www.swimsuitsjustforus.com, [877] 587-8487).</TE>
<TE>   The Aquajogger Unisuit from World Wide Aquatics is a unitard style
suit that is sleeveless and falls mid-thigh. It's made of
polyolefin/Lycra and is fully lined in the front and back, and has a
shelf bra. Sizes go up to XXXL ($98.99, www.world wideaquatics.com,
[800] 726-1530.)</TE>

<LD>Maria and Alfonso were hiking with their Uncle Ruben on the trails
around the mountain camp where Uncle Ruben worked as a nature guide.</LD>
<LD>   Maria ran off the trail to get a closer look at a butterfly.</LD>
<LD>   "Be careful, there," said Uncle Ruben. "I think you just walked
through poison oak."</LD>
<TE>   "Oops," said Maria, looking all around, uncertain which plant was
poison oak.</TE>
<TE>   She quickly jumped back to the trail.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben knelt down beside the trail and plucked a tiny
three-parted leaf.</TE>
<TE>   "See how each leaf has these three parts," said Uncle Ruben. "And
look how shiny the leaf is. And some of the leaves are turning red."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," said Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are you holding it if it's poison oak?" Alfonso asked in a
startled voice.</TE>
<TE>   "I am one of the fortunate few who don't get it. But don't you
ever pick it!"</TE>
<TE>   After their hike, Maria washed her legs with soap and hot water.
Still, two days later Uncle Ruben noticed some blisters starting to
form on Maria's leg.</TE>
<TE>   "Does that itch?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, yes, it is just starting to itch," replied Maria.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Ruben took a leaf of a plant called aloe vera. Uncle Ruben
broke open the leaf and rubbed the watery insides on Maria's leg.</TE>
<TE>   "Ooooh!" yelled Maria. "That's all gooey and sticky."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, but let it dry on your leg," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, the itching has gone away," said Maria with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," said Uncle Ruben. "You should always avoid the poison oak,
but if you get a poison oak rash, the aloe vera plant can work
wonders."</TE>
<TE>   "We're glad we came to camp," said Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," chimed in Alfonso.</TE>

<HD>A Moment of Silence and a Slice of American Cheese</HD>
<DH>As in the last 75 years, a motley group congregates today
at a cemetery at the exact time Valentino died</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seventy-five years later, at least one mystery remains: the identity
of the original Lady in Black, who arrived each year on Aug. 23 at
12:10 p.m.--her face obscured by a veil--to silently lay roses at
Rudolph Valentino's crypt.</LD>
<LD>   Today, as every year, this question arises as fans, freaks,
collectors, an octogenarian silent movie organist--and perhaps a new
Lady in Black--gather in the main alcove of the Cathedral Mausoleum
at Hollywood Forever Cemetery to mourn the silent screen's "Great
Lover" on the anniversary of his death.</LD>
<LD>   The Valentino Memorial Service is part reverence, part cheese.
Over the decades, this classic example of Hollywood
self-memorialization has evolved a culture of its own, luring
cultists, the curious and even the lunatic fringe, eliciting from
attendees an almost religious fervor.</LD>
<TE>   The spectacle of the memorial service has become outrageous over
the years, said Valentino memorabilia collector Tracy Terhune, 44.
"It became like a circus," said Terhune, who works in the accounting
department of Universal Studios. People were drinking water out of
the wall-mounted vases used for flowers, he said, burning incense and
conducting seances. "People were saying they were carrying
Valentino's child, even though he had been dead for 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   The annual ritual--performed at 10 minutes past noon, the exact
moment of Valentino's death from natural causes in 1926 at age 31--
is one of Hollywood's oldest and most famous. The event has continued
in one form or another at the cemetery for the last 75 years (only
once, when the cemetery was crumbling and close to closing, did the
memorial migrate to the Silent Movie Theater on Fairfax Avenue.)</TE>
<TE>   Today, in the mausoleum, the ceremony is to include talks by
Hollywood historian Marc Wanamaker and Carrie Bible, a film buff and
voluntary Lady in Black, who will talk about her predecessors.
Eighty-nine-year-old Bob Mitchell, who claims to be the only
silent-movie organist still alive, will accompany a compilation of
romantic clips from Valentino films. Then, the Valentino pilgrims
will walk down the echoing marble hallways to lay flowers and plant
lipstick kisses on the crypt of the world's first celluloid
heartthrob.</TE>
<TE>   At dusk, which falls at about 8 p.m., visitors will spread their
blankets on the lawn to watch the Valentino movie "Monsieur
Beaucaire," projected on the side of the mausoleum. Mitchell will
play a generator-fueled Hammond organ, with a special speaker that
will imitate the sound of the Wurlitzer pipe organ once used at all
the silent-movie houses in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few years ago, when the old cemetery was crumbling and
close to bankrupt, it looked like the long-running memorial service
was nearly dead. But in 1998, a new, publicity-savvy owner gave the
cemetery--and the event--a new lease on life.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler Cassity, a Midwesterner from a family in the "pre-need"
funeral business, bought the place for $375,000. He saw the potential
of the 62 green acres abutting Paramount Studios, and of a place with
more dead movie stars than any other spot on the face of the Earth.
Interred in its cool mausoleums and smooth lawns are celluloid greats
such as Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Cecil B. DeMille, Tyrone Power--and,
of course, Valentino.</TE>
<TE>   Cassity had heard tales of the service and the mysterious ladies
in black. Still, he was surprised when an old man turned up at his
door one day, saying he ran the memorial service, and would like to
do it again for a fee. He gave Cassity his program, which appeared to
have remained constant since the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   The man's name was Bud Testa. "I was very happy to see him,"
Cassity said. "He was such a character. He was definitely old
Hollywood, even in his speech and his dress you could tell he was
from the Golden Era. He was still charging 1950s prices." Cassity
listened to the old PR man, and decided to take him up on his offer.
(Testa lives in a Glendale rest home; he was unable to give an
interview.)</TE>
<TE>   Cassity was taken aback the first time he witnessed the event.</TE>
<TE>   "It was out there," he recalled. "I didn't know what to think. I
was new to Hollywood. I didn't have a sense for that kind of flavor.
It seemed like the event had so little to do with Valentino. But it
definitely it had its own culture."</TE>
<TE>   Rather than judge it, however, Cassity decided to respect it.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell has played at the service for two decades, and still
plays several times a week at the Silent Movie Theater. In his youth,
he played silent films four to five times a week for four years,
including for two Valentino films, "The Eagle" and "The Cobra." That
career ended in 1929, the year the last silents were made.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell believes the service, and especially the ladies in black,
was always a publicity stunt.</TE>
<TE>   "The cemetery wanted to sell graves," he said. "They hired a woman
to be the Lady in Black, to keep the tradition up. Soon there were
two women in black. Last year there was a black woman who came
dressed all in white."</TE>
<TE>   The genesis of the tradition is almost irrelevant now. The event
has taken on a life of its own, with intrigues, legends and
rivalries. "There were antics, faintings, ripping off of veils," said
Terhune, who is hoping to publish a book on the topic.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the service's mystique, Terhune explained in a
room of his house crammed with Valentino memorabilia, were the
various ladies in black.</TE>
<TE>   Though it is said the first Lady in Black visited the crypt the
year after Valentino died, all through the 1930s the black-clad
mourners multiplied--and refused to identify themselves. Mitchell,
the organist, says silent-screen star Pola Negri, who claimed to have
been engaged to Valentino, was the first. (Cassity had heard that one
owner of the cemetery hired his own daughter to be the Lady in
Black.) By the 1950s, when Testa began oganizing the event, the
bizarreness seemed to reach its zenith. An offended member of the
Valentino family even threatened legal action to stop it. ("The
morbidly emotional gags and sideshow antics that take place annually
at the grave of Rudolph Valentino in the Hollywood Cemetery may be
halted by legal action," one newspaper reported in 1951.)</TE>
<TE>   "The family not only weren't involved, but didn't support the
service," said Jeanine Villalobos, 32, Valentino's great-great-niece.
Villalobos, a doctoral student at UC Irvine, is working on a
dissertation about her great-great-uncle, based on newly discovered
personal documents. "They felt it was disrespectful and very
theatrical. That people were using it for cheap publicity." She said
the family was especially put off by a publicity stunt for a 1951
movie about Valentino, in which actor Anthony Dexter showed up at the
crypt in costume with a publicist at his side.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, numerous ladies in black--from starlets to matrons--
were turning up on Aug. 23, vying for fame and newspaper coverage.
There were so many that they began giving their names, pretending to
faint, ripping each other's veils off, and throwing flowers at each
other, each claiming to be the real Lady in Black.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it actually became humdrum," Terhune said. "Except for
the drama of 'Would she appear?' And if she does, what would she do?
Faint? Sing? Cry?' And there was always the hope that two ladies in
black would face off."</TE>
<TE>   The names of many of the ladies in black have faded with time. But
two of the most ambitious, hard-core mourners' names have stuck. One
is Ditra Flame, who claimed she met Valentino as a teen in a boarding
house in Los Angeles before he became famous. He visited her when she
was sick in the hospital, she said, and they both pledged that
whoever died first would bring flowers to the other's grave. Flame's
last visit was in 1954. After that, she turned to missionary work,
dedicating herself to Jesus, rather than Valentino. The other
legendary Lady in Black was Estrellita Del Regil, a movie extra who
appeared in hundreds of films. She died last year. She claimed her
mother was the original Lady in Black.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago Terhune obtained the meticulous records of
Flame, who kept copies of every letter she sent and received
(including those to rival ladies in black), newspaper clippings with
personal commentary scribbled in the margins. "J. Edgar Hoover had
nothing on her," said Terhune. "She was going to write a book."</TE>
<TE>   With the passing of Del Regil things have grown tamer. Cassity
says he has tried to put the spotlight back on Valentino. Today's
service, he said, is no longer a publicity stunt, but an effort to
keep a tradition alive. Cassity has even tried to build bridges with
the long-alienated Valentino family. Villalobos said that after years
of hearing how tacky the event was, she checked it out two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some goofiness," she said. "But I was impressed that
there was still the active fan base, most of whom really do respect
him, and really do respect his work."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Cassity confessed earlier this week, "I'm afraid it might
become too sanitized, that we might be removing the fundamental
character by making it too tame. At the same time, we must be
somewhat respectful to the man who is interred there."</TE>

<LD>Math scores--A story in Thursday's California section about improved
Stanford 9 math test scores in the Los Angeles Unified School
District incorrectly quoted David Klein, a Cal State Northridge
professor, as saying that some high school math teachers had not
mastered basic subject matter. In fact, his quote should have read:
"You can't go to the top until you master the lower levels, and many
students haven't even mastered the basics." The story also stated
that half of the district's teachers lack full credentials. Actually,
25% are employed with emergency credentials, according to the
district.</LD>

<LD>John C. Argue--In an Aug. 12 Sports story remembering the late Los
Angeles Olympic organizer John C. Argue, no implication was intended
that Olympic President Peter V. Ueberroth's selection of Olympic
decathlon champion Rafer Johnson to light the torch at the Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 1984 had anything to do with Johnson
casting the decisive vote to select Ueberroth as president of the
organizing committee in 1979.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson also says that he was only "joking" when he declared to
others at a public gathering that the late Mayor Tom Bradley asked
him to vote for Ueberroth. Johnson said he cast his deciding vote for
Ueberroth independently, without any urging by Bradley.</LD>

<HD>Some Farmers Are Skeptical of Ads for State's Produce</HD>
<DH>Food: Officials launch a $32-million campaign. Some growers
doubt it will boost sales; they fear it could touch off charges of
protectionism.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Squeezed between rising costs and stiff competition from imports,
California food growers have been looking for ways to convince
consumers and retailers that their crops are worth paying more for.</LD>
<LD>   State agriculture officials unveiled one possible solution
Thursday, in the form of a "California Grown" advertising campaign to
persuade Californians to buy produce from their home state.</LD>
<LD>   But some growers and others don't expect the $32-million campaign
to have a measurable effect and are concerned it could touch off
charges of protectionism.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to be very careful," said Dan Sumner, head of the
Agricultural Issues Center at UC Davis. "The last thing we want is to
encourage the Japanese to have a 'Buy Japanese' program any more than
they do already."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, state officials believe a little public education
will boost the $29.8-billion industry's bottom line and instill pride
in the state's agriculture products. Local television spots and
supermarket signs featuring the "California Grown" license plate logo
were scheduled to debut Thursday night in major markets across the
state. They will run for 30 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Imports have increased so much over the last eight or 10 years,"
said Ralph Watts, chief executive of the Buy California program,
which received $20 million in federal funds and the rest from the
state and industry. "It's putting a lot of our industries in
trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Net income on California's farms declined 32% last year to $3.8
billion from $5.6 billion as prices for many of the state's 350
commodities dropped and production costs increased. But some growers
expressed skepticism that an advertising campaign would have much
effect.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to be the one to say it, but I really don't think so, "
said Bill Gentle, an apple grower in Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers, he said, care about quality and price rather than where
their produce comes from.</TE>
<TE>   "If Washington Fuji apples are priced at 69 cents a pound and
California [apples] at 79 cents a pound, [a television campaign is]
not going to sell one extra pound," Gentle said.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis previewed the ads Thursday at the California State
Fair in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get any better food than the food raised in
California," he said as he stood onstage with growers and farm
industry lobbyists surrounded by crates of fruits and nuts.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it sounds like boosterism. But you know how stringent our
environmental health standards are. No one else in the world has the
high standards we have.''</TE>
<TE>   Produce-importing groups said they would be on the lookout for
such messages in the ads.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with people promoting their products. But
if they try to disparage the competition, they're going to have a
problem," said Lee Frankel, president of the Fresh Produce Assn. of
the Americas, which represents U.S. and Mexican produce growers and
distributors.</TE>
<TE>   Watts said the campaign would not knock other growing areas but
simply would feature Californians talking about why they support
local agriculture. "We're just telling people when they have a choice
to buy California," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel said growers would be better served if the state invested
the $32 million in border controls or developing tastier varieties of
fruit that hold up to shipping.</TE>
<TE>   "I think at the end of the day what really matters to the consumer
is the quality and the taste."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Dan Morain in Sacramento contributed to this
report.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Southwest Airlines Inc., the only major U.S. airline consistently
profitable since the Sept. 11 attacks, said it is capping one-way,
last-minute fares at $299, $100 less than the previous price, as it
tries to grow its long-haul business.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 7 U.S. carrier, which flies mostly short-haul routes and
relies on measures such as quicker turnaround times for its planes to
maintain lower costs than competitors, said no one-way fare will be
higher than $299.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Kelly, Southwest's chief financial officer, said that even
though the airline is profitable, it is seeing declines in profit on
a year-on-year basis and the fare cut is one way to increase
business.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike its biggest rivals, Southwest has turned a profit in every
quarter since Sept. 11. In the most recent period, it earned $102
million. Southwest shares rose 38 cents to $15.23 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ciena Corp., the third-biggest U.S. maker of fiber-optic network
equipment, reported a quarterly net loss as sales tumbled 89% to
their lowest level since the company's 1997 initial public offering.</LD>
<LD>   The loss in its third quarter ended July 31 was $160 million, or
42 cents a share, contrasted with net income of $5.7 million, or 2
cents, a year earlier. Sales slid to $50 million from $458.1 million.</LD>
<LD>   Ciena said revenue would be unchanged or rise slightly this
quarter from the third period, missing analysts' forecasts. Ciena has
shed costs in a bid to break even with quarterly sales of $300
million.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Gary Smith said he wasn't sure when he would meet
that goal.</TE>
<TE>   Ciena said it ran through $87.7 million in cash in the third
quarter and will lose an additional $145 million to $155 million this
period. The decline will continue through fiscal 2003, the Linthicum,
Md.-based firm said.</TE>
<TE>   Ciena shares fell 37 cents to $4.12 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<LD>Digital video recorder maker TiVo Inc. reported a smaller net loss
for its second quarter as revenue grew sharply and said it would
restate some results from fiscal 2002.</LD>
<LD>   The company also raised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2003 and
lowered its operating-loss estimate for the year.</LD>
<LD>   San Jose-based TiVo reported a net loss of $3 million, or 6 cents
a share, for the second quarter, compared with a year-earlier net
loss of $34.5 million, or 82 cents. Analysts were expecting an
18-cent loss.</LD>
<TE>   The company added 42,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing the
total to 464,000. Revenue jumped to $23.9 million from $4.1 million a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   TiVo, which switched independent auditors in May from Arthur
Andersen to KPMG, also said a re-audit of its fiscal year 2000
results found accounting errors in non-operating and non-cash items
for the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31. The adjustments will not affect
its reported cash, revenue or operating losses, the company said.</TE>

<HD>Former NBC Exec Said to Be Choice of Academy</HD>
<DH>Television: Todd Leavitt reportedly has been selected as
chief operating officer of the organization behind the Emmy Awards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences is said to have chosen Todd
Leavitt, a former NBC executive, as its new chief operating
officer--the top staff position at the nonprofit organization that
presents the Emmy Awards.</LD>
<LD>   Sources said Leavitt, who runs a media-consulting company, was
selected Thursday by the group's executive committee after interviews
with three finalists for the position. The senior position at the
academy has been vacant since December, when the executive
committee--in a move opposed by some board members--opted not to
renew the contract of President Jim Chabin.</LD>
<LD>   Insiders said Leavitt has not formally accepted the position and
that it was possible no agreement will be reached.</LD>
<TE>   A sticking point has been that the job description has been pared
since Chabin's tenure, after he reportedly clashed with the academy's
elected chairman, Bryce Zabel.</TE>
<TE>   The academy declined to comment, other than to say that it has "no
deal with anyone" for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Zabel has said the organization wanted to fill the position before
the prime-time Emmy Awards on Sept. 22.</TE>
<TE>   The appointment comes at a crucial time for the academy, which is
negotiating a new licensing deal for the Emmys. The organization is
seeking a major boost in the fee it receives from the networks, which
provides about a third of its annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Leavitt joined NBC as head of its production unit, then known as
NBC Productions, in 1990 and later was named executive vice president
of NBC International.</TE>

<HD>Judge OKs $1.5 Billion in Financing for Adelphia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Dow Jones/Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. received the Bankruptcy Court's
approval Thursday to borrow up to $1.5 billion in new financing while
it tries to restructure.</LD>
<LD>   The debtor-in-possession financing, led by J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.
and Citigroup Inc., represents the second-largest DIP loan ever,
trailing Kmart Corp.'s $2-billion facility this year.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Robert Gerber said at the outset of his ruling that the DIP
facility, aimed at sustaining Adelphia's cable business, also is "one
of the most complex" such loans ever formed because of Adelphia's
capital structure.</LD>
<TE>   Gerber approved the post-bankruptcy financing package--secured by
Adelphia's subscriber value--after a seven-hour hearing, during which
its creditors and shareholders voiced their objections to certain
terms under the DIP agreement while its bank lenders argued for the
necessity of adequate protection of their interests.</TE>
<TE>   One key controversial component of the DIP pact requires Adelphia
to pay $300 million in interest to its banks for the $4.6-billion
loan withdrawn by Adelphia as of the end of April.</TE>
<TE>   Its creditors objected to the payment to the lenders--including
Bank of America Corp., Bank of Montreal, Wachovia Corp., and J.P.
Morgan Chase--as they believe those banks were partly to blame for
the $3.1 billion borrowed by Adelphia's founding Rigas family but
allegedly hidden from the company's books. By that account, only $1.5
billion of the loan was used by the company itself.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations of related-party transactions involving the Rigas
family effectively cut off Adelphia's access to further financing,
which, coupled with massive debt, ultimately pushed the Coudersport,
Pa., company into bankruptcy protection in June.</TE>

<HD>Baseball Sponsors Eyeing the Exits</HD>
<DH>Advertising: With TV viewership of games sliding amid
strike talk, corporations may shift marketing dollars to other
sports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH FRAMMOLINO and MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With strike-wary baseball fans threatening to desert the game, can
advertisers and corporate sponsors be far behind?</LD>
<LD>   The grand old game may soon find out, if preliminary television
ratings and comments from some of its richest supporters are any
indication.</LD>
<LD>   One day after the Major League Players Assn. angered fans from
coast to coast by setting an Aug. 30 strike date, Fox Saturday
Baseball lost 33% of its television audience Aug. 17.</LD>
<TE>   Although not all the loss could be attributed to fan ire,
viewership plummeted to 3 million from 4.2 million the week before.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the game's corporate sponsors are feeling restless as
well, wondering how committed they should be to a sport that is on
the verge of its ninth work stoppage since 1972.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, the senior vice president of advertising and marketing
told me there would be reluctance to renew" in the future, said Kay
Jackson, director of public relations for RadioShack Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The Fort Worth-based electronics giant is one of 18 firms that
paid a collective $170 million to the league last year for the right
to use baseball trademarks and intellectual property in national
marketing campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   For some sponsors, their fees pay for advertising time on national
baseball telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies, such as Miller Brewing Co., which fork over money
for stadium-naming rights and form their own alliances with
individual teams, also may reevaluate their ties if players stay off
the field, said Marc Spiegel, sport marketing public relations
manager for Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's name is on the new stadium in Milwaukee, and it sells
beer and has signage in 10 other parks, he said. That promotional
real estate won't be as valuable if nobody shows up, or if fans are
so upset that they stay away after labor peace is restored.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of new agreements or extending agreements with Major
League Baseball teams, there will be a period that companies will
want to see what kind of impact there was from the strike," Spiegel
said. "You know, from reading things and listening to people, I think
there's a big question mark as to how the game would ... I don't know
if 'recover' is the appropriate word. Will people continue to come
back to the stadium? A lot of people are saying they will not
return."</TE>
<TE>   Dean Bonham, chief executive of the Bonham Group, a Denver-based
sports marketing firm that has negotiated $800 million in sponsorship
agreements for corporate clients, said baseball's lingering labor
woes make it less attractive to corporations looking to put their
name on stadiums and their executives in luxury suites.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much animosity and negative image associated with
baseball today, the value of sponsorship ... is less than the value
you could get investing in other sports," Bonham said.</TE>
<TE>   If the strike happens, Bonham said, he expects it to be a long one
and that it will take years before fan attendance comes back to 2002
levels.</TE>
<TE>   He also predicts that corporate sponsorships, which often include
the use of luxury suites or premium seating, will fall off because
going first-class to the ballpark will be less of a treat.</TE>
<TE>   "The psychology doesn't work if you take them to a virtually empty
ballpark," Bonham said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, sponsors such as Miller are thinking about shifting their
advertising dollars to football telecasts if baseball goes on strike.</TE>
<TE>   RadioShack and PepsiCo Inc., both leaguewide sponsors whose
contracts give them refunds or other compensation for strike-canceled
baseball games, say they are eyeing other sports. But they may be too
late.</TE>
<TE>   Both Fox and CBS executives report more than 85% of commercial
time for pigskin telecasts is sold, leaving little inventory left.</TE>
<TE>   Advertising executives at Walt Disney Co.'s ABC network and ESPN
cable channels declined to comment on whether advertisers were trying
to shift their money.</TE>
<TE>   "If such a scenario happens, then we will take the appropriate
steps to protect our advertising clients," said Alison Lazar,
spokeswoman for ESPN's national advertising sales.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for baseball sponsor Viagra, the virility drug,
couldn't say whether it would redirect its advertising dollars to
other sports. But he said the brand would refrain from running its
ads featuring Texas Ranger star Rafael Palmeiro.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're not playing baseball, it just doesn't seem appropriate
to run them," said Geoffrey Cook, spokesman for the Pfizer Inc. drug.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most affected by any strike would be MasterCard
International, a longtime baseball sponsor that has spent lavishly on
a baseball promotion that asks fans to vote for the game's most
memorable moments.</TE>
<TE>   Fans are being asked to choose among 30 moments, with their top
10--and ultimately their penultimate selection--to be announced
before the fourth game of the 2002 World Series.</TE>
<TE>   And as part of the sweepstakes promotion, selected cardholders
will be given a "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity to share in the
celebration at the championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Now that there may not be a World Series, said Bob Cramer,
MasterCard's vice president for global sponsorship, contingency plans
are being developed to reward winning cardholders and announce the
sport's most memorable moments--during the strike.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Cramer said he's optimistic that the threat of a strike
will disappear and MasterCard won't have to use Plan B. "We have a
couple of options we're preparing, [but] we're not banking on it," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Energy Firms Continue Gains</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Shares of AES, Reliant Resources and Williams
surge as companies sell assets to raise cash and trim debt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Shares of AES Corp., Reliant Resources Inc. and Williams Cos. gained
for a fourth day because the energy firms are successfully
renegotiating loans and selling assets, analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Reliant Resources, the trading arm of Reliant Energy Inc., has
surged 72% this week.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, the second-biggest U.S. pipeline company, has gained
49%. AES, a power producer, is up 54%.</LD>
<TE>   Power producers and energy traders have been selling assets to
raise cash and trim debt amid investigations into sham energy
transactions and accounting.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. energy-trading business slumped after the troubles at
Enron Corp. and a drop in electricity and gas prices.</TE>
<TE>   "We're seeing lenders cooperating, realizing it's in their best
interest to keep these companies floating," said Argus Research
analyst Jeffrey Gildersleeve, who rates shares of AES, Calpine Corp.
and Mirant Inc. "hold" and owns Calpine and Mirant shares. "There had
been speculation that these companies would all go bankrupt in a
great ball of fire."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, based in Tulsa, Okla., this month raised $3.4 billion
from asset sales and new loans to stave off insolvency. Part of the
financing came from billionaire Warren Buffett and Lehman Bros.
Holdings Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said on Wednesday that pipeline and natural-gas
exploration profit will rise this year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Arlington, Va.-based AES on Thursday gained 74 cents, or
31%, to $3.15 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have plunged
91% in the last year, the second-biggest decline among stocks in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index after Dynegy Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Williams shares climbed 16 cents, or 4.4%, to $3.77. Mirant rose
74 cents, or 23%, to $3.95.</TE>
<TE>   Calpine gained 36 cents, or 8.3%, to $4.70. The stock is up 42%
this week.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Houston-based Reliant Resources rose $1.08, or 23%, to
$5.70. All trade on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant Resources' stock has dropped 53% since May 10 after the
company canceled a $500-million bond offering because it had not
disclosed so-called round-trip energy trades.</TE>
<TE>   In such trades, companies simultaneously buy and sell power at the
same price and quantity. The transactions artificially boost revenue
or trading volumes.</TE>

<HD>Prosecutors Face Choices With Fastow</HD>
<DH>News analysis: The government must decide whether to charge
ex-Enron CFO or cut a deal with him to get evidence against
higher-ups, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS and WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once a fast climber up the corporate ladder, former Enron Chief
Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow is headed for a long stretch in
federal prison unless he can provide significant new evidence against
his ex-bosses, Jeffrey K. Skilling and Kenneth L. Lay, legal experts
said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Fastow, 40, has not been charged, but he was portrayed as the
mastermind of three allegedly fraudulent off-the-books partnerships
in court papers filed Wednesday with the felony guilty pleas of
Fastow subordinate Michael J. Kopper.</LD>
<LD>   That means prosecutors probably have enough evidence to charge
Fastow, attorneys say, and the fact that they haven't suggests that
they still are sorting out what Fastow may be able to give them at
the negotiating table.</LD>
<TE>   "It's clear at this point that Mr. Fastow is in the cross hairs of
the government based on the information provided by Mr. Kopper," said
Robert A. Mintz, a former U.S. prosecutor who now is a partner in New
Jersey law firm McCarter &amp; English.</TE>
<TE>   The choice for prosecutors is whether to negotiate a deal with the
former CFO of Enron Corp. to get to Skilling and Lay or to play tough
with Fastow, who may represent their best chance for scoring a big
prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Fastow is able to negotiate a plea bargain with
prosecutors, as Kopper did, the exchange of cooperation for leniency
probably would include some jail time, several experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Kopper, 37, pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and
conspiracy to commit wire fraud and agreed to cooperate in the Enron
investigation and to hand over $12 million in profits from the three
partnerships, called RADR, Chewco and Southampton.</TE>
<TE>   Though Fastow has not been charged, federal prosecutors said they
are moving to seize property and $23.6 million in cash from him and
others, including his wife and brother and several Enron employees
who invested in the questionable partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how much, if any, incriminating data prosecutors
have collected on Skilling, 48, Enron's former chief executive, and
Lay, 60, its former chairman and chief executive. Neither has been
implicated in the partnership schemes, and they were not mentioned in
any of the publicly available documents filed in connection with
Kopper's plea agreement.</TE>
<TE>   However, Skilling and Lay face possible charges of illegal insider
trading if it can be proved that they sold huge chunks of Enron stock
when they knew the partnerships were contributing to the
deterioration of Enron's financial condition. Skilling also could
face perjury charges if his vehement and extensive denials of
wrongdoing in testimony before Congress prove false.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation appears to be following the trail blazed by the
Powers Report, the probe conducted by independent Enron board members
that explored some of the allegedly fraudulent partnerships,
including Chewco and Southampton, said Dennis H. Taylor, a former
Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer now with Shepherd, Smith &amp;
Bebel in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The report, issued in February, sternly criticized Lay as an
absentee manager but also absolved him of wrongdoing with the
partnerships, Taylor said. Skilling also failed to adequately oversee
the partnerships, the report said, and was warned by former Treasurer
Jeffrey McMahon about conflicts of interest in the suspect
partnerships but took no action.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts doubt that government prosecutors would cut a deal
with Fastow given the evidence they appear to have amassed against
him. Throughout their court filings, investigators portray Fastow as
the puppet master of the off-the-books partnerships, listing in
extensive detail the kickbacks that he allegedly received and the
measures that he allegedly put in place to disguise his actions.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been vilified [in court filings] and it would be highly
unlikely, both because of the position he held and what he's alleged
to have done, that they'd be interested in aggressively pursuing a
deal with him," said Walt Brown, a former prosecutor in Los Angeles
who is now a partner at Gray Cary in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors probably would consent to a plea bargain if Fastow
agreed to a harsh penalty, experts said. But if prosecutors pressed
for too long a prison term, Fastow might conclude that he has little
to lose by fighting any charges in court.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also would have to worry about a potential public
relations nightmare if it appeared that they were going lightly on
someone perceived to have been a main culprit in Enron's downfall.</TE>
<TE>   "Cutting any deal is going to subject them to a fair amount of
criticism," said Dan Hedges, a former U.S. attorney in Houston now in
private practice. "As a prosecutor, it would be a bad idea, and
politically it would be suicide."</TE>
<TE>   Any decision allowing Fastow to plead to lesser charges could rest
on whether he could provide substantial evidence implicating his
former superiors, Skilling and Lay. Some experts say it would be much
tougher to convict Skilling and Lay, in part because they were not
involved in the day-to-day activities of the partnerships and could
disclaim any knowledge of Fastow's financing.</TE>
<TE>   Cutting a deal with Fastow therefore poses a risk for prosecutors:
They may not get what they need to convict Skilling or Lay, while
giving up the chance to throw the book at Fastow.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators are probably looking at other mid-level executives,
like Kopper, who were involved or knew about the schemes and could
testify, Mintz said. That way, prosecutors are not relying on a
single star witness, as they did with David B. Duncan, the former
Arthur Andersen auditor who played that role in Andersen's
obstruction-of-justice trial.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw how well that worked," Mintz quipped. Though the
government won a conviction against Andersen, the victory did not
come as easily as many had predicted, and jurors said Duncan's
testimony was not central to their decision.</TE>

<HD>Activists' Lawsuits Target Junk Faxes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of California activists filed a jaw-dropping
$2.2-trillion set of lawsuits against facsimile marketer Fax.com Inc.
on Thursday, saying millions of junk faxes are clogging the nation's
fax machines, jamming communications and possibly endangering lives.</LD>
<LD>   The suits, filed in both state and federal courts in California,
seek class-action status and punitive damages against Aliso
Viejo-based Fax.com; its telecommunications provider, Cox Business
Services, a division of Cox Communications Inc., as well as Fax.com's
advertisers.</LD>
<LD>   "The right to free speech stops at the entrance to my house. You
are not allowed to invade my privacy and to use my resources to send
your message," said Steve Kirsch, a longtime Internet entrepreneur
and philanthropist who announced the lawsuits Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "They are more than a nuisance; in some cases, they can even
endanger public safety," Kirsch said, saying that unwanted faxes have
tied up hospitals' telecommunications systems.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits accuse the named companies of violating federal laws
prohibiting junk faxes--unsolicited advertisements or announcements
that are sent to millions of personal, corporate and government
facsimile machines.</TE>
<TE>   Redefining Progress, an Oakland-based public interest group, filed
the federal case.</TE>
<TE>   Fax.com President Kevin Katz rejected the litigation as "unfounded
and absurd," and said the company had the constitutional right to
advertise by fax.</TE>
<TE>   "I am dismayed by the outrageous charges leveled in the suit,"
Katz said. "To claim that a single fax endangers lives is bizarre."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Atlanta-based Cox declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   But in a decision earlier this month, the Federal Communications
Commission proposed fining Fax.com $5.38 million for sending
unsolicited advertisements by fax, the largest fine ever proposed for
such a violation.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers in the state lawsuit said they would seek a minimum
statutory remedy of $500 per fax from every advertiser who used
Fax.com to send unsolicited ads over the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   "We will seek treble damages of $1,500 per unsolicited fax from
Fax.com and Cox Communications," Kirsch said.</TE>

<HD>Freedom Taps Broadcast Head as Chief Executive</HD>
<DH>Media: The appointment of Alan Bell comes as the company is
beset by divisions among the Hoiles family, which owns the firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Freedom Communications Inc., Irvine-based parent of the Orange County
Register, on Thursday named the head of its broadcasting division as
Freedom chief executive and president.</LD>
<LD>   Alan J. Bell, a broadcasting executive who oversaw the company's
eight television stations, replaces Samuel C. Wolgemuth, who resigned
Thursday under pressure from the Hoiles family, owner of Freedom
Communications.</LD>
<LD>   Wolgemuth, 59, who had served as CEO and president of Freedom
since October 1999 and before that led the company's nearly defunct
magazine division, was blamed for millions of dollars in losses
related to failed magazine ventures.</LD>
<TE>   The appointment of Bell comes as the company is beset by turmoil
and divisions among Hoiles family shareholders. Some family members
wish to cash out some or all of their holdings through a transfer of
ownership from the third generation of family members to the fourth
generation.</TE>
<TE>   Board members and shareholders said they wanted a new chief
executive with more extensive media and business experience. Although
the company's performance has improved this year after a large loss
last year, insiders and members of the Hoiles family say they think
it could do even better with the right management.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom Chairman R. David Threshie called Bell "an experienced and
talented media manager who has spent his entire career in
communications, media and broadcasting."</TE>
<TE>   Robin J. Hardie, a shareholder and fourth-generation family
member, said she "looked forward to working with everyone to carve
out a new path for the company."</TE>
<TE>   Dissident shareholder and director Tim Hoiles, a critic of
Wolgemuth and his predecessor, James N. Rosse, a current board member
and former Stanford University provost, said Bell would act as
steward of Freedom's assets.</TE>
<TE>   "We had two people in a row who didn't know what they were doing,"
said Hoiles, a third-generation family member who is seeking to cash
out his 8.6% stake in Freedom. "Now, we have somebody who does."</TE>
<TE>   At Freedom, Bell headed a broadcast division that included five
CBS and three ABC network affiliates. Before joining Freedom in 1989,
Bell served as president of the Lorimar Broadcast Group and as
assistant general manager of WNEW-TV in New York and KTTV-TV in Los
Angeles. He is a Boston native who attended Harvard Business School.</TE>
<TE>   Bell said in a statement that he hoped to unify the company and
"put everybody on the same page."</TE>
<TE>   "When this happens, and it will, we'll reach new levels of both
profitability and service to the millions of readers and viewers who
depend on us," Bell said.</TE>
<TE>   The privately held firm--which also owns 28 daily newspapers and
37 weeklies and is the nation's 12th-largest newspaper company--lost
$110 million before taxes last year on sales of $803 million,
according to sources familiar with the results. Write-offs for
discontinued magazine and Internet operations accounted for most of
the red ink. One of the magazines, a joint-venture fashion
publication called Mode that targeted full-figured women, shut down
in October.</TE>
<TE>   In the first six months of this year, Freedom said it posted
pre-tax profit of $23 million, contrasted with a $55-million loss in
the same period a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The company continues to grapple with how and whether the group of
about 30 fourth-generation family members can buy out their elders.
The family could sell shares though an initial public offering or in
the private equity market, or sell a stake in the company directly to
a outside party. No transaction is expected to be completed for six
to 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hoiles, who has long maintained that an outright sale of the
entire company would fetch more than any other option, has hinted
that he would ratchet up the pressure if a buyout by the fourth
generation could not be completed. He has threatened to sue his
relatives if his demands to be bought out at a favorable price aren't
met.</TE>

<LD>Soybean futures fell again Thursday after more than 10 inches of rain
drenched parts of the Midwest, boosting prospects for the soybean
harvest after plants were damaged by months of drought.</LD>
<LD>   The third storm in a week dumped rain on parched fields from Iowa
to Michigan, the National Weather Service said. Soybean prices have
fallen almost 9% since Aug. 14 because the rains arrived as plants
were entering the crucial stage in which they produce oilseeds.</LD>
<LD>   "Rains like this can turn a damaged bean crop around pretty
quick," said Joe Victor, a grain analyst at Allendale Inc., a
McHenry, Ill.-based farm research company. "We may be hauling a lot
more bushels of beans out of those fields than we were expecting."</LD>
<TE>   Soybeans for delivery in November, after the harvest, fell 3.5
cents, or 0.6%, to $5.378 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
fourth decline in five sessions. Soybean futures have declined 4.6%
so far this week and are on track for their biggest weekly decline
since June 21. Still, prices are up 27% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Daily rainfall records were broken in Dubuque, Iowa, and Rockford,
Ill., and more rain is expected through tonight, the Weather Service
said.</TE>
<TE>   The rain will help soybean plants fill pods with oilseeds, which
are crushed to make vegetable oil and animal feed, analysts said.
Dry, hot weather slowed plant growth in June and July and threatened
to reduce the number of pods produced by each plant in August.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture lowered its estimate
for this year's soybean harvest by 8.1% from the month-ago estimate
to 2.63 billion bushels, which would be the smallest crop since 1996.
Drought conditions persist in Nebraska, South Dakota, Ohio and
Kansas, the National Drought Mitigation Center said before trading
opened.</TE>

<HD>Golden State Shareholders OK Takeover</HD>
<DH>Mergers: Nearly 90% approve the purchase by Citigroup
despite a stock drop that cuts the value of the deal to $4.9 billion
from $5.8 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE STEIN</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Golden State Bancorp Inc. shareholders Thursday backed Citigroup
Inc.'s planned $4.9-billion takeover of the second-largest U.S.
thrift, which would almost double the number of U.S. branches of the
world's largest financial services company.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company's shareholders voted 87.4% in
favor of the purchase. Voting against were 0.6%, and the remainder
abstained, Golden State said. Ronald Perelman, the largest Golden
State shareholder, with about a 31% stake, was among those backing
Citigroup.</LD>
<LD>   Chairman Gerald J. Ford defended the sale after Citigroup stock
dropped 20% since the takeover was announced May 21. The share
decline cut the value of the deal from an initial $5.8 billion.</LD>
<TE>   "I still think this is a good deal," Ford told shareholders. "All
shareholders are disappointed in market conditions generally. We may
have a higher premium today than were we traded independent of this
agreement."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Golden State, parent of California Federal Bank, rose 40
cents to $35.67 on the New York Stock Exchange. Citigroup shares on
the NYSE climbed 83 cents to $35.18, leading the 24-member
Philadelphia KBW index of large U.S. banks and thrifts.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase would add 352 branches, 8,800 employees and $25
billion in deposits to Citigroup's 424-branch network in the U.S.,
boosting the bank's domestic market share to 4.2% from 3.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup also would gain 500 automated teller machines and a home
lending operation that made $26 billion in mortgages in 2001 while
servicing $89 billion in home loans for other lenders.</TE>
<TE>   The bank's share of deposits in California would grow to 5.8% from
1.3%, ranking Citigroup behind Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo &amp;
Co. and Washington Mutual Inc., which have a combined 48% of the
state's deposits. California's banks have $492 billion of deposits,
more than any other state in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The two banks expect to complete the deal by Sept. 30, pending
approval from federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Some shareholders challenged the transaction before the vote took
place at a San Francisco Hyatt Regency hotel, where half the 84 seats
set up for Golden State shareholders were vacant.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the worst deals I've seen," said Charles Lutz, a
shareholder from Lafayette, Calif. "It's basically $5 less than when
the deal was announced."</TE>
<TE>   Golden State shareholder V.N. Vukasia said he is confident
Citigroup shares would rise.</TE>
<TE>   "I hold all my shares for the long term," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors holding 64.2% of the San Francisco-based thrift chose to
receive Citigroup stock rather than cash in the transaction,
including Perelman, chairman of Revlon Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The demand for stock exceeded a cap Citigroup had set, meaning
that investors would get a combination of shares and cash, or 0.821
of a Citigroup common share and $7.47 in cash for each Golden State
share, the companies said.</TE>

<HD>Dow Advances Past 9,000; S&amp;P Crosses Key Threshold</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Another afternoon rally drove stocks broadly higher Thursday, pushing
the Dow Jones industrial average to its first close above 9,000 in
seven weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The advance left the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index up more than 20%
from its five-year low reached on July 23. By some yardsticks,
crossing that threshold marks the start of a new bull market--though
many analysts say it is far too early to make that claim.</LD>
<LD>   In other trading, the dollar surged against the yen and the euro,
suggesting that foreign investors may be returning to U.S. stocks.
Treasury bond yields continued to rebound.</LD>
<TE>   On Wall Street, the Dow industrials rose 96.41 points, or 1.1%, to
9,053.64, the first finish above 9,000 since July 9.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 index gained 13.34 points, or 1.4%, to 962.70, and the
Nasdaq composite was up 13.70 points, or 1%, to 1,422.95.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks meandered for much of the session before buyers took
control in the final 90 minutes. Winners topped losers by about 2 to
1 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 10 to 7 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Blue chips leading the market higher included drug firms Johnson &amp;
Johnson, up $1.31 to $56.20, and Eli Lilly, up $4.03 to $62.15;
General Motors, up $1.31 to $49.32; and American Express, up $1.16 to
$38.19.</TE>
<TE>   At Thursday's close, the S&amp;P 500 is up 20.7% since it bottomed at
797.70 on July 23. The Dow is up 17.5% since then and Nasdaq is up
15.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts judge a 20% rise from an index's low to constitute
the beginning of a new bull move.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our thought that this is probably the start of the recovery
and not just a bear-market rally," said Chris Orndorff, head of
equities at Payden &amp; Rygel, a Los Angeles money management firm.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that stock prices respond to earnings,"
Orndorff said, "and we think earnings have bottomed out and are
finally starting to recover."</TE>
<TE>   Profit for the S&amp;P 500 companies overall rose in the second
quarter, the first year-over-year gain since the fourth quarter of
2000, according to earnings-tracker Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Orndorff warned, "markets rarely move in a straight
line," so a "re-test" of the July 23 lows is possible, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts are emphatic that the rebound since late July is
nothing more than a temporary respite within an ongoing bear market.</TE>
<TE>   John McGinley, editor of Technical Trends newsletter in Wilton,
Conn., said he is suspicious "in spades" about the rally. He said the
advance has occurred amid weak trading volume compared with the
activity in June and July, when share prices were sinking amid heavy
volume.</TE>
<TE>   In judging the importance of market phases, "There's only one kind
of volume to rely on, and that's increased volume," McGinley said. He
expects key indexes to fall below their July 23 levels, if not in the
next four months then in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the smart money stays on the sidelines for now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One big brokerage, CS First Boston, told clients Thursday to trim
stock holdings in light of the recent rally. The firm advised fund
managers to cut equities to 62% of total assets, down from 65%, and
boost cash holdings to 7% from 4%, while keeping bonds at 31%.</TE>
<TE>   One closely watched measure of investor sentiment turned more
downbeat this week: Investors Intelligence's weekly poll of
investment newsletter editors showed that 40% are bearish on the
market outlook, up from 37.4% the previous week. The bullish
percentage fell to 36.7% from 38.5%, while those who are expecting a
modest market pullback, at worst, eased to 23.3% from 24.1%.</TE>
<TE>   But "contrarian" analysts say the higher level of caution could be
bullish in the near term because the market often does its best to
confound the majority viewpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Another potentially positive sign for stocks is the dollar's
strength. It closed at 119.89 yen on Thursday, up from 118.45 on
Wednesday, while the euro fell to 97 cents from 97.9 cents. A rising
dollar can mean that foreign money is pushing into U.S. assets.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said foreigners may be hunting for U.S. corporate
bonds, as issuance of new bonds continues to resurge this week.</TE>
<TE>   Hunger for those securities also may be luring money from
lower-yielding Treasury securities. The yield on the benchmark
10-year T-note rose to 4.32% on Thursday, up from 4.20% on Wednesday
and the highest in a week.</TE>

<HD>Economy Rooted in Factory Plants</HD>
<DH>Manufacturing things, not just designing them, is vital to
state's future, study says</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California is renowned as a hotbed of creativity and design. But its
future in the new economy might well depend on retaining its
traditional expertise in manufacturing, said a report released
Thursday by the Santa Monica-based Milken Institute that examines the
economic role of the industrial sector.</LD>
<LD>   By far the nation's largest manufacturing state, California is
home to industries that employ more than 1.8 million people. Yet the
Golden State, like the rest of the country, is fighting the
perception that waning factory jobs are the inevitable byproduct of a
high-tech era.</LD>
<LD>   The reality is that one cannot exist without the other, said
Milken economist Ross DeVol, who is trying to debunk the notion that
a place such as Silicon Valley can continue to thrive on bright ideas
alone.</LD>
<TE>   Much of the wealth created in California from the technology
revolution has come not just from the invention and design of
computers, software and other high-tech products but from the
manufacture and export of these tangible goods. Gross state product
generated by California's high-tech manufacturing was $131 billion in
2001; computers and electronic products accounted for about half of
the state's exports last year.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing is inexorably linked to innovation and thus critical
to the ongoing vitality of any high-tech center, DeVol said. The
report notes that Silicon Valley's greatest technical innovation--the
microprocessor--was the result of a manufacturing improvement,
setting the stage for the knowledge-based economy the Bay Area knows
today.</TE>
<TE>   "To remain on the leading edge, [California] must produce things,
not just design them," said DeVol, the Milken Institute's director of
regional and demographic studies. "But we're at risk of losing our
edge."</TE>
<TE>   Since May 2000, California has shed more than 115,000
manufacturing jobs, many of them in the lucrative technology sector.
Although some of these jobs will return when the tech sector
rebounds, others won't because of structural changes in the industry.
Stung by falling profits and unlikely to see revenue rebound to the
frenzied levels of the late '90s any time soon, high-tech
manufacturers such as Milpitas, Calif.-based contract manufacturer
Solectron Corp. are cutting jobs here while expanding operations
offshore.</TE>
<TE>   The state faces huge challenges in retaining high-tech production
as well as other types of manufacturing, said Jack Stewart, president
of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn., which funded
the Milken study. The state's business costs are among the highest in
the nation. California's tax structure motivates sales-tax hungry
communities to favor big-box retailers and car dealerships over
factories. And the state's anti-business image hasn't helped matters.
Companies that once viewed a California address as a sign of success
are expanding elsewhere. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel Corp., for
example, hasn't built a factory in the state since the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high. According to the Milken study, California's
average manufacturing wage and salary income was $54,600 in
2000--among the highest in the nation. Because of manufacturing's
high multiplier effect, every time a factory job is lost in
California, an additional 2.5 jobs are lost in other sectors that
supplied goods and services to the plants and their employees.
Manufacturing exports account for 9.4% of California's gross state
product, and manufacturing jobs have long provided immigrants and
minorities with a springboard into the middle class.</TE>
<TE>   Although DeVol acknowledged that California will never become the
lowest-cost location to put a factory, he said there are a number of
things that policymakers can do to make the state more attractive to
manufacturers, from lowering some business taxes to streamlining
regulations and the like.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the biggest challenge may be educating lawmakers that
California's rise in the new economy has its roots firmly on the
factory floor.</TE>
<TE>   "People forget that Silicon Valley is still largely about
manufacturing," DeVol said.</TE>

<HD>SureBeam Opens Irradiation Facility</HD>
<DH>Food: Germ-zapping center in Vernon will serve state's
meat, produce industries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Californians might get their first taste of irradiated fresh ground
beef in coming months.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego-based SureBeam Corp., a maker of electronic germ-zapping
equipment, opened an irradiation service center in Vernon on Thursday
for California's huge meat and produce industries.</LD>
<LD>   The 32,000-square-foot plant--the third of its kind in the
nation--would be able to process 300 million pounds of food annually,
starting with packaged hamburger and ultimately produce and cooked
foods, if those uses are approved by federal regulators.</LD>
<TE>   SureBeam's process exposes food to controlled levels of ionizing
radiation from electrons to kill germs. And in some cases, the
company uses radiation from X-rays.</TE>
<TE>   SureBeam hasn't signed any major customers for the center, at
least none that company officials would talk about.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts expect the firm to eventually treat meat for a number
of regional supermarket and fast-food chains that want to protect
their products, and themselves, against the threat of E. coli and
other dangerous germs.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to handle recalls," said analyst Stephen Levenson
of Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. "They want to insulate
themselves from the liability."</TE>
<TE>   Only a few large companies are buying irradiated meat, mostly on a
limited basis.</TE>
<TE>   The SureBeam center shouldn't lack for business, company officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "[California] is No. 1 in growing ... and No. 2 in meat
processing," said Larry Oberkfell, SureBeam chairman and chief
executive. "We have a lot of customers that are nationally based that
have plants in the West."</TE>
<TE>   SureBeam shares fell 1 cent to $2.44 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Prince Says Saudis Not Selling U.S. Holdings</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Nephew of King Fahd disputes report of panic
after lawsuit by relatives of Sept. 11 attack victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saudi billionaire Prince Al Waleed ibn Talal ibn Abdulaziz al Saud
denied Thursday that there was "panic selling" by Saudis of U.S.
investments, as had been reported, of $200 billion in reaction to
perceived anti-Saudi sentiment.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't believe at all there is a panic selling and an outflow
from the United States," Al Waleed said, after a report Wednesday by
the London-based Financial Times that Saudis had been exiting the
U.S. market.</LD>
<LD>   Saudi bankers and analysts also told Reuters they had seen no
evidence of massive capital flight from the United States, although
new investments could be harmed by the perceived U.S. hostility
toward Saudi Arabia.</LD>
<TE>   But a senior Saudi source said that some Arab investors are
starting to question the wisdom of leaving their U.S. investments
vulnerable to any potential legal action, and need reassurance that
their funds would not be seized as the result of a court action.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi individuals and institutions have been named in a
$1-trillion lawsuit by families of Sept. 11 victims for allegedly
funding terrorism. The suit accuses three Saudi princes, several
Saudi and other foreign banks and Sudan's government of funding key
suspect Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Al Waleed, commenting on the lawsuit to the Qatar-based satellite
station Al Jazeera, said the suit had no connection to U.S.
government policy and that it was "based on unrealistic grounds and
at the end of the day it will evaporate."</TE>
<TE>   The Financial Times report, which quoted analysts, said the level
of Saudi investment in the United States was $400 billion to $600
billion. Some other bankers estimate total Saudi overseas investment
at $500 billion to $700 billion, but official figures for the scale
of foreign Saudi investment are not available.</TE>
<TE>   Al Waleed, one of the world's richest men and a nephew of Saudi
Arabia's King Fahd, said a wholesale exit by Saudi investors in
recent months would not have made sense, given the market's depressed
state.</TE>
<TE>   Al Waleed said he had no plans to divest any of his U.S. holdings,
which include a stake in Citigroup Inc. worth several billion
dollars.</TE>

<HD>Williams-Sonoma Profit Up but Sales Forecast Cut</HD>
<DH>Retail: The company cites strength at its growing Pottery
Barn chain, which has caught shoppers' attention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Williams-Sonoma Inc. said Thursday that its quarterly profit surged
on tighter inventory controls and fewer markdowns, but a conservative
sales forecast weighed on the shares.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company, known for its high-end namesake
stores and the Pottery Barn chain, cut its projections for
third-quarter sales at stores open at least a year after a sluggish
July. It kept its earnings estimate unchanged.</LD>
<LD>   Williams-Sonoma's stock fell $1.65, or 6%, to $25 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</LD>
<TE>   Chief Executive Dale Hilpert said the company would start bulking
up inventories again after months of restraint amid skittish consumer
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   But it is approaching the rest of the year with caution, he said,
citing uncertainty over how the anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks and a shorter Christmas shopping season this year will affect
business.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be nimble and responsive, but we're not predicting a
bad economy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For the second quarter, Williams-Sonoma reported net income of
$14.1 million, or 12 cents a share, up from $1.4 million, or 1 cent a
share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue grew 16% to $495.6 million, helped by new stores. Sales at
stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, were little changed
from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Along with cost controls and improved shipping processes, the
company cited strength at its growing 151-store Pottery Barn chain,
which has caught shoppers' attention over the last year with its
sleek-yet-homey housewares and furniture.</TE>
<TE>   While Williams-Sonoma stores saw a 1.7% drop in same-store sales
in the quarter, Pottery Barn's crept up 1.3%.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which runs 445 stores, expanded the number by about
13% over the last year as demand for home furnishings has flourished
with lower mortgage rates fueling a U.S. housing boom.</TE>
<TE>   It expects to add 30 more stores by the end of the fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing is these [home furnishings] companies continue
to benefit from housing strength," analyst Kristine Koerber of WR
Hambrecht &amp; Co. said.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the retailer boosted its earnings forecast for the second
quarter to 7 cents to 8 cents a share from 4 cents to 5 cents
previously. Analysts then ratcheted up estimates to an average of 8
cents from 5 cents a share, according to Thomson First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it expected same-store sales growth of 2% to 4%
in the third quarter, down from earlier estimates of 5% to 6.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts, on average, expect third-quarter earnings of 10 cents a
share and full-year earnings of 99 cents a share, according to
Thomson First Call.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Approves Last Set of Steel Tariff Waivers</HD>
<DH>Trade: Import duties are excluded on 178 more products in
the Bush administration's attempt to avert a backlash against
American goods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration approved a seventh and final round of steel
tariff exclusions Thursday, waiving import duties on 178 products and
further defusing the threat of a trade war with Europe and Japan.</LD>
<LD>   The latest batch of waivers raises to 727 the number of products
that have been exempted from the stiff tariffs imposed by President
Bush to give ailing U.S. steel manufacturers more time to clean up
their balance sheets and consolidate their operations.</LD>
<LD>   Altogether, the administration has excluded 3.2 million tons of
annual imports, or about one-quarter of shipments initially subject
to Bush's "safeguard" action. The protective tariffs range from 8% to
30% and will remain in effect for up to three years.</LD>
<TE>   Steel companies criticized the exclusions as excessive, while
steel-consuming industries said they were not extensive enough.
Industry experts predicted that the effect on U.S. steel prices would
be minimal but their political effect substantial.</TE>
<TE>   "The primary objective of the exemptions was to assure domestic
steel buyers they're not being completely left out of the calculus,
and to get foreign suppliers to abandon or forestall their threats of
immediate retaliation," said Ben Goodrich, a global steel analyst at
the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "There's not
a whole lot of evidence that they applied really strict economic
criteria to them."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the exclusions apply to specialty products that are not
made in sufficient quantity by U.S. manufacturers to satisfy domestic
demand, such as "cold-rolled steel for flux-cored welding rods" and
"hot-rolled bar used for manufacture of scrap recycling knives." Some
cover imports of basic steel slab that is transformed into other
products by U.S. mills.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's review of more than 1,300 waiver applications
was "an extraordinarily rigorous process," involving hundreds of
meetings with steel manufacturers and consumers, said a U.S. trade
official who briefed reporters on the condition he not be identified
by name.</TE>
<TE>   The official said the exclusions were consistent with the
administration's objective of giving U.S. steel manufacturers "a
limited amount of breathing space" to regroup. "It is important that
they move forward aggressively in their restructuring," he said. "We
feel they understand that."</TE>
<TE>   American steel manufacturers, particularly the big integrated
producers that transform iron ore into finished sheet, bar, rod and
wire, have struggled to stay afloat in an industry characterized by
chronic overproduction around the world and high production costs in
the United States. More than 30 U.S. steelmakers have filed for
bankruptcy protection in the last five years; more than 20 mills have
stopped production.</TE>
<TE>   Bush imposed the temporary tariffs March 5 under a trade law
provision designed to protect U.S. industries whose survival is
threatened by surging imports. The tariffs were widely viewed as a
bid to secure votes for Republican candidates in the Steel Belt
states of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio, but they provoked
howls of protest from steel-consuming industries in the Rust Belt and
from steel manufacturers overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as soon as it imposed the tariffs, the administration began
processing requests for exclusions. The damage-control strategy
appears to have worked. Industry analysts said the waivers were
partly responsible for a decision by the European Union to rescind
threats of immediate retaliation and to await a ruling by the World
Trade Organization on the legality of the U.S. tariffs.</TE>
<TE>   Although they did not have exact figures, U.S. officials confirmed
that most of the exclusions apply to products made in Europe and
Japan, where the political opposition to the U.S. tariffs was
strongest.</TE>
<TE>   Response to the seventh set of waivers was mixed. A coalition of
U.S. steel companies said it wished the administration had not
approved the latest group of exclusions, but expressed relief that
the process was over.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed that a significant number of exclusions were
granted over the objections of the domestic industry," said American
Iron and Steel Institute spokeswoman Nancy Gravatt in Washington.
U.S. steelmakers had opposed 104 of the 178 waiver applications
approved Thursday, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But the exclusions, although helpful, will not do enough to
protect steel-consuming firms from price increases and supply
shortages caused by the president's tariffs, said Christopher Howell,
government affairs director for the Precision Metalforming Assn. in
Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what the intent was, but I'm afraid small businesses
got the short stick again," said Howell, whose trade group represents
manufacturers of parts for auto companies and other industries. "I
don't know how much worse it can get."</TE>
<TE>   The prices of many benchmark steel products have shot up 30% or
more this year, considerably more than the administration predicted
when it imposed the import tariffs in March. Benchmark hot-rolled
steel, for example, has jumped from $210 a ton in December to $400 a
ton in the latest survey conducted by Purchasing Magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Industry experts say other forces are contributing to the price
hikes, but their assurances have provided little comfort to steel
buyers. This month, Metaldyne Corp. Chief Executive Tim Leuliette
urged fellow parts suppliers to rise up in opposition to steel
tariffs and cost containment pressures, even if it meant "bringing
Detroit to its knees."</TE>

<HD>Wet Seal Shares Fall 11% on Sluggish Sales Forecast</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Retailer says it came close to meeting analysts'
expectations for the second quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of trendy apparel retailer Wet Seal Inc. tumbled almost 11% on
Thursday after the Orange County company said it expects sales at
established stores to be flat in the third quarter and perhaps
sluggish for the rest of the year.</LD>
<LD>   Wet Seal, which in addition to its signature stores operates Arden
B., Contempo Casual and Zutopia stores, also said it came close to
meeting analysts' earnings expectations for the second quarter ended
Aug. 3 despite disappointing sales in July.</LD>
<LD>   Profit was almost $3.7 million, or 12 cents a share, compared with
nearly $3.6 million, or 12 cents, in the comparable period last year.
The numbers are adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock split in May. A
consensus of analysts from Thomson First Call expected earnings of 13
cents.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue increased 8% to $146.2 million compared with the same
quarter last year. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key
industry indicator because it excludes new and closed stores, rose
1.6% for the 13-week period.</TE>
<TE>   Based on current trends, these comparable store sales could drop
10% to 15% this month, said the Foothill Ranch-based company.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Kathy
Bronstein said lean inventory probably hurt sales in July. Wet Seal
stores, for example, ran short of some clothing categories, such as
skirts, shorts and capris, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were down enough that I think we missed sales," Bronstein
said.</TE>
<TE>   Retailers generally are struggling to balance how much clothing to
stock as consumers seem to be more careful about spending. Too much
inventory can prompt huge markdowns to clear shelves, which hurts
profits.</TE>
<TE>   Wet Seal's stock closed Thursday at $11.01, down $1.31, on Nasdaq.
Some of the selling may have been the result of institutional
investors' disappointment that the company did not announce plans to
repurchase shares of its stock, which has lost 30% of its value this
year, said Christopher Krueger, an analyst with Dougherty &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Investors probably also were turned off by the company's less than
gung-ho projections for the rest of the year, he said. Wet Seal said
it expects flat comparable store sales for the third quarter, given
the current business trend. If that happens, earnings in the last
quarter would be 49 cents to 53 cents a share, compared with 49 cents
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of Thursday's news, Krueger said he has lowered his
per-share earnings expectations to $1.11 from $1.21 for the year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just simply another teen retailer having a tough time," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wet Seal also announced that it is promoting Susan O'Toole to
president of the Wet Seal division. O'Toole, who was instrumental in
building the Limited Too clothing chain for girls, was hired earlier
this year to head Wet Seal's smaller Zutopia division, which sells to
younger girls.</TE>

<LD>Recent comments by Bush administration officials on Iraq and
President Saddam Hussein:</LD>
<LD>   "We cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best.
We cannot put our faith in the word of tyrants who solemnly sign
nonproliferation treaties, and then systemically break them....</LD>
<LD>   We must take the battle to the enemy, disrupt his plans, and
confront the worst threats before they emerge. In the world we have
entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.... Our
security will require all Americans to be forward-looking and
resolute, to be ready for preemptive action when necessary to defend
our liberty and to defend our lives."</LD>
<TE>   President Bush, West Point, N.Y., June 1</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "It's the stated policy of this government to have a regime change
[in Iraq]. And it hasn't changed. And we'll use all tools at our
disposal to do so.... And there [are] different ways to do it....</TE>
<TE>   I'm a patient person ... but I do firmly believe that the world
will be safer and more peaceful if there's a regime change in that
government."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, White House, July 8</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Are there Al Qaeda in Iraq? Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary</TE>
<TE>   Donald H. Rumsfeld, Pentagon, July 30</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "We fight against a shadowy network that hides in many nations,
and has revealed its intention to gain and use weapons of mass
destruction. We're threatened by regimes that have sought these
ultimate weapons, and hide their weapons programs from the eyes of
the world. The same regimes have shown their true nature by torturing
and butchering their own people....</TE>
<TE>   Against such enemies, we cannot sit quietly and hope for the best.
To ignore this mounting danger is to invite it. America must act
against these terrible threats before they're fully formed. We will
use diplomacy when possible, and force when necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Bush, Fort Drum, N.Y., July 19</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "In our discussions with our friends around the world, I cannot
remember a single one who has not said, 'Of course, the world would
be better off without this man [Hussein] in power.' There are those
who are concerned about how to do it, and the consequences....</TE>
<TE>   He also has links to international terrorism. There is growing
evidence that that includes organizations like Al Qaeda. That would
be a mortal threat to the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Senior U.S. official, interview</TE>
<TE>   with The Times published Aug. 2</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Wouldn't it be a wonderful thing if Iraq were similar to

<HD>Anthrax Tests Negative at 2 N.J. Mail Facilities</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Tests for the deadly anthrax bacteria found no sign of spores at two
mail facilities in New Jersey, the U.S. Postal Service said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The tests were ordered after a mailbox in Princeton, N.J., was
found earlier this month to contain a trace amount of anthrax. The
Postal Service has said authorities do not believe there is any
health risk.</LD>
<LD>   "We have results for the Monmouth and Kilmer processing centers.
They are negative," said Postal Service spokeswoman Diane Todd.</LD>
<TE>   The two facilities handle mail from the Princeton mailbox. That
mail previously would have gone to the postal center in Hamilton,
N.J., which processed several anthrax-laced letters last year and
remains shut.</TE>
<TE>   Officials tested three other postal centers in New Jersey this
week that also handled mail from the Princeton mailbox. Results are
expected early next week, the Postal Service said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   In the nation, five people have died and 13 others were made ill,
including five New Jersey postal workers.</TE>
<TE>   No arrests have been made despite a $2.5-million reward.</TE>

<HD>Parents Keep Kids Home in Protest of School Board</HD>
<DH>Boycott: Officials put two seats to a vote after Marianna,
Ark., district lines are redrawn. Foes want all seven on ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MARIANNA, Ark.</DL>
<LD>The schools were open in this impoverished Mississippi Delta district
and teachers held classes. Most kids, though, didn't attend.</LD>
<LD>   Their parents wouldn't let them.</LD>
<LD>   For a fourth day Thursday, most parents in the Lee County School
District kept their kids at home to protest what they see as an
unfair school board election system.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a painful situation," said Carolyn Elliott, a spokeswoman
for the organizers, who have sued the district to put all seven board
seats--instead of just two--up for a vote at next month's elections.</TE>
<TE>   Only 465 of the district's 1,750 students attended classes
Thursday. On Monday, the first day of school, just 181 showed up.</TE>
<TE>   Marianna, population 5,181, is one of the poorest communities in
the state. Census figures last year showed per capita income at
$10,253--ranking the town 108th of Arkansas' 110 communities with
1,000 or more households.</TE>
<TE>   Boycott organizers say state law requires all school districts
with a 10% or greater population of minorities to redraw their school
boards and hold elections for all board seats after every census.</TE>
<TE>   Board members redrew the districts according to the 2000 census as
required, but said only two seats that were already up for election
Sept. 17 should be contested.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say school officials violated federal law regarding
zoning for school board positions and violated the civil rights of
those who filed to run for the five other board positions.</TE>
<TE>   There also have been accusations of racial bias. Although 90% of
the school district's students are black, five of the seven board
members are white. The Census 2000 figures said 57.2% of Lee County
is black.</TE>
<TE>   Board member Phylista Stanley, who is black, said the race of
board members is not the root of the community discord, though
boycott organizers complain of race-based preferential treatment.</TE>
<TE>   A circuit judge delayed a hearing on the lawsuit Wednesday after a
temporary order declaring all seven seats open was issued a day
before. Community members said the boycott would likely continue
until the election issue is resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday, Gov. Mike Huckabee urged parents in this community
about 100 miles east of Little Rock not to put their children in the
middle of a matter that's best left to the courts.</TE>
<TE>   "Holding children out of school is not helpful to the children,"
Huckabee said. "We are urging parents to get their children back in
school and let the process of the courts determine the direction of
the school board."</TE>

<HD>Evidence Shows Asteroid Hit Earth 3.5 Billion Years Ago</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Nearly 3.5 billion years ago, when the Earth was just a billion years
old, a huge asteroid slammed into the young planet and produced a
global rain of glass droplets and towering tidal waves that raced
around the world, according to an analysis of ancient rocks.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers at Stanford University and Louisiana State University
say samples collected from deposits in South Africa and Australia
show that a space rock about 12 miles wide smashed into the Earth and
sent into the atmosphere millions of tons of dust and vaporized rock.</LD>
<LD>   The rock samples have been age-dated at 3.47 billion years old and
are the oldest known evidence of an asteroid impact on the Earth,
said Donald R. Lowe, a researcher at Stanford University and a senior
author of the study appearing today in the journal Science.</LD>
<TE>   Lowe said that although evidence of the impact was found in
Australia and South Africa, the movement of the Earth crust in the
billions of years since has wiped out any crater created by the
asteroid. It did leave a concentrated layer of iridium, a chemical
common in space rocks but rare on Earth.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the oldest record of an asteroid impact ever found on
Earth," said Gary R. Byerly, a professor of geology at LSU and
co-author of the study.</TE>
<TE>   He said the primitive Earth was heavily bombarded earlier in its
history, but evidence of those events has been erased by geologic
changes.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Stanley, a Johns Hopkins University expert on the early
history of Earth, said it is known from other studies that the early
solar system was filled with rock and dust left over from the
formation of planets. During the first few hundred million years, he
said, this debris often slammed into the Earth and the other planets.</TE>
<TE>   "We know there was a lot of material that hit the Earth back
then," Stanley said. "What is interesting about this work is that
they were able to find evidence from an impact that far back."</TE>
<TE>   Lowe said the asteroid that hit Earth 3.47 billion years ago was
about twice the size of the 6-mile-wide space rock that struck 65
million years ago and killed off the dinosaurs. When the earlier
crash occurred, bacteria were the only forms of life on the planet,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   And it is a good thing: Lowe said anything larger than microbes
would almost certainly have been wiped out.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe said that as the huge asteroid sped toward the Earth, it
would have punched a hole through the atmosphere, leaving in its wake
a brief vacuum.</TE>
<TE>   "When the meteor hits the surface, it instantaneously melts and
vaporizes rock and that rock vapor is sucked right back up the hole
into the atmosphere," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the continents were only beginning to form at the time, most
of the Earth was covered with water.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have taken only a second or two for a meteor that's 20
kilometers [12 miles] in diameter to pass through the ocean and
impact the rock beneath," Lowe said. The impact would have created
immense tidal waves--rising perhaps a mile or more in height--that
raced around the globe again and again, scouring the ocean floor and
eroding any bits of dry land, he said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Minneapolis firm is recalling about 717,000 pounds of frozen ground
beef products that were sold nationwide because of possible E. coli
contamination.</LD>
<LD>   GFI American Inc. produced the meat from June 25 to July 16, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday in announcing the recall.</LD>
<LD>   The government has not received any reports of consumers falling
ill from the recalled beef.</LD>
<TE>   The E. coli bacteria is found in the intestinal tracts and feces
of livestock. If it contaminates meat, it can lead to digestive
illnesses, dehydration and death.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, call the USDA meat and poultry hotline at:
(800) 535-4555, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. PDT weekdays.</TE>

<LD>Inspection of all 291 CH 46 Sea Knight helicopters in the Navy and
Marine Corps found only one with a flaw of the kind that triggered a
temporary grounding of the fleet, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The full fleet has been returned to service.</LD>
<LD>   The Navy Air Systems Command ordered the grounding Monday as a
precaution after discovery of a crack in a rotor component of a Sea
Knight at the Cherry Point Marine Corps Air Station in North
Carolina.</LD>
<TE>   A similar problem was found Wednesday in a CH 46 deployed aboard
the amphibious assault ship Belleau Wood in the Persian Gulf area,
said Ward Carroll, a spokesman for the command. The part was replaced
and the chopper was returned to service, along with the rest of the
fleet that underwent inspection, he said.</TE>

<LD>A landlord in Frederick who shot and killed two cats after a tenant
refused to get rid of them was acquitted of felony charges, the first
court test of a new Maryland law designed to stiffen penalties for
animal cruelty.</LD>
<LD>   A judge ruled that Eric Grossnickle destroyed the cats in a
legally acceptable manner when he blasted them with a 12-gauge
shotgun.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't like what he did, but it's not a crime under Maryland
law," Circuit Judge Mary Stepler said.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling left the cats' owner, April Ritch, frustrated and
tearful.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a crime to take somebody's house pets from their home
and shoot them and kill them?" Ritch asked.</TE>
<TE>   Grossnickle was also acquitted of theft but convicted on two
counts of malicious destruction of property, a misdemeanor punishable
by up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine.</TE>

<HD>Bush Unveils Forestry Policy in Oregon</HD>
<DH>Environment: After tour, he calls fire damage 'a crying
shame.' Critics say plan benefits industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CENTRAL POINT, Ore.</DL>
<LD>President Bush challenged critics of his forest policy to stand in
the middle of what had been a forest of Douglas fir and ponderosa
pine--as he did Thursday--"and see firsthand the effects of bad
forest policy."</LD>
<LD>   In woodsy garb of olive green and khaki, the president hiked
through the remains of a section of Squires Peak Forest and then
unveiled a policy intended to make it easier for loggers to remove
kindling--as well as healthy, old trees--without lengthy delays posed
by bureaucracy and courts.</LD>
<LD>   "Had we properly managed our forests," he said, "the devastation
caused would not have been nearly as severe as it has been. It's a
crying shame."</LD>
<TE>   Bush spoke as he toured the burned-out woods near the town of
Ruch, viewing an example of conflicting forest policies: one that
lets the woods grow so dense that they burn furiously out of control,
and a newer approach that thins the forest sufficiently to remove
kindling and saplings, which fuel catastrophic fires.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the forest was charred and barren; part was seared, but
not to the point of devastation.</TE>
<TE>   The question of how to thin the forest has produced angry debate
throughout the West. Bush's efforts to speed loggers' access to the
woods has drawn criticism from environmental groups, which see the
administration's policy as dictated more by concerns about the
interests of logging companies than about forest health.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing wrong with people being able to earn a living off
of effective forest management," the president said. "There are a lot
of people in this part of the state that can't find work because we
don't properly manage our forests."</TE>
<TE>   His tour took him on a dirt and gravel road to an elevation of
3,200 feet on Squires Peak. Along the way, his motorcade passed a
clutch of protesters, one holding a sign reading "More Forest, Less
Bush."</TE>
<TE>   He strolled the remains of the forest. The woods were silent, save
for the sound of his boots on the burned soil.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Central Point, the air was acrid with the smoke of three
fires, including one known as the Biscuit fire, the largest in the
state's history. The fires are burning in southwestern Oregon, within
50 miles of the town.</TE>
<TE>   Under the president's plan, the government would streamline
procedures giving loggers permission to work the forests. This would
lessen the opportunities for opponents to try to block the activities
intended to remove not just the most volatile fuels--underbrush,
deadwood and thin trees--but also some commercially valuable old
pines and firs.</TE>
<TE>   It would remove what the administration called "needless
administrative obstacles." With congressional approval, it would also
remove a legislative provision that officials said "imposed
extraordinary procedural requirements on [U.S.] Forest Service
appeals" of decisions blocking logging plans.</TE>
<TE>   "The procedure requirements of our environmental laws are not
supposed to wreak environmental havoc, and that's what some of them
are doing," said James L. Connaughton, chairman of the president's
Council on Environmental Quality.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout much of the West, forests have grown extremely dense as
a result of reduced logging and policies that for decades demanded
the extinction as quickly as possible of all fires. That approach
allowed a massive buildup on the forest floor of brush and other
fuels.</TE>
<TE>   Some forests are said by administration officials to be 15 times
more dense than they were a century ago. Forests that 100 years ago
could be traversed on foot are now too densely packed to cross,
Connaughton said.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been more fires, burning at such high temperatures
that they sterilize the forest floor, preventing growth for years
rather than allowing the regeneration that would follow more
conventional fires.</TE>
<TE>   In the current fire season, more than 6 million acres have burned,
Connaughton said. He said 281 fires began burning Wednesday,
including five of more than 100 acres.</TE>
<TE>   As Bush arrived in Oregon from his home near Crawford, Texas, Air
Force One flew low over burning forest, banking to provide a better
view. At some points, the smoke obscured the forests. At others,
patches of burned woods, green trees and smoldering fire could be
seen, and a firefighting airplane flew below the president's craft.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists critical of the Bush policy have focused as much
on the changes in forest management processes as on the decisions to
give loggers greater access to the forests.</TE>
<TE>   Their concern is that limits on the extent to which they could
appeal Forest Service decisions would have a far-reaching impact on a
tool they have used to delay for years activities they fear will
damage ecosystems. Their efforts are built on the legal and
administrative procedures established in the National Environmental
Protection Act.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is whether they are using fire as a means to go at"
the National Environmental Protection Act, said Jennifer Coates, a
spokeswoman in Washington for the Heritage Forests Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, the issue poses few difficulties for Bush. One of his
stops in Oregon was a dinner that White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer said was expected to raise $300,000 for the reelection
campaign of Sen. Gordon Smith and $600,000 for the state Republican
Party.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is flying to California today to begin a two-day visit to the
state built around fund-raising appearances for Republican
gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr.</TE>

<HD>Utah Toxic Stockpile Is Smaller, but It's Still a Handful</HD>
<DH>Safety: The chemical weapons housed at the Army's Deseret
depot are to be destroyed by 2004, but problems and delays are
continual.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Six years after the job started, the Deseret Chemical Depot has
destroyed 44% of the nation's largest stockpile of chemical weapons,
officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The remaining stockpile at the site southwest of Salt Lake City is
scheduled to be destroyed by 2004, but the incinerator has been shut
down since July 15 after two maintenance workers, wearing charcoal
respirators, were exposed to residual amounts of sarin nerve agent.</LD>
<LD>   The workers were treated for minor symptoms and released that day
in good health, said Maj. Rudy Burwell, an Army spokesman. He said
the plant will reopen within weeks, after a safety report is done.</LD>
<TE>   The depot has destroyed more than 6,000 tons of sarin, or GB, a
highly volatile nerve agent that can paralyze the lungs. It had been
stored in bombs, rockets, warheads and bulk containers.</TE>
<TE>   The depot will then destroy 1,300 tons of VX, a more toxic but
less volatile nerve agent that has the consistency of vegetable oil.
It's contained in mines, rockets, warheads and aircraft tanks
designed to spray a deadly mist.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the depot will move on to 6,100 tons of mustard gas, a
blister agent that can dissolve tissue on contact.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign started Aug. 22, 1996, when the incinerator began
burning the depot's 13,616 tons of chemical warfare agents--weapons
the U.S. military has never used in combat. They are being destroyed
under international treaties signed by more than 200 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Utah once stored about 42% of the nation's stockpile of chemical
warfare agents. Now that's down to 25%.</TE>
<TE>   Though the job is expected to be done by 2004, the depot has
missed earlier deadlines and almost anything can set back the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough question. There's still some unknowns in the
stockpile," said Marty Gray, who oversees the Army depot for the Utah
Department of Environmental Quality. Seven other U.S. sites and one
in the central Pacific Ocean also store chemical weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Mike Leavitt used the six-year anniversary to declare that
Utah residents are safer.</TE>
<TE>   "The disposal of the chemical weapons stockpile is a great example
of how regulators can work collaboratively to solve environmental
problems in a safe, efficient and responsible manner," Leavitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, hardly a week goes by without the Deseret Chemical Depot
announcing a spill or vapor leak, usually from broken seals in the
Cold War-era munitions.</TE>
<TE>   Those mishaps haven't been a serious problem for depot workers,
people living around the base or the environment, Gray said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the depot said it was temporarily closing a chemical
agent destruction test facility over inconsistencies in air
monitoring data.</TE>

<HD>Funeral Held for Slain Virginia Couple; Girl Is Still
Missing</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Police have no suspects in the abduction of
9-year-old Jennifer Short and leads have not panned out. At the
service, mourners pray for her safe return.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MARTINSVILLE, Va.</DL>
<LD>Family and friends of a slain couple said goodbye Thursday and
pleaded and prayed for the safe return of the couple's 9-year-old
daughter, who has been missing since her parents were killed last
week.</LD>
<LD>   At the funeral for Michael and Mary Short, Pastor Jackie Poe urged
Jennifer Short's captors to return the girl. Although authorities
don't know her whereabouts, he said, "God knows where she is."</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer's grandmother Margaret Hall led about 200 people past the
flower-lined caskets at Martinsville Church of God. Most wore yellow
ribbons, symbols of hope that Jennifer will come home safely.</LD>
<TE>   In the week since Michael Short, 50, and Mary Short, 36, were
killed in their red-brick ranch home, Jennifer's picture has been
posted on storefronts, homes and tractor-trailers. Signs throughout
western Virginia's rural Henry County ask motorists to pray for the
girl.</TE>
<TE>   "Ain't no sense in what's been done," cousin Thomas Arrington said
before the funeral. "That's what's aggravating. I don't know why
anyone would take people out of their bed like that."</TE>
<TE>   Mourners remembered the Shorts as a private family that enjoyed
being together. Poe said Michael was a "happy go lucky" trickster who
would disguise his voice in phone calls to his sister. Mary, Poe
said, was caring and helpful to others.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a wonderful quality for a daughter like Jennifer to
follow," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, investigators still have no suspects, and leads that
came from around the country have dried up.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators called off a ground search this week and have begun
to focus on a few acquaintances and former employees of the Short
family. The Secret Service has sent Spanish translators to help them
question some of Michael Short's former employees.</TE>
<TE>   Henry County Sheriff Frank Cassell has indicated that the killer
or killers knew the family, and that the Shorts were probably asleep
when the crimes occurred. But authorities don't know whether the
primary motive was to kill the parents or abduct the girl.</TE>
<TE>   "We've heard reports of everything," Cassell said. "We just need
to sort out what's fact and what's fiction."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers at Jennifer's school, Figsboro Elementary, met Thursday
to prepare for the new school year. Jennifer, who was to start the
fourth grade Monday, will have a desk waiting for her.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just hopeful and praying that she'll come back," said science
teacher Laurie Young.</TE>
<TE>   The school also will hold a penny drive to raise money as it did
after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, this time to benefit Jennifer.</TE>
<TE>   School social worker Carmala Shively said she hopes to keep the
first day of school as normal as possible.</TE>
<TE>   There are no plans for an assembly or other forums to discuss what
happened, but that may change, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll take our cues from the students," Shively said.</TE>

<HD>Senate Democrats Predict Soaring Deficit Over 10 Years</HD>
<DH>Budget: Forecast, in prelude to election, runs counter to a
big surplus seen by the White House.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Firing the latest salvo in a preelection battle over who should get
the blame for U.S. budget woes, Senate Democrats on Thursday forecast
a large federal deficit over the next 10 years, in contrast to a
recent White House prediction of a similarly sized surplus.</LD>
<LD>   In a Democratic staff analysis, the Senate Budget Committee
estimated that the government will run a deficit of $475 billion from
2002 through 2011 if all of President Bush's budget policies are
enacted.</LD>
<LD>   The White House Budget Office in July predicted a surplus of $444
billion over the same period.</LD>
<TE>   The $919-billion difference between the 10-year forecasts, which
budget analysts admit are imprecise at best, pales in comparison to
the scale of the undisputed turnaround in the U.S. fiscal position
over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   In early 2001, congressional and White House analysts were
predicting 10-year surpluses of more than $5.6 trillion.</TE>
<TE>   The "vanishing surplus" has become a major issue ahead of
November's elections--where small swings could shift party control of
the House and the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats generally blame Bush's $1.35-trillion tax cut package
last year, though few have so far been willing to call for it to be
rolled back. Republicans counter that the tax cut is aiding the
recovery from recession and the aftermath of Sept. 11, factors they
point to in explaining current budget setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the notable impact of the recession and war on terrorism,
there is simply no escaping the fact that the largest single factor
causing the drop in surplus over the 10 years is the tax cut," Senate
Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat, said
in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   If the offsetting effect of Social Security surpluses are
excluded, the U.S. government will run a deficit of almost $2.8
trillion from 2002 to 2011, the Democratic report says.</TE>
<TE>   It also projects a $158-billion deficit in fiscal year 2002, which
ends on Sept. 30, close to the White House estimate of $165 billion.
In 2003, however, Democrats predict the deficit will rise to $190
billion, versus a White House forecast that it will fall to $109
billion.</TE>
<TE>   If Bush's policies are adopted, the federal budget will not come
back into balance until 2009, the report says. The administration
predicts it can balance the budget by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The White House also has sought to recast the deficit debate into
one about Congress' spending habits, accusing the Democratic-led
Senate of ignoring fiscal discipline by pushing for more money for
nonemergency government programs.</TE>
<TE>   Bush last week refused to spend $5.1 billion of lawmakers'
priorities that were part of a broader emergency counter-terrorism

<HD>Links Sought in Killings of Soldiers' Spouses</HD>
<DH>Crime: Army team will go to Ft. Bragg to look at common
factors, including possible side effects from drug given to troops in
Afghanistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Army is sending a team of specialists to Ft. Bragg, N.C., on
Sunday to investigate common factors among four soldiers accused of
killing their wives, including possible side effects from an
antimalarial drug prescribed to troops who fought in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Army spokeswoman Elaine Kanellis said Thursday that the probe
would examine "any possible physical, behavioral and any
pharmaceutical aspects" the soldiers have in common. That includes
probing their use of Lariam, a popular antimalarial drug, that has
been cited in a spate of lawsuits alleging it contributes to
psychological problems, including suicide.</LD>
<LD>   "If you have a cluster of incidents anywhere ... you would
definitely want to see if any incidents were related," Kanellis said
at the Pentagon.</LD>
<TE>   She emphasized that the team from the Army's headquarters,
including two specialists from the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, would examine "all medical aspects
of the recent incidents," and not merely a link to the drug. Top Army
brass got involved after an ongoing review by officials at Ft. Bragg
that began after four men allegedly killed their wives in a span of
six weeks. Two of the men committed suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing in that investigation so far suggests that the
FDA-approved antimalarial drug Lariam is a factor, said Ft. Bragg
Garrison Commander Col. Tad Davis, referring to the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The drug, known generically as mefloquine, is one of two obvious
links connecting the soldiers. The other was the men's military
history; three were special operations soldiers who recently had
returned from Afghanistan. None of the men knew one another, military
officials said, prompting investigators to seek other connections.</TE>
<TE>   Army officials declined to say how many of the men had been
prescribed Lariam, but a lawyer for one of the men confirmed that his
client had taken the drug. The other two who had returned from
Afghanistan are likely among the thousands of soldiers prescribed the
drug before they can go to nations where malaria poses a significant
risk, such as Afghanistan. About 25 million people have taken Lariam
over the last 17 years, including many soldiers and Peace Corps
workers. Some have complained of psychological side effects that, in
extreme cases, include vivid nightmares and hallucinations.</TE>
<TE>   Lariam has spawned lawsuits from the United States to Denmark. A
group called Lariam Action, which solicits signatures on its Web site
for a petition seeking a congressional investigation of the drug,
said many soldiers have said they have complained to the military
about the drug's side effects.</TE>
<TE>   "They were not able to ever get the military to ever look into the
possibility that the side effects could have been caused by Lariam,"
said Jeanne Lese of San Rafael, a co-director of the group.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the drug's manufacturer, Nutley, N.J.-based
Hoffman-La Roche, did not return calls seeking comment, instead
sending a statement noting that the drug provides protection from a
disease that affects about 300 million people each year and kills 2
million.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no medication completely free of adverse events," the
statement said. "Antimalarial medications including Lariam are no
exception. However, it is important to note that Lariam is not
associated with violent, criminal conduct."</TE>
<TE>   Side effects listed on the drug's label include "convulsions,
depression, hallucinations, psychotic or paranoid reactions, anxiety,
agitation, aggression."</TE>
<TE>   The label warns that Lariam should not be prescribed for patients
"with active depression or with a history of psychosis or
convulsions." It also says the drug increases the risk of convulsions
for epileptics, and warns the drug should be stopped "if signs of
acute anxiety, depression, restlessness or confusion occur" because
they could precede "a more serious event."</TE>
<TE>   The label notes, "Suicidal ideation has also rarely been reported,
but no relationship to drug administration has been established."</TE>
<TE>   Yet one malaria specialist said the Ft. Bragg cases appeared too
locally concentrated to blame Lariam.</TE>
<TE>   "It's within the realm of possibility, but it seems to be very
unlikely that it's a direct cause," said Dr. David Sullivan, a
researcher at the Malaria Research Institute at Baltimore's Johns
Hopkins University, who suggested the soldiers might have suffered
from post-traumatic stress disorder.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was just the drug, we should have more suicides, because
servicemen are on Lariam all the time, even on peaceful missions in
these areas. If it's just the drug, you should have the same thing in
people who are not exposed to a horrific encounter with the enemy."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan puts the incidence of psychological side effects at 0.1%
to 1% of the millions of people who have taken the drug.</TE>
<TE>   But a 2000 study presented at a conference in Toronto found that
20% of patients experienced some "neuropsychiatric" side effects.</TE>
<TE>   The slayings began June 11, when Green Beret Sgt. 1st Class
Rigoberto Nieves fatally shot his wife and then himself two days
after he returned from Afghanistan. Then another Green Beret, Master
Sgt. William Wright, on July 19 confessed to strangling his estranged
wife, Jennifer. That same day, Sgt. 1st Class Brandon Floyd, a member
of the secret Delta Force, shot his wife, Andrea, then killed
himself.</TE>
<TE>   One Army official noted that the incident occurred six months
after Floyd returned from Afghanistan and, presumably, had stopped
taking the drug.</TE>
<TE>   The last incident occurred July 9, when Sgt. Cedric Ramon Griffin
of the 37th Engineer Battalion allegedly stabbed his estranged wife
50 times and set her body on fire, police said.</TE>
<TE>   All of the couples had reportedly had domestic disputes, according
to police and neighbors. Studies have found that military families
have a higher rate of domestic abuse than civilian families.</TE>
<TE>   "There probably needs to be better education and awareness," said
Maj. Gary Kolb, a spokesman for the Army's Special Operations Command
at the base. "But we're not really sure how we can do that. We only
have so much influence on the spouses of the soldiers that are in
special operations.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't make things mandatory for them to be involved. We would
hope that they are very proactive and try to seek assistance when
they can."</TE>

farmers brought goats and other props for the demonstration,
demanding that the department pay black farmers who were wrongly
denied loans because of their race. Faced with the protest, the
department said it was willing to pay but that it would not set a
deadline for issuing the checks. The department had agreed to pay
$50,000 to each of the farmers who were denied loans to settle a
class-action lawsuit filed in 1997 but denied allegations that it had
resisted issuing checks.</CP>

<HD>S. Korean Firms to Pay for Dumping Oil in Oceans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE</DL>
<LD>A consortium of South Korean shipping companies has admitted that its
freighters sailing between Alaska and Asia illegally dumped oily
waste at sea for years and will pay a $5-million fine, federal
officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The sister companies, which operate about a dozen ships that carry
frozen seafood from Alaska, have pleaded guilty to environmental and
conspiracy charges, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Top company officials also were indicted on charges related to the
dumping, Alaska U.S. Atty. Tim Burgess said.</LD>
<TE>   "As this investigation shows, crimes against the environment are
serious, and if you are caught there are serious consequences,"
Burgess said at a news conference where the plea agreements and
indictments were unveiled.</TE>
<TE>   The ships operated by the South Korean companies routinely used
hoses to bypass oil and water separators that are mandated by
international environmental law, federal officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Using the bypass hoses, the ships dumped their oily bilge water
and oil sludge directly into the sea instead of treating waste water
and properly disposing of waste oil at shore. It was a regular
practice that dated to 1995, prosecutors said, and resulted in tens
of thousands of gallons of oily waste being dumped each year by the
cargo fleet.</TE>
<TE>   Those indicted included a man who is Boyang Maritime's general
manager and a major shareholder and board member. Also indicted were
two other managers, a ship captain and a chief engineer. The
indictments, issued by a federal grand jury Wednesday, charge
conspiracy, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, lying to
investigators and making false statements.</TE>
<TE>   One captain and two chief engineers from ships in the companies'
fleet already have pleaded guilty.</TE>

<HD>Blacks Suffer Gene Variant, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Health: Researchers say DNA linked to heart problems found
in 13% of African Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The deaths of 450,000 people a year in the United States are linked
to irregular heartbeats, and a study has found that 13% of black
Americans have a gene variation that greatly increases their risk of
developing a rare type of abnormal cardiac rhythm.</LD>
<LD>   In a study appearing today in the journal Science, researchers say
they screened hundreds of DNA specimens looking for forms of a gene
called SCN5A, which plays a key role in the chemical and electrical
cycling of heartbeats.</LD>
<LD>   They found that the variant, Y1102, was present in more than half
the black patients who were being treated for cardiac arrhythmias, or
irregular heartbeats. People carrying the gene variant are eight
times more likely to develop a rare type of irregular heartbeat than
those who don't.</LD>
<TE>   Researchers did not find the variant in screenings of white and
Asian patients. They found it in only one of 123 Latinos tested.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Mark T. Keating, senior author of the study, said the variant
has a subtle effect on risk, becoming a concern only when patients
have other conditions that would make them susceptible to a rare type
of irregular heartbeat, known as prolongation of the QT interval.</TE>
<TE>   "For most people, such an arrhythmia is not a big deal, but for
people who have this allele [gene variation] it is a bigger deal,"
said Keating, a researcher at Children's Hospital in Boston and a
member of the Harvard Medical School faculty. "This allele will not
cause arrhythmia by itself. You have to have several things go wrong
at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   The gene variation could become a concern only if a patient's
heartbeat is already affected by other factors. The most common is a
severely reduced level of electrolytes in blood serum.</TE>
<TE>   Electrolytes such as potassium, calcium, sodium and magnesium are
chemicals that affect cardiac rhythm, and their levels can be
decreased by extreme exercise, or by medications used to control
blood pressure or eliminate excess fluids.</TE>
<TE>   Patients with the Y1102 variant need to keep serum electrolytes
normal, Keating said.</TE>

<HD>West Nile Reaches New Mexico, Montana; U.S. Cases Near 300</HD>
<DH>Health: Two Georgia fatalities may raise the virus' death
toll. Zoos are inoculating some species.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>The number of Americans who have contracted West Nile virus this year
approached 300 Thursday as the mosquito-borne virus extended its
reach to Montana and New Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   The disease has now killed at least 14 people and infected animals
or humans in all but seven of the lower 48 states. Virginia officials
are waiting to confirm their first case, a 33-year-old Richmond man
they believe contracted the virus last month. The death toll will
rise if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirm that
case and two fatal cases of West Nile reported Thursday in Georgia.</LD>
<LD>   State officials said the victims were a 51-year-old Atlanta man
and a 77-year-old man from Columbus, Ga., but did not say when they
died.</LD>
<TE>   "West Nile virus arrived in Georgia last year, and there is
currently no way to eradicate it, so we expect it to be with us every
summer for the foreseeable future," said Dr. Kathleen Toomey,
director of the state Division of Public Health.</TE>
<TE>   At least 33 people have died since the virus appeared in the
United States in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Most of this year's deaths and the 296 reported human cases have
occurred in the South. Louisiana accounts for 147 illnesses and eight
fatalities.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Lyle Petersen, a CDC expert on the virus, said it should
continue to be worse in the South because warm weather means more
mosquitoes. "But outbreaks could eventually happen anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Montana health officials on Thursday confirmed finding West Nile
in a horse. New Mexico officials said two horses were infected.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure if we keep looking hard enough we'll find some more,"
said Thurman Reitz, assistant New Mexico state veterinarian. "I don't
have any reason to think it's going to quit at the Texas border."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, zoos across the country are vaccinating some of their
most susceptible animals.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland Metroparks Zoo is using a commercial vaccine for
domestic horses to inoculate its equine species--zebras, donkeys and
miniature horses.</TE>
<TE>   And many zoos are taking prevention a step further, vaccinating
equine and bird populations, even though the vaccine has not been
proved effective in birds.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an emerging disease, so for any emerging disease, you
study it intensively to figure out how bad it's going to be," said
Dominic Travis, a veterinarian epidemiologist at Chicago's Lincoln
Park Zoo and a national coordinator of West Nile zoo response. "It
has spread from New York to Colorado and Wyoming in three years, and
that is of concern."</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis Zoo began vaccinating its most susceptible birds, as
well as its equine species, about two weeks ago, said Eric Miller,
the zoo's director of animal health and conservation. Susceptible
birds include crows, raptors, flamingos, parrots and outdoor birds.</TE>
<TE>   The zoo has confirmed several cases of West Nile deaths in birds,
and the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans lost two flamingo chicks to the
disease. A penguin also died at a zoo in Rochester, N.Y., and the
National Zoo in Washington, D.C., reported that two flamingo chicks
and a duck died from the virus, which the zoo also believes killed a
dozen more of its birds.</TE>
<TE>   Zoo and health officials have stressed that people shouldn't fear
visiting zoos, because they're no more likely to be bitten by a
virus-carrying mosquito at a zoo than elsewhere. People can't get
West Nile from each other or by touching an infected animal.</TE>
<TE>   But zoo officials worry that the virus could endanger valuable
animals. "Many of the species at this zoo and others are endangered,
and we don't want to be losing them to disease," Miller said. The
virus can cause flulike symptoms and encephalitis, a potentially
fatal brain infection. Most people bitten by an infected bug never
get sick.</TE>
<TE>   The virus is most dangerous for children, the elderly and people
with weak immune systems. There is no cure for humans.</TE>
<TE>   West Nile is common in Africa and the Middle East. Since 1999,
when the virus reached New York, mosquitoes have spread the virus to
the South and West.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC has repeatedly said the virus will reach the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "We fully expect the virus will make it to the West," Petersen
said.</TE>

<HD>Tough Rules for Diplomats in Parking Lot Named N.Y.</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>For most New Yorkers, finding a quick and legal parking spot is an
exercise in frustration. Diplomats and consular officials soon will
share their pain.</LD>
<LD>   New York City officials and the U.S. State Department said
Thursday that the number of diplomatic and consular vehicles allowed
to park on city streets will be slashed by three-quarters, to 530
from 2,600.</LD>
<LD>   Diplomats and consular officials from the city's 189 diplomatic
missions owe nearly $22 million in parking fines.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg also said the city is cracking down on
new offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Without naming specific countries, Bloomberg said "a very small
minority" of scofflaws had taken the shine off the diplomatic and
consular community's parking record.</TE>
<TE>   State Department officials will physically remove consular plates
and refuse renewals of diplomatic plates to consulate officials who
fail to pay three or more tickets after 100 days.</TE>
<TE>   Consular plates will come off vehicles owned by officials who do
not pay 60% of their outstanding tickets by Sept. 1.</TE>

<HD>Couple's Liability Questioned in Son's Overdose</HD>
<DH>Courts: Experts say the charges against a N.J. pair in
their 18-year-old's heroin death are rare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TRENTON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>A couple showed "conscious disregard" for their 18-year-old son by
ignoring the heroin use that killed him, a grand jury said in a
manslaughter indictment that legal experts say raises questions about
parental liability.</LD>
<LD>   Criminal law experts said the indictment handed up Tuesday is
"very unusual" because Mary and Lewis Hockenbury are not accused of
selling or giving drugs to their son. Leonardo DiPasquale died of an
overdose at the couple's home last year.</LD>
<LD>   "Criminal law doesn't prosecute a failure to act. It only
prosecutes acts," said George Thomas, professor of law at Rutgers
School of Law in Newark.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutor Katharine L. Errickson said the Lebanon Township couple
weren't presented as possible defendants to the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   "But after hearing all the evidence, jurors decided on their own
they wanted to consider a charge of manslaughter against the
parents," Errickson said.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury saw evidence of "conscious disregard" by the couple
for their son, Errickson said. She did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   The Hockenburys didn't return phone calls Thursday from Associated
Press, and prosecutors did not know whether the couple had an
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The Hockenburys, who could face up to 10 years in prison if
convicted, were indicted along with three friends of DiPasquale who
are accused of giving him drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Erica Poch, 18, and Christine Curtin, 21, also were charged with
manslaughter. James Bowkley, 46, was charged with drug distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Guerra Thompson, a law professor at the University of
Houston Law Center, said prosecutors will have a tough time proving
the couple knew DiPasquale's heroin use would contribute to his
death.</TE>
<TE>   "Relatives living in the same home may have a legal duty to rescue
each other if in trouble, like choking, for example," Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   "But people who take heroin don't normally die."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, some states have passed laws that hold parents
liable for a child's crimes. But Thompson said courts have
consistently declared those laws unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   The case is especially unusual because DiPasquale was an adult
when he died and presumably responsible for his actions, Thomas said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Errickson said that makes no difference in the case: "If
he was a child, more charges could have been filed against the
parents."</TE>
<TE>   Before his death, DiPasquale had been charged with drug
distribution in the fatal heroin overdose of a 17-year-old last year.</TE>

<HD>Nine Families Accept Checks From 9/11 Victims Fund</HD>
<DH>Compensation: Of a pool of 25 applicants, four are
appealing the award and 12 have not responded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Nine Sept. 11 victims' families have accepted checks from the federal
government's compensation fund, the fund's administrator said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The families that accepted the cash payout came from a pool of 25
applicants who received notice of their award in July from the
Justice Department, which oversees the fund. Four are appealing their
award and 12 have yet to respond, the administrator, Kenneth
Feinberg, said.</LD>
<LD>   The average award for the 25 applicants is $1.36 million, and the
payments range from $300,000 to $3 million. The Justice Department
would not say how much the nine families received.</LD>
<TE>   Feinberg said that while it would be a mistake to infer too much
from just nine awards, they did provide some general guidance in what
applicants could expect.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that this will give families a comfort level that they
will be treated fairly," he said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Feinberg had said in March that the average award to victims would
be about $1.85 million before outside income sources, like life
insurance, were deducted. The awards announced Thursday are minus
those deductions.</TE>
<TE>   Names and other identifying characteristics, like the number of
children, were left off the information the Justice Department
distributed Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, those with the highest incomes received the
largest awards. For those earning more than $200,000, the awards
ranged from $2.1 million to $3 million. Those who earned from $50,000
to $100,000 over age 35 received awards from $300,000 to $1.9
million. Those with incomes below $50,000 under age 35 received from
$610,000 to $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   New York Lawyer Debra Steinberg speculated that some older
applicants might receive less because they are more likely to have
life insurance.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 662 people have applied to the victims fund, out of
families of the more than 3,000 killed and injured in the attacks,
according to the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   Those who seek an award from the fund must give up their right to
sue the airlines and other entities, although they are free to sue
terrorists. The fund was set up as an alternative to the courts by
Congress as part of the $15-billion airline bailout bill passed soon
after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Many families still ambivalent about the victims fund have been
looking to the first awards as a gauge of how generous Feinberg was
prepared to be. Feinberg said the early awards were the most
straightforward claims with the simplest finances.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ellen Salamone, whose husband worked for Cantor Fitzgerald,
said she and other family members were waiting to see how those who
appeal their award fare in a follow-up hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to see how Mr. Feinberg handles those hearings,"
Salamone said.</TE>
<TE>   She said that some are just putting off filing because they are
waiting for paperwork from employers. Others are stalling because the
process is emotional, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign that a number of victims may turn to the courts, nearly
1,500 people and businesses filed notices of claim with the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey by the July 10 deadline
preserving their right to sue.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of those will necessarily file lawsuits. But New York law
requires lawsuits against the Port Authority to be filed within a
year of the incident prompting the litigation so the lawsuits must be
filed by Sept. 10. Ten suits have been filed so far against the
airlines.</TE>
<TE>   New York lawyer Lee Kreindler, whose firm is representing about
250 families, said a number of his clients have decided to sue. He
added that he was not encouraged by the early awards, which he called
"much lower than they should be."</TE>

<HD>Fund-Raiser Brings Out Bush Protesters</HD>
<DH>Politics: Portland, Ore., police pepper-spray the crowd,
rallying against president's policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Riot police fired pepper spray at hundreds of protesters and hit some
with batons Thursday night after ordering them to move from an area
near a hotel where President Bush attended a fund-raiser.</LD>
<LD>   Protesters hammered on the hoods of police cars as pepper spray
wafted through the air. Earlier, several hundred demonstrators
marched toward the Hilton hotel after Bush's arrival there.</LD>
<LD>   Protesting the president's foreign policy, they chanted "Drop
Bush, Not Bombs."</LD>
<TE>   Supporters of Bush in formal attire were jostled and taunted by
protesters as they arrived for a fund-raiser for the reelection
campaign of Sen. Gordon Smith. After elbowing through demonstrators,
the VIPs were checked by Secret Service agents before they were
allowed inside the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Police ordered about 500 protesters to move from a barricaded
area. Riot police wearing helmets then entered the area, pushing
activists with their batons, knocking some down. Police then fired
aerosol canisters of pepper spray at the protesters.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a number of items thrown at our officers over the last
few hours," police spokesman Brian Schmautz said.</TE>
<TE>   Police also used pepper spray after about 150 demonstrators
blocked vehicle access to Morrison Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Three protesters were arrested, police spokesman Henry Groepper
said.</TE>
<TE>   One police officer injured her wrist when protesters pushed a
barricade she was standing near, Groepper said. Two patrol cars were
damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the protesters criticized a new forest initiative
announced earlier in the day by Bush that would make it easier for
timber companies to cut wood from fire-prone national forests.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern is that he has absolutely no morals about protecting
our environment," said Joanne Marron, a teacher with a master's
degree in ecology.</TE>
<TE>   "The new policy is classic doublespeak," said Kenneth Kreuschu,
24, also from Cascadia Forest Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been shown time and again that more cutting leads to more
fire. The new policy is a hoax."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the activists also were worried about a possible war with
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any American boys' lives are worth a barrel of
oil," said Rob Moitoza, 57, who carried a sign that said: "Vets
Against Bush."</TE>
<TE>   Moitoza said he served two years in the Navy aboard an aircraft
carrier during the Vietnam War and fears a much worse conflict if
U.S. troops are sent to Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "If he [Bush] starts a war against Iraq, it will be to get
reelected," Moitoza said. "All he cares about is wealth and power."</TE>

<HD>Airports May End 2 Security Questions About Baggage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Airport passengers may not be asked much longer whether they packed
their own bags and, starting right away, they will be allowed to take
drinks through security checkpoints.</LD>
<LD>   For the last 16 years, ticket agents have been required to ask
passengers two security questions: "Has anyone unknown to you asked
you to carry an item on this flight?" and "Have any of the items you
are traveling with been out of your immediate control since the time
you packed them?"</LD>
<LD>   There is no hard evidence the queries have prevented a hijacking
or bombing. Many passengers question the value of the tactic, as
anyone with something to hide presumably would not answer honestly.</LD>
<TE>   The Transportation Security Administration, the agency created
after Sept. 11 to oversee airport security, is seeking ways to make
travel less onerous. Among the considerations is getting rid of the
questions, according to TSA chief James M. Loy.</TE>
<TE>   "A review is underway," Loy said Thursday at a news conference in
San Francisco. He said it was part of an examination of a larger body
of regulations and that a decision won't take long.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Transport Assn., which represents big airlines, would
welcome the change, spokesman Michael Wascom said.</TE>
<TE>   "All passengers do not pose equal security threats," Wascom said.
"Why should we continue to ask these questions of everyone? We should
be focusing on people who are higher security risks."</TE>
<TE>   Billie Vincent, a former Federal Aviation Administration security
chief, said the U.S. requirement originally included five or six
questions written 16 years ago after two incidents in Europe
involving men who deceived their girlfriends into carrying explosives
onto planes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, a security guard for Israeli airline El Al questioned a
pregnant Irish woman at London's Heathrow Airport and discovered her
Jordanian fiance had duped her into carrying a bomb onto an Israeli
jet.</TE>
<TE>   "What was started as very meaningful became essentially
irrelevant," Vincent said. In the United States, the questions were
reduced to two and people were never trained to interrogate
passengers properly, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A trained interrogator would ask simple questions, looking for
reasons to ask further questions, such as shiftiness or conflicting
responses, said David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "El Al still asks those questions, but it's still part of a larger
process where they're interrogating passengers, which is what we need
to do in this country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Loy, who succeeded John W. Magaw last month as TSA chief, said the
agency wants to balance customer service and security.</TE>
<TE>   He said Thursday that passengers will be allowed to carry
beverages in paper or foam cups through metal detectors.</TE>
<TE>   The new policy requires plastic, glass, metal and ceramic
containers to be sealed and put through the X-ray screening machine.
An open can of soda won't be allowed through a checkpoint, but a
bottle of soda with a top that can be sealed will.</TE>
<TE>   Screeners are forbidden to ask passengers to eat food or drink a
beverage as part of a security procedure. The policy was changed June
24 after a woman said a security guard at New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport forced her to drink from three bottles of her
own breast milk to demonstrate the liquid posed no threat to other
passengers.</TE>

<HD>Fierce Rains Flood Streets, Cause Outages in Midwest</HD>
<DH>Weather: Up to 7 inches falls in Chicago, shutting down
subway lines and delaying flights. Flash flooding is reported in
several other states too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Torrential rains Thursday flooded Chicago streets and highways,
clogged subway lines and knocked out power to thousands of
Midwesterners, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Up to 7 inches of rain dumped by a parade of thunderstorms moving
slowly through the region shut down major highways leading into
Chicago and flooded the Blue Line subway, which runs under Dearborn
Street downtown, and the Red Line, which runs under State Street.</LD>
<LD>   The flooding snarled the morning commute for thousands, with
shuttle buses pressed into service to ferry subway passengers around
the flooded stations.</LD>
<TE>   Interstate 190, leading into O'Hare International Airport, was
closed for several hours by flooding.</TE>
<TE>   Flights at O'Hare and Midway Airport were delayed for several
hours by the storms.</TE>
<TE>   Floodgates were opened into Lake Michigan to release untreated
water from overwhelmed sewer systems in Chicago and the suburb of
Wilmette, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Swimming in the lake was banned for two days, said Angelynne
Amoress, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Park District.</TE>
<TE>   The National Weather Service issued flood warnings for several
area rivers and flash flooding was reported in parts of South Dakota,
Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Rainfall totals included 11.7 inches in Galena, Ill., and slightly
more than 9 inches at Dubuque, Iowa, and nearly 5 inches in Lafayette
and Grant counties in Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   Several apartment complexes and a trailer park were evacuated in
Eau Claire, Wis., due to flooding.</TE>
<TE>   Lightning sparked fires in at least five homes near Milwaukee. An
unmanned blimp about 100 feet long broke loose from its mooring at a
stadium north of the city and damaged several roofs and chimneys
before coming to rest on a house. No one was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, lightning strikes and wind gusts knocked out power to

<HD>Patriotism Helps Army Recruitment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The sluggish economy, snazzy new ads and a surge in patriotism after
Sept. 11 helped the Army reach its recruiting goals early this year,
officers said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   That's all true for recruit Allen Hawkins Jr., who says he joined
to pay off college debts, impressed by the new ads and inspired by
the war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   An Army officer swore Hawkins in as a private 1st class during a
ceremony in the Pentagon courtyard to tout the Army's recruiting
success.</LD>
<TE>   "I hope I can go in and make my country proud," said Hawkins, 26,
of Spartanburg, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps also say they're meeting
their enlistment goals after a recruiting slump in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   That slump prompted all the services to increase the number of
recruiters and boost advertising. The Army ditched its old "Be All
You Can Be" slogan last year in favor of "An Army of One."</TE>
<TE>   "To the youth market, it became a stale slogan. We wanted
something new, something exciting," said Gen. John Keene, the Army's
vice chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   The new slogan is meant to convey that the Army values each
soldier's individual contributions, said Lt. Gen. Dennis Cavin, who
oversees Army recruiting.</TE>
<TE>   The economic slump also has had an effect. Cavin said the Army
estimates that about 3,000 of its recruits joined because of the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins was the last active-duty soldier sworn in to meet the
Army's goal of 79,500 new troops for the year ending Sept. 30. The
Army already has recruited 19,000 people toward next year's goal.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy and Air Force have commitments for enough recruits to
meet their goal, though not all the recruits have entered basic
training. The Navy's goal is 46,500 and the Air Force's target is
37,283.</TE>
<TE>   The Marine Corps' goal is 38,642, and the service had signed up
31,523 by July 31.</TE>
<TE>   The Army is keeping high standards for recruits, Cavin said. More
than 22% of this year's recruits have at least one semester of
college, and more than 4,000 have an associate or bachelor's degree,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Army is not the last choice, it is the first choice for many
Americans," Cavin said.</TE>

<HD>Deejays Fired Over Cathedral Sex Stunt</HD>
<DH>Radio: Show broadcast a couple allegedly in flagrante at
N.Y. church. Catholics complained.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Opie and Anthony are over and out.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based shock jocks, criticized by Roman Catholic
groups for broadcasting a live account of a couple allegedly having
sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral, had their nationally syndicated show
canceled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "Based on recent events, the 'Opie and Anthony Show' has been
canceled and will be replaced by other programming beginning Friday,"
WNEW-FM said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   The station, owned by Infinity Broadcasting, offered no further
comment. The pair had been pulled off the airwaves Monday, three days
after the stunt was aired.</TE>
<TE>   The cancellation was announced shortly after Federal
Communications Commission Chairman Michael K. Powell directed the
agency's enforcement bureau to investigate the broadcast. The FCC had
been flooded with hundreds of complaints about the show.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to sack the disc jockeys and their highly rated
afternoon drive-time show was hailed by William Donohue, head of the
350,000-member Catholic League.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm delighted with the results," Donohue said. "I'm very, very
happy. It is an example of corporate responsibility in an age of
corporate irresponsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Donohue said his group would back off its call for the FCC to pull
WNEW's broadcast license and fine Infinity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's over," he said. "I'm satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   The cancellation came one day after the Virginia couple suspected
of the sex stunt appeared in a Manhattan courtroom on charges of
public lewdness.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Florence, 37, of Quantico, and Loretta Lynn Harper, 35, of
Alexandria, were due back in court Oct. 2. The couple's lawyer has
said they were just simulating sex inside the landmark Manhattan
cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   The couple were arrested Aug. 15 after they allegedly had sex in a
cathedral vestibule just a few feet from worshippers, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The radio show's stunt was part of a regular feature where couples
could earn points and win a trip for having sex in risky places.</TE>
<TE>   Charges of acting in concert were still pending against "Opie and
Anthony" producer Paul Mercurio, 42, who provided a running account
of the encounter over his cell phone.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second firing in four years for Greg "Opie" Hughes and
Anthony Cumia. The pair were canned in 1998 by a Massachusetts
station after announcing on April Fool's Day that Boston Mayor Thomas
M. Menino was killed in a car crash.</TE>

<HD>Mother in Sunburn Case Denies Charge</HD>
<DH>Courts: After the counts against an Ohio woman are reduced,
she says she did nothing wrong when her young children were burned at
a county fair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>STEUBENVILLE, Ohio</DL>
<LD>A day after being abruptly released from jail, a woman who allegedly
allowed her children to become severely sunburned said Thursday she
didn't do anything wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Eve Hibbits, who had been jailed for eight days, appeared on NBC's
"Today" show one day after prosecutors dropped three felony counts,
replacing them with a misdemeanor charge of child endangerment.
Authorities said her three children were not as severely injured as
officials had believed.</LD>
<LD>   Hibbits was arrested Aug. 14, the day after a sheriff's deputy
noticed her 2-year-old daughter, Rose, and 10-month-old twin boys,
Thomas and Timmy, had sunburned faces at the Jefferson County Fair.
Temperatures were in the 90s at the time.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff Fred Abdalla said the children did not have any sunscreen
or shirts on when a deputy spotted them and took them to a first aid
station. They were later treated at a hospital and released. He said
their faces looked like they had been "dipped in red paint."</TE>
<TE>   Hibbits' attorney, Shawn Blake, said Thursday that the children
were wearing sunscreen.</TE>
<TE>   Hibbits, 31, told NBC she didn't think she had committed a crime,
and being behind bars was awful.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like the walls of the jail were falling in on me. I ain't
never been in jail," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hibbits was released on her own recognizance and pleaded not
guilty to the misdemeanor. She had been held on $15,000 bond.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials initially said the children suffered from
second-degree burns but later reduced that to first-degree burns,
Jefferson County Prosecutor Brian Felmet said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel they [the charges] were too severe based on that
information," he said. "With the benefit of hindsight with the
information we have now, we feel they weren't warranted."</TE>
<TE>   The maximum penalty for the misdemeanor is six months in jail and
a $1,000 fine, but Felmet said probation was likely.</TE>
<TE>   Though Hibbits could have faced five years in jail and a $10,000
fine on each of the felonies, the sheriff said Wednesday that he had
not intended to imprison her.</TE>
<TE>   "My intent was for the safety of the children, which was
accomplished, and to give her a wake-up call," Abdalla said.</TE>
<TE>   Hibbits' husband, Richard, was working at the fair and the family
had been camping there.</TE>

<HD>Political Ties Between Blacks and Jews Strained</HD>
<DH>Race: African American leaders express outrage at groups
targeting Rep. Cynthia McKinney's pro-Palestinian stance. She lost
the primary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The success of Jewish groups in helping to defeat two longtime
African American members of Congress has further frayed the damaged
relationship between leaders of black and Jewish organizations.</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of Tuesday's ousting of Rep. Cynthia A. McKinney in a
Georgia Democratic primary, some African American political activists
and leaders are expressing outrage at Jewish organizations that
targeted McKinney because she had expressed pro-Palestinian
sentiments about the Middle East crisis.</LD>
<LD>   McKinney lost to Denise Majette, a former state judge who is also
black but benefited from out-of-state contributions from Jewish
groups and crossover voting by Republicans. Also this year, another
black member of Congress, Rep. Earl F. Hilliard of Alabama, who had
pro-Arab support, was defeated by Artur Davis, who was funded by
backers of Israel.</LD>
<TE>   After Hilliard's loss, McKinney's survival in the face of Jewish
opposition became a cause celebre for many black leaders. The Rev.
Jesse Jackson responded to her defeat by calling for a meeting of
African American and Jewish leaders, and others called for picketing
and demonstrations. Meanwhile, one Jewish Web site crowed that
"Cynthia McKinney, D-Gaza Strip," had been ousted and replaced by
someone with sense and class.</TE>
<TE>   Factors other than her pro-Palestinian stance contributed to
McKinney's defeat. But much of that was lost in postelection
recriminations reminiscent of flare-ups that have broken out between
the leaders of black and Jewish organizations that were closely
aligned in the civil rights era.</TE>
<TE>   "The tensions are huge around this issue, but our coalition must
survive these pressures," Jackson said. "There is a sense of outrage
and I do not know how that will play out."</TE>
<TE>   Calling the McKinney election "a litmus test for the relationship
between blacks and Jews in this country," the Rev. Bamani Obadele, a
Chicago activist, also called for a meeting of leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who are angry about this and I agree with Jesse
Jackson that there has to be a summit," said Obadele, who, with a bus
load of supporters from Chicago, went to Georgia on Aug. 16 to stump
for McKinney. They were among 2,000 African American volunteers from
around the country who made the journey.</TE>
<TE>   Many Jewish leaders, taking pains to say the historic bonds
between blacks and Jews may stretch but never will snap, accused
black leaders of suggesting that African American politicians should
be protected from opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Abe Foxman, president of the Anti-Defamation League, said it was
"absurd" to suggest that Jewish groups should not have targeted a
politician--something all groups have a right to do--because he is
African American.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened there was as American as apple pie," he said.
"There's not a crisis in African American-Jewish relations and
personally, I think McKinney defeated McKinney."</TE>
<TE>   McKinney has suggested that the Bush administration failed to heed
warnings about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks because the president's
allies would profit from the ensuing war, and she has opposed
congressional resolutions of solidarity with Israel in its conflict
with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "You can support the Arabs without being anti-Israel, and you can
support other positions without being anti-Jewish," Foxman said. "But
she was flagrant."</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center
and Museum of Tolerance, urged blacks to see Jewish concern for
Israel in the same light as African American anger about South Africa
in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to remember, when the dominant issue in the world was
apartheid in South Africa, it would be ridiculous for any Jew to have
imagined that African Americans would not have that as a paramount
concern and monitor congressional elections to see which candidates
were not in sync with ending the apartheid regime," Hier said.</TE>
<TE>   Now Israel's survival is at stake, he said. "Not only Jews but
many supporters of Israel all over the world would be concerned with
people running for Congress who had a lukewarm attitude about that."
But he said this "moment of friction" will not impair the "historic
relationship" between blacks and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders on both sides alluded to past tensions that had been
overcome. Hier noted that Jackson had recovered from his 1980s
reference to New York as "Hymietown." Jackson said that when Israel
maintained strong ties to the apartheid regime in South Africa,
blacks did not permit their anger to harm the coalitions with U.S.
Jews.</TE>
<TE>   To some Muslim leaders, who supported McKinney in the Georgia
primary, Tuesday's election transcended black-Jewish tensions. They
characterized it as a major step in the political maturation of Arab
Americans. "It's the first time that the American Muslim community
and Arab American community ever went toe to toe with the pro-Israel
lobby," said Ibrahim Hooper of the Council of American-Islamic
Relations. Ten or 15 years ago, such activity would have been unheard
of, Hooper said. "And this is what frightens the pro-Israel lobby.
This is just the beginning skirmish."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson cautioned against seeing the McKinney defeat purely in
black / Jewish terms. He noted that McKinney received tepid support
from her own political party. And he noted that another
congresswoman, Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland), easily won her primary
this year despite having been roundly vilified for casting the sole
vote against military retaliation after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>A suspected Basque terrorist escaped from a high-security Paris
prison by switching places with his brother during a visit, prison
officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The switch at the Sante prison took place Saturday but was only
discovered Thursday, prison officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The escapee, Ismael Berasategui Escudero, is a suspected member of
the Basque separatist movement ETA who was arrested May 14 in
southern France. The brother who took his place in prison was held
Thursday for questioning and could be investigated on charges of
helping an escape. His name was not revealed.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a natural physical resemblance between the two men,
which was reinforced by their thought-out desire to slip our guard,"
the prison director, Alain Jego, said in a telephone interview. "It's
hard to tell them apart."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators suspect that the ETA, short for Basque Homeland and
Freedom, may have directed the escape. Inmates at the Sante prison
get three visits of 45 minutes each a week. Their hands are stamped
with invisible ink before entering the visiting room. After the
session, guards verify that the ink is still present and that
visitors have none on them.</TE>
<TE>   French authorities were holding Berasategui on charges of
"criminal conspiracy related to a terrorist enterprise," carrying
weapons and receiving stolen goods.</TE>
<TE>   The ETA has killed more than 800 people as part of a drive to
carve a Basque homeland.</TE>

<HD>Bhutto Applies to Seek Election</HD>

<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto filed Thursday as a candidate
for parliament in Pakistan's Oct. 12 elections, despite the military
government's insistence that she is not qualified to run and its
threats to arrest her if she returns to the country.</LD>
<LD>   Bhutto, in a telephone interview from self-exile in London, said
she was determined to return to Pakistan and run for parliament .</LD>
<LD>   "Life and death are in the hands of God," Bhutto said. "I am
determined to go back to serve my countrymen."</LD>
<TE>   She said she would come home "much before the elections," but she
did not say when. "I will contest elections," she insisted.</TE>
<TE>   Bhutto's application for certification as a candidate was
submitted to election authorities by her Pakistan People's Party.</TE>
<TE>   Her application, however, is likely to be rejected. President
Pervez Musharraf has decreed that no one convicted of a crime may run
for office. Last month, a court sentenced Bhutto to three years in
prison for corruption. Her party says that the charges were trumped
up.</TE>
<TE>   The president has also ordered that prime ministers who have
served twice may not seek a third term. That excludes Bhutto as well
as her successor, Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted by Musharraf in an
October 1999 coup.</TE>
<TE>   Bhutto was ousted as prime minister in 1996 amid a corruption
scandal and left the country. She and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari,
were found guilty of corruption in April 1999 and were sentenced to
five-year jail terms, fined and disqualified from politics for seven
years. In July, Bhutto was sentenced to the further three-year prison
term for failing to appear in court to answer graft charges.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bhutto's party commands a substantial following in
Pakistan. The party has asked an appeals court to overturn laws that
prevent her candidacy.</TE>
<TE>   Bhutto's papers were filed a day after Musharraf announced
constitutional amendments granting him new powers, including
authority to dismiss parliament and appoint top military commanders.
He also gave himself five more years in office.</TE>
<TE>   Major parties said changes to the constitution could be made only
by parliament and accused Musharraf of seeking to perpetuate
dictatorship under the guise of democracy.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, a State Department spokesman expressed concern
Thursday over "recent decisions" by Musharraf. The United States
shunned Musharraf after the 1999 coup but has avoided criticizing his
domestic policies since the Sept. 11 attacks because of Pakistan's
role in aiding the U.S.-led campaign in Afghanistan.</TE>

<LD>Chinese authorities have evacuated 600,000 people from around the
dangerously swollen Dongting Lake in Hunan province as more than 1
million people piled sandbags and checked for breaches along its
hundreds of miles of embankments, state media said.</LD>
<LD>   The embankments protect millions of people from inundation. Floods
in the province had already killed at least 16 people, the China
Daily reported, without elaboration. It said 27,000 houses had
collapsed.</LD>
<LD>   The crisis point is expected Sunday, when a flood crest surging
down the Yangtze River sweeps into Dongting, which is already 9 feet
above flood warning level.</LD>

<LD>A former kickboxer who had boasted to friends about starting fires
was convicted of arson and sentenced to 15 years in prison for a
fireworks explosion that killed 22 people and flattened an entire
Dutch neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Andre De Vries, 34, was found guilty of igniting a fireworks depot
that triggered a series of powerful explosions in May 2000 in
Enschede. De Vries, who maintained his innocence throughout his
trial, threw his hands in the air when the decision was read aloud.
He yelled that the judge was "out of his mind" before four guards
dragged him from the courtroom.</LD>

relief among secular Turks and the country's industrial elite. Many
of them see the Princeton-trained economist's bid as crucial to
boosting the party's fortunes against the conservative Justice and
Development Party in the Nov. 3 elections.</LD>
<TE>   More important, Dervis is seen by many Turks and Western
governments as one of the few figures who could keep the nation's
fragile economy on track.</TE>
<TE>   Descended from an illustrious line of Ottoman Empire generals, the
53-year-old Dervis is widely credited with ramming through a series
of radical reforms that helped Turkey secure about $31 billion in
international loans, which are expected to finance its economic
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Dervis repeatedly has said that he sees himself as a technocrat,
not a politician, and would prefer to be in charge of the economy in
any new government rather than serve as prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   A die-hard social democrat admired for his modesty,
industriousness and probity, Dervis kept the nation guessing as to
his plans after resigning Aug. 10 from Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's
three-party coalition. He was the eighth Cabinet minister to quit in
a month.</TE>
<TE>   Dervis initially was expected to join a new party created by
former Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, another of the scores of
lawmakers to break recently with the ailing Ecevit over his refusal
to relinquish power to a younger and healthier successor. The
rebellion paralyzed Ecevit's coalition, prompting parliament to call
elections about 18 months ahead of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Dervis tried instead to bring together what he termed in a recent
interview with The Times "forces on the center-left that would
achieve the conditions under which Turkey can overcome its economic
difficulties and pursue our road toward Europe and a modern and free
society."</TE>
<TE>   The economy and Turkey's desire to join the European Union are
major issues in the current campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Dervis argued that such a broad alliance would serve as a credible
alternative to the Justice and Development Party and its leader,
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a former pro-Islamist and ex-mayor of Istanbul.
For all Erdogan's efforts to distance himself from his Islamist past,
he has failed to persuade many pro-secular Turks, including the
country's powerful military leaders, of his conversion. They fear he
would steer Turkey away from its pro-Western course.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Dervis failed at organizing such an alliance in part
because of personality clashes between Turkey's fragmented
center-left politicians. His decision to join the Republican People's
Party was prompted in part by Cem's strident refusal to take part in
any alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Western governments and lending institutions generally regard
Dervis as someone they can work with and trust. Close cooperation
between the West and Turkey, Israel's strongest regional ally and the
sole member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with a majority
Muslim population, is seen as more crucial than ever on several
fronts.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts, however, doubt that Dervis and Deniz Baykal, leader
of the center-left party, can counter the charismatic Erdogan's
popularity.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people out there who have lost their jobs, who
can barely feed their kids, and blame the IMF [International Monetary
Fund] and Dervis for their plight," said a European diplomat in
Ankara, the capital, who requested anonymity.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Feared a Nuclear Argentina</HD>
<DH>Policy: Hoping to win the regime's support for a ban in the
1970s, America curbed its opposition to the 'dirty war,' documents
show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. efforts in the late 1970s to pressure Argentina to end the
torture and killing of leftists were restrained in part by an
American desire to keep the military junta from developing a nuclear
bomb, newly declassified U.S. government papers show.</LD>
<LD>   A State Department intelligence report from 1978 said that even
while the Carter administration was stepping up pressure on the
Argentine regime to curb the "dirty war" against dissidents, U.S.
policymakers worried that pushing too hard could jeopardize efforts
to convince the junta to join a treaty banning nuclear weapons in
Latin America.</LD>
<LD>   "Argentina's nuclear status and capabilities have forced the
United States to examine carefully the possibility that human rights
initiatives could be detrimental to continued U.S. influence in the
nuclear area," said the report from the State Department's Bureau of
Intelligence and Research. "The U.S. human rights approach to
Argentina has always been tempered by Argentina's potential as a
nuclear proliferator."</LD>
<TE>   The report was among 4,677 documents from 1975 to 1984 that were
declassified and released by the State Department this week. The
information had been requested by the families of the regime's
victims, human rights groups and governments that are considering
prosecuting Argentine officials they accuse of human rights abuses.</TE>
<TE>   Documents disclosed earlier this week suggested a clear difference
between the Ford and Carter administrations in their policies on
Argentina. The earlier documents indicate that leaders of the
military regime believed that the Ford administration, which was in
office when the junta took power, was not sincerely concerned about
rights abuses.</TE>
<TE>   The papers show that the generals repeatedly dismissed expressions
of concern from the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires, saying they knew
from personal visits to Washington that Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger did not object to their campaign against the leftists.</TE>
<TE>   The military government cracked down on insurgents beginning in
March 1976 in an effort to end political violence that had racked the
country since 1970. Thousands of Argentine citizens disappeared in
the campaign, which the regime viewed as a war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   When Jimmy Carter took office in 1977, he stepped up pressure on
the Argentines to halt what his administration saw as gross human
rights abuses. The U.S. cut back on military and economic aid and
began collecting information on incidents of kidnapping, torture and
killing.</TE>
<TE>   By early 1978, Carter administration pressure had brought
relations between the two countries to a "nadir," the intelligence
report notes. While U.S. officials continued to press on human rights
issues, their desire to bring the junta around on the nuclear issue
complicated the effort.</TE>
<TE>   The report notes that the nuclear arms issue was a major item on
the agenda when Carter met Argentine President Jorge Rafael Videla in
September 1977, and when Secretary of State Cyrus Vance visited
Buenos Aires two months later.</TE>
<TE>   Though the South American nation does not possess nuclear weapons,
analysts say it came close to developing them while the military
ruled from 1976 to 1983. The prospect of a nuclear-armed Argentina
was especially unnerving to U.S. officials because of the country's
rivalry with neighboring Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   The report says the Argentines had not sought to use the nuclear
weapons issue to win concessions from the U.S. in the human rights
debate. Nonetheless, it says, they "undoubtedly appreciate the
bargaining power of their nuclear chip," and predicts that the
generals "may attempt to inject it directly into human rights
discussions."</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Osorios, an analyst at the National Security Archive, a
nonprofit research organization that gathers declassified national
security documents, said the report shows that the proliferation
worries were a "very, very important factor" in shaping U.S. policy
at the time.</TE>
<TE>   F. Allen "Tex" Harris, a retired foreign service officer who was
closely involved with the "dirty war" issue while at the U.S. Embassy
in Buenos Aires in the late 1970s, said in an interview that the
Argentine nuclear program "was a major concern of the Department of
State and the defense establishment" at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the biggest issue generating debate among U.S.
policymakers, he said, was whether the policy should be shaped by the
desire to influence Argentina's human rights practices or whether the
U.S. should take "a long-term view that it had to maintain good
working relations with the military as the only stable entity in the
country."</TE>

<HD>Colony Is Between Spain and a Hard Place</HD>
<DH>Europe: The decidedly British residents of Gibraltar fear
being usurped by their neighbor, as talk of joint sovereignty heats
up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GIBRALTAR</DL>
<LD>Jonathan Stagnetto is a true Gibraltarian: very British, of broadly
mixed European ancestry and fiercely proud of this territory's unique
character.</LD>
<LD>   Like many residents here, Stagnetto bitterly opposes any
concessions to long-standing Spanish claims of sovereignty over this
British colony. He fears that despite local resistance, London is
tempted to dispose of Gibraltar as an unwanted legacy impeding
greater British influence within the European Union.</LD>
<LD>   Such fears skyrocketed last month when British Foreign Secretary
Jack Straw said Britain was willing to establish joint sovereignty
here with Spain.</LD>
<TE>   "The identity of being Gibraltarian is British," said Stagnetto,
37, a small-business owner. "It would be idyllic if we didn't have to
change. But it's not nice to be clinging to the shirttails of someone
who doesn't want you."</TE>
<TE>   It remains unclear whether Britain really wants to get rid of this
2 1/2-square-mile territory, or whether it simply wants to be seen as
engaged in serious negotiations with Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   In his July comments, made to the British Parliament, Straw argued
that an agreement would benefit Gibraltar by ending uncertainty over
its future and smoothing its relations with Spain.</TE>
<TE>   "The dispute is also damaging to Britain's interests because we
are trying to build a strategic alliance with Spain to help deliver
the EU we both seek," Straw added. Making air travel safer, cheaper
and with fewer delays is one area in which improved British-Spanish
cooperation would help, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, French-German ties have often been seen as central
to EU developments. Many observers say London and Madrid are now
trying to build a similar relationship to push reforms they favor.</TE>
<TE>   Yet under British proposals made so far, it is difficult to
envision a scenario in which Gibraltar actually ends up being turned
over to Spanish control.</TE>
<TE>   Straw stressed in his comments to Parliament that a joint
sovereignty deal must be permanent, not a stepping stone toward full
Spanish control, and that any agreement would require the approval of
the people of Gibraltar in a referendum.</TE>
<TE>   But Spain has repeatedly said it will never give up its demand to
eventually recover full sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   Gibraltar was captured by a joint Anglo-Dutch force in 1704 and
ceded by Spain to Britain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. The treaty
included a condition that if Britain ever left the territory, Spain
would have preference "before any others" in recovering it. That
provision has been used to argue against Gibraltar's becoming
independent, as many former British colonies have.</TE>
<TE>   Though Gibraltar's economy once was largely dependent on the
military base here, it has become an international financial center
and tourist magnet. Its once working-class downtown district is now a
pedestrians-only street full of trendy shops, restaurants and
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Almost no one thinks the people of Gibraltar would vote in favor
of any agreement that transferred even partial sovereignty to Spain,
which Stagnetto called "our unfriendly neighbor."</TE>
<TE>   Stagnetto, who was born in Gibraltar, reflects this place's
history and its forging of a new identity. His ancestry, he
explained, is "Italian, Maltese, Welsh, Irish, Portuguese,
German--and apparently there's some Spanish there." Like most of
Gibraltar's 30,000 residents, he speaks English, Spanish and a mixed
language sometimes called Gibraltarian and sometimes called
Spanglish.</TE>
<TE>   To preserve Gibraltar's uniqueness, and to underline local
opposition to any concessions to Spain on the sovereignty issue, the
territory's government has already announced plans for an autumn
referendum.</TE>
<TE>   Straw acknowledged that a deal is far from certain.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless we and Spain can resolve the outstanding issues, then
plainly there will be no agreement, [but] in 12 months of
negotiations we are now closer than ever before to overcoming 300
years of fraught history," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the key stumbling blocks is Britain's determination to keep
its military base here, at a point that overlooks the passage between
the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The territory stretches Britain's
military reach toward the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Gibraltar "is 1,000 miles nearer any potential hot spots than the
south coast of the U.K.," said Maj. Chris Pugh, media operations
officer at the base. "It gives us that steppingstone if required to
launch something from here.... We do a certain amount of
intelligence-gathering here. To sit on a choke-point is quite handy
for that."</TE>
<TE>   The talk of shared sovereignty has sent chills through Gibraltar's
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "British or independent, we don't mind, but we don't want to be
Spanish," said Peter McKay, 16.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to be Gibraltarians and be friendly with Britain and with
Spain," added his friend Darion Corbacho, also 16. "I think the ones
that should be speaking are us. The British and Spanish are talking,
[but] the ones who will suffer the consequences are us."</TE>
<TE>   Across the narrow isthmus that connects "the Rock"--a
1,396-foot-high limestone mountain--to Spain, support is strong for
recovery of Spanish sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   It is important to "stop having a colony of one member state [of
the EU] in another member state," said Juan Carlos Juarez Arriola,
mayor of La Linea, the Spanish border town abutting Gibraltar. "As a
first step, shared sovereignty is a good option."</TE>
<TE>   Spain's demand for recovery of Gibraltar "is a historical claim
... and the Spanish government is not going to give that up," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Correra, 58, a retired police officer in Gibraltar, called
Straw's comments in Parliament "such a silly, stupid statement" and
predicted that an agreement on dual sovereignty is impossible. "I
think it will be a stalemate actually, now and for the next few
generations," Correra said.</TE>
<TE>   Many here see hypocrisy in Spain's demand for the return of
Gibraltar while it insists on keeping its own North African enclaves
of Ceuta and Melilla on the Mediterranean coast, surrounded by
Morocco. Spain sent gunboats in July to enforce its claim to a tiny
uninhabited island near Ceuta after a dozen Moroccan soldiers landed
there and raised their country's flag. The two countries later agreed
to restore the status quo by withdrawing all forces from the island.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Azopardi, deputy chief minister of Gibraltar, said he
believes that Britain wants "a period of time when they hope that the
Spaniards use a carrot, and they intend to use a stick, to persuade
the people of Gibraltar to take this deal." But voters here would
never back joint sovereignty, which could undercut the option of an
independent future, he aid.</TE>
<TE>   "Why should we have a solution imposed on us?" Azopardi said.
"This, instead of being decolonization, would be recolonization and
the substitution of one colonial power by two. Everyone else gets
decolonized except the people of Gibraltar. It's legal nonsense, and
nonsense in the context of modern times."</TE>

<HD>The Past, and the West, Beckons to Kaliningrad</HD>
<DH>Russia: Likely to soon be an island amid EU, Baltic enclave
looks askance at Moscow and seeks to affirm German roots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KALININGRAD, Russia</DL>
<LD>Sitting at a terrace cafe in a district of sturdy old German houses,
one could imagine oneself thrust back in time to old Prussia. It is
an apt setting for Yuri Nushtayev, one of the backers of a drive to
readopt this city's original German name, Koenigsberg.</LD>
<LD>   The long-haired graphic designer has no German roots. Like almost
all of the other 950,000 residents of the Kaliningrad region, he is
ethnically and linguistically Russian.</LD>
<LD>   But, as the 32-year-old earnestly explained to a visitor, many
members of his generation are looking for a new future for this
outpost of Russia nestled up against the Baltic that may soon find
itself marooned inside the European Union. That future has a
direction: west.</LD>
<TE>   And first stop in that direction is ending the Soviet practice of
denying the city's past.</TE>
<TE>   Leningrad has gone back to calling itself St. Petersburg.
Sverdlovsk has reverted to Ekaterinburg. But, as the Kremlin sees it,
Kaliningrad is never to become Koenigsberg again.</TE>
<TE>   It's just one example of Moscow's policy toward Kaliningrad that
drives people such as Nushtayev crazy.</TE>
<TE>   Kaliningrad is a name that honors an early Bolshevik and close
associate of Josef Stalin. But this former Prussian capital was known
to knights, merchants, writers, musicians, philosophers and seafarers
as Koenigsberg for 700 years.</TE>
<TE>   But to hear the response of federal authorities--"Madness!" is
typical--it is as if Nushtayev and his friends seek to undo the
Russian victory of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, 57 years after being turned over to Stalin at Potsdam,
and 11 years after it ceased being a closed Soviet district,
Kaliningrad appears to be on everyone's agenda. That's because of the
likely admission of Poland and Lithuania, its immediate neighbors, to
the EU next year--which would make Kaliningrad a Russian island
inside the EU's borders.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament,
fear that the rest of Europe will try to peel Kaliningrad away from
Russia. European diplomats have their worries too, wrestling with how
to protect the EU from smuggling and illegal migrants from the
Russian enclave. Journalists and academics are intrigued by the
question of how this little sliver of Russia, slightly larger than
Connecticut, will fare within the united Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Kaliningrad is a historical and geographic anomaly. Eight hundred
miles from Moscow, its location between Poland and Lithuania leaves
it cut off from the rest of Russia by three international boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Back when the Soviet empire stretched from the Elbe River to
Vladivostok, that didn't matter much. But now that the rest of the
empire has receded, Kaliningrad has been left behind, as it were,
high and dry.</TE>
<TE>   During the Cold War, Kaliningrad's territory and year-round harbor
offered a useful protrusion into Europe for the Soviet military.
Strangers weren't allowed in for secrecy reasons, turning a region
that always had thrived on commerce into a sealed box and a mystery
even to its immediate Eastern Bloc neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   After the Soviet Union fell, Kaliningrad opened up and crime and
sleaze poured in; the region became as well known for its petty
smuggling of vodka and cigarettes, abundant prostitutes, narcotics
and AIDS as it was for buried amber, a semiprecious petrified resin
used in jewelry, and its few surviving German cultural monuments.</TE>
<TE>   With Kaliningrad on course to be surrounded by the azure flag of
the EU, the problem for residents is likely to be sorting out their
place and their identity.</TE>
<TE>   Kaliningraders live closer to 10 European capitals than they do to
Moscow. Some would argue that this city is closer in spirit too.</TE>
<TE>   Old German postcards show Koenigsberg as it was--bustling streets
crowded with stately burgher homes and shops, steepled churches,
streets lined with trees and the main square dominated by a Gothic
royal castle.</TE>
<TE>   Today's Kaliningrad center is unrecognizable. With the exception
of the majestic red-brick cathedral, everything was destroyed during
or after the war. Now, in the center, one sees wide streets lined
with boxy, nondescript, Soviet-built apartment blocks, squat rows of
kiosks for shopping, and empty wind-swept spaces where cars park and
refuse collects.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some Old World charm has managed to survive--alleys of trees
and green parks planted with flower beds, and, on the edges of this
city and in the countryside, sturdy prewar houses whose steep
red-tile roofs flare out at the eaves (and occasionally are crowned
by a voluminous stork's nest).</TE>
<TE>   Mere proximity to Western European values has imbued people in
Kaliningrad with a more cosmopolitan, tolerant and compromising
attitude, people here say.</TE>
<TE>   "If you wanted to sum it up, Kaliningraders are more civilized
than the rest of Russia," said Sergei Pasko, a leader of the Baltic
Republican Party. Behind him hung the red-white-and-blue flag with a
golden compass star that he hopes one day will become the banner of
an autonomous "Baltic Republic."</TE>
<TE>   It would be going too far to say that a large proportion of people
in the region want independence. Even Pasko's separatist party
believes that there should be "association" with Russia.</TE>
<TE>   But there are abundant signs that people here--as in many of
Russia's 89 republics and regions--chafe at what they see as callous
and arbitrary decision-making in Moscow that does not always take
into account their interests.</TE>
<TE>   "So far the situation with separatism is hypothetical," said
Soloman I. Ginsburg, a member of the regional parliament. But
sentiment for independence could grow in 10 years if Kaliningrad
under Russian governance does not manage to close the gap in living
standards with its European neighbors, he predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "Obtaining a Mercedes will be a stronger motivating factor than
the wish to look at Russian birch trees," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The most pressing problem facing Russia and Kaliningrad is the
EU's insistence that Poland and Lithuania, starting next July, impose
visa requirements for people entering their territory from Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials seemed caught by surprise and reacted
indignantly. In tones that made some feel that he was making
Soviet-style threats, Russian President Vladimir V. Putin denounced
the EU's proposal and said it would be "worse than the Cold War."</TE>
<TE>   He said Russia wouldn't accept any situation in which someone from
another country would determine whether a Russian citizen could
travel from Russia proper to the Kaliningrad enclave. At first,
Putin's proposed solution was for sealed trains and/or a visa-free
corridor across Lithuania and Poland to get around the problem.</TE>
<TE>   But these proposals didn't sit well with the EU. Now Russia seems
to be asking the EU to adopt a very liberal no-visa-needed policy
toward all Russians similar to the one the bloc has with Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the sides began what is likely to be a drawn-out
negotiating process in Brussels to find a compromise that protects
the EU's security while not--in the words of French President Jacques
Chirac--"humiliating" Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Visa worries are felt acutely these days in Kaliningrad. The EU
policy would have "very grave consequences economically," said
Alexander S. Karetsky, a lifelong resident and now spokesman for the
regional governor, Vladimir Yegorev, who happens to be the
ex-commander of the Russian Baltic Fleet.</TE>
<TE>   To an American visitor, Karetsky asked, "What if to travel from
the main part of the United States to Alaska, you needed a visa from
Canada? Wouldn't that be ridiculous?"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, even under the EU's plan, people would still be able to
travel freely to Russia by plane or ferry. But most people now go by
car or bus. About two-thirds of Kaliningraders don't even have
passports, and to impose even a modest visa fee would be burdensome
for people often earning less than $100 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the visa question is a difficult one, most people
believe that Russia and the EU will eventually find a way to finesse
the issue. For residents, it is vital, not so much because they need
to travel back to Russia, but because their livelihood is linked to
their Baltic Sea neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, Kaliningrad is reverting to form.</TE>
<TE>   Founded by crusading Teutonic knights who subdued (and virtually
wiped out) the indigenous pagan tribes of the area, Koenigsberg in
the Middle Ages was a member of the Hanseatic League, a federation of
trading towns spread along the Baltic. Its port and its commerce
brought riches to the city, making it one of the jewels of
northeastern Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In 1945, Koenigsberg and its surrounding area in what had been
East Prussia was formally recognized by Allied leaders at Potsdam as
belonging to the Soviet Union. The victorious Red Army was already
there. Most of the German population had already fled or been killed,
and the remnants would soon be roughly relocated to the Soviet
occupation zone of Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Nazi Germany was to be punished for its wartime aggression by
losing East Prussia; Stalin decreed that Soviet citizens should move
in and erase all memories of Prussia from this new Soviet territory.</TE>
<TE>   Historic buildings, heavily damaged by the war, were torn down
rather than restored. Streets and cities were renamed wholesale. In
the countryside, collective farms supplanted baronial manors and
feudal estates.</TE>
<TE>   Yuri V. Kostyashof, a historian at Kaliningrad State University,
says that Soviet authorities had an unofficial motto--"To erase the
Prussian spirit from the land"--and that is why they were so avid to
destroy anything that smacked of the city's Germanic past.</TE>
<TE>   Now he believes strongly that today's Kaliningrad would benefit
from an honest interpretation of its past and that the historical
record of Koenigsberg would provide insights into today's political
discussions about the enclave's future.</TE>
<TE>   "Koenigsberg flourished only at times when it had good relations
with its neighboring countries," he said. "The openness of the
Kaliningrad region to the outer world is the main guarantor of its
prosperity. That is what history teaches."</TE>

<HD>Filmmaker Turns 100 Amid Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Germany: A Gypsy group accuses Nazi-era artist Leni
Riefenstahl of Holocaust denial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Leni Riefenstahl, who made masterful films for the Nazis, turned 100
on Thursday with a birthday party at a lakeside hotel--and a fresh
criminal investigation into whether she broke German law prohibiting
Holocaust denial.</LD>
<LD>   The inquiry was prompted by a Gypsy organization's claim that
Riefenstahl used slave laborers from concentration camps as extras in
her film "Lowland."</LD>
<LD>   The accusation by the Cologne-based organization Rom said
Riefenstahl used 120 Gypsies from camps in Salzburg and Berlin from
1940 to 1942, then failed to prevent them from being returned to the
Nazi camp system, where many died.</LD>
<TE>   The group accuses Riefenstahl of Holocaust denial for dismissing
those allegations as nonsense in an April interview published in the
Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw all the Gypsies that played in 'Lowland' again after the
war," Riefenstahl was quoted as saying. "Nothing happened to them."</TE>
<TE>   Iris Pinkepank, spokeswoman for Rom, said her organization could
prove that many of those Gypsies died by comparing Riefenstahl's
lists of people appearing in the film with records from the Nazi
death camp at Auschwitz in German-occupied Poland.</TE>
<TE>   "Leni Riefenstahl is a woman who cares for her own history--she
makes sure that only the truth she wants to read and only her version
is published," Pinkepank said. "But there are some survivors still
living, and we have contact with them and they want their version to
be told."</TE>
<TE>   Frankfurt prosecutor's spokesman Job Tilman said his office opened
a preliminary investigation, which could lead to criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Although postwar American and French panels cleared Riefenstahl of
responsibility for war crimes, she has been dogged by allegations
that she was more deeply involved in the Nazi cause than she admits.</TE>
<TE>   German media reports on Riefenstahl's birthday--celebrated
privately with nearly 200 friends near her Munich-area home--reflect
the difficulty many have in trying to reconcile her place in history.</TE>
<TE>   "Old woman, or Hitler's witch? Filmmaker of the century or the
Fuehrer's career woman? Pinup girl of the Nazis, or only narcissist?"
wrote the top-selling Bild national newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   In Die Welt newspaper, several of Riefenstahl's peers, including
"Basic Instinct" director Paul Verhoeven, focused on her contribution
to filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   Verhoeven said Riefenstahl's "Triumph of the Will," a documentary
of the 1934 Nazi party rally at Nuremberg, was the work of a
brilliant artist.</TE>
<TE>   Verhoeven said Riefenstahl should be given the same second chance
given other artists with close Nazi connections.</TE>

<HD>China Puts Brakes on Personalized License Plates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>China's capital and other main cities have suspended a program that
allowed car owners to have personalized license plates, after
complaints that some choices were rude, politically incorrect or
otherwise objectionable, including one reading "USA 911," official
media reported Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Ten days after the program was launched, traffic authorities
reverted to choosing plates themselves, the New China News Agency
reported.</LD>
<LD>   A Beijing traffic administration official, who declined to give
his name, confirmed that the plan had been suspended but would not
say why.</LD>
<TE>   There was no word on when or if the program would resume.</TE>
<TE>   The program was also suspended in the cities of Hangzhou, Tianjin
and Shenzhen, news reports said.</TE>
<TE>   It allowed drivers to pick a three-letter, three-number
combination for their plates.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the apparent reference to the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks in the United States, the combinations included "SEX 001" and
"TMD"--representing the key letters in a common Chinese obscenity.
Other combinations included "FBI," "UFO" and "VIP."</TE>
<TE>   Some combinations posed potential intellectual-property problems,
news reports said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those were BTV, the name of Beijing's main local
broadcaster, and U.S. computer giant IBM.</TE>
<TE>   The program received an enthusiastic response from China's growing
ranks of mostly young, first-time car owners.</TE>
<TE>   About 23,000 personalized plates were issued during the program,
news reports said. It wasn't clear whether any of those would be
recalled.</TE>

<HD>Pigs Stripped of Rejection Gene</HD>
<DH>Science: Cloning project seeks to make animal organ
transplants viable for humans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Scientists announced Thursday that they have cloned piglets lacking
both copies of a gene that makes the human immune system reject
transplanted organs from pigs.</LD>
<LD>   In the United States, Britain and other countries, organ failure
is the major cause of death and disability. With a shortage of human
organs for transplant, many die while waiting for them--6,000 last
year in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "Developing another source of organs would have a profound impact
on society, so from a practical perspective this is a very important
advance," said Dr. Jeffrey L. Platt, director of transplantation
biology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. "And even if it
doesn't solve the problem, it will answer very important questions in
the field."</LD>
<TE>   PPL Therapeutics, the Scottish company that in 1996 helped breed
Dolly the sheep, the first cloned mammal, announced that four healthy
piglets with both copies of the gene "knocked out" were born July 25
at the company's U.S. subsidiary in Blacksburg, Va.</TE>
<TE>   A fifth piglet died shortly after birth of unknown causes, it
said.</TE>
<TE>   The next step is to transplant pig organs into other animals, such
as baboons, to see whether the organs can function in the primates
for at least three months. Geoff Cook, chief executive of PPL
Therapeutics, said studies testing pig organs in humans could start
within two years.</TE>
<TE>   It is unknown whether the elimination of the gene will solve the
rejection problem. There could be other aspects of human immune
response involved. Another worry is whether the organs could carry
harmful pig viruses.</TE>

<HD>Killing Forests to Save Them</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clearly, the Oregon fire that President Bush used as a backdrop
Thursday was as catastrophic as he said it was. Bush was also right
in saying the United States needed an aggressive program to reduce
the danger of such fires, especially when they threaten people and
homes. But the answer is not in allowing timber companies to
indiscriminately rev up their chain saws or in undermining the
nation's basic environmental protection laws.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration is using this drought-driven fire year to
lend political credence to the efforts of timber executives to roll
back the protection given the forests in recent years against more
logging and road-building.</LD>
<LD>   Bush wants to contract with loggers to thin as much as 190 million
acres of federal forest land--an area about the size of Indiana--in
exchange for cutting commercial-value logs, presumably in the thinned
areas, but also large trees that survive forest fires. That sounds
like logging the forests to save them.</LD>
<TE>   Bush defends the plan as a way for the forests themselves to pay
for fire protection, saying "there's nothing wrong with people being
able to earn a living off of effective forest management." But the
key to holding down forest fires is in clearing the tangle of brush
and small trees that have little commercial value and allowing the
larger, more fire-resistant trees to remain uncut. The older trees
shelter wildlife, help maintain clean watersheds and provide
recreation areas.</TE>
<TE>   The president's program also would remove from law a provision
that he claimed "imposed extraordinary procedural requirements" on
the Forest Service when projects were challenged. One lumber
executive decried such challenges as "this runaway train of
mismanagement and lawsuit abuse." But a federal report says only 20
of 1,671 thinning projects in fiscal 2001 were challenged and none
went to court.</TE>
<TE>   A more reasonable blueprint for forest protection is at hand--the
landmark Sierra Nevada Framework, which would coordinate management
of 11 national forests in the Sierra. Its focus is on clearing trees
and brush around vulnerable communities. Trees of up to 30 inches in
diameter--valuable as lumber--could be cut within a quarter-mile of
any settlement and trees of up to 20 inches in diameter within the
next mile and a quarter. These areas should get priority, rather than
remote forests that are valuable for their big timber but where fires
pose little threat to people.</TE>
<TE>   If logging companies are concerned about red tape affecting
efforts to clear underbrush, Congress should order a simpler fix
without weakening environmental laws. Otherwise the nation will be
holding a fire sale that only a logger could enjoy.</TE>

<LD>Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf's usurping of constitutional
powers demands more than muted murmurs of protest. He's a front-line
partner in the United States' war on terrorism and he faces threats
from terrorists within Pakistan, but Washington should tell the
general he is leading his country down a well-trod path to disaster.</LD>
<LD>   Musharraf admitted this week that most people he talked to about
planned constitutional changes opposed them. Yet he unilaterally
imposed amendments that would let him dissolve the elected
parliament, appoint Supreme Court justices and decide who would head
the armed forces.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage is due in
Pakistan this weekend. He should tell Musharraf that when the Bush
administration proclaims its support for democracy around the world,
it doesn't mean just in Iraq and Iran. Democracy should start with
U.S. allies such as Pakistan.</LD>
<TE>   Military rulers have run Pakistan for about half the time since it
became independent from Britain in 1947. They usually are welcomed as
replacements for corrupt and incompetent governments, as was
Musharraf when he seized power in 1999. But eventually the military
regimes allow corruption to spread or lose a war with India or become
heavy-handed and unpopular.</TE>
<TE>   Normally that takes years; Musharraf has squandered his popularity
in months, making enemies not just among Islamic radicals but among
Pakistanis hoping for democracy.</TE>
<TE>   The major U.S. concern is that Pakistan continue the search for
Taliban and Al Qaeda members and stop infiltrators from crossing into
India. But Washington also should remind Musharraf that the country
would be better off as a democracy.</TE>
<TE>   The general needs Pakistanis' support as he tries to stop Sunni
Muslims from killing Shiites and Islamic fundamentalists from killing
Christians. The violence in Pakistan is so bad the State Department
has urged Americans in the country to leave and closed the consulate
in Karachi to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf said the parliament to be elected in October would not
have the power to repeal his changes, but legislators should ask the
Supreme Court to overrule him. In April, Musharraf extended his rule
by five years through a referendum so rigged he was forced to
apologize.</TE>
<TE>   The general's creation of a national security council with some
seats held by the military institutionalizes the military's role in
government. That may prove to be better than having army generals
active behind the scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf now needs to end the violence in Pakistan and give the
country a period of stability, during which he should consult with
the elected parliament and encourage a new generation of politicians
not tainted by corruption to join him in building democracy in a
nation where it has mostly been a stranger.</TE>

<LD>The region known for its freeways and sprawl is not just inhospitable
to pedestrians. It's often lethal. Los Angeles County led the nation
with 230 pedestrian fatalities last year and ranked seventh in per
capita deaths.</LD>
<LD>   Almost half--104--were on Los Angeles city streets. Stretches of
Westlake, Echo Park, Hollywood and Boyle Heights are especially
dangerous, according to a Times computer-assisted analysis published
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Reporters Hugo Martin and Maloy Moore looked at more than 2,500
pedestrian deaths from 1993 through 2001 and found the highest
concentrations in crowded urban areas bisected by busy streets and
populated by low-income residents. No surprise there. What they
didn't find in those areas were the flashing and striped crosswalks
and other safety upgrades credited with helping reduce fatalities in
the rest of the county.</LD>
<TE>   It is often said that nobody walks in Los Angeles. More
accurately, almost nobody with alternatives walks. No wonder the
poor, the elderly and children make up a disproportionate share of
pedestrian fatalities. An additional 1,700 to 2,000 pedestrians
countywide are hospitalized after accidents each year.</TE>
<TE>   Pedestrian deaths and injuries are preventable. Those on foot put
themselves at risk if they jaywalk or wear dark clothes at night.
Nationally, one-third of adult victims are legally intoxicated. On
the other side of the steering wheel are the drunk drivers, the
speeders and the drivers who, yakking on their cell phones, charge
through crosswalks even when pedestrians wear Day-Glo orange.</TE>
<TE>   Both pedestrians and drivers need educating. The city, however,
should go beyond the usual billboards and other public outreach and
put into walking safety the kind of energy and resources devoted to
driving safety.</TE>
<TE>   Safety advocates recommend such steps as adding and improving
sidewalks, siting playgrounds away from streets and restricting
on-street parking.</TE>
<TE>   Longer crossing times at traffic lights allow the elderly to reach
the curb or traffic island. "Smart" crosswalks warn drivers by
flashing lights when a pedestrian steps off the curb. Either might
have saved Luis Bosch Guzman, a 77-year-old Army veteran and Echo
Park resident who in 1996 was killed by a speeding pickup. Bosch had
almost made it across busy Alvarado Boulevard when the traffic signal
changed.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Department, spurred by 15 child pedestrian
deaths last year, has stepped up enforcement at schools, ticketing
parents who double-park and kids who dart across traffic. The
computer analysis by The Times gives the city valuable information
about where else to concentrate its efforts.</TE>

<LD>Re "EU Fear-Mongers' Lethal Harvest," Opinion, Aug. 18: It becomes
obvious from a brief review of Ronald Bailey's work that he believes
more in the rights of a corporation to generate profits than the
rights of the public to enjoy a diverse and healthy source of food.
The primary intent of agribusiness is to gain control of the vast
"people have to eat" market. Widespread distribution of genetically
modified organisms puts complete control of human nutrition into the
hands of a few corporations. In 2000, seeds marketed by Monsanto made
up 91% of all genetically engineered crops.</LD>
<LD>   This is a battle we always have to fight. What bothers me more is
Bailey's attempt to misinform the public by referring to the corn as
"genetically enhanced to protect it against insects." The only reason
the corn was modified was to gain a profit, in the short run or the
long run. The corn was shown to have two Monsanto modifications,
Roundup Ready and BTExtra. "Roundup Ready" means the crop is not
affected by Roundup herbicide, an herbicide that Monsanto sells. Next
it will want to bottle the air.</LD>

<TE>   Again and again we gullible consumers have been told that various
substances (DDT and other chemicals, smog, asbestos, many drugs) with
which we come into daily contact, some courtesy of agribusiness, are
safe, only to find out later, sometimes many years later, that they
are anything but. Why should we now believe that the "safe" genetic
manipulation of the food we eat will turn out any differently? No
"Frankenfood" for me.</TE>

16: Finally, we may make some headway as to what happened on Sept.
11. The media and the Republican administration have dragged their
feet in getting to the bottom of this horrendous terrorist act
perpetrated on our country. It took the unwavering courage of the
families of the victims coming together to sue the Saudis--and anyone
else connected to this treacherous act--to get to the truth.</LD>

<HD>Heston Not to Blame for Misuse of Guns</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George Clark (letter, Aug. 21) blames Charlton Heston for the deeds
of criminals misusing guns and asks if Heston would weep about these
deeds. I am sure Heston feels sorrow about these events, as any
decent person would. However, to blame him for them is ridiculous.
One might as well blame a car enthusiast for bank robbery. (Robbers
couldn't do it without a getaway car, right?)</LD>
<LD>   Far from weeping about what he has accomplished, Heston should,
and probably does, take great pride in having fought for a right
considered so important by the founding fathers that they put it
second in the Bill of Rights. Voluminous research shows that murder
rates go down when citizens are permitted to carry concealed
firearms. At the same time, no law has ever stopped lawbreakers from
having items they want. Just think about drugs inside prisons. Gun
bans simply disarm the law-abiding, thereby emboldening criminals.
Heston's efforts have saved many lives on balance. Bravo to a brave
man for a job well done and best wishes for the strength to carry on!</LD>

<TE>   As someone who has known and worked with Charlton Heston for 20
years, I am not surprised at all that he maintained a sense of
self-respect in the face of the devastating experience of Alzheimer's
disease ("Heston Faces His Illness Squarely," Aug. 18). In our work
together he taught me the prime importance of grace under pressure.
Watching his sad announcement only reminded me of the courage I have
witnessed in him countless times in private.</TE>

<LD>Where is the critical eye in "L.A. Unified Hails Reforms as Test
Scores Rise for Fourth Year" (Aug. 21)? In this front-page article on
LAUSD gains in reading and math scores on the Stanford 9 exam, the
writers quote only teachers, district officials and educational
experts who favorably view the testing program and the changes
standardized testing and standards have brought into California
schools. Is there no one who thinks test scores are rising because
students and teachers are growing accustomed to the Stanford 9 test?
Is there no one who questions whether higher test scores really mean
students possess stronger skills? Is there no one who laments the
loss of meaningful art, music or science education in the regular
primary-grade curriculum due to the increased time spent on scripted
language and math instruction?</LD>

<LD>It is obvious that the Bush administration doesn't have the ability
or the intention to make an informed decision regarding the next step
in its war on terrorism. Without any proof that Saddam Hussein or
Iraq had anything to do with the attacks on Sept. 11 (despite an
exhaustive search by the FBI and the CIA), the administration is
trying to manufacture the truth to suit its military goals.
Meanwhile, as stated in Robert Scheer's Aug. 20 commentary, 15 of the
hijackers and Osama bin Laden are from Saudi Arabia, our ally.</LD>
<LD>   These are strange, dangerous times for the U.S. and the world. We
desperately need a leader with a basic understanding of the history
and the complexities of the region, someone who can take a step back
and develop a working strategy to save lives and prevent war. Bush
and Vice President Dick Cheney are not up to that challenge. I
predict that invading Iraq--as a quasi-response to what happened last
year--will be a catastrophe. It will bring worldwide condemnation and
create an even more enduring hatred from factions around the globe.
The Bush administration will deal with the fallout for only two more
years. We will have to deal with the effects indefinitely.</LD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis will announce a series of steps today aimed at
strengthening corporate accountability in California, including
seeking to revoke the license of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm
and stiffening the penalties for securities law violations,
administration officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Seizing on a national issue as he seeks reelection, the Democratic
governor also will sign three bills tightening controls on corporate
accounting practices and appoint a prominent consumer advocate to the
state board that regulates the accounting industry, the officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   The bills that Davis is poised to sign will put California at the
forefront of corporate accountability efforts, consumer advocates
said.</LD>
<TE>   "This package of bills will help restore consumer confidence in
the financial practices underpinning our corporate system," said
Betsy Imholz, director of the West Coast office of Consumers Union, a
national consumers advocacy group. "And we believe restoring the
public confidence in corporate accountability is critical at this
point."</TE>
<TE>   Recent scandals involving Enron, WorldCom and other corporate
high-fliers have rocked the U.S. economy and ravaged the 401(k)
retirement plans of millions of Americans by causing stock prices to
plummet.</TE>
<TE>   For Davis, the issue of corporate responsibility offers the
possibility of increased political profit because of the recent focus
on the business practices of his opponent, Republican Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign advertisements have hammered the Republican
candidate over a Los Angeles jury's $78-million judgment against the
Simon family financial firm and an IRS investigation of Simon's use
of offshore tax shelters.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of Davis' corporate accountability initiative may be
more than coincidence: President Bush begins a California swing today
that Simon supporters hope will help their candidate's battered
campaign and take some of the public focus off Simon's business
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate reform has been high on the White House agenda recently
as well. In late July, Bush signed a law aimed at cracking down on
questionable business practices.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is scheduled to announce corporate accountability reforms
during an appearance today at a senior assisted-living center in
Culver City, administration officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor will also disclose that the Board of Accountancy is
seeking to revoke the license of Arthur Andersen, which would bar the
firm from the public accounting business in California. The firm was
linked to Enron's problems, among others. The board filed the action
against Arthur Andersen on Aug. 16, an hour after learning that the
state of Texas had lifted the firm's license, administration
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, the Texas action is grounds for revocation
of an accounting firm's license.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Andersen officials could not be reached Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Davis will also name Gail K. Hillebrand to the California Board of
Accountancy, which regulates the accounting industry in the state.
Hillebrand, 46, of Albany, is a senior attorney at Consumers Union,
the advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   The three bills the governor is scheduled to sign are:</TE>
<TE>   * AB 2873, by Assembly members Dario Frommer (D-Los Feliz) and Lou
Correa (D-Anaheim), aimed at preventing the sort of
document-shredding that came to light in the Enron scandal. It
requires companies to retain audit documents and records for a
minimum of seven years;</TE>
<TE>   * AB 270, by Correa and Sen. Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont), strengthens
state accounting laws and ends accounting industry domination of the
Board of Accountancy by requiring a public majority;</TE>
<TE>   * AB 2970, by Assemblyman Howard Wayne (D-San Diego), targets the
"revolving door" between accounting firms and their clients. It bars
accounting firm employees from going to work for a client within 12
months of providing audit services.</TE>
<TE>   Davis will also announce a stiffening of criminal fines and prison
terms for securities law violations, which the administration says
will "boost investor confidence and protect consumers from corporate
and accounting irregularities."</TE>
<TE>   The criminal fine for general securities law convictions will
increase from $1 million to $5 million; the maximum criminal fine for
securities fraud convictions will increase from $10 million to $25
million, and prison terms will be lengthened from two to five years
to five to 20 years.</TE>

<HD>Lawmaker Drops Ahmanson Support</HD>
<DH>Growth: Assemblyman Keith Richman, a Valley mayoral
candidate, urges a new study on how the development would affect
traffic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge) has withdrawn his support
for the controversial Ahmanson Ranch mini-city and called for a new
study of its effect on San Fernando Valley roadways--a review that
would further delay a project stalled for a decade and raise
questions about whether it will ever be built.</LD>
<LD>   Richman, a mayoral candidate for the proposed San Fernando Valley
city, asked Ventura County officials late Wednesday for a new study
after concluding that old traffic projections are unreliable
indicators of jams the project would cause on nearby roads.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed 3,050-home project is just across the Ventura County
line from Woodland Hills and Calabasas. Most Los Angeles politicians
and many Valley residents oppose it. It was approved by Ventura
County in 1992 but delayed by legal challenges and environmental
issues.</LD>
<TE>   Richman, whose district includes parts of Ventura County and the
Valley, had been the project's staunchest public supporter among
elected officials, even writing a newspaper essay in support last
September. But after declaring his mayoral candidacy in June, he said
he was rethinking that position.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm extremely concerned about the impact of the Ahmanson Ranch
project on the surrounding communities," Richman said in an
interview. "I'm withdrawing my support until I'm confident the
traffic issues have been addressed and [can be] mitigated. We need to
know what the true traffic numbers are."</TE>
<TE>   Tim McGarry, a spokesman for Ahmanson Ranch owner Washington
Mutual Bank, said the bank still intends to break ground next year
after Ventura County approves a new study about how to protect the
threatened red-legged frog and the spineflower, which was discovered
on the ranch in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Richman has his facts wrong," McGarry said. "According to
Caltrans, traffic projections in the 1992 [study] remain reasonably
accurate, and a new study would not tell anyone anything they do not
already know....Responsible leaders should tell the public the
truth."</TE>
<TE>   In his letter to Ventura County officials, Richman, a physician,
said the 1992 Ahmanson Ranch environmental study had underestimated
traffic growth on key roads--such as the Ventura Freeway and Victory
Boulevard--by up to 38%.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the material, unanticipated change in traffic volumes
before a single Ahmanson unit has been built, additional traffic
mitigation measures are clearly warranted," the lawmaker wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was basing his conclusions on analyses by Los Angeles
city and county officials and environmental and community groups. He
said he had studied nearly a foot of documents in making his
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "There seems to be a great degree of contention regarding the
traffic numbers on the 101 Freeway, access roads and also the roads
in the San Fernando Valley," Richman said. "There's been a
significant degree of development along the 101 corridor."</TE>
<TE>   McGarry said nearly all of the freeway traffic growth was
anticipated in the original 1992 traffic study, and that Ahmanson
trips would be only a small part of the increasing congestion. "The
problems of the 101 are the product of regional growth, not just one
project," McGarry said.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmanson's projected 37,500 vehicle trips on all Valley freeways
and roads would be about half of the 72,000 daily trips created by 84
new projects built along a nearby stretch of the Ventura Freeway in
the last decade, McGarry said.</TE>
<TE>   In an updated analysis this year, the Ventura County
transportation department concluded that the 1992 Ahmanson Ranch
traffic study was still a valid assessment of future conditions on
the Ventura Freeway. And the California Department of Transportation
has concurred.</TE>
<TE>   The difference between 1992 traffic projections for six segments
of the freeway closest to the project and the actual Caltrans counts
in 2000 ranges between 2.6% and 8% more traffic, said Ventura County
planner Dennis Hawkins. But those same numbers can be crunched in
different ways, Hawkins said. "There's a lot of statistical
manipulation that can be done to make it look better or worse," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for opposition group Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch said
Richman's switch represents a turning point in the campaign to stop
Washington Mutual from developing its 2,800-acre project.</TE>
<TE>   "There is now no elected official that publicly supports
Washington Mutual's disastrous development," campaign director Chad
Griffin said. "It's significant because they had always held out
Keith Richman as someone who believed this was a responsible
development. They have constantly used his name to give their side
legitimacy."</TE>
<TE>   McGarry said Richman's switch doesn't affect the company's
position. "We continue to believe that Ahmanson Ranch is a good
project," he said. "It should be built, and will be built."</TE>

<DH>Fire ant: Visiting official learns from a model campaign,
which sees eradication by 2005.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A fleet of vans from the Orange County Fire Ant Authority broke the
midday calm in a red-roofed Mission Viejo neighborhood Thursday,
carrying a troop of exterminators on the prowl for a tiny but
potentially deadly invader.</LD>
<LD>   The county's battle to eradicate the imported red fire ant--a
stinging interloper from South America that was discovered in Orange
County in 1998--has been so successful that the program has become a
model for other areas similarly overrun.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, the crew was joined by one of Australia's top
agricultural officials because Orange County is closer to eradicating
the stubborn imported fire ant population than anywhere in the
nation, and two invasions have recently been discovered in Queensland
state.</LD>
<TE>   "These ants are the world's greatest invaders. They truly hate
every living thing," said Keith McCubbin, director of the Fire Ant
Control Centre in Queensland.</TE>
<TE>   The reddish-brown bugs are typically less than a quarter-inch
long. They pierce human skin with their pincers, and a barbed stinger
causes a painful blister.</TE>
<TE>   The insects are known for swarming. They silently coordinate their
attack, using pheromones, so that hundreds sting at once. At least 36
deaths have been attributed to red fire ants, including, in 2000,
that of an 87-year-old nursing home patient with Alzheimer's disease
in Sarasota, Fla., who was bitten 1,625 times as she lay in bed.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, field workers were spraying a form of ant birth
control onto the perimeter ridges of the Painted Trails development.
In parks and schools, they also use a chemical that stops the insects
from metabolizing food, causing them to starve to death.</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 18,800 infested sites in Orange County, which
is spending $11.6 million over five years to get rid of the ants.
After treatment, 97% of the colonies appear to be gone. Eradication
is likely by 2005, officials said.</TE>

<LD>A fleet of vans from the Orange County Fire Ant Authority broke the

<LD>   The county's battle to eradicate the imported red fire ant--a
stinging interloper from South America that was discovered in Orange

model for other areas similarly overrun.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, the crew was joined by one of Australia's top
agricultural officials because Orange County is closer to eradicating
the stubborn imported fire ant population than anywhere in the
nation. The local fire ant infestations mimic two recently discovered
ant invasions in the Australian state of Queensland, which could
devastate the island nation's fragile ecosystems.</LD>
<TE>   "These ants are the world's greatest invaders. They truly hate
every living thing," said Keith McCubbin, director of the Fire Ant
Control Centre in Queensland.</TE>
<TE>   The Australian government has committed $145 million over five
years to get rid of infestations centered around the port and western
suburbs of Brisbane. To devise the best fire ant strategy, McCubbin
came seeking advice from Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Bowen, the county's program manager, added, "Observing our
progress is logical. We have a one-year head start on their program,
our climates are similar and both infestations are somewhat
isolated."</TE>
<TE>   Imported red fire ants are indigenous to South America, but were
first found in the United States in Mobile, Ala. Now, they have
spread through the humid Southeast and have also infested parts of
California and the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   The reddish-brown bugs are typically less than a quarter-inch
long. They pierce human skin with their pincers, and a barbed stinger
causes a painful blister.</TE>
<TE>   The insects are known for swarming. They silently coordinate their
attack, using pheromones, so that hundreds sting at once. At least 36
deaths have been attributed to red fire ants, including, in 2000,
that of an 87-year-old nursing home patient with Alzheimer's disease
in Sarasota, Fla., who was bitten 1,625 times as she lay in her bed.</TE>
<TE>   McCubbin also visited Texas, which has been overrun by the insects
and where eradication isn't even an option. The only solution there
is to control the infestations, so the state offered a picture of how
grave the situation could become if Australia doesn't act now, he
said. He also visited Merced to view infestations in almond orchards,
a safety issue for workers.</TE>
<TE>   But the situation in Orange County could shed the most light on
how best to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, field workers were spraying a form of ant birth
control onto the perimeter ridges of the Painted Trails development.
In parks and schools, they also use a chemical that stops the insects
from metabolizing food, causing them to starve to death.</TE>
<TE>   Experts once suggested aerial spraying, which local officials
immediately nixed. Instead, they chose the two chemicals that are
"less toxic than table salt," said Mike Hearst, communications
director of the county's Fire Ant Authority.</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 18,800 infested sites in Orange County, which
is spending $11.6 million over five years to get rid of the ants.
After treatment, 97% of the colonies appear to be gone. Hearst said
eradication is likely by 2005.</TE>

<HD>Dog Charges Woman, Biting Her 14 Times</HD>
<DH>Attacks: Natalie Elliott is saved when her sister kicks the
pit bull in the ribs. Orange boy mauled Saturday by another dog is
released from hospital.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A pit bull attacked a 26-year-old woman Thursday in Garden Grove,
jumping on top of her and leaving her with 14 bite marks.</LD>
<LD>   Natalie Elliott of Anaheim was visiting family members when a
brown, red-nose pit bull named Princess rushed her, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   Elliott was kneeling on the ground with her Lakeland terrier,
Buddy, when the pit bull charged her from behind, said Elliott's
sister, Michelle Risser, who witnessed the attack. Elliot was knocked
to the ground while she struggled to protect her own dog.</LD>
<TE>   "She was really hysterical," Risser said. "The dog was yanking and
yanking her arms and I thought, 'Oh my God! The pit bull's going to
get on top of her."</TE>
<TE>   Elliot suffered 14 bites on her arms before Risser was able to get
the dog away by kicking it in the ribs.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics treated Elliott's wounds at the scene. She was later
taken to Garden Grove Hospital and Medical Center by relatives for
further observation.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Vargas, one of the pit bull's owners, said Princess was able
to run outside their yard because the gardeners had left the backyard
gate open.</TE>
<TE>   "She is a very friendly dog," said Vargas' mother, Angelus, as
they sat in the frontyard. "My little daughter always kisses and
plays with her."</TE>
<TE>   Animal control officials took Princess to the Orange County Animal
Shelter, where she will remain for nine days of observation.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday marks another in a series of dog attacks in the last few
days. Los Angeles postal worker Phyllis Sanders suffered severe bites
to her face and nose Monday when two dogs--a pit bull and a shepherd
mix--mauled her as she was delivering mail.</TE>
<TE>   Two-year-old John Michael Macias-Drisner of Orange was taken to
UCI Medical Center on Saturday after an attack left him with several
cuts and deep bite marks on his head, face, chest and legs. Doctors
gave the boy 100 to 150 stitches during three hours of surgery.</TE>
<TE>   The boy was released Thursday after four days in the pediatric
intensive care unit and two days in the pediatric ward.</TE>
<TE>   "Little Michael is not completely out of the woods, but everything
looks good so far," said UCI Medical Center spokeswoman Marcida
Dodson.</TE>
<TE>   Pit bulls are the most commonly reported breed involved in fatal
attacks on humans, according to a report in the Journal of the
American Veterinary Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "People have ruined the breed," said Los Angeles Animal Services
spokeswoman Jackie David. She said that people have bred one
aggressive pit bull with another, increasing the number of vicious
dogs. "The breed itself is not a bad breed," David said. "However,
you have to understand that you are dealing with a really powerful
animal."</TE>

<HD>Backbone Trail Is 4 Miles Longer After Ceremony</HD>
<DH>Park: New section of path through Santa Monicas will help
connect Point Mugu and Pacific Palisades.</DH>

<LD>With sweeping ocean views and rugged peaks as backdrops, national
park officials and lawmakers dedicated the latest stretch of the
Backbone Trail on Thursday, saying they expect the vast, 69-mile
ribbon of footpaths to be finished next year.</LD>
<LD>   "This trail has to be the crowning achievement of the park," said
Woody Smeck, acting superintendent of the Santa Monica Mountains
National Recreation Area. "It will be the longest trail in the
mountains."</LD>
<LD>   The new four-mile segment leaves just 1.5 miles of trail left for
development in the 30-year effort to join Point Mugu State Park in
Ventura County and Will Rogers State Park in Pacific Palisades by
footpath.</LD>
<TE>   Sitting in a remote spot 2,100 feet above the Pacific Ocean, the
latest trail addition is an easy, level hike with minimal elevation
gain along the way.</TE>
<TE>   "At this height, there is little evidence of development, so you
really feel you are in a wilderness," Smeck said.</TE>
<TE>   On clear days, the trail offers stunning views of the Pacific
Ocean and the Channel Islands, along with a wide array of volcanic
rock formations, colorful lichens and rare red shank chaparral.
Sandstone Peak looks down on the broad, winding path as it links with
the rest of the Backbone Trail.</TE>
<TE>   The new trail, which took eight months to build, will open in
September.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) peered into
the steep canyons and up at the jagged peaks, describing the view as
like being in Sequoia National Park "without having to make motel
reservations."</TE>
<TE>   "We are celebrating the fact that those in much better shape than
I can hike from Tarzana to Point Mugu up the longest trail that
starts in an urban area," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman said he has secured $22 million in federal funds since
1996 for trail and land acquisitions in the park. The latest four
miles were obtained after paying $950,000 for 11 parcels of land from
private owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only do we have tremendous complexity of ecosystems here, but
we have the legal complexities of acquiring land in the Los Angeles
metropolitan area," Sherman said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the entire project could be completed in a year,
with negotiations underway to buy the last five parcels of land
needed or create public rights of way through them.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica Mountains, believed to be the world's largest
urban national park, encompass 150,050 acres and attract 35 million
visitors a year. About 60 miles of the Backbone Trail are already in
use.</TE>
<TE>   Milt McAuley, 83, knows the mountains better than most. He has
written seven guidebooks to the area, including "Guide to the
Backbone Trail" and "Hiking Trails of the Santa Monica Mountains."</TE>
<TE>   The bushy-browed Canoga Park man watched Thursday's ceremonies
from beneath his Panama hat.</TE>
<TE>   "A hundred years ago, they called this the Devil's Backbone
Trail," he said.</TE>
<TE>   McAuley has walked the trail 12 times, hikes twice a week and has
twice stumbled upon mountain lions. He is also a bit of a skeptic and
recalls laughing heartily when he first heard of plans for connecting
the Backbone Trail's segments. Now he thinks it might actually
happen.</TE>
<TE>   "We are getting much closer, and we have a politician who is
interested and able to get money," he said, walking down the new
trail. "I think this is going to be one of the major trails in the
Santa Monica Mountains. It will be the trail of the mountains."</TE>

<HD>Limits Sought on Work by Blake's Investigator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors want a judge to limit the work done by an investigator
for Robert Blake's defense team because they say he is telling
potential witnesses that he does not believe the actor killed his
wife.</LD>
<LD>   In court documents filed earlier this week, prosecutors say that
William C. Jordan, whom they describe as a potential prosecution
witness, may be overstepping his bounds.</LD>
<LD>   Jordan has interviewed or tried to interview two key prosecution
witnesses -- former stuntman Gary McLarty and private investigator
William Welch, prosecutors said.</LD>
<TE>   During his interview with Welch, Jordan said: "I would stake my
life that Blake didn't do this [murder]," according to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Blake and Bonny Lee Bakley, 44, were married a few months before
she was shot to death near a Studio City restaurant May 4, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, 68, is charged with murder, two counts of soliciting murder
and conspiracy. He has been held without bail in Men's Central Jail
since his April 18 arrest in Hidden Hills.</TE>
<TE>   In their motion, Deputy Dist. Attys. Patrick R. Dixon and Gregory
A. Dohi suggest that Blake's legal team should be ordered to rely on
investigators other than Jordan to interview prosecution witnesses.
Jordan's interviews, they say, "might taint the recollections of key
witnesses and that they, in turn, might taint his recollections."</TE>
<TE>   Blake's attorney, Harland W. Braun, said Thursday that Jordan is
working part-time for Blake's defense team but declined to specify
his role in the investigation, saying: "I don't want to get into our
strategy."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash denied a
prosecution motion in May to stop Jordan from working for Blake.</TE>
<TE>   Nash is expected to consider the latest motion and set a date for
a preliminary hearing in the murder case Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In a related matter, the state Supreme Court on Tuesday asked
prosecutors to respond to Blake's appeal for a bail hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Nash has repeatedly denied bail, saying that he wants to hear
evidence at the preliminary hearing before making a decision. The 2nd
District Court of Appeal upheld that decision last month and Blake's
attorneys filed a writ with the Supreme Court.</TE>

<LD>The gunman and driver in a drive-by slaying Sunday night had
carjacked their vehicle half an hour before the attack, police
disclosed Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The victim of what police Capt. Julie Nelson called a pointless
crime was Manuolevao Stibbie, 22, of Los Angeles, who aspired to be
an elementary school teacher. Police said Stibbie and five companions
were driving home on 223rd Street when, without words or any
altercation, a gunman in the carjacked sports utility vehicle fired
several times. Stibbie died at the scene.</LD>
<LD>   Nelson asked anyone with information to call Det. Chris Merlo at
(310) 548-2833.</LD>

<LD>A teenager who had sex with her basketball coach has sued him, her
former private high school and its owner.</LD>
<LD>   The girl, who is now 16, and her parents filed the lawsuit Tuesday
in Los Angeles County Superior Court. It accuses coach Paul Calvin
Clark III of manipulating the girl into an illegal sexual
relationship, which she says began last year in his office at Ribet
Academy, a private school in the Glassell Park area of Los Angeles.
Clark was convicted in June of four counts of sex with a minor.</LD>

<HD>Carter Burgess, 85; Envoy, Defense Official</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carter L. Burgess, assistant secretary of defense under President
Eisenhower and a one-time aide who had been entrusted to deliver news
to France of the planned Normandy invasion, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Burgess died Sunday in Roanoke, Va. The cause of the death was
complications from two strokes he suffered this summer.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Roanoke, Burgess earned a bachelor's degree at Virginia
Military Institute. During World War II, he rose to the rank of
colonel. He worked under Gen. Eisenhower as secretary of the general
staff of Supreme Headquarters, Allied Expeditionary Forces.</LD>
<TE>   While stationed in England, Burgess delivered a message from
Eisenhower to Gen. Charles de Gaulle, then in North Africa, informing
him of plans to invade Normandy. The Allies were afraid that any
transmitted information would be decoded by the Germans.</TE>
<TE>   When the war ended, Burgess served as deputy secretary of the
secretariat at the San Francisco conference establishing the United
Nations. He worked as special assistant to the secretary of State in

<HD>A Redemonstration of the Chicano Moratorium</HD>
<DH>Protests: The marches against the Vietnam War will be
marked with photos, films and a panel of participants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a young amateur photographer, Kathy Gallegos trekked 32 years ago
to the Eastside of Los Angeles, where thousands were gathering for a
series of anti-Vietnam War protests. Fearing one event would turn
violent, she left early, missing history in the making.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the 53-year-old owner of Avenue 50 Studio in Highland Park is
hosting an exhibit, including photos and newspaper articles, that
captures much of the history she missed. "We are all getting older,
and I think the young people need to hear what happened," Gallegos
said.</LD>
<LD>   The exhibit is one in a flurry of activities--art, films, a peace
rally, a panel discussion and a prayer service--being held today
through Aug. 30 to commemorate the anniversary of demonstrations in
1969 and 1970 known as the Chicano Moratorium. (Information regarding
schedule of events is at www.aztlannet.com.)</LD>
<TE>   The original Moratorium aimed to protest the fact that Mexican
American soldiers were dying in the Vietnam War in higher proportion
than their numbers in the general population.</TE>
<TE>   Although there were several demonstrations on the Eastside months
apart, to some, the Chicano Moratorium is synonymous with the Aug.
29, 1970, protest at Laguna Park, the gathering of 20,000 people that
resulted in violent confrontations with police.</TE>
<TE>   When the dust settled, three people were dead: Angel Diaz, Lyn
Ward and Ruben Salazar--a Times columnist and news director of
KMEX-TV.</TE>
<TE>   Although activists through the years have marked the Moratorium
with marches and other events, this year's anniversary has a larger
number of activities. The members of the committee that organized the
original Moratorium are chiming in.</TE>
<TE>   At one event, special guests will include Rosalio Munoz, Ramses
Noriega and David Sanchez, all members of the original committee.</TE>
<TE>   But Chicano Moratorium 2002 isn't meant only as a nostalgic
exercise, according to members of the original committee, whose
protests drew thousands from throughout the Southwest and from as far
as Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   There's a current relevancy, organizers say, given the possible
war against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We are also again at a time of military escalation, as the Bush
administration is calling for a prolonged war on terrorism," said
Munoz, 56, the chairman of the original committee.</TE>
<TE>   "That has many of us worried ... about the denial of rights in our
Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Munoz, who works in advertising but through the years has
protested things such as Proposition 187--which would have denied
public services to illegal immigrants--was a key character in the
original Moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   A former UCLA student body president, Munoz helped spark the
Moratorium in 1969 when he refused to be inducted into the military.</TE>
<TE>   The Moratorium is perhaps the best remembered of what was a series
of protests reflecting social unrest nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   There were about 30 protests in Latino communities all over the
Southwest, from Fresno and Stockton to Albuquerque and San Antonio,
to parts of the East, including and San Juan, Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much history that it's incredible that it was crammed
into such a short period of time," said Nancy Tovar, 66, a retired
graphic designer who is contributing memorabilia, items such as
pictures of marches, to the Avenue 50 Studio exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   The commemoration presents a perfect occasion for art expression,
organizers say.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those involved in the original events have matured to
produce such things as books and memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   But the event also presents a chance to pick up the protest
against some of the same issues that, organizers say, have not
changed.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding the possible war against Iraq, "I believe that the same
thing will happen that happened during the Vietnam action, that
Chicanos in disproportionate numbers will be going into the
military," said Rudy Tovar, 80, Nancy Tovar's husband, who recalls
police hurling tear gas at him and others at one protest.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the military issues, other bad conditions for Mexican
Americans persist, said Carlos Montes, 54, a member of the Brown
Berets who said he fled the country in 1970 to avoid police and
prosecutors who were hounding him over his involvement in protests.</TE>
<TE>   "The same conditions that we marched against are still here today:
the attacks against the health system, overcrowded schools and the
threat of war," said Montes.</TE>

<HD>E. Chillida, 78; Spanish Wrought-Iron Sculptor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eduardo Chillida, one of Europe's leading sculptors whose immense
wrought-iron works are found in public spaces in Paris, Berlin,
Frankfurt, Germany, and Barcelona, Spain, has died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Chillida died Monday at his home near San Sebastian, Spain, his
son Luis announced. Chillida had Alzheimer's disease, but his son did
not specify the cause of death.</LD>
<LD>   In a career spanning more than 50 years, Chillida was best known
for his iron sculptures, but also worked with wood, alabaster, marble
and granite.</LD>
<TE>   One of his most famous sculptures is "The Comb of the Winds,"
which overlooks the sea at San Sebastian. The artwork came to
symbolize efforts to bring peace to the Basque region, torn by
separatist violence for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Another major piece, showing two iron hands joined together,
representing the unification of East Germany and West Germany, is in
Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps his best-known work in the United States is in front of
the I.M. Pei-designed Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas. The work
features two pillars with branches that reach out but do not touch.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, a Chillida sculpture is inside the World Bank
headquarters. A sculpture by Chillida also sits outside Beverly Hills
City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Born in San Sebastian, Chillida was the son of an army officer and
an amateur singer. His family sent him to live in Paris during the
Spanish civil war in the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to Spain, Chillida studied architecture at the
University of Madrid, but he abandoned that pursuit for drawing and
design.</TE>
<TE>   He moved back to Paris in the late 1940s and began working in
plaster and stone, modeling his work after Greek marble sculptures in
the Louvre. Feeling dislocated, he returned to the Basque region and
began working with iron. He worked in that medium for much of the
next decade as his reputation grew throughout Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Chillida's work was exhibited in more than 100 one-man shows, and
he participated in many international exhibitions, including the
Venice Biennale. He received the Carnegie Prize for sculpture in
1964. In 1978, he shared the Andrew W. Mellon Prize with Willem de
Kooning.</TE>
<TE>   The Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain,
hosted a major retrospective of his work in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, Chillida's work has been exhibited at the
Tasende Gallery in La Jolla and in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to son Luis, Chillida is survived by his wife, Pilar;
seven other children; and 26 grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>DNA Databank Leads to Arrest in 1995 Rape</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven years have passed since a 28-year-old Fountain Valley woman
running an errand for her mother was kidnapped outside a convenience
store by a knife-wielding man who took her to a secluded area and
raped her.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, authorities announced that they had arrested and
charged a 30-year-old parolee in the 1995 crime, using DNA taken from
the man during his most recent prison stint.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Castillo was charged with rape and kidnap with the intent
to rape. Castillo, a former Santa Ana resident, was tracked down and
arrested at a Santa Ana strip mall last week without incident. He
could receive a life sentence.</LD>
<TE>   The arrest marked the 100th time the state has tied a suspect's
DNA to an unsolved crime, said Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony
Rackauckas.</TE>
<TE>   "Technology is definitely changing police work," said Lt. Kim
Brown of the Fountain Valley Police Department. "This speaks to good
crime scene investigation and good evidence preservation. I'm very
confident we'll have other unsolved cases that will be solved."</TE>
<TE>   Castillo was a "cold hit" in the state databank of convicted
offenders' DNA. His DNA, taken in January before his release from
prison, where he had served time for a parole violation, matched
evidence found at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo became a part of the state databank because he had served
time for a 1995 robbery. Since 1989, state law has required blood and
saliva samples from people convicted of violent and sex crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "We hold everybody accountable," said Stephen K. Goya, a parole
administrator for the state Department of Corrections. "If they think
they can run and not get caught, they're seriously mistaken."</TE>
<TE>   The cold hit was the second for Fountain Valley police. The first
was also in an unsolved 1995 rape, a case in which the suspect broke
into the victim's second-floor apartment.</TE>
<TE>   With 200,000 offender profiles and DNA samples from 2,500 cases in
the databank, the number of cold hits in California has climbed
steadily to nearly one a week. Cold-hit cases are those that have
remained unsolved without any identified suspect.</TE>
<TE>   The woman who was attacked outside the convenience store still
lives in Orange County and continues to struggle with the crime,
Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was quite emotional about someone being held responsible for
the crime against her," Brown said. "It brings some kind of closure
to it. It can be unnerving, over the years, as to who committed this
crime or why they committed this against you."</TE>

<LD>A longtime Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy was ordered held on
$250,000 bail Thursday on charges of sending lurid e-mails to a
15-year-old girl in the sheriff's Deputy Explorer program, as well as
of possessing illegal assault weapons and child pornography.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Richard Dario Comoe, 44, was arrested Wednesday after a
sheriff's task force served a search warrant at his Canyon Country
home, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Jeffrey M. Harkavy ordered
Comoe to appear at the downtown Criminal Justice Center on Sept. 3
for formal arraignment.</LD>
<TE>   In court, prosecutors charged the 21-year department veteran with
five counts of possessing illegal firearms, including a machine gun,
a modified assault weapon and a sawed-off shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   Comoe, a watch deputy at the East Los Angeles Sheriff's Station,
also was charged with one misdemeanor count each of annoying or
molesting a child younger than 18 and possessing child pornography,
prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys Alan Bell and Philip A. Gunning, who are representing
the deputy, obtained a reduction in Comoe's bail from $1 million to
$250,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Deputy Comoe intends a vigorous defense to the charges on both
factual and legal grounds and believes that he will be exonerated,"
his attorneys said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Comoe sent annoying and suggestive e-mails and
partially nude photos to the teenage girl enrolled in the Deputy
Explorer program.</TE>
<TE>   According to the department, youths in the program assist deputies
with such duties as report writing, bicycle licensing, crowd
management at public events, anti-crime campaigns and gathering
statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The girl told a fellow Explorer that she was being harassed by
Comoe's e-mails, authorities said. Sheriff's deputies were notified
and began an investigation, said Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the
Los Angeles County district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies served a search warrant earlier this month at Comoe's
home and found a safe that allegedly contained illegal weapons and a
computer disc with child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on all counts, Comoe could spend up to five years,
eight months in state prison and would have to register as a sex
offender, Robison said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials said Comoe has been relieved of duty pending
the criminal investigation's outcome.</TE>

<HD>DNA Evidence in Rape Cases Was Delayed</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: Officials say it took nearly six months to
alert detectives that data pointed to one suspect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While accused serial rapist Narcisso Solis cruised Thousand Oaks
streets and allegedly raped another woman in July, DNA evidence
linking him to two earlier sexual assaults sat unattended in a county
crime lab freezer.</LD>
<LD>   Short-staffed and burdened by the demands of several high-profile
criminal cases last spring, technicians took nearly six months to
alert detectives that stored DNA from Thousand Oaks rapes in January
2002 and August 1998 pointed to a single suspect, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Three weeks after the DNA similarities were discovered, sheriff's
officials said, crime lab technicians informed investigators that DNA
samples taken from a blood test Solis gave after a drunk-driving
arrest matched the earlier swabs. Technicians also suspected Solis'
DNA would be similar to that taken from the July rape victim.</LD>
<TE>   "We only had so much staff and there were other priorities that
had to be addressed," sheriff's spokesman Eric Nishimoto said of the
DNA testing delay. "It was due to the high priority of the cases that
were currently being tried in court."</TE>
<TE>   Among the cases in which DNA was key to the prosecution were the
triple-murder trial of Socorro Caro and the case of accused Simi
Valley serial rapist and murder defendant Vincent Henry Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Frank O'Hanlon, who heads the sheriff's East County Major
Crimes Unit, said detectives would have launched an investigation
sooner had they received the DNA analysis before July 31.</TE>
<TE>   But he and others familiar with the case insist they would have
had a difficult time finding Solis.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the evidence from the last [sexual assault] that turned
the key on Solis," O'Hanlon said. Sheriff's detectives arrested Solis
Tuesday and booked him on 30 felony counts of sexual assault,
burglary, false imprisonment and assault with a deadly weapon. If
convicted, he faces life in prison. His arraignment is set for
Wednesday. At a news conference announcing Solis' arrest, Brooks said
there were similarities between the Solis case and that of Sanchez,
charged with first-degree murder in the 2001 shooting of Moorpark
College student Megan Barroso.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks also said information from the Sanchez case helped
investigators in pursuing Solis.</TE>
<TE>   The same detectives who arrested Solis on Aug. 15 in the
drunk-driving case said they first contacted crime lab technicians in
January about a possible connection between a rape that month and the
one in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Lab technicians began testing the DNA a month later, said Cmdr.
Brent Morris of the Sheriff Department's technical services division.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators' curiosity was raised in January when an 18-year-old
woman was raped at knifepoint in her Thousand Oaks home.</TE>
<TE>   Crime analysts, who review crime statistics, told investigators
the 1998 rape occurred in the same vicinity as the January Thousand
Oaks attack and wondered whether there was a link. The two attacks
also followed a similar pattern. In both assaults the victim was
attacked as she slept and was threatened with a knife, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the victims gave different descriptions of their
attacker, "we were concerned enough to ask for the match," O'Hanlon
said. A task force was established the day after the DNA match was
confirmed and Solis was soon tabbed as a suspect by a parole agent.</TE>
<TE>   Crime lab officials said that staffing problems coupled with heavy
demands for their expertise have caused unavoidable delays concerning
DNA tests. A complete DNA matching test can be completed in a week,
but waits of more than three months for test results are not unusual
in the county, Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   "Between 1997 and 2000 there was a 135% increase in backlog in DNA
cases across the country," Morris said. "We are mirroring a problem
that is nationwide."</TE>
<TE>   Although 10 new cases arrive each month that require DNA analysis,
the local crime lab only has one DNA analyst working full time,
Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   "In a perfect world I would like to have three more DNA analysts,"
Morris said. "I would like to get on all these cases quicker."</TE>

<HD>Sick Dogs Seized at Kennel in El Monte</HD>
<DH>Probe: More than 200 are rescued, but six are found dead
and 17 are euthanized because of their health. Owner is cited for
animal cruelty.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 200 malnourished and diseased dogs, and six dead ones, were
removed Wednesday and Thursday from a kennel in El Monte.</LD>
<LD>   Animal control officers found the remains of some dogs in bags and
freezers at Second Time Around for Magnificent Pets, said Kaye
Michelson, a spokeswoman for the county Department of Animal Care and
Control.</LD>
<LD>   Seventeen of the rescued dogs had been euthanized because of their
conditions, she said.</LD>
<TE>   The property owner, Patricia Cravy of Long Beach, was issued a
felony citation for animal cruelty and for misdemeanor violations,
including keeping animals in unsanitary conditions and not providing
veterinary care. She had not been arrested, but the case probably
would be forwarded to prosecutors, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "These are animals she supposedly rescued, who hopefully would
have been placed in new homes," Michelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Second Time Around's Web site says it is "a private, no-kill
nonprofit rescue and adoption group." Cravy, it says, "has been
rescuing and adopting animals for 37 years, the last 17 in the Long
Beach area."</TE>
<TE>   Officers went to the property in the 2900 block of Durfee Avenue
on Wednesday evening after a neighbor complained of the stench. They
found dogs crowded into concrete kennels, sitting in their own waste,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "When we walked on the property, just to our right were bags upon
bags of rotting dog food with flies on them," said El Monte Police
Sgt. Santos Hernandez. "The dogs were going crazy, just barking. It
was so deafening; after a while you heard silence."</TE>
<TE>   Michelson called conditions at the animal shelter "horrible,
absolutely horrendous. The animals were kept in just deplorable
conditions."</TE>
<TE>   For two days, dogs were taken to the Baldwin Park Animal Shelter,
where they were treated by veterinarians and other staff members,
Michelson said. Most of the dogs are young, including some puppies,
and a few showed signs of aggression, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were trying to find out why so many dogs had been
kept in such bad conditions, Michelson said. Animal control officials
had inspected Second Time Around in January, but investigators did
not find nearly as many dogs then, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've already had calls from people wanting to adopt," Michelson
said. "We'll put photos of dogs on a Web site (www.animal
control.co.la.ca.us) as soon as we get a chance to determine which
are adoptable."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a Burbank woman was charged with animal cruelty after
authorities found 86 dogs stocked in crates at her home. Authorities
said Pam Miller was a once-reputable dog rescuer who had begun
collecting dogs.</TE>

<LD>In a morning raid designed to reduce pollution along Newport Bay,
workers rounded up about 60 ducks Thursday and whisked them off to an
"undisclosed, secure location."</LD>
<LD>   As residents watched from their bayside homes, workers converged
on the Grand Canal on foot and in boats, catching the white and brown
ducks with nets.</LD>
<LD>   City code enforcement officers helped contract workers in the
systematic roundup, which took about two hours. Safety First had to
obtain a permit for the removal from the state Department of Fish and
Game, which monitored the procedure.</LD>
<TE>   Animal control experts from the U.S. Department of Agriculture had
earlier fed the ducks food laced with tranquilizers to slow them
down. The ducks will be moved today to a farm in San Bernardino
County.</TE>
<TE>   It's the most aggressive effort yet in Newport Beach's
long-running battle to reduce the bay's bacteria levels caused by
duck droppings.</TE>
<TE>   Ducks have been a fixture in the bay, but only in the last several
years have they generated complaints by residents who say the noise,
stench and unsightly droppings are becoming intolerable.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents support the relocation, noting that generous
feedings by beachgoers have turned birds that once migrated up and
down the coast into year-round Newport Beach residents.</TE>
<TE>   "They're neat to look at," said Kristin Vigeland, "but the
constant feeding of them builds up the stench from duck droppings. I
don't walk that side of the canal anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The city has tried banning large-scale feedings in an effort to
reduce the duck population. But several residents, including Bunty
Justin, defied the ban and simply collected the citations that
officials issued.</TE>
<TE>   Justin was angry and saddened when she learned the ducks had been
taken.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know where they took them or if they're alive," she said.
"I think they're narrow-minded and heartless people."</TE>
<TE>   But officials stressed that the ducks were not harmed.</TE>
<TE>   "They're in my warehouse now recovering from the tranquilizer,"
said Tim Pietz, owner of Safety First, the contractor. "Tomorrow
they'll be relocated."</TE>
<TE>   The city's contract with Safety First ensures that the animals are
not euthanized or killed for food.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't have done this if that was the outcome," said Dave
Kiff, assistant city manager.</TE>
<TE>   A few ducks remained along the Grand Canal, but officials said the
intention was to bring the population to a natural level. "Maybe
eight ducks is a good amount," Kiff said.</TE>

<HD>Santa Paula Official Forced to Run as Write-In</HD>
<DH>Courts: Councilwoman Laura Espinosa, who missed a filing
deadline, says she has no choice now but to urge voters to list her
name on ballot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Longtime Santa Paula City Councilwoman Laura Flores Espinosa will
have to run her November reelection bid without her name appearing on
the ballot, a judge ruled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Espinosa, seeking her third four-year term, said she has no choice
but to ask voters to write in her name on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, I'm really disappointed with the court's ruling,"
Espinosa said outside court. "The only option is to be a write-in
candidate, and we'll pursue that. My main purpose is to serve the
city of Santa Paula."</LD>
<TE>   The decision by Ventura County Superior Court Judge Melinda
Johnson stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Espinosa last week, after
County Clerk Richard Dean rejected candidacy documents she submitted
Aug. 14.</TE>
<TE>   While Aug. 14 was the deadline for nonincumbent challengers to
file election papers, sitting council members' papers were due Aug.
9, Dean said.</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa, a member of the council the past eight years, said the
slip-up was simply a misunderstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa said she was under the impression that because Councilman
Donald Johnson had announced he would not seek another term, the
filing deadline had been extended five days for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "At no time did they tell me an incumbent has to file by a certain
deadline," Espinosa said Thursday before the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   But Dean, who inspected all documents for the county's
consolidated election, said instructions given to Santa Paula
candidates made clear the different filing dates.</TE>
<TE>   He said no other candidates in the county had the same problem,
either this year or any year he can remember.</TE>
<TE>   "It just doesn't happen," Dean said. "People who are incumbents
don't miss their deadlines--they know them."</TE>
<TE>   In court Thursday, Espinosa's attorney, Richard Francis, argued
the councilwoman was eligible for the extended filing date because
she was really attempting to run as a challenger to Johnson's seat,
not as an incumbent for her own seat.</TE>
<TE>   But Leroy Smith of the county counsel's office said the purpose of
the elections law governing filing deadlines is to allow prospective
candidates an opportunity to learn if an incumbent, who may be
difficult to unseat, will be running before deciding whether to join
the race.</TE>
<TE>   The interpretation offered by Francis would render that law
meaningless, Smith said, because it would allow all incumbents to
wait until the last minute, then claim they are actually filing for
each others' seats on the council.</TE>
<TE>   The judge agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The intent of the law is clear," Johnson said. "Mrs. Espinosa did
not file in a timely manner."</TE>
<TE>   The fumble is particularly ironic because Espinosa--one of two
Latinos on the council in a city where Latinos represent two-thirds
of the population--is a well-known advocate for ethnic diversity in
Santa Paula government.</TE>
<TE>   She helped fight for a measure on the November ballot that asks
voters whether the council's five members should be elected from
separate districts instead of citywide.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit faulted the city's current
at-large voting system for keeping a representative number of Latinos
off of the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa was the only Latino council member at the time the suit
was filed. Since then, she has been joined by Mayor Ray Luna.</TE>
<TE>   Two other Latinos are seeking a seat on the council in the Nov. 5
election: former Mayor Al Escoto and high school teacher Gabino
Aguirre.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates for the three council seats are incumbent Rick
Cook, seeking a second term; Rita Graham, a land-use planner; Mary
Ann Krause, an urban planner; and real estate agent John Wisda.</TE>
<TE>   The judge on Thursday also rejected Espinosa's argument that Dean,
the county clerk, did not have the authority to keep her name off of
the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Francis said Dean overstepped his bounds when he refused to accept
Espinosa's late filing papers, which were certified by City Clerk
Steven Salas.</TE>
<TE>   "I have this vision of Mr. Dean riding around the state like the
Lone Ranger, telling people how to follow the law," Francis told the
court. "It's not his job."</TE>
<TE>   But Johnson said a resolution passed by the City Council, which
asks Dean to verify signatures for the city, also gives him the power
to determine whether all election documents are valid, including
whether they are timely.</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa said waiting until the last minute is "typical Laura."</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone else comes first, and Laura comes last," Espinosa said.
"I've learned my lesson."</TE>

<HD>Westerfield Trial's Last Round</HD>
<DH>Murder: His lawyers will try to convince jurors that he
doesn't deserve to die for killing girl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>If defending David Westerfield was difficult, his defense attorneys
now face an equally daunting challenge: persuading the jury that
convicted him of kidnapping and murdering 7-year-old Danielle van Dam
that he does not deserve to die.</LD>
<LD>   In the last eight years, San Diego prosecutors have asked juries
to sentence four child-killers to be executed. In all four cases, the
juries voted for death, including for a mother who killed her four
children and a couple who scalded their niece to death.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers in the Westerfield case have been ordered by the judge not
to make any public comment about the penalty phase set to begin
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorneys, former prosecutors and law professors watching
from afar, however, predict that Westerfield attorney Steven Feldman
will use a two-pronged strategy of calling character witnesses and
telling jurors that if they have any "lingering" doubt about
Westerfield's guilt they should vote in favor of life imprisonment
instead of death.</TE>
<TE>   But Feldman will be up against testimony that former prosecutor
Colin Murray predicts will be "gut-wrenching."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors are expected to call to the stand grieving parents and
other family members and friends to explain how special and loving
Danielle was and how tormented they are by her murder.</TE>
<TE>   "The prosecutor will need to introduce the jury to Danielle, the
kind of girl she was, what her hobbies were, what she would be doing
today if she hadn't been murdered," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   And lead prosecutor Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek will also be
able to ask the jury to imagine the pain and terror that Danielle
must have felt in her final hours as Westerfield kidnapped her from
her bed, took her to his house and waited several hours before
killing her.</TE>
<TE>   Facts about Westerfield's background--possibly including abusive
treatment of a former live-in girlfriend--will also be introduced as
the jury is asked to weigh mitigating factors against aggravating
factors in deciding between death and life imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   The most powerful factor leaning toward a recommendation for death
may be Danielle herself: a young, white, upper-middle-class child.</TE>
<TE>   "She fits the profile of victims where the defendant is most
likely to be sentenced to death," said Justin Brooks, executive
director of the California Innocence Project at the California
Western School of Law in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Westerfield fits the profile of killer least likely to
be sentenced to death: white and upper-middle class.</TE>
<TE>   In the 19 death-penalty cases in the eight-year tenure of San
Diego County Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst, juries have chosen death in
10, life imprisonment without parole in two, and deadlocked in three.
Four cases, including Westerfield's, are pending.</TE>
<TE>   All 12 of the Westerfield jurors, while being questioned before
the trial, said they would be willing to impose the death penalty.
Some cried during the trial while being shown child pornography
seized from Westerfield's computer.</TE>
<TE>   Surveys have shown that even people who oppose the death penalty
say that a case involving someone who kills a child might make them
change their mind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be incredibly hard for Feldman to get up there and
say, 'OK, you didn't believe me before that he wasn't guilty, but now
believe me about my client not deserving to die,' " Brooks said.</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Cruz professor Craig Haney, a psychologist and lawyer,
has written that during a penalty phase, a defense lawyer needs to
strip away the "demonic qualities" that the prosecution and media
have attributed to the defendant and show him as a more complex
individual, one deserving of pity or, at least, mercy.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Bradley Patton said Feldman is likely to argue
that the death penalty should be reserved for the "worst of the
worst," criminals with long records and no redeeming value, and that
Westerfield--who appears to have only a drunk-driving arrest on his
record--"clearly does not fit" that description.</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, once a jury in a murder case has found that
a "special circumstance" exists--in this case because the killing
followed the kidnapping of Danielle--the trial shifts into the
penalty phase.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the rules are the same as the original trial except that
both sides are given more latitude to present evidence, and the
defense, not the prosecution, is allowed the final argument to the
jury.</TE>
<TE>   If the jury decides on life imprisonment without parole or if the
panel is deadlocked, the defendant receives life imprisonment. If the
jury decides on death, the judge can reject that penalty in favor of
prison, although it rarely happens.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego County, that last happened in 1996, when a judge
rejected the jury's recommendation of death for a 19-year-old
convicted of the torture and murder of a transient. The judge said he
felt the defendant was no more culpable than two defendants for whom
the jury had recommended prison.</TE>
<TE>   The Westerfield penalty phase could be seen as Round 2 of the
courtroom battle between Feldman, the bearded, hyperkinetic liberal
from UC Berkeley, and Dusek, the clenched-teeth, former minor league
baseball pitcher from Brigham Young University.</TE>
<TE>   Dusek has sent defendants to death row; Feldman has won some
cases, lost others.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman is likely to call Westerfield's two ex-wives, his
ex-in-laws, his two grown children and people helped by the
injury-rehabilitation devices Westerfield designed and patented. They
could testify about his kindness and his law-abiding temperament.</TE>
<TE>   The defense is also expected to ask Superior Court Judge William
Mudd to give the "lingering doubt" instruction to the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Gibson, a veteran public defender, said the jury's lengthy
deliberation--nearly 40 hours over nine days--suggests that one or
more members needed to be persuaded before voting for guilt. Those
jurors, he said, might be reluctant to vote for death on evidence
that they believe has left at least a glimmer of doubt.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Feldman presented two entomologists who
suggested that Danielle's body was dumped on the rural road sometime
after Westerfield began being watched continuously by police and
therefore he could not be the killer. The prosecution offered two
experts to dispute that theory.</TE>
<TE>   Although the rules of evidence are more flexible in penalty
phases, there are limits.</TE>
<TE>   Opposing attorneys are set to meet today with Mudd in a closed
session to discuss what evidence will be allowed.</TE>

<HD>Norman Jolley, 86; Actor in '40s Westerns Wrote TV Series
'Space Patrol'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Norman Jolley, prolific writer of such series as "Space Patrol,"
"Wagon Train" and "Cimarron City" during television's golden age in
the 1950s, has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Jolley died Aug. 13 at the Mayo Clinic facility in Scottsdale,
Ariz., of cardiac arrest following surgery for pancreatic cancer,
according to Jean-Noel Bassior, who is writing a book about the
"Space Patrol" saga. In recent years, Jolley had lived in Indio,
Calif.</LD>
<LD>   The native of Adel, Iowa, began his career as an actor, earning
small roles in 1940s westerns. He also acted on radio and later on
television.</LD>
<TE>   Jolley was the first bad guy on "Space Patrol," posing as the evil
Agent X. But when the producer decided he needed a writer more than a
villain, Agent X was zapped into suspended animation, the worst fate
allowed by the stun-gun of real life World War II flying hero Ed
Kemmer playing space Cmdr. Buzz Corry.</TE>
<TE>   The program was shown, either locally or nationally, on Saturday
mornings or in prime time, from 1950 to 1955. As its primary writer,
Jolley became adept at inventing raydurium, endurium, the palm
injector and other out-of-this-world gadgets of the
technology-challenged mid-20th century. As he conjured such gadgets,
he developed a key rule of thumb that he would maintain throughout
his career: never violate actual fact.</TE>
<TE>   "Strangely enough," Jolley told The Times in 1952, "I find that an
extension course in engineering that I took at the University of
Wisconsin has been a great aid in writing 'Space Patrol' scripts.
I've brushed up on my physics and astronomy to keep the dialogue
legitimate and, to date, we've never had a complaint from any
scientist about error in our stories."</TE>
<TE>   Jolley also appeared occasionally in the series as the secretary
general of the United Planets. But he had largely made the career
shift from acting to writing.</TE>
<TE>   He teamed up with another former actor, Dick Bartlett, in 1956 to
form Bartlett-Jolley Productions. With Jolley writing, Bartlett
directing and both men producing, they made eight movies for
Universal-International within two years and worked on critically
acclaimed segments of "Wagon Train" and later "Cimarron City"
starring the late George Montgomery.</TE>
<TE>   Jolley is survived by his wife, Lois; one son; two daughters; and
two grandchildren. No services are planned.</TE>

<LD>While Anaheim officials were debating this week whether to allow a
Mexican supermarket to do business in their fair city, the governor
indicated he would sign a bill allowing illegal immigrants to get
driver's licenses.</LD>
<LD>   There is not a state in the union, I assure you, half as
interesting as California.</LD>
<LD>   Anaheim's fearless leaders had thrice stood in the way of
Gigante's attempt to open for business, claiming at one point that
the store was too Latino for Anaheim Plaza, an outdoor mall near
Disneyland.</LD>
<TE>   It was a curious argument, considering that the Anaheim
neighborhood is 60% Latino. In my mind's eye, I played with the idea
of a city where illegal immigrants could legally drive cars to their
hearts' content, but couldn't shop at a Gigante because it was too
ethnic.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim's backwater rubes were spared further embarrassment
Wednesday when the City Council, under community pressure, finally
gave the OK to Gigante.</TE>
<TE>   There is no connection between the Gigante and driver's license
stories, except that they speak to California's continued growing
pains and identity crisis. On the issue of ethnicity, we can be
rednecks one day and trailblazers the next.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis said he'll probably sign the driver's license bill
if it lands in front of him, meaning that roughly 200,000 illegal
immigrants would be allowed to drive.</TE>
<TE>   But Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) isn't certain his
bill--futzed with since 1999 and then pulled back after Sept.
11--will make it into Davis' hands. Naysayers on the right think the
licensing of illegals is nuts, and those on the left think required
background checks are fascist.</TE>
<TE>   At times like this, you can almost respect Davis for being such a
spineless centrist.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people, judging by my mail, believe the very idea of the
bill is proof that California has finally gone insane.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone is here illegally, I don't think they should be
allowed to do anything, frankly," said Diana Hull of Californians for
Population Stabilization (CAPS), which is based in Santa Barbara.
"The way we're so out in the open about this illegality is shocking."</TE>
<TE>   The state is already overpopulated, Hull says. To begin
legitimizing everyone who sneaked in will only encourage more of the
same.</TE>
<TE>   She's probably right. But it's more complicated than that.</TE>
<TE>   People are here illegally because the unspoken federal policy is
to allow them to be here. It's the lie we're all in on.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses exploit cheap labor in the fields and hotels and
restaurants, and so do homeowners who don't ask questions of the
gardener or housekeeper who work like the devil for rock-bottom
wages.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a woman in Pico-Union who could drive to work at a
Beverly Hills hotel in 20 minutes, but the bus takes her three hours.
That's who this bill is for," says Cedillo.</TE>
<TE>   Those who've worked the hardest are already driving around without
licenses or insurance, so if there's a crackup on the highway, you
and I are going to pay. Licensing people who pass a background check,
and prove they've worked in the state for 15 months, seems fair to
me.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is to make sure that these are not the terrorists of
the world, and not people with criminal histories either here or in
their country of origin," says L.A. County Sheriff Lee Baca, who's on
an advisory committee that persuaded Gov. Davis to insist on the
background check.</TE>
<TE>   "These are people who came here illegally, but are otherwise
honest, hard-working, decent people who want to be part of the
American dream."</TE>
<TE>   I say we should give them more than a driver's license. We should
quit the charade and legalize them altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Just yell olly olly oxen free and say everyone who's in is in.</TE>
<TE>   And then we should have an honest conversation on population
growth and immigration.</TE>
<TE>   The California environment is being destroyed, traffic is insane,
there's a water shortage, a housing crisis, the health-care system is
overwhelmed, and our schools are so depressed, even recent
improvements still leave them six credits short of mediocre.</TE>
<TE>   In 39 years, the state population is expected to double, and every
one of those problems will explode. I've been called a dope and a
bigot for suggesting it, but Los Angeles and the rest of the state
ought to be asking how big is too big.</TE>
<TE>   Baca told me that on a recent trip to China, cops told him they'll
lose their jobs if they have more than one child.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know if we want to go that far, but I did the math and
Gov. Davis has enough money in his campaign kitty to send a
three-pack of condoms to every adult in California.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and the state congressional delegation should demand that if
the federal government isn't going to better develop the economies of
border nations or enforce its own immigration laws, and 40% of all
immigrants are going to continue settling in California, the feds
ought to start paying more of the bills.</TE>
<TE>   Especially if Presidente Bush, with one eye on the next election,
keeps posing as an amigo.</TE>
<TE>   Baca says 25% of his jail population is made up of illegals, for
an annual cost of $90 million. Court costs run another $160 million.
Meanwhile, the financially strapped county is going Third World in
health care, shutting clinics and cutting off immunization for tens
of thousands of children.</TE>
<TE>   Gil Cedillo insists California's problems are not a function of
too many people, but of poor leadership.</TE>
<TE>   I say it's a combination of the two.</TE>
<TE>   And if we don't do something about both, driver's licenses or no,
we'll all be stuck in traffic on the way to Gigante.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Fund Missing More Than $2 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than $2 million has disappeared from a county planning
department fund used to pay for building inspections, prompting
officials to place two employees on administrative leave while they
investigate.</LD>
<LD>   Planning and Development Services Director Thomas B. Mathews said
there is no evidence that the money was stolen, though theft hasn't
been ruled out.</LD>
<LD>   "An outside auditor is going through the books," Mathews said.
"We'll have a lot more to report in a month."</LD>
<TE>   Auditor-Controller David E. Sundstrom's office discovered that the
fund was empty during a close-out of the planning department's books
for the fiscal year that ended June 30. There should have been about
$2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors this week authorized up to $8 million to
cover inspection costs until the fund can be replenished. The account
is usually funded from fees paid by developers for building and
safety inspections of new and remodeled homes.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Mathews ordered immediate cost cuts in his department,
eliminating unfilled vacancies and ending the use of outside help,
including contractors to check grading permits. Layoffs are possible,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation will review how much money went into the fund
during the last year and what expenses were paid. Auditors in the
last two weeks uncovered one obvious problem: Planners had estimated
that 8,000 permits would be pulled last year; only 4,500 were.</TE>
<TE>   The size of Orange County's inspection fund was challenged in 1999
in a lawsuit filed by Barratt American Inc. The national homebuilder
argued that the county was improperly stockpiling a high reserve in
the fund, which at one point reached $18 million.</TE>
<TE>   A court master was appointed to analyze the county's use of the
money.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before the lawsuit was filed, supervisors agreed to reduce
inspection fees by nearly a third to reduce the reserve. As of June
30, 2001, the fund was at about $7 million. The lawsuit is still
pending.</TE>

officials to place two employees on administrative leave while they
investigate.</LD>
<LD>   Planning and Development Services Director Thomas B. Mathews said
there is no evidence that the money was stolen, though theft hasn't
been ruled out.</LD>
<LD>   "An outside auditor is going through the books," Mathews said.
"We'll have a lot more to report in a month."</LD>
<TE>   Auditor-Controller David E. Sundstrom's office discovered that the
fund was empty during a close-out of the planning department's books
for the fiscal year that ended June 30. There should have been about
$2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors this week authorized up to $8 million to
cover inspection costs until the fund can be replenished. The account
is usually funded from fees paid by developers for building and
safety inspections of new and remodeled homes.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Mathews ordered immediate cost cuts in his department,
eliminating unfilled vacancies and ending the use of outside help,
including contractors to check grading permits. Layoffs are possible,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation will review how much money went into the fund
during the last year and what expenses were paid. Auditors in the
last two weeks uncovered one obvious problem: Planners had estimated
that 8,000 permits would be pulled last year; only 4,500 were.</TE>
<TE>   The size of Orange County's inspection fund was challenged in 1999
in a lawsuit filed by Barratt American Inc. The national homebuilder
argued that the county was improperly stockpiling a high reserve in
the fund, which at one point reached $18 million.</TE>
<TE>   A court master was appointed to analyze the county's use of the
money.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before the lawsuit was filed, supervisors agreed to reduce
inspection fees by nearly a third to reduce the reserve. As of June
30, 2001, the fund was at about $7 million. The lawsuit is still
pending.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors want an update next month on an ongoing review of the
inspection fund and the county's fee structure for building permits.
Planning officials hope to set new fees to provide a minimum reserve
so the fund is less vulnerable to dips in construction activity,
Mathews said.</TE>
<TE>   Money borrowed from the county treasury also will have to be
repaid from new fees, he said.</TE>

<HD>Making Room for Library Turns Into a Really Moving
Experience</HD>
<DH>Echo Park: Revelry marks Craftsman apartment building's
journey to new home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE RAMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gawkers shook their heads in disbelief. Dodger fans cheered as if the
home team were headed for the World Series. Some danced in the
street.</LD>
<LD>   A mariachi band rushed out of a bar to belt out several ranchera
standards.</LD>
<LD>   And anyone with a video camera eagerly recorded the carnival-like
atmosphere as a 1913-vintage Craftsman apartment building was moved
early Thursday on the streets of Echo Park in order to preserve it.</LD>
<TE>   "This is better than the Rose Parade," Dodger fan Mario Peralta
exclaimed as he came upon the excitement on Sunset Boulevard after
watching his team win an extra-inning game at nearby Dodger Stadium.
"And this is better than any float I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   The moving of the 4,400-square-foot structure, which began at 11
p.m. Wednesday, was a local happening for many in the largely
working-class neighborhood west of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   It also represented a victory for preservationists who wanted to
save the building, which stood on a spot where a new $3-million city
library branch is to be built.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, buildings of this size are cut in several sections for
such a move. But because Alvarado Street and Sunset are wide
thoroughfares, the Craftsman was moved in one piece to its new home
in the Angelino Heights section of Echo Park.</TE>
<TE>   For months, members of the Echo Park Historical Society worked the
city's Library Commission and Design Aid Architects, an architectural
preservation firm in Hollywood, to save the two-story fourplex
structure.</TE>
<TE>   "It represents a bygone era," said Scott Fajack, the historical
society's president. "You don't see structures like this anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Another fourplex at the library site was torn down after it was
determined that no lot in the area was large enough to accommodate
it. City officials, however, cooperated with Echo Park
preservationists in saving that building's interior doors and
trimmings, windows and other items.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Craftsman at 1218 N. Alvarado St., a few doors
north of Sunset, historical society member Kevin Kuzma, 28, and his
fiancee, Darienne Hetherman, 27, agreed to take over ownership of the
building for free if a lot could be found for it.</TE>
<TE>   Kuzma said he found one at 1121 W. Marion Ave., nearly 1 1/2 miles
away, and paid $50,000 for it.</TE>
<TE>   He also agreed to pay $35,000 for city utility workers, who would
accompany the building on its move, to ensure that no overhead wires
or traffic signals were damaged.</TE>
<TE>   The city paid an estimated $90,000 for the move by American Heavy
Moving and Rigging in Chino.</TE>
<TE>   After several delays over permits, word spread quickly throughout
Echo Park this week that the move would start late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Benuto, 26, and Nereida Godinez, 19, were among the several
hundred onlookers who watched as a giant truck began pulling the
building--mounted on a steel-reinforced trailer--from its resting
spot.</TE>
<TE>   The festive mood seemed straight out of a Mardi Gras celebration
in New Orleans, but the L.A. onlookers put their spin on the
happening.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen stuff moved before, but this building is big," Benuto
said.</TE>
<TE>   Al Nunez wouldn't budge from his prime spot across the street from
the Craftsman.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a party and I ain't missing it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As the structure negotiated a left turn onto Sunset, onlookers
shouted at the two-dozen or so workers to call attention to overhead
utility lines.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want my cable TV cut off!" Echo Park resident Humberto
Luna screamed.</TE>
<TE>   As the structure lumbered by the El Prado bar on Sunset after
midnight, the members of Mariachi Estrella rushed out and began to
play well-known tunes.</TE>
<TE>   "We play for the building," member Mauricio Hernandez called out.</TE>
<TE>   Several dozen onlookers, who walked up the street to watch the
action, clapped their approval. "Is this L.A. or what?" Kuzma said to
no one in particular.</TE>
<TE>   Up the street, a crowd of twentysomethings spilled out of a bar to
cheer.</TE>
<TE>   "Awesome, dude," one bar patron said to the movers.</TE>
<TE>   Others in the crowd walked onto Sunset to pose for photographs
with the building in the background.</TE>
<TE>   On the spur of the moment, one couple, Jhaemi Willem and Kaitrain
Sones, began dancing provocatively with the structure as a backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   Some cheered, but most in the crowd just gawked.</TE>
<TE>   By 1:15 a.m., the movers had reached Marion, but their work wasn't
done. They waited more than two hours as nearly a dozen cars were
towed away for violating a temporary no-parking edict to accommodate
the move.</TE>
<TE>   By then, few celebrators were around to cheer the towing of cars.
There was just the silence of the early morning calm.</TE>
<TE>   Around daybreak, the Craftsman was snugly in its new home.</TE>
<TE>   By 10 a.m., Kuzma, who had stayed up all night to take in the
festivities, was too tired to revel in his new building, which will
cost about $150,000 to rehabilitate.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I'm pleased, but I'm really too tired to say anything
else," he said.</TE>

<HD>Big Bear Masquerade Spreads a Little Fear but It Doesn't
Fool Anybody</HD>

<LD>Joseph Young of L.A. read in the Big Bear Grizzly's Sheriff's Log
that someone had contacted authorities about "three males with fake
beards and fake mustaches in a room next to him and his family." An
investigation found that the "three middle-aged men [were] attempting
to see if one of the wives was cheating on them."</LD>
<LD>   Something's coloring their attitude: With the strike deadline
nearing, I sneaked out to the Dodgers' day game Thursday (though I
forgot my fake beard and mustache). I couldn't help observing the
huge THINK BLUE sign on the hillside next to the stadium. Think blue?
But why, when the players and owners are thinking green.</LD>
<LD>   More mixed signals: Stan Martin of Huntington Beach found a joint
in Balboa that won't kowtow to customers (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   Unreal estate: Bob Bacon of West Covina spotted a real estate
listing that candidly promised some suffering--probably, Bacon
surmised, "when the buyer gets that first mortgage bill'' (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   New definition of fast food? A counselor in the L.A. Unified
School District, Jordan Austin, noticed a lunch menu with an
erroneous title (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Wrong place at the wrong time: The Los Alamitos News-Enterprise's
police log reported that a driver "damaged a wrought-iron gate trying
to drive out" of a cemetery after he "got locked inside."</TE>
<TE>   I bet Laker fans would warm to this: The idea of naming a street
or part of Staples Center after Chick Hearn, the Lakers' late
broadcaster, is commendable. But Alan Oda, a contributor to Don
Barrett's laradio.com Web site, suggested that the best tribute would
be to preserve one of Hearn's traditions.</TE>
<TE>   That is, when the Lakers have clinched a victory, the team's radio
station, KLAC (570), would cue up a tape of Hearn's trademark
announcement: "This game's in the refrigerator! The eggs are cooling
... " etc.</TE>
<TE>   The silent minority: On his Web site, Barrett has been asking
local radio personalities to recall their most grueling jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Wallengren of KOST (103.5) wrote that he started out as an
overnight DJ at a country music station in little Preston, Idaho.
Once, he was reading the turkey and cattle futures report when the
phone rang. He couldn't answer it, because he was alone in the
"Quonset hut" of a studio.</TE>
<TE>   It rang for the entire seven-minute report. "I could hear the
brrrrrr bleeding through on the air," he said. When he finally picked
it up, the caller hung up.</TE>
<TE>   "I screamed every awful word I knew," Wallengren said, not
noticing his mike was open. He figured his career was over, since he
had "done the George Carlin 'Seven Dirty Words' routine live on air."
He wondered "how much the FCC would fine me and how long my jail time
would be." He waited for the protests. But his phone never rang.</TE>
<TE>   "Not one person must have been listening," he said. "My turkey and
cattle futures report had saved me."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Responding to the pledge drive of radio station KCRW
(89.9), I forked over $50 because I also received a certificate for
two hot dogs and assorted goodies from the landmark Pink's stand. The
certificate won't enable me to break Orson Welles' record for hot-dog
consumption at Pink's. He wolfed down 18 at one sitting.</TE>

<HD>Camp Paper Leaves Its Imprint on Offenders</HD>
<DH>Boys who work on publication at probation facility say it
gives them a creative outlet and helps hone useful skills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Behind the high concrete walls of a Los Angeles County juvenile
probation center in the Santa Monica Mountains, a dozen boys clad in
orange shorts and white T-shirts discussed deadlines and tossed
around story ideas.</LD>
<LD>   While serving time at Camp David Gonzales, they run a newspaper,
Behind the Wall, that is unusual for a youth publication in several
respects.</LD>
<LD>   For one thing, there are two editions, different in an uncommon
way. About 200 copies are circulated within the camp, with pictures
of residents and full names on bylines; an additional 100 copies,
with faces obscured and last names omitted, are distributed to
Juvenile Court judges and members of the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors, which funds the camp.</LD>
<TE>   Then there is the constant turnover.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there's the wide scope of the newspaper's topics.</TE>
<TE>   Recent issues have included stories on subjects ranging from the
war in Afghanistan to the failure of Bernard C. Parks to win a second
term as chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. Regular features
include horoscopes and reviews of the weekly videos shown to camp
residents who exhibit good behavior.</TE>
<TE>   By all accounts, the paper is a hit. The boys say it helps them
pass their days, gives them an outlet for expression and even allows
them to hone skills useful on the outside.</TE>
<TE>   Judges responsible for the county's juvenile justice system give
the publication high marks, saying it provides them an unusual window
into camp operations.</TE>
<TE>   The publication offers the boys the opportunity to interact
positively with society, said Jo Kaplan, a member of the county
Probation Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this gives them some insight into their ability to change
things through writing," Kaplan said, "with a pen, rather than
fighting and anger. They're not going to stay locked up forever." The
paper, which has published six editions so far, is the brainchild of
Kaplan; another commission member, Carol Biondi; and Katrina Dewey,
editor of the Los Angeles Daily Journal.</TE>
<TE>   "The need for a communication method within the camp is pretty
serious," Dewey said. "They don't know a lot about the good or bad
that goes on within the camp, let alone the outside world."</TE>
<TE>   Judges and probation officers in the juvenile justice system say
the paper provides them insight into the children they're making
decisions about.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives them a good outlet for making their concerns about the
system known," said Victor Greenberg, a Juvenile Court commissioner.
"Whether or not there's agreement, it's still important to know how
they feel."</TE>
<TE>   Greenberg said he was impressed with the tone. The publication
could have been used merely as a vehicle for complaints, which hasn't
happened, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "From what I'm seeing, they're straightforward ... but the
articles are approaching both their problems in camp and their
successes in a very constructive way."</TE>
<TE>   Christian, 17, agreed. He said the adults don't censor them.</TE>
<TE>   "But we don't criticize stuff," he said. "We don't go against them
or with them. It's a privilege having a newspaper here."</TE>
<TE>   Christian types and proofreads the articles and designs pages. He
recently wrote about the fourth victory by cancer survivor Lance
Armstrong in the Tour de France.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in Christian's life, he is keeping a journal.
"When I listen to a song, I remember something and I write that
down," he said. "When I smell a fragrance and think of someone, I
write that down. I didn't do that before."</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of Crenshaw High School, Christian said writing has
become therapeutic. "All the wrath that builds up during the day, I
write it down at night," he said. "Slowly, I'm relieving my anger."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Saturday morning, members of the newspaper staff took
their seats around a long table among stacks of copies of the New
York Times, Los Angeles Times and other publications.</TE>
<TE>   Wilfredo, a tattoo spread across his neck, stood at the head of
the table. As editor in chief, he ran the weekly editorial planning
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 boys work on the paper at any given time. But the staff
changes constantly as youths get sent home or to other facilities. At
this meeting, Wilfredo looked out at teenagers of different races,
from different neighborhoods across the county, most of whom are
associated with different, and sometimes rival, street gangs.</TE>
<TE>   The main order of business was preparing the list of topics to be
covered in the coming issue. Using everyday newspaper lingo, the boys
called it a "budget."</TE>
<TE>   The opinion section needed material, Wilfredo said. World news
stories were skimpy too, he said. They had only a story about the
Inglewood police officers indicted in the beating of 16-year-old
Donovan Jackson. "It's better if we get two more stories," Wilfredo
said.</TE>
<TE>   They talked about assigning two reporters to cover a baseball game
against another youth probation camp, to be played that afternoon at
Camp Gonzales. One could write the news story, another could do an
opinion piece.</TE>
<TE>   Wilfredo warned the staff members who volunteered not to act like
those sent to cover the last game, who shouted obscenities at the
opposing team. And, "Please, no pictures of throwing signs or homies
kickin' it," Wilfredo instructed a photographer.</TE>
<TE>   With the budget filled, papers rustled and pencils scribbled as
the boys got to work--writing and doing research. The editor gave one
last directive: "When you guys write, really express yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Most involved said they had discovered the joy of writing. "I like
how you get to express how you feel and write about what's happening
in the world," said Jesse, 15. "I got on the newspaper, and my whole
thing changed. Before, I thought the way I was going to live is
gangbanging."</TE>

<HD>Tougher Laws Are the Best Antidote to Drunk Drivers</HD>

<LD>When murders occur, we all know how to react. We want the killer to
be caught and put away forever. Because there's virtually universal
agreement on that, it's the perfect opportunity for public officials
to step up, decry the violence and push for maximum punishment.</LD>
<LD>   It's not surprising, then, to see police or prosecutors before the
cameras in high-profile murder cases. Southern California and the
nation have provided no shortage of opportunities in recent months.</LD>
<LD>   But what about people who don't kill with guns, knives or their
hands? What about people whose weapon is a snootful of liquor and a
loaded SUV or pickup truck? The victims they leave behind are no less
dead, their loved ones no less bereaved, angered or demoralized.</LD>
<TE>   Where's the outrage when that happens? Where are the public
officials denouncing these crimes on camera?</TE>
<TE>   Even if they called press conferences, would the cameras and
newspaper reporters show up? Our ambivalence may well reflect
society's. Do we as a country view a drunk driver behind the wheel of
a 1-ton killer with the same contempt as a cold-blooded killer?</TE>
<TE>   We all know the answer is no.</TE>
<TE>   This has all come home to me because of a letter from the family
of a young Huntington Beach woman killed in March when a man alleged
to have been drunk ran a red light at 80 mph and plowed into a car
carrying the woman and two of her friends. All three women--Jillian
Baedeker, Chelsea Toma and Nancy Le--died; the alleged drunk driver,
James Paul Bell Jr., survived. Baedeker and Toma were 19, Le 18.</TE>
<TE>   The letter, written by Rick Baedeker, Jillian's father, to the
Orange County district attorney's office, is nothing less than a
family's anguished questions about justice.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter (the family sent me a copy), Baedeker writes: "In
the ensuing weeks [after the accident in March], friends and
relatives asked me if I was filled with hate for Mr. Bell. I said
that I was not, and that I had no intention of participating in the
trial unless asked to do so by the district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "At the same time, I expressed confidence in the legal system. I
was sure that the process would result in a just punishment for the
crime that ended the lives of three beautiful young girls and,
perhaps more important, a just punishment that would protect and
preserve an American society that does not allow drunk drivers to
kill its citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Baedeker says police told him Bell "would very likely" be charged
with murder. Instead, the D.A.'s office has charged him with gross
vehicular manslaughter while driving under the influence. If Bell has
no prior convictions, the maximum sentence would be in the 16-year
range. Baedeker says he has discovered that if Bell pleads guilty, he
could get a reduced sentence that might make him eligible for parole
in six to eight years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a just punishment?" Baedeker writes. "Two years for each
of the dead girls?"</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Brown, a senior assistant district attorney, oversaw the
review of the Bell case and confirms that prosecutors considered a
second-degree murder charge. The evidence, however, forced them to
file the lesser charge, Brown says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not tough to figure out what to file, morally," Brown says.
"It is tough to figure out what we can file based on the facts of the
case."</TE>
<TE>   He goes on to say that, despite Bell's alleged
drunkenness--ironically, perhaps because of it--prosecutors couldn't
prove he had the "conscious awareness" that he would kill someone.
Nor did other evidence exist to support the more serious charge.</TE>
<TE>   Brown promises that prosecutors will thoroughly review Bell's past
before sentencing recommendations are made to a judge.</TE>
<TE>   These cases disgust me, but I can't fault the D.A.'s decision.
Prosecutors are ethically bound to file only those charges they
believe the evidence supports. If the rest of us are outraged that
someone can get drunk and end up killing three people and possibly
face only a few years in prison, we should change the laws that guide
prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   That is exactly what the national Mothers Against Drunk Drivers
wants to do. Its new president is pushing the slogan, "Get MADD All
Over Again" as a way to "reignite the fire under the nation on the
issue of drunk driving," says Paula Birdsong, California's executive
director. An element of that would be to increase penalties for
drunk-driving deaths, she says.</TE>
<TE>   A final word from the Baedeker family:</TE>
<TE>   "A slap on the hand for this crime would be a sucker punch to the
families of Jillian, Chelsea and Nancy and a violation of our trust
in the criminal justice," Baedeker writes. "My family and I don't
want vengeance. We want a just punishment."</TE>
<TE>   In a way, the Baedeker family's complaint shouldn't go to the
D.A.'s office.</TE>
<TE>   It should go to all of us.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Freidann Parker, 77, co-founder of the Colorado Ballet, died Aug. 2
at a hospital in Denver of complications from E. coli infection,
which was diagnosed in early July.</LD>
<LD>   Colorado Ballet co-founder Lillian Covillo met Parker in the late
1940s in a dance class taught by Martha Wilcox. The two began the
Covillo-Parker School of Dance, then a fledgling ballet company.</LD>
<LD>   After an ambitious double bill in 1961, Covillo and Parker created
Colorado Concert Ballet, which presented Denver's first "Nutcracker"
the following season. Every performance sold out. By 1978, the board
of directors more than doubled its budget to $100,000, and Colorado
Ballet was born. Today its budget has grown to $7 million with a
roster of 40 dancers.</LD>
<TE>   A native of Cheyenne Wells, Colo., Parker's first dance lessons
were with Iris Potter. She later trained with modern-dance pioneer
Hanya Holm.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lillian Goldman, 80, an advocate for women's education who donated
more than $20 million to Yale Law School, died Tuesday of pancreatic
cancer at her home in East Hampton, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Goldman donated to Yale's law school in part because it was one of
the first in the country to accept women.</LD>
<LD>   Her gift was used for the expansion and reconstruction of the
school's library, which was renamed the Lillian Goldman Law Library.
It was also used to endow a day-care center at the school and for
scholarships, especially for women and those interested in studying
women's rights.</LD>
<TE>   Born Lillian Schuman in New York City, she married Sol Goldman
when she was 19. She urged him to leave his family's grocery business
and invest in New York City real estate. At the time of his death in
1987, Goldman was one of the largest private landlords in New York
City.</TE>
<TE>   Lillian Goldman also made significant donations to the Alzheimer's
Assn. and the Parkinson's Disease Foundation, among other
organizations.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Turpal-Ali Atgeriyev, a former Chechen rebel commander and top
official in the region's rebel government, died Sunday while serving
a 15-year prison term for terrorism, officials said Thursday. He was
either 32 or 33.</LD>
<LD>   Atgeriyev died of a leukemia-related brain hemorrhage at a prison
hospital in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg, the Russian
Justice Ministry said.</LD>
<LD>   He fought in the 1994-1996 Chechnya war with Russia and was
believed to be one of the masterminds--along with prominent rebel
Salman Raduyev--behind a 1996 raid on the southern Russian town of
Kizlyar in which 78 people were killed. Rebels took hundreds of
hostages at a hospital and used some as human shields.</LD>
<TE>   After the war, Atgeriyev became deputy prime minister and head of
security in Aslan Maskhadov's rebel government.</TE>
<TE>   However, when the conflict resumed in 1999, Maskhadov and other
rebel leaders suspected him of cooperating with Russian authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Atgeriyev was sentenced to 15 years in prison for
terrorism and hostage-taking, while Raduyev was sentenced to a life
term.</TE>

<HD>PG&amp;E's Creditors Side With PUC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM REITERMAN and NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State utility regulators and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. creditors
announced a deal Thursday that would raise electricity rates, if
necessary, to pay the company's debts and restore California's
largest utility to financial health.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement was a victory for the Public Utilities Commission
because the creditors' committee had taken a neutral position on
whether PG&amp;E should be reorganized under its own plan or a PUC
alternative. The judge overseeing the bankruptcy case is expected to
consider the creditors' wishes as he decides which reorganization
plan to adopt.</LD>
<LD>   The PUC has opposed PG&amp;E's proposed reorganization, in part,
because it contemplates spinning off parts of the company in such a
way that they would not be subject to regulation by the state agency.</LD>
<TE>   With Thursday's announcement, the official committee of unsecured
creditors is joining forces with the PUC to push a modified plan that
requires regulators to keep rates high enough to cover PG&amp;E's costs
of financing $1.75 billion in debts.</TE>
<TE>   "We obviously support this proposal," said creditors' committee
attorney Paul Aronzon, contending it would bring PG&amp;E out of
bankruptcy more quickly. The PUC plan also has fewer regulatory
hurdles, and it provides payment of debts entirely in cash, while
PG&amp;E's would pay 40% of the debt with notes.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the PUC plan say they will ask a bankruptcy judge to
approve a new round of voting by creditors on the competing
proposals. The first round ended Aug. 12, and the results have not
been announced.</TE>
<TE>   In a written statement, PG&amp;E said, "The PUC announcement today,
weeks after the voting period ended, underscores the fact that its
current plan is not feasible and cannot be confirmed.</TE>
<TE>   "PG&amp;E continues to believe its plan of reorganization is the
fastest, fairest and most feasible solution."</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E needs more information about the PUC's modified proposal
before commenting further, the statement added.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Dennis Montali will approve one of the plans or neither in
early November.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors on April 6,
2001, saying it had incurred billions of dollars in energy-related
debts. PG&amp;E blamed the PUC for its financial plight and proposed to
reorganize by spinning power-generation assets into a new subsidiary
of its parent, PG&amp;E Corp. The PUC condemned the plan as a "regulatory
jailbreak" and proposed its own plan that would maintain its
jurisdiction over PG&amp;E.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups have condemned both deals as consumer-financed
bailouts of a failed deregulation scheme once supported by utilities.
"This renegade PUC has once again raped the ratepayers in violation
of state law," said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Santa
Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. The
organization would go to court to try to stop the plan, he said.</TE>
<TE>   PUC General Counsel Gary Cohen said "rates should be able to come
down shortly after PG&amp;E comes out of bankruptcy" next year because
last year's record rate increases should more than cover the
utility's costs and debt payments.</TE>

<HD>Youths Carve a Gift of Peace for N.Y.</HD>
<DH>Sept. 11: The 'healing pole' that helped them is offered to
city still recovering from terrorist attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALINAS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Joseph Werner has never seen the healing pole. But he recognizes the
pungent smell of the 1,100-year-old cedar.</LD>
<LD>   He knows it's 2 1/2 stories tall and two arms' length thick. He's
told that the protective lacquer makes it turn the color of maple
syrup in the sun. And when he slides his fingers over the bumps and
grooves carved into the log by troubled teenagers during the last two
years, he can feel the shapes of dolphins, owls and bears.</LD>
<LD>   Werner lost his sight in a hit-and-run car accident 20 years ago,
but the Monterey County youth leader believes the majestic carving,
which resembles a totem pole, has a certain power. He and the teens
in his charge, who painstakingly produced it with the help of a
master artisan from New Zealand, now hope it will bring peace to New
Yorkers mourning the losses of Sept. 11.</LD>
<TE>   In Polynesian and Native American traditions, the carved wood is
believed to take on healing powers through its creators, who exorcise
their sorrows through their hammers and chisels. Today, the pole will
be tied to a truck in Salinas and driven to New York City's Bronx
Zoo, its new home.</TE>
<TE>   A Fresh Start</TE>
<TE>   The journey marks a new beginning for many of the youths, who had
been struggling with problems ranging from truancy to drug abuse, and
for the log itself, which came from Alaska. It was brought to
California in the 1920s by the Navy, which used it to support a pier
at an ammunition depot in Port Chicago, 35 miles north of San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The pier was destroyed in an accidental explosion in 1944 that
killed 320 servicemen, two-thirds of them African American cargo
handlers working without safety equipment. The blast, which
registered 3.5 on the Richter scale, is credited by military
historians with initiating the debate on desegregating the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   The log was tossed on the banks of Suisan Bay in the 1980s. A
decade later, it and nine others from the pier were about to become
firewood. A group of environmentalists bought them and gave three to
Werner's One Voice Arts and Leadership Program, a state-run federal
project. Shane Eagleton, the New Zealand artist who has been working
with the program since 1998, took on 12 of Werner's charges in the
summer of 2000 to carve the pole. Their goal was to give the finished
work to a community coming to grips with some sort of tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Using 27 chainsaws of different sizes, Eagleton made a
double-helix pattern around the log. The twisting strands represent
the continuity of nature and the links among people of different
backgrounds and races. His hope was that the concept would inspire
the youths and broaden their horizons.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these kids were rough in the center," said Eagleton, who
is currently working with youths in Hawaii and has provided stage art
for touring bands such as Pink Floyd and the Grateful Dead. "They
never worked with art, and coming from low-income families, they
didn't have a lot of outlets to express themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Esquivel, one of the 12 teens, said he and the others were
initially intimidated by the project because they had never tried
woodcarving and feared it would be beyond their skills. However, he
was intrigued by Eagleton, whose encouragement was unrelenting. "I
didn't know if I could do it," the 18-year-old said. "But as I kept
going, I decided to follow through. I did my best and I got better at
it. I finished what I started and I never missed a day."</TE>
<TE>   Esquivel had just been through a tough year. He was expelled from
his high school for skipping too many classes and had to finish 10th
grade at a continuation site. After working on the pole, he said, he
was able to resume his studies. He made up lost credits and graduated
on time last spring. His next goal is community college.</TE>
<TE>   Demetrious Huggins, 19, often smoked marijuana and drank before a
friend suggested he join One Voice, where he volunteered for the
healing pole project. He was so moved by the experience that summer
that he wrote an essay about how working on the carving team changed
his life, saying it was important "not to waste any more time" and he
wanted to "use all of [his] ability to help others."</TE>
<TE>   Huggins enrolled in remedial classes to earn his high school
diploma, which he expects to receive next month.</TE>
<TE>   Huggins and the others worked in a chilly warehouse with no
electricity at the abandoned Fort Ord Army base nearby. Carving
sessions lasted from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. to capitalize on sunlight. At
first, the wary teens formed cliques along racial lines: African
American, Asian, Latino. But within a couple of weeks, they were
hammering in rhythm, marveling at the centuries-old pockets of wet
resin still trapped in the wood.</TE>
<TE>   The teens learned to share the precious surface of the pole,
coordinating the outcomes of their designs so as to not interfere
with one another. They took field trips together to the aquarium and
the beach. Soon the two girls with cars started giving the group
rides to town to grab lunch.</TE>
<TE>   As the days passed, the renderings on the pole became clearer. The
work became easier. The young workers' confidence soared.</TE>
<TE>   "The good thing about woodcarving is that you can't really mess
up, you just chisel deeper," said 18-year-old Jaymes Lambert, a
childhood friend of Huggins' who now also attends remedial classes.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the eight-week project, the moldy three-ton log had
been transformed into an intricate display of wildlife images: a
grizzly bear, a bottlenose dolphin, a jellyfish. At the top of the
pole sits a phoenix with its wings spread.</TE>
<TE>   The teens were paid $2,500 each for their work--a lot of money for
youths from newly arrived immigrant families, financially strapped
single-parent households or homes where nobody was employed. Huggins
said he gave most of his earnings to his mother to help pay the rent.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the summer, when the project was nearly done and the
teens had to go back to school, no home had been chosen for the pole.
So it remained in a warehouse. Another summer came, and with it a new
group of teens, who added scales to the pole's fish figures and
feathers to its birds. Then came Sept. 11, and a home for the healing
pole became "painfully obvious," Werner said.</TE>
<TE>   Perfect Environment</TE>
<TE>   A Bronx native, Werner thought of the zoo as the perfect
environment for the pole's wildlife motif. But zoo administrators
seemed lukewarm. So he mailed them a video documentary on the making
of the pole.</TE>
<TE>   What the zoo officials saw on the tape included an emotional
candlelight vigil around the pole in Palm Springs, where it was
displayed for 600 participants in California youth programs. Also on
the video were some of the original 12 teens, recounting their work
and the feeling of accomplishment it provided.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after, Werner told the zoo representatives about the
Monterey County police and firefighters who had the outlines of their
hands carved into the pole in solidarity with their New York
counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   The pole's history and the project's impact on the teens proved
irresistible. "We were knocked flat," said Steven Sanderson,
president of the Wildlife Conservation Society, which runs the zoo.</TE>
<TE>   The pole is expected to arrive in New York on Wednesday. On Sept.
5, it will be unveiled beside a waterfall in the zoo. Werner and
Eagleton will meet the pole in New York, and Huggins and Lambert, the
only two of the original 12 still involved with One Voice, will also
be there.</TE>
<TE>   "I can envision thousands of people applying their personal
experience to this pole," said Werner, who credits the project with
helping him finally forgive the people who crashed into his
motorcycle and left him for dead years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's divorce, hardship, lost loved ones, hunger or
poverty, they can look at what these people have created with this
project and heal together."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Nun Sues Priest, Alleging 1983 Rape</HD>
<DH>Courts: The Texas cleric has been put on leave by the
bishop of Dallas. The suit alleges a cover-up by church officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former nun living in Chatsworth has sued a Roman Catholic priest,
alleging that he raped her in the Philippines 19 years ago and that
she gave birth to a son.</LD>
<LD>   In the lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Sylvia Abano
Martinez Arambulo and her son, Jonathan Tomas Martinez Arambulo,
accuse Father Ernesto Corral Villaroya of rape and assault in
December 1983 and allege that church officials covered up his
conduct.</LD>
<LD>   Arambulo said she came forward to help other victims and sisters.
"Maybe you can find other victims. That would please me," she told
reporters Thursday at a news conference announcing the suit, which
was filed Aug. 8.</LD>
<TE>   Before the lawsuit, Villaroya served as a priest in Ennis, Texas.
The bishop of Dallas, Charles V. Grahmann, placed him on
administrative leave after the priest informed him last Friday of the
lawsuit and its allegations, said Mary Edlund, chancellor for that
diocese. Edlund said Villaroya told the bishop the relationship with
Arambulo was consensual. He admitted "to an inappropriate
relationship with an adult woman," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Villaroya's parishioners at St. John of Nepomucene were informed
Sunday that he was placed on leave because of the allegations, Edlund
said. He could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In an apparent effort to publicize the suit against Villaroya,
Arambulo, her son and their attorney conducted their news conference
in the shadow of the soon-to-be-dedicated Our Lady of the Angels
Cathedral in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that the archdioceses of Los Angeles, San Antonio and
Masbate in the Philippines all conspired to keep the identity and
location [of Villaroya]" from the plaintiff, said George Goldberg,
her attorney. Goldberg later conceded that the Texas allegations
related to the Diocese of Dallas, not San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   While the suit names all three dioceses, Goldberg said he had
suspicions but no evidence of such a conspiracy. Moments after
Goldberg spoke, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Archdiocese, Tod
Tamberg, called the suit's naming of the archdiocese "malicious" and
said church attorneys will seek a State Bar investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "This frivolous lawsuit was apparently filed to generate publicity
for this woman's lawyer," Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg said Villaroya was not a priest in the Los Angeles
Archdiocese, but during the 1990s was living in Los Angeles "and
performing the functions of a priest.... In 1991, 1993 and 1995, we
sent him letters ... and told him to cease and desist." The Times
reported in 1991 that Villaroya had been ordered to stop performing
priestly functions at St. Philomena church in Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Edlund, of the Dallas Diocese, said Villaroya told officials there
that he lived privately in the Los Angeles area in the early 1990s
because he was looking after his elderly parents. Six years ago, the
bishop of Masbate approved Villaroya's transfer to the Dallas Diocese
and sent a letter to its vicar of clergy, saying he was a priest in
good standing, Edlund said.</TE>
<TE>   Villaroya, she said, was assigned to the parish of the Good
Shepard in Garland, Texas, and then, under normal rotation,
transferred to St. John's in Ennis.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Goldberg said his client has waited nearly two decades to
act because she was afraid to pursue legal action in the Philippines
and could not find the priest.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, however, Villaroya contacted her and asked to
meet the son, Goldberg said. In June, Villaroya allegedly signed a
notarized declaration of paternity after Arambulo's 18-year-old son
sought him out, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The son confronted the father, and the father acknowledged
paternity, but he does not acknowledge the rape," Goldberg said.</TE>

<HD>Teen Sues Ex-Coach, School in Sex Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Glendale teenager who had sex with her basketball coach has sued
him, her former private high school and its owner.</LD>
<LD>   The girl and her parents filed the lawsuit Tuesday in Los Angeles
County Superior Court. It accuses Paul Calvin Clark III--convicted in
June on four counts of sex with a minor--of manipulating the girl
into an illegal sexual relationship, which she says began last year
in his office at Ribet Academy, a private school in the Glassell Park
area of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Clark is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 10.</LD>
<TE>   The girl is now 16. (The Times does not identify victims of sex
crimes, or their families.) Clark is 35 and no longer works at Ribet.</TE>
<TE>   The school and its owner, Ron Sires, ignored reports that Clark
and the student were sexually involved, the teen and her parents
contend in their lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   And in hiring Clark, Ribet failed to check his background, which
contained reports of similarly inappropriate activity with underage
students at other schools, the suit says.</TE>
<TE>   The family is seeking a refund of the tuition paid to Ribet and
unspecified monetary damages.</TE>
<TE>   "The victim has been harmed and will definitely suffer further
harm as an adult based upon what happened as a teenager," the
plaintiffs' attorney, David Ring, said.</TE>
<TE>   Sires denied Thursday that he or any school administrator was
negligent in hiring Clark, and said Ribet officials received no
reports of sexual misconduct. "This is a lawsuit without facts
supporting it," Sires said, adding he and fellow administrators are
"outraged" by the suit and plan to countersue the plaintiffs and
their attorney for defamation and other causes.</TE>
<TE>   Clark's attorney, Robert M. Bernstein, said, "We believe that this
demonstrates exactly what we said [during the criminal trial], that
[the girl's family is] seeking financial gain out of this and that
was the reason they pursued criminal prosecution."</TE>

<HD>Court Hears Appeal of Burbank Prayer Ruling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A panel of state appellate court justices heard arguments Thursday on
whether a court-ordered ban on sectarian prayer violates the free
speech rights of religious leaders invited to pray before public
meetings, as contended by officials in Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, a Los Angeles County judge ruled that Burbank City
Council meetings cannot begin with sectarian prayers.</LD>
<LD>   During oral arguments Thursday, the justices questioned Chief
Assistant City Atty. Juli C. Scott about Burbank's position.</LD>
<TE>   Justice Michael G. Nott of the 2nd District Court of Appeal asked
Scott how Burbank residents would respond if a council meeting were
opened with a Muslim prayer referring to Allah.</TE>
<TE>   Scott argued that it is irrelevant to the case whether such a
prayer would offend city residents. She said enforcement of the
court-ordered ban on sectarian prayer requires city officials to
censor speech, violating the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   "This [case] is not about religion," she argued.</TE>
<TE>   But attorney Roger Jon Diamond, a free-speech advocate, rejected
that argument.</TE>
<TE>   "I guarantee you, the Christians would be outraged" by a Muslim
prayer, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Irv Rubin, the Jewish Defense League's national director, sued the
city of Burbank after he attended a council meeting in November 1999
that began with a Christian prayer. He was at the meeting to oppose
the expansion of the Burbank airport.</TE>
<TE>   At that meeting, David King, a Mormon bishop, led a 67-second
prayer that ended " ... in the name of Jesus Christ."</TE>
<TE>   King had been recruited by the Burbank Ministerial Assn., whose
mostly Christian members volunteer to lead the invocation at council
meetings. The association has just two non-Christian members, and
they are both Jewish, Scott told the justices Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin was one of two plaintiffs in the Burbank case. In a separate
case, he was charged in January with plotting to bomb a Culver City
mosque and a congressman's office. He is in custody at the
Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles while awaiting
trial, Diamond said.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin "definitely wants to go forward with this case," Diamond
said.</TE>
<TE>   The justices are expected to issue an opinion within 90 days.
Besides Nott, the other justices on the case are Kathryn Doi Todd and
Judith Ashmann-Gerst.</TE>

<HD>Business Group Sponsors Secession Debate</HD>

<LD>An influential San Fernando Valley business group prepared to weigh
in on secession by hosting a conference and debate Thursday, where a
new study was released that finds Los Angeles does not keep and
attract business as well as smaller cities.</LD>
<LD>   The Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., which sponsored the event
in Studio City with several other business groups, plans to send
ballots to its members next week, asking whether it should support
the Valley's breaking away from Los Angeles. The conference was seen
as an important last chance by both sides of the issue to influence
the association's 300 corporate members, which include the Walt
Disney Co., Universal Studios and Southern California Edison.</LD>
<LD>   "With 2 1/2 months left before the election, it's important we
take advantage of every opportunity to explain to the business
community the advantages of a smaller city with lower taxes," said
Richard Katz, co-chairman of the Valley Independence Committee.</LD>
<TE>   Katz was particularly encouraged that secessionists' complaints
were supported by a study released by the Rose Institute of State and
Local Government at Claremont McKenna College.</TE>
<TE>   The study found that Los Angeles was in the bottom half of the
county's 88 cities in collection of sales tax per capita, an
indication it is not doing well in attracting and keeping retail
business and convincing residents to shop in the city, said the
institute's Steve Frates. "Los Angeles could easily increase its
sales tax 10% to 12% if it were more business-friendly," he said. Los
Angeles, for instance, has the second-highest tax in the county on
gross receipts.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rose Institute adds facts to what is commonly believed to be
true, which is that the anti-business nature of the city of L.A.
draws businesses out of the city," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   The study also found that Los Angeles ranked 38th out of 88 cities
in the county in 1999 in the amount of state money received per
capita and ranked 9th in federal funds, doing less well than Long
Beach and other smaller cities.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the Valley claim that it doesn't get its fair share,
the study found that only a fraction of the city's redevelopment
money is spent in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   And while Los Angeles ranks 10th countywide in per-capita spending
on police, per-capita spending in the Valley is about half that.</TE>
<TE>   City Controller Laura Chick said Los Angeles is addressing the
problems that the study identified, beefing up its police force and
embarking on tax reform. Those issues, she said, don't warrant
breaking up the city.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take five to 10 years of pain and uncertainty to
get a new city on its feet," she said. "Why can't we allow Los
Angeles to take two to four years to turn the ship around, when it is
already turning?"</TE>
<TE>   The debates at the conference demonstrated how Los Angeles'
business community is sharply divided, largely along geographic
lines, over the issue.</TE>
<TE>   In one debate, the pro-secession side was taken by Joel Simon,
vice chairman of the United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando
Valley, which recently voted 31 to 13 to support secession. The
opposition was handled by Rusty Hammer of the downtown-based Greater
Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Simon cited the new study and said a smaller Valley city would cut
business taxes. "The plain truth is, Los Angeles is not
business-friendly," he said. "L.A. has a bloated government. It
wastes money."</TE>
<TE>   Hammer noted that the city has begun tax reform and reduction. The
fact that more than half of the council members are relatively new
gives momentum to that reform, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The real issue here is things that have brought about reforms
include term limits, which have brought us a new generation of
leaders," Hammer said.</TE>
<TE>   Some attendees were surprised that Mayor James K. Hahn did not
attend the conference, which would have provided a chance to
influence next week's balloting. A Hahn representative said he was on
vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Hollywood secession leader Gene La Pietra sought to woo
business leaders in that community with a lunch Thursday and an
outline of plans to cut the business tax by at least 50%. The plan
would provide further tax credits to new businesses moving into
Hollywood as well as firms that use local vendors.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to be a company town. We are going to be a union
town," he told the 100 people present, including members of the
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Citing West Hollywood as the model for what Hollywood should
become, La Pietra also previewed a "rough cut" of the television
commercial that the secession group plans to begin airing soon on
cable and broadcast stations.</TE>
<TE>   Featuring a German rock band singing "Hey L.A., set Hollywood
free. Give her back her dignity," the videotape shows community
landmarks such as the Hollywood sign, as well as La Pietra speaking
about how the community will be revitalized.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Watts community activist Daude Sherrills announced
a rally today to seek support for a plan to put a measure on next
year's ballot to have Watts and South-Central Los Angeles break away
from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Watts as a community has been misrepresented,'' he said.</TE>

<HD>Fatal Bar Shooting Shatters Peace in Tiny Sierra Madre</HD>
<DH>Violence: The incident earlier this month gives residents
of the enclave an unwelcome taste of the crime associated with a big
city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORA ZAMICHOW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The drone of a circling police helicopter woke many people in Sierra
Madre in the black of a recent August night.</LD>
<LD>   Problem in nearby Pasadena, one man thought. Traffic accident,
thought another. But darned if that noise didn't sound as if it were
directly overhead.</LD>
<LD>   Must be a fire, thought Sierra Madre Mayor Doug Hayes. He pulled
himself out of bed, stepped barefoot into his car and drove downtown
toward the chopper's searchlights.</LD>
<TE>   There he found the Tailgators sports bar roped off with yellow
police tape. Blood splattered the sidewalk and five bullet holes
chipped the bar's stucco wall. Hayes quickly learned that one man had
been shot dead, that another man was being held and that police were
seeking a third man who had fled on foot.</TE>
<TE>   For tiny Sierra Madre, 17 miles northeast of Los Angeles, it was
the first fatal shooting in 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Something like that, for crying out loud, is never supposed to
happen here," said Hayes, 51, whose eyes filled with tears. "We're
not used to dealing with anything wilder than an out-of-control
skateboarder."</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Madre is among the last small towns in Los Angeles County.
Residents like to say that if someone sneezes while walking past
Howie's Market, by the time he reaches Arnold's Hardware store, owner
Bob Hatfield will ask: "How's your cold?"</TE>
<TE>   A local newspaper once ran a front-page headline that blared: "A
Week of Tragedy in Sierra Madre." The story described a minor traffic
accident and how some kids had put detergent in a koi pond, killing
the fish. Because of this small-town intimacy, many locals refer to
Sierra Madre as Mayberry, after the squeaky-clean town in the 1960s
TV series, "The Andy Griffith Show."</TE>
<TE>   But in the early morning hours of Aug. 8, a big-city crime hit
George Lopez's Tailgators sports bar. Lopez arrived at his bar at
11:30 p.m. on Aug. 7, a Wednesday. Three men walked in soon after.
He'd never seen them before. That was unusual. At Tailgators, most of
the patrons are townspeople or buddies of Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   In Sierra Madre, George Lopez--like many here--is known by his
first name. Lopez, 42, retired from the Los Angeles Police Department
last year. He had been a cop for 20 years, working a variety of
assignments, including undercover narcotics and SWAT, before deciding
he'd had enough. He was fed up with the politics and the lousy
reputation he felt police had gotten after the beating of Rodney
King. A couple of bad officers, he said, shouldn't taint the entire
department.</TE>
<TE>   When he left the LAPD, he hoped to make a living running his
restaurant and sports bar. He believed his enterprise would be more
profitable if he worked full time, rather than squeezing in time
between shifts. He also wanted more time with his wife and their two
sons. One Christmas, wanting his boys to learn compassion, he and his
family distributed several hundred dinners, cooked at his restaurant,
to the homeless in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Experience told Lopez that the three strangers were casing his
bar. Uneasy, he asked a bartender to check the bathroom. The
bartender walked in just as one of the three strangers punched a
patron, Lopez said. After that, the three men headed for the front
door. Lopez said he followed.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make sure they were going," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Just outside the front door, standing a few feet away, one of the
men pulled out a gun, Lopez said, and pointed it at Lopez, then at
Lopez's friend, an off-duty LAPD officer.</TE>
<TE>   As the gunman aimed again at Lopez, the off-duty officer drew a
weapon and the two exchanged fire.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez had always prided himself on being prepared. But suddenly,
he recalled, "I'm a retired officer without a gun in a gunfight."</TE>
<TE>   In his 20-year police career, Lopez said, he had never shot
anyone. Now he wanted a gun in the worst way, and it was inside the
bar.</TE>
<TE>   When the shooting was over, one of the strangers, John Lamar
Chavez, a 34-year-old Duarte resident, lay fatally wounded on the
sidewalk holding a .22-caliber semiautomatic handgun. Lopez and his
friends subdued another member of the trio. The third man took off
running. Sierra Madre police arrived, but they do not handle
homicides; L.A. County sheriff's deputies were called in.</TE>
<TE>   "Having worked undercover narcotics and SWAT and I come to
Mayberry, and here I have a gun pointed at me," Lopez remembers
thinking. "Wow, that's a trip."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said he has since lost a bartender and a DJ, both unnerved
by the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Madre, with a population of nearly 11,000, is the
third-safest city in the state, ranking behind Hillsborough in
Northern California and San Marino, according to an FBI report. The
city's 18 police officers face an average of seven thefts and five
burglaries a month.</TE>
<TE>   More often, residents call police when they are locked out of
their homes or when the neighbor's dog is barking. A Sierra Madre
officer last fired a gun in 1996 when pursuing a fleeing robber. He
missed, but the suspect was caught anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's real quiet, and we like it that way," said Sierra Madre
Police Chief Wayne Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after the gunfire at Tailgators, phones at the police
station began ringing: Were those gunshots?  What's the deal with the
helicopters?</TE>
<TE>   Joni Conlon, 39, a hairstylist who lives a block from the bar, was
awakened by flashing lights. Eighteen years in Sierra Madre and she
couldn't remember anything like this.</TE>
<TE>   Conlon panicked after the police dispatcher told her about the
shooting and the search for a man who ran from the bar. Were her
windows and doors locked? she wondered.</TE>
<TE>   At 4 a.m., Conlon, mother of a 2-year-old, called police again.
She told them her husband, whose job is exercising horses, was
leaving for work and should not be mistaken for the wanted man.</TE>
<TE>   Later that morning, when Bob Hatfield's son-in-law, Mitch
Schwartz, arrived to open the hardware store, there was still blood
on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz and his wife, Susan, live in Tel Aviv but were in Sierra
Madre visiting family. Citing the violence in Israel, they said, most
friends and relatives were trying to dissuade them from returning.</TE>
<TE>   The couple had just returned from Las Vegas, where there had also
been a shooting. That had not surprised them, but now, a homicide in
Sierra Madre, where Susan had grown up?</TE>
<TE>   Word of the shooting spread quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Arlene Decker Jones, 77, heard about the incident the way most
people did--through telephone calls with friends. One friend phoned
and complained about the noise from the helicopters. Jones phoned
another friend, who told her about the killing.</TE>
<TE>   " 'No, not here, not Sierra Madre,' " Jones recalls saying.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Reed, former editor of a town newspaper, heard the police
helicopter as she went to bed. When she awoke later in the morning
and still heard the helicopter, she figured something had gone awry
in Pasadena. A local reporter phoned Reed, 73, around 9 a.m. to ask
about the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Reed--propelled by curiosity--grabbed her camera, jumped into her
pickup truck and drove to the crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   No ma'am, an officer told her, she could not come inside the
yellow police tape to take pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Reed had one question: Was George OK? Yes, she was told. She said
Lopez had catered her daughter's wedding and she had always liked
him.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Reed explained, most people found it reassuring that
neither the shooter nor the victim was from Sierra Madre. "Everyone
will say, 'It was someone outside our town,' " Reed said. "A Sierra
Madran didn't shoot a Sierra Madran."</TE>
<TE>   That was small consolation, said the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "Reality hit home that morning, that we are a town like any
other," Hayes said, "and bad things happen."</TE>

<HD>Giuliani Stumps for Simon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With his campaign besieged by questions about his business ethics and
political viability, Republican gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr.
on Thursday turned to his onetime boss, former New York City mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, as a character reference.</LD>
<LD>   Giuliani, who was the U.S. attorney for Manhattan when Simon
worked in the office in the 1980s, said his friend's character may be
obscured in the rough and tumble of a political campaign.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a man of absolute and complete integrity," Giuliani said
outside the East Los Angeles Sheriff's Station, as Simon stood by his
side. "This is a man who is enormously well qualified to be a leader
for the state of California."</LD>
<TE>   In attendance, though, were supporters of Gov. Gray Davis, some
dressed in jailhouse stripes, who waved signs accusing Simon of
investment fraud. It was a reference to a $78-million verdict against
Simon's investment firm last month.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis backers skirmished with dozens of Simon supporters, who
tried to superimpose their "Bill Simon for Governor" placards over
the larger anti-Simon posters. Simon's motorcade made a detour to
avoid the Davis supporters, dropping the candidate and Giuliani off
in a side parking lot at the sheriff's station.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's appearance was intended to highlight Simon's
endorsement by a splinter union representing about 1,000 employees of
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. But Giuliani and Simon
spent most of the time fielding questions about the White House's
lukewarm backing of the Simon campaign and the fraud verdict.</TE>
<TE>   "Lawsuits are lawsuits," Giuliani said. "I've seen $90-million
verdicts reduced to $2 million."</TE>
<TE>   Simon also insisted he had White House backing, although President
Bush will not appear with Simon in public during a California swing
today and Saturday.</TE>

<HD>Brazilians Turning to Mexican Smugglers, U.S. Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Security: Authorities believe many are enticed by groups in
their native country that collaborate with traffickers south of the
U.S. border.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With mounting debt, a baby on the way and few prospects in their
small town of Criciuma, Brazil, Luciani Motta and her husband
Scharles turned their sights on America.</LD>
<LD>   After being rejected several times for a tourist visa, the young
couple headed north, planning to enter the United States illegally
through Mexico. Scharles Motta made it; his wife and daughter did
not.</LD>
<LD>   They are among nearly 2,200 Brazilians arrested so far this year
by the U.S. Border Patrol. Last year, the number was 3,200, up from
about 250 in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   The trend, U.S. immigration officials say, points to the growing
international appeal of Mexican smuggling rings that have honed their
skills over decades of transporting mostly Mexican migrants into the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The great majority of those caught at the border are still
Mexicans and Central Americans, but even as their numbers have
dwindled in recent years--from 1.55 million in 1998 to 1.24 million
last year--those of other countries have doubled in that same period
from about 10,500 to 22,000.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego County alone, Border Patrol agents have apprehended
more than 1,200 Brazilians in the last three years, the
second-highest nationality behind Mexicans. San Diego border agents
also captured 143 Chinese, 51 Ukrainians, 45 Cubans and 43 Russians
trying to cross from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a major corridor for migrant smuggling," said Adele
Fasano, Immigration and Naturalization Service director for the San
Diego district. "Unfortunately, because there is such a
well-developed infrastructure of Mexican smuggling rings, that
infrastructure is now being used to support international smuggling."</TE>
<TE>   The phenomenon has also raised the specter of terrorists using
Mexico as a passageway to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the highest state of alert," Fasano said. "The concern
is that the smugglers will change their tactics. They get more
sophisticated as we get more sophisticated."</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in October, INS agents at all ports of entry will
photograph and fingerprint foreign visitors deemed to represent
terrorist risks. The technology, already employed on a limited basis,
has helped the agency apprehend thousands of wanted criminals trying
to reenter the country since the beginning of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the tightening security on U.S. borders, or maybe because
of it, Brazilians and others are turning in growing numbers to
Mexican smugglers, immigration officials said. The route is
particularly appealing to Brazilians because they do not need a visa
to enter Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe many are being enticed by smuggling rings in
their native country that are collaborating with Mexican traffickers
for a piece of the lucrative business.</TE>
<TE>   Migrants pay up to $3,000 for the services of a "coyote," or
smuggler, once in Mexico, but middlemen charge their own fees along
the way, which can add thousands more.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe these people are being lured systematically" by the
smugglers, said Marissol Romares, deputy consul of the Brazilian
Consulate in Los Angeles. The migrants "are usually humble and
gullible people from small towns. They are sold on dreams of
America."</TE>
<TE>   Like others before them, the Mottas saw the U.S. as an escape from
their country's perennial socioeconomic ills, made worse recently by
a stubborn recession.</TE>
<TE>   The Mottas heard tales of other Brazilians who made it to the U.S.
One city in Brazil, Governador Valadares, has been nicknamed
Governador Valadolares, because of the dollars, or dolares in
Portuguese, sent back by its native sons and daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Scharles Motta, 27, needed dolares. Working as a waiter in
Criciuma, his wife said, he made barely enough to support himself.</TE>
<TE>   He had tried several times to get a tourist visa, but American
consular officials in Sao Paulo correctly suspected that he intended
to stay in the U.S. and seek work.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, he met Luciani, an office worker and aspiring
teacher. The couple married two years later. With his new wife, Motta
again applied for a visa and was turned down. A year later, Luciani
Motta was pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   "His dream was to make enough money to buy us a house" in
Criciuma, said Luciani, 29. "He always said he didn't want to live in
the U.S. permanently. He didn't want to live his life hiding" as an
illegal immigrant.</TE>
<TE>   That's the life he is living now. Two years ago, Scharles Motta
bought a ticket to Mexico City, his wife said. Someone who had made
the trip before suggested the Mexican route to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, he connected with smugglers who directed him to Tijuana
and then guided him through the treacherous border terrain east of
San Diego and into the U.S. Similar treks have claimed more than 200
lives this year alone, from hypothermia and heat exhaustion,
according to the U.S. Border Patrol. Once in the U.S., Motta flew to
Boston, his final destination.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, despite her husband's vehement warnings about the
dangers, Luciani Motta tried to follow, with their young daughter in
her arms.</TE>
<TE>   Border Patrol agents caught Motta, her daughter and seven others
by the side of Interstate 8 near El Centro in June, abandoned by
their smugglers, bodies bruised by the desert.</TE>
<TE>   The Mottas' daughter, Hachiley, spoke her first words while in
U.S. custody, her mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "She repeats the same word over and over," Luciani Motta said. "
'Medo, medo,' " which means "fear."</TE>
<TE>   Their frightening journey started in early June. The slightly
built woman, who had never ventured farther than a few hundred miles
from home, boarded an Aero Mexico flight to Mexico City with her
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Despite misgivings, she pressed on. From a Mexico City hotel,
Motta called her husband and told him of her plan to follow him
north. He was furious.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband relented, she said, and made arrangements with
smugglers to sneak her and their daughter to the U.S. They flew to
Tijuana and checked into a dingy hotel, she said. There they were met
by a burly man with a ponytail named Ricardo.</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo got straight down to business, Luciani Motta said. He
quickly drew a map on the room's brick wall.</TE>
<TE>   "You are in Baja California," Ricardo told her. "Memorize this
because it is very important. You are going to take a bus to
Mexicali. If you are stopped [by police], you tell them you are going
to check a famous seafood restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   Because Portuguese and Spanish are similar languages, Motta
understood most of what Ricardo was saying, but she struggled to keep
up.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so lost," she said. "I had never heard of these places....I
was so scared, but I had to mask it. My husband had told me, 'Keep
calm. We don't know what kind of people we are dealing with.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ricardo finished his instructions, Motta said, and then assured
her, "Don't worry. You are in good hands."</TE>
<TE>   He also gave her a pair of sneakers, Motta said.</TE>
<TE>   Mother and daughter boarded a bus in Tijuana with a 12-year-old
boy who would serve as their guide for this part of the journey.</TE>
<TE>   Motta trekked through the desert, sometimes breast-feeding the
baby as she walked. She ended up on the side of the freeway near El
Centro late at night, waiting for a final ride that would take them
to an airport in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Hachiley was scratched from the walk through the desert. Motta
hadn't had anything to drink or eat for nearly 12 hours and was
feeling faint.</TE>
<TE>   With them were three men and four women also smuggled in and their
two guides, including the 12-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the group spotted a flashlight in the distance, Motta said.
It was a Border Patrol agent following the group's footprints. The
smugglers left, telling the group that they would make a phone call
to check on their ride. They never returned.</TE>
<TE>   As Border Patrol agents descended on the group, Motta said, she
thought of making a final dash across the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at Hachiley," she said, rubbing a scar on her daughter's
face, "and I just couldn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Motta has been in the San Diego detention house for two months as
her deportation proceedings continue. She clings to the hope that her
husband will come up with the $30,000 bail the judge has imposed, so
she can reunite with him, even if only briefly.</TE>
<TE>   "I've come this far," she said. "I can't just go back."</TE>

<HD>Officers Curtail Harvest of Snails</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: Police say church group lied about thousands it
scooped up. Pastor calls incident a cultural miscue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC MALNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the pastor of the Good News Central Church in Los Angeles'
Koreatown, the incident with the 13,200 snails was primarily a
cultural misunderstanding. To police in Pismo Beach, it was primarily
a failure to tell the truth.</LD>
<LD>   The whole thing started Monday, when a resident of the seaside
community near San Luis Obispo called police to say that some people
were scooping up marine snails from an oceanfront tide pool. Officers
Chris Marshall and Brian Martin went down to have a look.</LD>
<LD>   "There were about 20 people down there--men, women and children,"
Marshall said Thursday. "But there weren't a lot of snails--just a
few in a bucket."</LD>
<TE>   Marshall said he asked the people, most of whom were affiliated
with the church, what was going on, and they told him that, although
they had harvested a lot of snails, they had put virtually all of
them back in the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "Two or three hours of picking them up, only to put them back in
the ocean?" Marshall said. "We found that a little hard to believe."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall said he asked if he could check the group's vehicles, and
was given permission to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "One guy opened up a van, and in the back were two great big
coolers," the police officer said. "One of them was full of black
turban snails. We counted 13,200 of them, but there may have been as
many as 15,000."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall said he was less upset by the illegal harvesting of the
snails than he was by the group's failure to tell the truth.</TE>
<TE>   "There were kids there," the police officer said. "Do you lie to
cops? I don't think that's setting a very good example."</TE>
<TE>   Four members of the group were cited by state game wardens for
violating California regulations requiring fishing licenses, which
none of the group had, and exceeding the limit of 35 snails per
person.</TE>
<TE>   Fines could be $3 per snail--a total of almost $40,000--although
Marshall said the actual penalty probably would be a small fraction
of that.</TE>
<TE>   Chung Park, pastor of the church at 3500 W. 1st St., admitted that
members of the group had not been as forthcoming as they should, but
he largely blamed nervousness born of cultural confusion.</TE>
<TE>   "In Korea, you don't need a license to get snails, and there's no
limit," he said. "You just go down to the ocean and catch them."</TE>
<TE>   He said that, when police arrived, "we didn't know what to say. We
got nervous. We couldn't tell the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Park said the church group had driven to Pismo Beach to study
marine life and harvest the thumbnail-sized snails, which are
considered a delicacy.</TE>
<TE>   "We boil them," he said. "They taste close to clams."</TE>
<TE>   Marshall was asked whether he'd like to have a taste.</TE>
<TE>   "Not knowingly," he said.</TE>

<HD>South Gate Told Not to Fund Robles' Defense</HD>
<DH>Politics: Judge rules charges against the city's treasurer
are unrelated to his official duties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge on Thursday ordered South Gate to stop paying for the
criminal defense of Treasurer Albert Robles, who is charged with
threatening to kill two state legislators and a police officer.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council authorized Robles' public-financed defense
shortly after his arrest in April, saying the charges arose from
Robles' official duties and that his statements were a form of
political speech.</LD>
<LD>   But Superior Court Judge David P. Yaffe said that "hardball"
politics excludes criminal acts, declaring skeptically that he didn't
think "the way you make political speech is to threaten someone's
life."</LD>
<TE>   Yaffe's decision to grant the temporary restraining order stays in
effect until he hears further arguments at a preliminary injunction
hearing in September.</TE>
<TE>   So far, records show the city has spent about $1 million on
Robles' legal bills, part of which involves an unrelated grand jury
investigation. Criminal defense attorneys say costs for a typical
threats case, from start to finish, can range from $30,000 to
$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The taxpayer lawsuit, supported by a cross-section of South Gate
residents, charges that the legal fees amount to a gift of public
funds.</TE>
<TE>   "The citizens of South Gate are pleased that the hemorrhaging has
stopped," said Glenn Rothner, the attorney for the two South Gate
businessmen who filed the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "The taxpayers ... have been unable to comprehend how the very
serious charges against Mr. Robles relate to his duties as city
treasurer, and the City Council majority has yet to provide an answer
to that question."</TE>
<TE>   Robles did not return a phone call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Just one day before Thursday's hearing, city officials paid the
firm representing Robles -- Sheppard, Mullin, Richter and
Hampton--$146,000.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Henry Gonzalez, a Robles' critic, said the payment was
rushed through at the last minute. "It's just subterfuge that's all,"
he said. "There is no emergency situation other than to beat a court
ruling handed down by a judge."</TE>
<TE>   Robles' attorney, Thomas M. Brown, was not available to comment on
the allegation, nor was City Atty. Salvador Alva. But earlier in the
day, after the hearing, Brown expressed confidence that Yaffe's
temporary restraining order would not be extended.</TE>
<TE>   Robles faces charges of threatening to kill Assemblyman Marco A.
Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles), Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier) and a
police lieutenant. He remains free on $500,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Robles' three City Council allies in April authorized his defense
after an outside attorney hired by the city, George B. Newhouse Jr.,
concluded that the criminal case lacked evidence and was filed in
retaliation for Robles' outspoken views.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Robles and the legislators have been at odds on
several issues, most notably a plan to build a power plant off the
Long Beach Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   In his findings, Newhouse said the city should pay Robles' defense
because he probably wouldn't have been prosecuted if he were a
private citizen.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge dismissed that argument, saying it seemed
"irrational." Yaffe also grew frustrated with city attorneys when
they declined to provide evidence that the prosecution was
politically motivated.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the city's actions "arbitrary" and "capricious," Yaffe
said, "I can see no connection between Mr. Robles employment as city
treasurer and the criminal threats he is being prosecuted for."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, Robles' attorney, said that he was unable to show evidence
that the case was political without compromising Robles' defense. At
the next hearing, Brown said, he would consider presenting the
information in a closed courtroom setting.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, municipalities can pay for the criminal defense
of city officials if the acts are deemed to be within the scope of
official duty.</TE>
<TE>   But legal experts say cities usually pay legal fees only if an
employee's actions can expose them to civil lawsuits, such as in
police brutality or sexual harassment cases.</TE>

<HD>Stun Belt Use in Court Is Curtailed</HD>
<DH>Ruling: The devices can only be deployed if no better
alternative is available, the state high court decides. Risk of
accidents is cited.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Stun belts, which discharge debilitating electric shocks, should no
longer be strapped to defendants in courtrooms unless there are no
less onerous alternatives, the California Supreme Court ruled
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In a broad opinion by Chief Justice Ronald M. George, the court
made it difficult, if not impossible, for judges to order defendants
to wear the security belts while testifying during criminal trials.</LD>
<LD>   The belts, designed to control troublesome defendants with an
eight-second, 50,000-volt electric shock, are strapped under clothing
and operated remotely by a law enforcement officer or judge. The
shock knocks the wearer to the ground, causes intense writhing and
shaking, and may result in uncontrolled defecation and urination as
well as serious medical injury, the court said.</LD>
<TE>   On a 6-1 vote, the court overturned the assault conviction of a
defendant who was required to wear a belt while testifying.</TE>
<TE>   "In view of the nature of a stun belt and the debilitating and
humiliating consequences that such a belt can inflict," George wrote
for the court, "it is reasonable to believe that many if not most
persons would experience an increase in anxiety if compelled to wear
such a belt while testifying at trial."</TE>
<TE>   The belts are widely used in courtrooms in most states, and in the
transportation of prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty International has described them as instruments of torture
and called for a ban. Some courts have recently limited their use.
The Indiana Supreme Court has barred them altogether.</TE>
<TE>   A defense lawyer in Thursday's case praised the ruling. But the
lone dissenting justice warned that it would imperil judges and
jurors who must be near dangerous defendants, and a prosecutor
complained that it will deprive courts of a safe, useful security
device.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is close to an outright ban, said Deputy Atty. Gen.
David A. Rhodes, who represented the prosecution before the court. "A
very effective security tool here has just been put too far out of
reach."</TE>
<TE>   Appellate courts in recent years have tended to view stun belts as
the security device of choice, an assumption that Thursday's ruling
called questionable and unwarranted. In fact, the state high court
compared the forced use of a stun belt in court to the forced
administration of antipsychotic medication during a trial.</TE>
<TE>   'More User-Friendly'</TE>
<TE>   The court said stun belts have accidentally discharged at least
twice in California courtrooms and the potential for such accidents
"provides a strong reason to proceed with great caution in approving
the use of this device."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the manufacturer said the belt has been worn more
than 65,000 times in the United States and has never caused a death.
There have been only nine accidental discharges, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We introduced them in 1993, and they just took off," said Dennis
Kaufman, a consultant for Electronic Defense Technology, based in
Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   He said the company now makes devices that are "more
user-friendly" and can be worn around the wrist or ankle. They emit
the same jolt of electricity as the belts, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling requires judges to consider several factors
before ordering use of a belt, including the potential for accidental
activation, psychological effects that may impair a defendant's
ability to concentrate and serious medical risks for individuals with
a variety of medical conditions.</TE>
<TE>   A defendant is not a candidate for a stun belt or any physical
restraint unless it has been shown that there is a manifest need for
such a device. Such a need would be demonstrated if it were shown
that the defendant was likely to try to escape or assault someone in
the court, the court ruled.</TE>
<TE>   Before ordering a stun belt, the judge must review the defendant's
medical history and order a medical examination to ensure that the
device would not be unduly dangerous. A defendant who is asked to
express a preference about a restraint should be warned about the
possibility of accidental discharge, the state high court said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the trial judge would have to determine whether the stun
belt is the least restrictive way to ensure courtroom security. In
deciding this, judges should consider "whether there is adequate
justification for the current design of the belt" as opposed to a
device that would deliver a lesser, briefer shock, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   "Particularly in view of the number of accidental activations, we
conclude that a trial court should not approve the use of this type
of stun belt as an alternative to more traditional physical
restraints if the court finds that these features render the device
more onerous than necessary to satisfy the court's security needs,"
George wrote in People vs. Mar, S086611.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling came in the case of James Allen Mar, a Santa Barbara
County man who was found guilty of resisting and injuring a peace
officer while being moved from a holding cell during an arrest for a
parole violation.</TE>
<TE>   Mar's lawyer told the judge the belt was "making him very, very
nervous and agitated" and asked that it be removed while he
testified. "He is afraid somebody's going to push the button," the
defense lawyer said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge ruled that Mar should wear the device, observing that
the "belt is his best insurance that he will come across with
self-control."</TE>
<TE>   Mar testified, becoming excited and speaking rapidly at various
points. In response to a question from his lawyer, he said he was
very nervous. The belt was never activated.</TE>
<TE>   Under the state's three-strikes law, Mar was sentenced to 26 years
to life because he had committed felonies in the past.</TE>
<TE>   In overturning Mar's most recent conviction, the state high court
cited the closeness of the evidence in the case, the crucial nature
of Mar's demeanor while testifying and the likelihood the belt
affected his composure on the stand.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling noted that security officers who placed the stun belt
on Mar failed to demonstrate that it was needed, and the judge failed
to require such a showing.</TE>
<TE>   In a dissent, Justice Janice Rogers Brown lambasted the majority
for relying on information about stun belts obtained on the Internet,
details that were not debated at trial. She said the court could have
deferred the issue to the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead, the majority, rushing to judgment after conducting an
embarrassing Google.com search for information outside the record,
has tied the hands of the Legislature, to the likely peril of judges,
bailiffs and ordinary citizens called up to do their civic duty,"
Brown wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers in the case said alternatives to stun belts include leg
and hand restraints that can be hidden, or by seating a defendant on
the witness stand before the jury enters.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of stun belts contend that the devices are useful
because jurors have no way of knowing that the defendant is being
restrained and likely to be dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Stun belts may now be reserved for defendants who prefer them to
other restraints.</TE>
<TE>   National Impact</TE>
<TE>   "The California Supreme Court's decision has ensured that
courtrooms will be safer, more dignified forums for the
administration of justice," said Carlo Andreani, who represented Mar
on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   He said Mar will be retried or the defense will reach an agreement
on a plea with the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Hoffman, former chairman of Amnesty International in the
United States, said rulings such as Thursday's may lead to the demise
of stun belts nationally.</TE>
<TE>   "If the California courts are in the forefront of condemning this
kind of use, that is something that should have persuasive effect in
other parts of the country," said Hoffman, a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   But Kaufman, the spokesman for the manufacturer, said stun belts
can prevent violence.</TE>
<TE>   "If I took a pencil and stuck it in your arm, that could be an
instrument of torture," Kaufman said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is used the way it is supposed to be, it is not a device of
torture," he said.</TE>

<HD>Dozens Held in Crackdown on Airport Access</HD>
<DH>Security: Most of the workers for private firms could face
charges related to document fraud. For others, immigration charges
may lead to deportation.</DH>

<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM, PATRICK J. McDONNELL and DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dozens of workers with access to airplanes at Los Angeles
International Airport and other Southland facilities were arrested
Thursday as part of a nationwide crackdown on airport security,
federal law enforcement sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Sources put the number arrested in raids at LAX, Ontario
International Airport, John Wayne and Long Beach airports and at
homes at fewer than 100, but cautioned that additional arrests were
expected.</LD>
<LD>   Detainees were employed at the region's airports by private firms
as janitors, caterers, baggage handlers and maintenance workers.</LD>
<TE>   Many had badges that provided them with access to
security-sensitive areas such as planes, ramps, runways and cargo
areas, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The effort, which involved the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, U.S. Marshals Service, Department of Transportation, Social
Security Administration and California Department of Motor Vehicles,
was not expected to ensnare suspected terrorists, according to
federal law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   Most of those arrested were expected to face criminal charges
related to document fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Others may face only immigration charges, which could lead to
deportation.</TE>
<TE>   The crackdown is part of a nationwide sting known as Operation
Tarmac, in which federal authorities have arrested workers at
numerous airports across the country.</TE>
<TE>   It is one of several efforts launched in the wake of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks to improve airport security.</TE>
<TE>   Some public defenders and court-appointed defense lawyers who
milled about in two courtrooms set aside for processing the
defendants in Los Angeles federal court were critical of the raids.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing is bull," said defense attorney Mort Boren.
"These people are not terrorists. They're just people who came here
looking for jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the Service Employees International Union were
particularly outraged that the raids were carried out the day before
President Bush is scheduled to visit the area.</TE>
<TE>   The union plans to send a letter protesting the actions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a disgrace," said Eliseo Medina, the union's executive vice
president and an outspoken advocate of immigrant rights.</TE>
<TE>   "President Bush is punishing hard-working immigrants for the
crimes committed last September by terrorists. These people are not
terrorists--they only want to work."</TE>
<TE>   Reviews of employee records conducted under Operation Tarmac are
separate from an order from the Federal Aviation Administration last
fall that the nation's airports conduct background checks on 750,000
airport employees by Dec. 6.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maria Teresa Quiej Alvarez, one of two formerly conjoined sisters,
underwent surgery again Thursday to remove a buildup of blood in her
brain.</LD>
<LD>   Doctors at UCLA Mattel Children's Hospital said that the operation
was a success and that the year-old girl from Guatemala was alert.
"She was awake, eyes open," said Dr. Andy Madikians. "She was moving
her hands and feet."</LD>
<LD>   Surgeons separated the twins Aug. 6. Maria Teresa underwent a
blood-removal operation later the same day and again Aug. 16. Her
sister, Maria de Jesus, has not returned to the operating room since
the separation.</LD>
<TE>   Both girls remain in serious condition. Doctors say their vital
signs are stable.</TE>
<TE>   Their father, Wenceslao Quiej Lopez, who bags bananas to support
his family, and their mother, Alba Leticia Alvarez, visit the girls
daily.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Teresa is still on a respirator and fed intravenously, but
Maria de Jesus is breathing on her own and eating baby food.</TE>
<TE>   "She likes sweets," Madikians said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Gas Station Hit With Complaint Over Waste</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ventura County district attorney's office has filed a civil
complaint against the owner of a Thousand Oaks gas station and its
environmental advisor for allegedly transporting and storing
hazardous waste.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint contends that Summit Energy Corp. and its advisor,
Finn Moller, also violated state law by transporting hazardous waste
and waste oil without a uniform hazardous waste manifest.</LD>
<LD>   According to the complaint, Summit was cited by county inspectors
July 14, 1999, for unlawfully storing the waste and oil at its gas
station in the 1200 block of East Thousand Oaks Boulevard. The
hazardous materials were being stored in unlabeled drums, with open
tops, and in a plastic trash can, according to prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   Moller allegedly directed a Summit maintenance worker to transport
the hazardous waste from Thousand Oaks to Los Angeles County in an
open-top trailer, prosecutors said. The hazardous waste ultimately
was taken to a facility in Long Beach for proper disposal, officials
said. Prosecutors are seeking a permanent injunction and civil
penalties.</TE>

<HD>Invasion Politics: Timing Counts</HD>
<DH>Saddam, you're safe for now--a 2002 war wouldn't boost Bush
in the presidential vote.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS JETT</AU>
<BD>Dennis Jett, dean of the International Center at the
University of Florida, was U.S. ambassador to Peru from 1996 to 1999.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saddam Hussein can chill. The United States is not going to invade
his country--at least not for a while.</LD>
<LD>   Not because no one was convinced by the argument that an invasion
was justified merely by his being evil. And not because a number of
Republican luminaries have joined those divisive Democrats in
pointing out the risks of acting alone and the implications for
regional stability.</LD>
<LD>   An attack won't happen soon because of the dynamics of
presidential popularity.</LD>
<TE>   Over the course of a president's time in office, approval ratings
almost always decline. (The only recent exception has been Bill
Clinton, whose last three months recorded the highest end-of-term
approval ratings of any modern president.)</TE>
<TE>   Military action brings a surge in presidential popularity, but it
is always short-lived. Therefore in politics, as in comedy--a related
art form--timing is everything.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's father learned this the hard way. After we went
to war with Iraq, almost 90% of those polled felt good about his
performance.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, those with a negative opinion equaled those with a
positive one. And by the election 11 months after that, Bush the 41st
was only in the high 30s and lost to Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons cited for the drop in approval of the elder
Bush was he seemed clueless about the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The current President Bush interrupted his monthlong vacation so
he could demonstrate at the Waco economic meeting that he was not
following in his father's economic footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats unfairly labeled the event an infomercial. Unfair
because it was an insult to infomercials, which at least have some
content, unlike the Potemkin political theater of Waco.</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the president's economic hardships is the changing
perception of his administration. Initially it seemed to be made up
of sure-footed MBAs and confident CEOs, but increasingly it appears
run by poster boys for crony capitalism and corporate corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Unless a majority of Americans can be convinced that President
Bush understands and cares about their economic situation, only a new
foreign military adventure will give a sufficient boost to the
sagging popularity percentages. Afghanistan will be long past its
prime even if there are any Americans still doing the dreaded
nation-building.</TE>
<TE>   And Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's exhortations to look under your bed
for terrorists won't be enough to scare the voters into accepting a
second term.</TE>
<TE>   Since the surge derived from military action will dissipate within
a year, Saddam Hussein had better start worrying about an invasion at
the end of next year, when the election of 2004 is less than 12
months out.</TE>
<TE>   But dictators are far cleverer than presidents at preserving
themselves in power. Hussein might just roll out the red carpet for
the U.N. inspectors and let them search anywhere they want for his
weapons of mass destruction. With the inspectors on the ground doing
their job, the Bush administration would be left without a dog to
wag.</TE>
<TE>   If that happens, a new enemy will have to be found quickly.
Ideally it would be one that could provide an easy, casualty-free
victory and shore up Bush's political base at the same time. Since
the far right never liked giving it up, maybe the president could
invade Panama to take back the canal.</TE>

<HD>Growing Threat of Computers In, Poison Out</HD>
<DH>Near and far, scrap from electronics is an environmental
problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MURRAY</AU>
<BD>Mark Murray is executive director of Californians
Against Waste.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High-tech trade association lobbyists are working overtime in the
California Legislature, seeking to add a perverse corollary to the
famous "Moore's Law." The lobbyists' formula: Although computing
power increases exponentially every 18 months, the technology we use
to manage our discarded electronics retreats a couple of centuries in
the same period.</LD>
<LD>   In February, we saw tape and photos of Chinese laborers
disassembling discarded U.S. computers and terminals with hammers
(technology that goes back millenniums) and simple levers (even
older). A report issued that month by the environmental groups Basel
Action Network and Silicon Valley Toxics Network documented that
toxic electronic scrap from the U.S. was being exported to developing
countries such as China, India and Pakistan, where hundreds of
thousands of laborers, working without protective gear or safety
awareness, break down components by hand. The results? Drinking water
supplies so badly polluted that water has to be trucked in from other
regions and alarming reports of health problems, especially among
children.</LD>
<TE>   The picture in California is also grim, but legislation now being
debated in the state Capitol could help. The electronics industry
should get behind this effort instead of arguing for ineffective
voluntary programs. Obsolete electronics, including microcomputers,
are among the fastest-growing portions of our waste stream,
increasing at almost three times the rate of the rest of our
municipal garbage.</TE>
<TE>   According to European governmental studies, this equipment
contains a number of toxic substances. The glass in computer video
and TV screens--the cathode ray tubes, or CRTs--contain lead to
protect users from radiation dangers, according to the California
Integrated Waste Management Board. Last year, the state Department of
Health Services affirmed that CRTs contained hazardous levels of lead
and banned their disposal in municipal and private solid-waste
landfills.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer volume of electronic scrap is threatening to overcome
our existing waste management programs. Here in California, about
10,000 computers and TVs become obsolete every day. What happens when
more of us get around to cleaning out our garages, closets and
storage sheds?</TE>
<TE>   We've seen the development of a sophisticated and effective system
for recycling beverage cans and bottles, but the infrastructure for
electronics waste remains weak, underfunded and inconsistent.</TE>
<TE>   Some computer manufacturers, including IBM and Hewlett-Packard,
have recently established voluntary "pay as you throw" programs for
consumers, charging between $15 and $35, depending on the size of the
unit. But the high cost, as well as low consumer awareness, has
discouraged large-scale participation.</TE>
<TE>   Some large markets, such as the European Union, have already begun
to require that manufacturers take responsibility both for the design
and long-term handling of their products. We must start doing a
better job of that in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Given how well computer marketers advertise the speed of new
systems, and how well companies roll out new product, the failure to
provide good information and support to consumers is inexcusable. It
is reminiscent of another failed product stewardship effort--used
tires. Some fly-by-night recyclers pocketed fees paid by well-meaning
consumers, then stacked up the old tires and eventually abandoned
them--leaving taxpayers to clean up the mess.</TE>
<TE>   According to estimates from Californians Against Waste, our
state's total cost of properly handling obsolete computers and TVs
could be $75 million to $150 million annually. That's a steep cost,
but we can't keep ignoring the problem. The high-tech industry should
take steps to avoid inevitable--and justly deserved--blame by
supporting legislation proposed by state Sen. Byron Sher (D-Stanford)
that would establish a front-end fee to pay for easy-to-use
collection programs at no further cost to consumers. A companion
measure by Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles) would set state goals
to increase computer and other electronics waste recycling and
consumer education measures.</TE>
<TE>   Lobbyists from the Electronics Industry Assn. and other industry
trade associations oppose Sher's measure, calling it a "tech tax." It
is not. Industry groups also oppose Romero's timetable and standards
for recycling programs while refusing to work in good faith with
consumer groups and environmental advocates on national legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The electronics industry should stop being the problem and start
being part of the solution, or it will earn itself a reputation as a
global environmental polluter of the worst order.</TE>

<HD>A New Wound to Medical Privacy</HD>
<DH>Administration rules eviscerate patient consent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SOBEL</AU>
<BD>Richard Sobel is a senior research associate at Harvard
Medical School.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the Bush administration accepted Clinton administration
proposals for medical-records regulations--including a requirement
for seeking patient consent for treatment, payment and "health
operations"--some suggested that President Bush just might become
known as the "privacy president."</LD>
<LD>   But now, by removing that consent requirement, the
administration's credibility is short-circuited, and Bush has
severely undercut medical confidentiality.</LD>
<LD>   Confidentiality has been fundamental to medicine since the
Hippocratic oath. It's a long-standing ethical norm that patients
have the right to agree or not to agree to both treatment and how
their medical information is used. Unless patients feel their
information will be safeguarded, they will often not reveal their
full symptoms. A California Health Foundation survey found that one
in six patients already tried to hide some health concerns from
providers.</LD>
<TE>   The substitution of giving notice that personal patient health
information, both physical and psychological, has been
disclosed--rather than obtaining patients' consent to do so
first--imposes a burden on the provider, who must try to get patients
to sign a form acknowledging that they don't have the most basic
right to consent. There is also a burden on patients, who face the
choice of acquiescing to having no right of consent, trying to
negotiate for that right or refusing treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of asking if they can come into your house, they are
going to come into your house and give you notice about it," privacy
expert Sue Blevins said.</TE>
<TE>   The familiar occasion of doctor's office visits may take on a very
different character when providers have to ask patients to accept
that their medical information may be disclosed without their
approval. Patients will become even warier of sharing symptoms that
could be revealed to insurance companies or employers, risking loss
of coverage or weakening job promotion prospects. Lacking complete
medical histories, providers will have to practice more defensive
medicine by requiring additional, expensive tests. The costs to
doctor-patient trust and the health of the medical-care system will
increase. Moreover, even if the Clinton consent requirement remained,
the regulations still would have serious, if fixable, flaws. Consent
is often  forced because medical providers can refuse to give care if
patients do not agree to disclose their medical records. The
regulations also provide access without consent or court order to
medical records for "national priority purposes," particularly
purposes of the police and national security agencies. In this "docs
to cops" provision, what patients say in private to a physician to
get better care could end up getting them in trouble with the law.
For instance, a patient whose records included information provided
in confidence to a doctor to get into a drug treatment program could
end up in trouble with the law for drug use.</TE>
<TE>   Abolishing consent now is not a minor modification. It deserves a
full regulatory review.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, this abolition affects the core of what it means to have
consent of the governed and due process in a nation founded on these
principles. People have a right to say yes or no to the use of such
personal details as their medical histories. Absent consent, use of
medical records becomes a government prerogative that is foreign to a
free society.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration should return to its commitment to protect
medical privacy by putting consent back into the regulations. It
should fix the flaw by creating truly informed consent and
restricting wider disclosure.</TE>
<TE>   The health of Americans and the body politic is at risk. Consent
for the use of medical records is basic to doctor-patient
confidentiality and the health of the nation.</TE>
<TE>   A consent requirement should be the foundation of any set of
regulations whose purpose must be to reinforce--not undermine--a
right so fundamental as medical privacy.</TE>

<HD>A National Map Without California</HD>
<DH>Governor's race and the state are way down on White House
list of priorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL WHALEN</AU>
<BD>Bill Whalen, a research fellow at Hoover Institution at
Stanford University, worked on Richard Riordan's gubernatorial
exploratory committee in 2001 and was a speechwriter for Gov. Pete
Wilson.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The easiest job in the White House just might belong to whoever is
responsible for the president's California political briefings. For
six years now, there's been the same story to report: Republican
election prospects aren't pleasant; big-money donors want to know
whether their state is "in play" in the next presidential election.</LD>
<LD>   It's an odd situation, made odder by this contradiction: After his
current visit to California, President Bush will have raised more
than $7 million for gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr.--more money
than collected for any of this year's GOP candidates with the
exception of Bush's brother, the governor of Florida.</LD>
<LD>   All that time, travel and presidential sweat equity invested for a
contest that means little to George W. Bush's political future.</LD>
<TE>   It's a bitter pill for the California GOP to swallow, but maybe
it's time to own up to a hard truth: The Golden State isn't the
linchpin to this presidency that Republican die-hards want to
believe.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, California's 55 electoral votes would all but ensure a second
Bush term. But as the last election showed, they're a luxury for the
GOP, not a necessity.</TE>
<TE>   Having a partisan ally in Sacramento is overrated as well. The
elder George Bush and Bob Dole lost big here despite having
Republican Pete Wilson as governor. Jimmy Carter twice failed to
carry California while fellow Democrat Jerry Brown was in the
governor's office.</TE>
<TE>   In this election, California doesn't factor into Bush's most
urgent priority, which is Republican control of Congress. South
Dakota, with just 1/44th of California's population but with one
contested Senate seat to California's none, matters more.</TE>
<TE>   And while the matchup between Simon and Gray Davis may turn out to
be the nation's most expensive race, it's not at the forefront of
this year's gubernatorial parade. From 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.,
Florida and Texas may appear to weigh more heavily for reasons having
to do with family pride, personal ego and electoral votes.</TE>
<TE>   Where this leaves California is in a political no-man's land from
now through November.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is helping the Simon campaign by raising a badly needed $3
million on this trip. Yet he isn't stumping across the state on
Simon's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Is it to avoid the correlation between corporate responsibility
and the $78-million verdict against Simon's family business? Perhaps.
Then again, the president is campaigning in the Central Valley with
House hopeful Dick Monteith, a telling sign of Bush priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Or is it that the White House recognizes that California's
governor race is an aberration of the current political climate?</TE>
<TE>   Enron, the stock market and Al Qaeda don't fuel the California
debate. Neither parties' issues prevail. Simon and Davis aren't
spending millions in ads and direct mail to champion the repeal of
the estate tax or prescription drug reform.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, the California governor's race promises to be something
that Bush should recognize from his primary days in 2000, when he and
Arizona Sen. John McCain exchanged body blows. After Labor Day,
California lurches full-throttle into an insult-fest that will have
everything to do with two candidates' failings and precious little to
do with the Bush agenda, much less a forward vision for Californians.</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of bellicose politics that Bush claimed to be above
when he sought the presidency as a Washington outsider. As a
California outsider, he may want to avoid being associated with an
ugly tit for tat that serves only to further jaundice voters. Let's
assume Bush will return after the election, to again show that he
cares about the GOP's fortunes. It could be a most welcome visit.
After another few weeks of Davis-Simon brickbats and broadsides,
California may be in sore need of "a uniter, not a divider."</TE>

<HD>Hitting the Brakes on the Driver's License Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Easing Path to Driver's Licenses" (Aug. 21) is typical of the
pandering done by politicians to get votes at the expense of their
responsibility to work for the benefit of California. Gov. Gray Davis
and Assemblyman Gil Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) don't have any problem
authorizing legal documents for the undocumented. Davis spins it by
saying, "People who contribute to our economy and pay taxes are
deserving of that privilege." Sheriff Lee Baca and Cedillo feel that
"thorough background checks" by the state Department of Justice are
all that really matters. Meanwhile, they are all practicing
malfeasance by not enforcing the laws concerning immigration.</LD>
<LD>   The Times writes articles about failing institutions, like health
care, and the Legislature bemoans a lack of money, while no one in
power wants to breathe a word about the runaway overpopulation that
is at the root of these problems. It is apparently not politically
correct for self-serving politicians to state the truth about
overflowing illegal immigration or to do anything about it.</LD>
<LD>   Michael G. Miller</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your quoted remarks of Gov. Davis about his support for AB 60, the
driver's license bill, are utterly amazing. A recent Los Angeles
study revealed an estimated $1.1 billion a year that, in violation of
the law, was not being paid into Social Security, workers'
compensation, health insurance and other social safety-net programs
to protect workers who became ill, injured, unemployed or retired.
This study revealed that an estimated 28% of the work force in the
county was paid in cash, and one in four didn't have federal and
state payroll taxes withheld. The vast majority of these workers are
illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Whichever way one slices driver's licenses for illegal aliens, AB
60 aids and abets the violation of federal immigration laws. Issuing
driver's licenses to illegal aliens so they can drive to work is a
violation of federal laws that prohibit illegal immigrants from
working in the U.S. Equally amazing is that the differences between
the Legislature and the governor aren't "fully resolved"--little
things like security checks for hundreds of thousands of foreigners
who've walked across our borders in the middle of the night. This
dreadful legislation is a test of the mettle of state voters. Are we
going to allow this sham to remain unchallenged?</TE>
<TE>   Michael Scott</TE>
<TE>   Glendora</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If California starts giving driver's licenses to "undocumented"
immigrants, what's next? Will the DMV grant carjackers clear titles
to stolen vehicles as a reward for getting away with the crime? Will
hit-and-run drivers be given free state-approved car repairs? Will
drag racers on public highways receive taxpayer-funded tuneups?</TE>
<TE>   The point here is that these immigrants are not "undocumented,"
they are illegal. Anyone brazen enough to admit to that status when
applying for a driver's license should be deported immediately, if
our immigration laws are to have any meaning whatsoever.</TE>

<LD>Each day in the paper and on television I read and see about only two
of the six candidates for governor. There are a large number of
unsatisfied Californians complaining about the actions of the two
dominant-party candidates. If we are to believe that the media offer
unbiased reporting or promotion of candidates for office, then why
are the other people who have qualified for the ballot given no
coverage? Issues such as mass transit, pollution, education, the
budget and campaign finance reform have more than two sides. If the
rationale is the other candidates' low poll numbers, then coverage
may enhance them and provide Californians with a choice.</LD>

punishment in the form of draconian 24-hour curfews and closures, a
35-year military occupation that has left over half of all
Palestinians living in poverty and half of all their children

being a strategic ally, Israel is our greatest liability when it
comes to preserving U.S. security and credibility, and the biggest
obstacle to efforts to achieve a stable Middle East.</LD>

<HD>Sheffield Is Living in Peace</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gary Sheffield is back at Dodger Stadium this weekend, and each
waggle of his bat will serve as a reminder that the Dodgers could use
him.</LD>
<LD>   Not any old Sheffield, but this one: the 2K2 version, happy and
productive, apologetic and nonconfrontational. He has no interest in
revisiting the acrimonious days in Dodgertown; he doesn't care if the
fans boo him every at-bat.</LD>
<LD>   "There's more important things to think about," Sheffield said.
"I'm just wearing another uniform. I've been on other teams before. I
have to approach it the same way."</LD>
<TE>   There are more important things.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, DeLeon, could deliver their baby any day now. (The
Braves' public-relations director keeps Sheffield's cell phone with
him during the games in case the big call comes.)</TE>
<TE>   His new team has the best record in baseball and is leaving
National League East rivals so far behind that the Expos, Phillies,
Marlins and Mets probably wish the strike would happen today.</TE>
<TE>   And he's putting in work at the plate, hitting .303 with 24 home
runs and 76 RBIs. He had a run of reaching base in 52 consecutive
games earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   It has all conspired to take the edge off his return to Los
Angeles. He won't try to discourage talk that the Dodgers are better
off without him.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're glad I'm not there, then I'm not there," he said
before the Braves had finished their series with the San Diego Padres
on Thursday. "That's fine. I don't have any problems with that. I do
what I do. I just try to concentrate on what particular uniform I'm
wearing that year. Just concentrate on that and not look back."</TE>
<TE>   If the fans want to say he shouldn't have traded barbs with the
team in the spring of '01--when he criticized the big contracts given
to Shawn Green and others, blasted Chairman Bob Daly, and suggested
he might not play well if he weren't traded--he'll give them that
too.</TE>
<TE>   He said his mistake was "fighting fire with fire, instead of just
letting my actions take place on the field. Once we got in the war of
words, I regret that."</TE>
<TE>   If he bumps into Daly behind the batting cage, he doesn't think
they'll have much to say.</TE>
<TE>   "When you think you're right all the time, a lot of times that's
when you're wrong," is how he characterized Daly.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers traded Sheffield to the Braves last winter primarily
to get rid of his attitude, but they were happy to get Brian Jordan
in return. It turns out their biggest benefit from the deal was the
other player the Braves included, pitcher Odalis Perez.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, they miss Sheffield in the lineup. Green has learned to
work with what he gets without Sheffield around to keep pitchers
honest against him, but the Dodgers are too dependent on him. When he
slumps, so does the team. There's no Sheffield around to pick up the
slack or provide another fearsome bat.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers felt they couldn't risk another year of Sheffield,
especially as he neared the end of his contract, which will run out
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Why couldn't Sheffield just have been like this last year? Does a
happy Sheffield make a team a winner, or does a winning team make
Sheffield happy? When it's smooth sailing, he's up on the deck. When
the ship starts sinking, he'll drill an extra hole in the hull.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Sheffield just seeks stability, like a kid whose family has
moved around his entire life. This is the fifth team in his 14-year
major league career. Sometimes Sheffield brought on the change, as
with his first team, the Milwaukee Brewers. An unhappy Sheffield said
later that he intentionally played bad defense for the Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   He liked playing for the Padres, but they broke up a perfectly
good team by dumping high-salaried players like him and Fred McGriff.
He was happy when he landed with a championship-caliber club in
Florida, but the Marlins slashed their own payroll after winning the
World Series in 1997. That led to Sheffield's coming to the Dodgers
in the infamous Mike Piazza trade.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't exactly Sheffield for Piazza, but Sheffield--not Bobby
Bonilla or Charles Johnson--was the key component in the deal. That
meant he had the task of replacing Piazza, the most popular Dodger of
his generation.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help that Sheffield held up the trade by demanding a
contract renegotiation before he even got to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Things have gone more smoothly in Atlanta. On the first day of
spring training, a group led by perennial All-Star pitcher Greg
Maddux and shortstop Mark DeRosa led an impromptu group that gathered
around Sheffield's locker and welcomed him to the Braves. Once the
season began, he got in with his new teammates by hitting home runs
in the first three games.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been one of the best players, he's been one of the most
popular players, all in one," Manager Bobby Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves struggled to a 12-15 start in April but went 39-15 in
June and July to take control of the division race.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sheffield does his part, guys like Chipper Jones and
Andruw Jones keep him from carrying the load alone. And with the
Braves, there's always that pitching staff.</TE>
<TE>   No team in sports has mastered the regular season the way the
Braves have over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a relaxed atmosphere," Sheffield said. "It enables me to
just go out and play baseball and not worry about the other mess."</TE>
<TE>   For Sheffield, the "mess" usually has to do with money. And even
that isn't a point of contention--for now.</TE>
<TE>   "I have one year left on my contract, and I get to pick and choose
what I'm going to do with my career," Sheffield said. "And I'm going
to choose wisely.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even want to talk about it. The thing is, when I become a
free agent, then I'm going to make the right choice. And it's going
to be the right choice for me and my family."</TE>
<TE>   The family's about to grow. And he could double his total of World
Series rings. Would that keep him happy?</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dustin Hermanson finally had a reason to show his excitable nature.</LD>
<LD>   After spending all but eight days of the season on the disabled
list, Hermanson stepped in for Pedro Martinez and won his official
debut as a Red Sox starter as Boston defeated the Texas Rangers,
12-3, Thursday night at Fenway Park.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez is healthy, but Manager Grady Little decided to use him
today against the Angels instead because he didn't want to waste a
start by his ace with a threat of rain.</LD>
<TE>   "I was more than happy to step in," Hermanson said. "I would have
pitched in a snowstorm tonight."</TE>
<TE>   He got plenty of support as Manny Ramirez had two homers and six
runs batted in to spark Boston to a 12-0 lead after four innings.
Hermanson (1-0) was sharp with four shutout innings before giving up
two runs in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Castillo pitched four innings for his second career save and
first since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez went four for four with a season-high 11 total bases.
Jason Varitek drove in three runs with a single and a double despite
a moderate rain that fell most of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 9, Cleveland 3--Mark Mulder completed the Athletics' first
four-game sweep of Cleveland and visiting Oakland won its season-high
ninth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder (15-7) followed a brilliant performance by Cory Lidle--a
one-hitter Wednesday night--with a pretty good one of his own, giving
up three runs and five hits in 7 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder walked none, struck out two and got 16 outs on grounders as
the A's moved into a tie for first place in the AL West with Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 4, Detroit 2--Mike Cameron singled in two runs in a
three-run sixth inning as the Mariners split the four-game series at
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron was seven for 11 in the series, including hits in six
consecutive at-bats, after arriving in Detroit in an 0-for-21 slump.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Franklin (5-3) pitched six innings, giving up two runs, four
hits and a walk. Kazuhiro Sasaki pitched the ninth for his 32nd save
in 37 tries.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 8, Kansas City 6--Jacque Jones hit a home run leading
off a game for the third time in four days and Cristian Guzman and
Luis Rivas also homered as the Twins won at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 3, Tampa Bay 2--Jerry Hairston homered and scored the
winning run in the bottom of the 11th on a single by Tony Batista at
Baltimore to carry the Orioles to victory in front of the smallest
crowd (21,447) in the 11-year history of Camden Yards.</TE>

<HD>Angel Losses Multiply</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After Salmon goes on disabled list, they fall to
Yankees, 4-2, and out of first place in AL West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>For the Angels, this was a lost series. They lost two games out of
three. They lost two players to the disabled list. They lost their
tenuous grip on first place.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time since June 25, the Angels are in third place in
the American League West. They lost their lead in the wild-card
standings too, after a 4-2 loss to the New York Yankees on Thursday
night dropped them one game behind the Oakland Athletics and Seattle
Mariners.</LD>
<LD>   They open a four-game series tonight in Boston, against a Red Sox
team 2 1/2 games behind the Angels in the wild-card race. The Angels
had hoped their No. 3 hitter, outfielder Tim Salmon, would return
tonight. Instead, they put him on the disabled list Thursday, after
his badly bruised left hand failed to respond to more than a week of
treatment. The Angels put starter Aaron Sele on the disabled list
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Oh, and Pedro Martinez pitches tonight for Boston. The Angels have
persevered through adversity all season, but this attrition at a
critical time might make an Angel fan hardened by previous collapses
of late August and early September wonder whether another might be
unfolding and how much attrition is too much to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   "There is such a thing as too much," pitcher Jarrod Washburn said,
"but I don't think we're at a point where we're going to throw in the
towel and call it a season. I don't think we're at the point of
shaking our heads and saying we can't do it.</TE>
<TE>   "If we lost Darin Erstad tomorrow, then maybe you'd have to say
enough is enough."</TE>
<TE>   Said Erstad: "We lost a couple games, but it's not like we're out
of it. We're right there. There's no urgency or panic in here."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are 8-3 since Salmon last started, but the first 10 of
those games were against Toronto, Detroit and Cleveland, teams a
combined 72 games out of first place.</TE>
<TE>   They lost the series to the Yankees. They lost Salmon, who is
hitting .395 this month and .339 since the All-Star break. And, with
a bad weekend in Boston, they could fall behind the Red Sox in the
wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   In the first three games of the series, the Red Sox will start
Martinez and Derek Lowe, the starters with the lowest earned-run
averages in the league, and oft-frustrating knuckleballer Tim
Wakefield.</TE>
<TE>   No urgency about the weekend?</TE>
<TE>   "This team has played with a sense of urgency every single day
this year," Erstad said. "And we're going to continue to do a great
job of that."</TE>
<TE>   And what of falling out of first place and into third?</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to look at the standings on the last day of the
season," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "We haven't looked at the
standings when we've been in first place. We're not going to start
now."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels lost the season series to the Yankees for the first
time since 1997, losing four of seven games this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees snapped the three-game winning streak of Angel rookie
John Lackey, who nonetheless pitched his first major league complete
game. He gave up four runs and 11 hits, but he needed only 100
pitches to complete his eight innings before a typically rowdy Yankee
Stadium crowd of 43,222.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans were going crazy, and I got a little fired up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels should have done better against Yankee starter David
Wells. Alex Ochoa hit his first home run since joining the Angels in
a July 31 trade, and Troy Glaus doubled home another run, but with
runners on second and third and one out in the fourth inning, Wells
struck out Shawn Wooten and Benji Gil</TE>
<TE>   Lackey staggered a bit in the first inning, striking out two but
also loading the bases on a single, walk and hit batter. Raul Mondesi
singled home two runs, giving the Yankees the lead for good.</TE>
<TE>   "It had nothing to do with nerves," Lackey said. "I can't
guarantee you performance every time, but I can guarantee you it
won't be because I'm scared."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Slow-Healing Salmon on Disabled List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Angels have played almost two weeks without outfielder Tim Salmon
and could play another two without him. After the soreness failed to
subside in his badly bruised left hand, the Angels finally put him on
the disabled list Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "You start trying to convince yourself it's feeling better, but
it's not," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Salmon suffered the injury when he was hit by a pitch Aug. 10, and
the Angels had played one man short since then, hoping he could swing
without pain and return. When the pain got worse while he was hitting
Thursday, the Angels told Salmon to rest the hand for several days,
and Manager Mike Scioscia said he believed it would be "a stretch"
for Salmon to be ready next Thursday, when he is eligible to be
activated.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels promoted second baseman Chone Figgins from triple-A
Salt Lake. Figgins, 24, will serve mostly as a pinch-runner; he is
hitting .305 and leads the Pacific Coast League in triples (18),
stolen bases (39) and runs (100).</TE>
<TE>   The Angels plan to carry four outfielders--Garret Anderson, Darin
Erstad, Alex Ochoa and Orlando Palmeiro--for now and promote another
outfielder when rosters expand in nine days, Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As expected, the Angels plan to promote Mickey Callaway from Salt
Lake to replace injured Aaron Sele in the starting rotation. He will
probably start Sunday at Boston and next Friday against the Baltimore
Orioles, after which an off day and the roster expansion will allow
the Angels to evaluate the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Callaway, 27, is 9-2 with a 1.68 earned-run average at Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels demoted Scott Schoeneweis to the bullpen in June,
Scioscia and pitching coach Bud Black said Schoeneweis could return
to the starting rotation. But when the Angels put Sele on the
disabled list Wednesday, they did not consider replacing him with
Schoeneweis in the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   After posting a 5.38 ERA in 15 starts, Schoeneweis has provided
solid relief when the Angels needed it most. His ERA is 4.20 since
moving to the bullpen and 1.04 since July 15, the day doctors
detected a torn rotator cuff and labrum in the shoulder of the team's
only other left-handed reliever, Dennis Cook.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis has not abandoned his goal of starting again, but said
he's resigned to finishing this season in the bullpen and willing to
help the playoff push from there.</TE>
<TE>   "I throw 10 pitches a week," he said. "It's not rocket science to
figure out I can't throw 100 right now."</TE>

<HD>Astros Acquire Reliever Gordon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chicago Cubs are back to only one closer, trading Tom Gordon to
the Houston Astros on Thursday for a minor league pitcher and two
players to be named.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a good team, a good organization," Gordon said before the
teams faced each other. "This will be good for me to be in this
situation. I'm just glad somebody wanted me.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sure I'll miss my teammates. But this is more of a positive
for me."</LD>
<TE>   Gordon was one of the Cubs' more consistent relievers, going 1-1
with a 3.42 earned-run average since coming off the disabled list
July 2. He had not allowed a run in 8 2/3 innings in his last six
outings.</TE>
<TE>   But he wants to be a closer, and the Cubs have another in Antonio
Alfonseca. The Cubs traded for Alfonseca at the end of spring
training after Gordon tore a muscle in his right shoulder. He missed
most of the first half of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that Gordon's desire to close has been dramatically
overblown," Astro General Manager Gerry Hunsicker said. "He seems
very excited to be here. He's got a chance to win a pennant and I
think he'll fit in great."</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for Gordon, the Cubs got left-hander Russ Rohlicek,
9-5 with a 2.98 ERA at Class-A Michigan.</TE>

<TE>   The Miller Park design firm and construction manager must develop
and pay for a plan to fix the roof leaks that have plagued the
Milwaukee Brewers' home since it opened two seasons ago, the
executive director of the stadium board said.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Duckett, executive director of the Southeastern Wisconsin
Professional Baseball Park District, said the leaks that sent several
hundred fans scurrying in the fifth inning Wednesday night "was a
watershed" moment.</TE>
<TE>   HCH Miller Park Joint Venture, the construction manager, and
Dallas-based HKS, the design firm, have tried a half-dozen changes in
the flaps between the seams of the five-panel roof to try to fix the
leaks since the stadium opened in March 2001, Duckett said.</TE>
<TE>   But high winds and heavy rains have caused leaks on several
occasions, and Wednesday night's downpour sent water onto the playing
field near home plate and the pitcher's mound.</TE>
<TE>   "We were willing to listen to their design improvements until last
night," Duckett said. "Last night, we said we really have to go in a
different direction."</TE>
<TE>   Duckett termed it a "conditional action" to require HCH and HKS to
fix the problems. He said no legal action would be taken, but
taxpayers would not pay for the repairs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unacceptable," Duckett said. "We paid a lot of money for a
roof and want it to work as intended. It has not ensured the fans the
comfort that it was intended to."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston center fielder Johnny Damon dislocated his finger sliding
back into first base in the first inning of Thursday's game against
Texas and was listed as day to day.</TE>
<TE>   Damon led off the bottom of the first with a single up the middle.
Ranger left-hander Dennys Reyes then tried to pick him off and Damon
dove headfirst into the bag with his hand outstretched.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oakland reliever Jim Mecir was suspended for three games for
hitting Royce Clayton of the Chicago White Sox Saturday with a pitch
after a warning had been issued.</TE>
<TE>   A team spokesman said Mecir will appeal the decision. The
suspension won't begin until after a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit Tiger outfielder Bobby Higginson must pay $6,000 per month
in child support to his former fiancee, Judy Morgan, an Oakland
County Circuit Court judge ruled in Pontiac, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Athletics sent minor league right-hander Jeremy
Bonderman to the Detroit Tigers to complete a three-team trade made
last month.</TE>

<LD>Rob Adolph, one of the golfers who failed to qualify this week for
match play in the U.S. Amateur at Oakland Hills near Detroit, played
quarterback for two USC Rose Bowl teams in the 1970s and was the
second baseman on two national champion Trojan baseball teams.</LD>
<LD>   Now 50 and a Fresno real estate developer, Adolph took up
skydiving about 10 years ago and several times has sky-dived into
Fresno State's football stadium with the game ball--a Bulldog
tradition.</LD>
<LD>   "That's the ultimate adrenaline rush," he told Jo-Ann Barnas of
the Detroit Free Press. "When you reflect on jumping out of an
airplane, it makes this thing called golf easier to do."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Two of the top five on the major league career
strikeout list pitched for USC. Who are they?</TE>
<TE>   A true story: Jules Tygiel, author of "Baseball's Great
Experiment: Jackie Robinson and His Legacy," told this tale about
Josh Gibson, the great Negro League slugger, to Tom FitzGerald of the
San Francisco Chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   A young player for the Homestead Grays reached base with two out,
bringing Gibson to the plate. Before Gibson had a swing, the player
took off for second and was thrown out, ending the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "What were you thinking of?" yelled Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to get into scoring position."</TE>
<TE>   "Boy," admonished Gibson, "When I'm at the plate, everyone is in
scoring position."</TE>
<TE>   Changing times: Remember Danny Almonte, the 14-year-old Dominican
kid from the Bronx who was passed off as 12 and dominated the Little
League World Series last year before his age was revealed and his
team disqualified?</TE>
<TE>   Juliet Macur of the Dallas Morning News tracked him down a year
later on a dusty diamond on the edge of Harlem. He's still throwing
left-handed fastballs, but facing players his own age, they're
getting hits.</TE>
<TE>   "The kid's no superstar against players his own age," said Felix
Bonilla, a Harlem baseball commissioner. "At least I think these kids
are his own age."</TE>
<TE>   Tough decision: When he accepted the Florida State coaching job,
Bobby Bowden wasn't all that sure he had done the right thing. In his
book "Bound for Glory," he explains:</TE>
<TE>   "When [athletic director] John Bridgers approached me about the
possibility of the head coaching job at his school, I could think of
only two jobs that could be worse--being elected mayor of Atlanta
shortly after Sherman left town, or being the general who volunteered
to replace George Custer during the last siege of Little Bighorn.
Things [at Florida State] were just about that bad."</TE>
<TE>   Faster than fast: From a standing start, an NHRA top-fuel dragster
accelerates faster than a jumbo jet, a fighter jet or a Formula One
race car.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Randy Johnson and Tom Seaver.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Chris Riley, who finished third in last week's PGA
Championship, was a sophomore at Nevada Las Vegas when he was asked
to host a hotshot recruit he knew from the Southern California junior
circuit.</TE>
<TE>   The recruit was put up at the Mirage hotel and given red-carpet
treatment, but Tiger Woods enrolled at Stanford instead.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what went wrong, Riley said, "My college coach wanted to
know that too."</TE>

<LD>Cecil Sapp supplied the offense with 178 yards rushing and two
touchdowns and Colorado State's defense made the game-saving play as
the Rams defeated Virginia, 35-29, in the Jim Thorpe Classic Thursday
night at Charlottesville, Va.</LD>
<LD>   The Cavaliers had a chance to win in the final seconds, but
quarterback Marques Hagans fumbled on the Rams' one-yard line with 10
seconds to play.</LD>
<LD>   Sapp carried 25 times, 14 in the second half, in the earliest
season opener in Division I history.</LD>
<TE>   "I was worried about him wearing down, but he was as strong in the
second half as he was in the first," Ram Coach Sonny Lubick said. "I
didn't think I was going to go the whole game with one tailback."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Babcock kicked five field goals, including a 46-yarder that
put the Rams ahead for good with 4:07 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Three plays after the field goal, Colorado State's Dexter Wynn
intercepted an errant pass and returned it to the Virginia five.
Babcock kicked his fifth field goal to make it 35-29 with 2:20 to
play.</TE>
<TE>   Hagans then drove the Cavaliers 81 yards in two minutes before
fumbling.</TE>

<TE>   Penn State safety Yaacov Yisrael, who started every game last
year, will sit out the season after tearing a ligament in his left
knee.... Maryland tailback Bruce Perry, who ran for 1,242 yards last
year, will be out the first four-to-eight weeks of the season because
of a groin injury suffered before a scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   A mysterious illness has sent four Fort Hays State (Kan.) players
to the hospital and sickened 21 other players and two coaches. The
four players, being treated for an unusual form of pneumonia, were in
fair condition.... Florida State offensive guard Milford Brown, who
started 12 games for the Seminoles last season, had his college
career end when the NCAA ruled that he has used up his eligibility.
Brown was a full-time student at Alabama State in the fall of 1997,
meaning his five-year eligibility window for competition had
closed.... Tennessee lost Constantin Ritzmann for the season after
the defensive tackle tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left
knee.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's Todd Johnson returned to practice as a spectator, a day
after the All-Southeastern Conference safety was knocked unconscious
during a workout. He is expected to return to practice next week....
Sixth-year senior Daniel Cobb was named the starting quarterback by
Auburn Coach Tommy Tuberville. He beat out sophomore Jason Campbell.

<HD>Dodgers Not Left Hanging by This Chad</HD>
<DH>Baseball: In a rare start, Kreuter comes through with three
hits, including two-run homer, in 6-2 victory over Marlins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having spent 15 years in the big leagues with seven teams, several of
them twice, catcher Chad Kreuter knows all too well his role as a
journeyman catcher. But some years the journey is tougher than
others.</LD>
<LD>   This is one of those years.</LD>
<LD>   So a few weeks ago, with cobwebs collecting on his glove and bat,
Kreuter sat down with Dodger Manager Jim Tracy and made a plea for
more playing time, promising results.</LD>
<TE>   Tracy made good on his promise to pencil Kreuter's name into the
starting lineup more often and Kreuter made good on his promise to
produce Thursday, when he came up with three hits, including a
two-run homer and a well-placed bunt down the third base line, drove
in a season-high three runs and scored two in a 6-2 victory over the
Florida Marlins in front of an afternoon Dodger Stadium crowd of
33,278.</TE>
<TE>   Oh yeah, and Kreuter also did an effective job behind the plate as
starter Hideo Nomo (12-6) limited Florida to two runs in seven
innings with five strikeouts and a walk to end a personal 10-game
losing streak against the Marlins. Paul Shuey, who has struggled
since coming over from the Cleveland Indians in a trade last month,
shut out Florida over the final two innings for his first save.</TE>
<TE>   The victory, the Dodgers' seventh in their last eight games,
improved their record to 73-54, kept them 2 1/2 in front of the San
Francisco Giants in the wild-card race and gave the Dodgers some
momentum heading into a pair of important series. The National League
East-leading Atlanta Braves come into Dodger Stadium tonight to start
a three-game series, to be followed by the NL West-leading Arizona
Diamondbacks beginning Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I tip my cap to Trace," said Kreuter, who appeared in only his
35th game Thursday. "He understood that I was becoming stagnant. He
saw the rewards of putting me in although I am not always going to
have games like this."</TE>
<TE>   Of course there's a good reason why Kreuter, who is hitting .282
with two home runs and 12 RBIs, isn't playing more. The guy ahead of
him is Paul Lo Duca, the versatile, clutch-hitting sparkplug of the
team.</TE>
<TE>   And Lo Duca showed that versatility again Thursday in the seventh
inning when he squirted a pinch single past pitcher Graeme Lloyd,
under the glove of second baseman Luis Castillo and into right-center
to tie the score, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   The Marlins had taken the early lead on Derrek Lee's fifth-inning
home run. And the way Marlin starter Josh Beckett was pitching, it
might have held up if the sore finger on his pitching hand had held
up.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy had praised the 22-year-old right-hander before the game and
nothing he saw on the field caused him to change his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Beckett gave up an infield single to the first man he faced, Dave
Roberts, but nothing more through four innings, retiring everyone he
faced.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was throwing stuff as good as any we've seen all
year," Dodger right fielder Shawn Green said.</TE>
<TE>   But in the fifth inning, with Adrian Beltre at bat, Beckett felt a
familiar pain surface. Twice before this season, he has been put on
the disabled list because of a blister on his right index finger.
Beckett looked down and, sure enough, the unwanted problem was back.</TE>
<TE>   Beckett stayed in long enough to give up a double to Beltre.</TE>
<TE>   That was enough for Marlin Manager Jeff Torborg, who pulled
Beckett.</TE>
<TE>   On came reliever Lloyd, who gave up a game-tying single to
Kreuter.</TE>
<TE>   Florida went ahead in the sixth when Castillo singled, stole his
major-league leading 40th and 41st bases and scored on a double by
Mike Redmond.</TE>
<TE>   But after Lo Duca's single tied the score, Green smacked a two-run
single to give the Dodgers the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Shuey, who entered the game with an 8.38 earned-run average,
protected the lead by giving up only a walk over the final two
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "My family is here now," he said of wife Julie and daughters
Morgan (age 5) and Casey (3). "I see my kids every day. They are
happy and that makes a big difference to me. I was stinking it up
before. I am not going to make any excuses. I was not getting it
done, but I'm more carefree now."</TE>
<TE>   Around Dodger Stadium these days, that's a common feeling.</TE>

<HD>Jordan Might Not Get to Face Braves</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Frustration simmered at both ends of the Dodger clubhouse Thursday.
And the first pitch hadn't even been thrown.</LD>
<LD>   At one end, outfielder Brian Jordan stood by his locker stall,
knowing that he was about to sit out his fifth consecutive game
because of stiffness in his back caused by a protruding disk. He is
also facing the possibility of not playing in the three-game series
beginning tonight against his former team, the Atlanta Braves.</LD>
<LD>   "My back is my back," Jordan said. "It doesn't change. I could be
playing [Friday] or I might not be playing until the next day or the
next day. It is frustrating, not being able to play against my former
team."</LD>
<TE>   Jordan said, however, that after having received an epidural
injection last week, he won't undergo another one.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing is rest and rehab," he said. "I am not going force
anything because of my back. This is a career thing."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are not going to force the issue by putting Jordan on
the disabled list, according to Manager Jim Tracy. Putting him on the
DL now would force him to sit out 15 days, minus the time he has
already been out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been mentioned, but we are going to take another day or so,"
Tracy said. "We do not want to lose him for an [additional] nine or
10 days because of a rush to judgment."</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the clubhouse, right-hander Kevin Brown,
returning from elbow and back surgery, was just as frustrated. In his
second relief appearance since coming off the disabled list, Brown
gave up three runs and seven hits in three innings Tuesday night
against the Florida Marlins.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can do is work every day and when it's right, it's right,"
Brown said. "I would like to be my old self when I walk out on the
mound, but that is obviously not the case."</TE>
<TE>   Brown said that neither mechanical problems nor his previous
ailments were causing him to struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "I would trade a little pain to pitch better," he said. "Last
year, my elbow felt like it was hanging by a thread, then [this
season], my back hurt, but I was pitching better. It's hard to
understand."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mikki Hoffman, mother of Dodger coach Glenn Hoffman and San Diego
Padre pitcher Trevor Hoffman, received the George and Barbara Bush
Little League parents-of-the-year award Thursday, honoring both her
and her late husband, Eddie, at the Little League World Series in
Williamsport, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   During the 15 years one or all of the Hoffman brothers--Glenn,
Trevor and Greg--were involved in Northwest Little League in Anaheim,
Eddie spent time serving as league president, umpiring, landscaping
the park and singing the national anthem, while Mikki worked the
snack bar or served as team mom.... Announcer Vin Scully missed a
second consecutive game because of laryngitis.</TE>

<HD>Youngsters Steal Spotlight</HD>
<DH>Gymnastics: Patterson and Vise, both 14, have strong
showings in U.S. vs. World event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The next time the world's best gymnasts come to Anaheim, it will be
for real.</LD>
<LD>   The 2003 World Championships--the team qualifying event for the
2004 Olympics in Athens--will be next August at the Arrowhead Pond of
Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   This time, the U.S. vs. the World competition was just for
fun--and to get a few kinks out of the operation.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the crowd of 5,119 at the Pond for the T.J. Maxx
International Gymnastics Challenge on Thursday got to see 2000
Olympic all-around champion Alexei Nemov and fellow Russian Svetlana
Khorkina, the two-time Olympic champion in the uneven bars.</TE>
<TE>   The night also provided a glimpse of a work in progress as
American gymnasts tried to continue their recovery after being shut
out of the medal count in Sydney, where the women finished fourth and
the men were fifth.</TE>
<TE>   The sneak peek Thursday was a look at U.S. junior champion Carly
Patterson and runner-up Hollie Vise, both 14-year-old fast-rising
stars.</TE>
<TE>   Two-time national champion Tasha Schwikert was one of the polished
pros at the Pond, but Patterson, 83 pounds and still wearing braces,
stole the show with a 9.90 in the floor exercise, displaying sprite
tumbling and lots of personality. Her balance beam routine earned a
9.788.</TE>
<TE>   Vise scored 9.838 on uneven bars and a 9.8 on beam.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like they did really well under pressure, being so
young in a show like this," Schwikert said. "They handled it really,
really well."</TE>
<TE>   If all goes according to the plan originally devised by Bela
Karolyi, they'll be better prepared and have more international
experience in 2004 than the Americans did in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the results Thursday should be taken loosely.</TE>
<TE>   The judging in the USA-vs-the-World format was by a panel that
included Karolyi, Shannon Miller, Peter Vidmar and Kurt Thomas as
well as gymnastics neophyte Rafer Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women took a 78.453-76.827 victory.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. men, led by twins Paul and Morgan Hamm, who didn't finish
the competition after straining an ankle tendon in the floor
exercise, lost to the world team, 77.703-67.639.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan Jovtchev of Bulgaria had the highest score of the evening,
a 9.988 on rings.</TE>
<TE>   There has been progress for the Americans--as evidenced by the
men's stunning silver in last year's world championships, where the
women took third.</TE>
<TE>   Though Patterson and Vise will still be too young for the upcoming
world championships in Hungary, that's no problem, Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's OK. I think I need a little more experience and
competition with other countries."</TE>
<TE>   But both girls will be eligible for Anaheim next year--and for
Athens.</TE>
<TE>   "I really hope to be back here next year," Patterson said.</TE>

<HD>Frankel Eager for Challenge</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer, who has Milwaukee Brew entered in
Pacific Classic, says that War Emblem has little to lose in race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Trainer Bobby Frankel is suggesting that the War Emblem camp has
little to lose by running the 3-year-old colt against older horses in
Sunday's $1-million Pacific Classic at Del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   "If they lose to older horses, they don't lose much stature," said
Frankel, who has won six of the first 11 Classics, all with
4-year-olds or older. Frankel will remain at Saratoga, where he's
saddling Medaglia d'Oro, the 2-5 morning-line favorite, in Saturday's
Travers for 3-year-olds. He has Milwaukee Brew, the 3-1 second
choice, entered in the Pacific Classic. War Emblem is the 2-1
favorite.</LD>
<LD>   A host of trainers are tackling War Emblem, the Kentucky Derby,
Preakness and Haskell winner. When entries were taken Thursday, the
names of 14 horses were submitted, a record field for Del Mar's
signature race. The Pacific Classic had never drawn more than nine
horses until now.</LD>
<TE>   Only six 3-year-olds have ever run in the Classic, and never two
in the same year, but this year's version has Came Home besides War
Emblem. Both will carry 117 pounds, seven less than the 12 others,
under the race's weight-for-age conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Anita Derby winner, Came Home was beaten by more than 10
lengths, finishing sixth, as War Emblem won the Kentucky Derby. Since
then, Came Home notched two victories at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Came Home's trainer, Paco Gonzalez, also has entered Bosque
Redondo, whose role is to engage the front-running War Emblem in the
early stages, theoretically setting up the stretch run for his more
illustrious stablemate.</TE>
<TE>   Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan own Bosque Redondo and are also
the principal partners in a group that races Came Home. At 8-1, Came
Home and Bosque Redondo will run coupled in the betting.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows what's going to happen," said David Flores, who
rides Bosque Redondo. Then he puckishly added: "I'll probably steal
the race."</TE>
<TE>   With the June retirement of Chris McCarron, Mike Smith took over
the riding assignment aboard Came Home and in his first try rode the
colt to a 1 1/4-length victory in the Swaps at Hollywood on July 14.
Like War Emblem, Came Home will be facing older horses for the first
time.</TE>
<TE>   "My horse is more mature now," Smith said. "He's got tactical
speed, but we'll take nothing away from him if [the chance to make
the lead] comes easy. But what I hope to do is sit off the pack."</TE>
<TE>   Of the six previous 3-year-olds to run in the Pacific Classic,
Best Pal won the inaugural running in 1991 and General
Challenge--with Flores--proved best in 1999. General Challenge was
trained by Bob Baffert, who hedged about running War Emblem after his
colt fired an extra-fast five furlongs in :57 3/5 on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Other 3-year-olds to run well in the Classic have been Tiznow,
second to Skimming in 2000, and Dramatic Gold, who was third behind
Tinners Way and Best Pal in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, Skimming, who thrived at Del Mar, gave
Frankel his latest victories in the Classic. Instead of trying for a
third Classic victory in a row, Skimming suffered a training injury
and this week was retired. His stud career will begin in February at
Cardiff Stud Farm in Atascadero, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   After Gary Jones saddled Best Pal for his Pacific Classic victory
in 1991, Frankel won the next four runnings--with Missionary Ridge,
Bertrando and Tinners Way twice.</TE>
<TE>   "At the right time I was in the right place with the right horse,"
Frankel said.</TE>
<TE>   His hope Sunday, Milwaukee Brew, won the Santa Anita Handicap in
March and the Californian in June at Hollywood Park, but in his last
start, on July 14, Frank Stronach's 5-year-old lagged by 11 lengths
in the Hollywood Gold Cup and couldn't catch the pace-setting Sky
Jack. Milwaukee Brew finished third, beaten by three lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel accepted responsibility for jockey Kent Desormeaux being
so far behind early, blaming his pre-race instructions.</TE>
<TE>   "There won't be any instructions this time," Frankel said.</TE>
<TE>   Desormeaux gave Frankel his first Pacific Classic victory, with a
gate-to-wire ride on Missionary Ridge, a 24-1 longshot, in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "A static plan [with Milwaukee Brew] didn't work out last time,"
Desormeaux said. "I'm on a horse that closes, and that's always a
sizable risk, because of potential traffic problems, in a big field
like this. What I have to do is determine how far back I should be,
and then come running in the last quarter of a mile.</TE>
<TE>   "I look for War Emblem, Speedy Pick and Sky Jack to be up front.
In a best-case scenario, maybe those three can run each other off."</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Doug O'Neill, Sky Jack, at 6-1, will be ridden by
Laffit Pincay, seeking his first Pacific Classic victory. O'Neill was
not happy with Sky Jack's No. 3 post, which puts him inside Bosque
Redondo (No. 4) and War Emblem (No. 6).</TE>
<TE>   "If they're flying up front, we hope to be sitting just off the
pace," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arbiter, who has five victories in seven starts this year,
including a victory over the track, was not entered in the Pacific
Classic because of a leg injury.... Garrett Gomez, who rides
Momentum, is seeking his third Classic victory in a row. He was
aboard Skimming in 2000-01.... Came Home worked three furlongs in :37
2/5 at Hollywood Park. He and Bosque Redondo will be vanned the 100
miles to Del Mar on Sunday morning.... Seven horses were entered for
Saturday's $300,000 Del Mar Oaks. They include Dublino, Megahertz and
Alozaina, who finished 1-2-3 in the American Oaks at Hollywood.
Dublino was disqualified to second place by the stewards. Others
running in the Del Mar Oaks are Pina Colada, Arabic Song, Ristra and
Fair Bianca.... Flores rode three winners Thursday.... Vindication, a
$2.15-million yearling purchase by Satish Sanon, won for the second
time in as many starts and is a possible for the closing-day Del Mar
Futurity on Sept. 11.</TE>

<HD>Owners, Players Find Shared View on Time</HD>
<DH>Labor: Key issues aren't discussed, but sides do agree that
one week is a big enough window in which to make a deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The baseball players' union failed to respond to the owners' latest
revenue-sharing proposal during a series of collective bargaining
sessions Thursday, but the sides--in a surprisingly positive
perspective--agreed they have plenty of time to resolve the remaining
issues before the union's Aug. 30 strike date.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Rob Manfred, management's lead labor lawyer, said it is
strictly a matter of resolving numbers now because there is agreement
on the structure of both the revenue-sharing distribution and payroll
tax, the two biggest issues among several still on the table.</LD>
<LD>   Neither the tax--still a potentially deal-breaking hurdle--nor
revenue sharing was discussed Thursday, but Manfred called it a
productive day in which 20 pages of complex language relating to the
issue of debt servicing by individual clubs was finalized, and
non-economic subjects such as scheduling, interleague play and the
assignment of contracts were discussed.</LD>
<TE>   Manfred also said there was a "good conversation" on how and when
the union will respond to the owners' Tuesday offer that reduced
their revenue-sharing proposal from $282 million to $268 million, and
he is "mildly optimistic" that response will come soon.</TE>
<TE>   The union often takes a cynical view of Manfred's positive twists,
but union lawyer Steve Fehr, the brother of Executive Director Don
Fehr, agreed with Manfred that there is plenty of time to resolve the
remaining issues.</TE>
<TE>   "They can be resolved within a day if the commitment is there," he
said. "I'm not saying they will be resolved within a day, only that
the issues have been narrowed sufficiently that they can be resolved
in a much shorter time [than the seven days before Aug. 30]."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Fehr agreed with Manfred's perception that the union soon
would respond to the revenue-sharing proposal (perhaps today, but
more likely on the weekend) and said, "Hopefully, resolving what's
left to resolve on revenue sharing won't be difficult." The players
have proposed shifting $235 million from the high-revenue clubs to
low-revenue clubs, meaning there is a $33-million difference that
would seem to be easily bridged. The union already has agreed to the
owners' straight-pool method of distribution, which would divide the
money evenly among the 30 teams.</TE>
<TE>   The tax issue is more contentious. The union considers the
two-tiered element of increased revenue sharing and payroll tax
equivalent to a salary cap and, as Don Fehr recently wrote in a memo
to players and agents, an all-out assault on the salary structure.</TE>
<TE>   However, Manfred said that with the tax, like revenue sharing, the
sides have made "great strides" in the structuring and "what
differences remain are strictly differences in the numbers."</TE>
<TE>   The tax numbers, however, are more complicated than the
$33-million revenue-sharing difference. Although owners have accepted
the union's concept that, as Manfred put it, "the more times you
exceed the threshold, the harder you get hurt," there are wide
differences over the triggering threshold and rate of tax, and the
ability to bridge those differences holds the key to a settlement
before Aug. 30. In addition, the owners' quest to have the tax cover
four years compared to the union's willingness to go only three is
another potential problem.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, as part of finalizing the debt-service package, there
was one important concession by management, according to a source.
The debt owed players, deferred and otherwise, will not be counted in
the 60-40 tabulations that require clubs to have 60% of their value
in assets and not more than 40% in debt. The union had been concerned
that by including player debt in the formula it would restrict
spending.</TE>
<TE>   The union is expected to brief its executive board on the status
of the talks in a conference call today.</TE>

<HD>Yao Impresses in China Defeat</HD>
<DH>Basketball: No. 1 draft choice has 13 points, 11 rebounds
and six blocks in first game against NBA players.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM SMITH</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>Well, it wasn't the Toni Kukoc treatment after all.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe this guy is going to make it.</LD>
<LD>   China's Yao Ming withstood the threats from the NBA-stocked Team
USA--even if his team didn't--during the Americans' 84-54 romp over
China in an exhibition game here Thursday in preparation for next
week's World Championships in Indianapolis.</LD>
<TE>   Yao, China's 7-foot-5 star, finished with 13 points, 11 rebounds
and six blocks. In the first half he had 11 points, five rebounds,
two blocks and two steals, while the U.S. rolled to a 51-28 lead.</TE>
<TE>   As Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen did to Kukoc in the Olympics
a decade ago, U.S. players said they were prepared to test the
much-discussed Chinese giant.</TE>
<TE>   But Yao didn't panic, displaying a soft shooting touch and resolve
that even helped his team to an early lead.</TE>
<TE>   The game opened with Antonio Davis, who defended Yao, and Jermaine
O'Neal driving unsuccessfully at Yao, whose size seemed to disturb
just about all the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   But not rookie Jay Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Coming in late in the first half, Williams, the former Duke
standout, drove on and almost succeeded in an attempt to dunk on the
huge center, drawing the crowd's biggest reaction and his teammates'
cheers.</TE>
<TE>   "People are always going to come after you," Williams said. "You
have to be ready."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team was ready and blew away the Chinese team with a 16-3
run to close the first quarter and 14-2 to open the second quarter.
The principal contributors were Michael Finley with 12 points, Shawn
Marion with 10 and O'Neal and Ben Wallace controlling the backboards.
Finley finished with a game-high 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   But China's team, which is not considered a serious medal
contender in next week's 16-team tournament and will play the U.S.
again Aug. 31, was not the story. It was Yao, the NBA's No. 1 draft
pick with the Houston Rockets.</TE>
<TE>   It was reminiscent of the Dream Team's game in 1992 against
Croatia and Kukoc, then regarded as Europe's best player. The Bulls
were coming off their second consecutive title, and Jordan and Pippen
weren't happy about the Chicago management's love affair with Kukoc.</TE>
<TE>   The locker room was quiet as the U.S. team was about to face
Croatia when Jordan spoke.</TE>
<TE>   "Kukoc is ours," Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   No one said anything.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys take who you want, but he's ours," Jordan said. "Anyone
got a problem with that?"</TE>
<TE>   Jordan and Pippen then practically picked up Kukoc heading out of
the locker room, holding him to an embarrassing four points in a
33-point U.S. win.</TE>
<TE>   There was no Jordan or Pippen Thursday, but this is a hard-working
if not star-laden U.S. team.</TE>
<TE>   It took a 5-0 lead, but Yao, moving easily around the basket, made
two of turnaround jump shots, a face-up jump shot and followed a miss
with a slam dunk when China took that 11-8 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. pressure quickly opened up the game, but the only U.S.
dunk in the first half with Yao in the game was when the center
changed Paul Pierce's shot and O'Neal followed the shot with a slam.
Yao later blocked an O'Neal drive before Williams came closest to
putting one in over him.</TE>
<TE>   Yao, wearing No. 13 in the burgundy and gold of the Chinese team,
didn't back down or back off. He scored only five points and was in
quick foul trouble against the U.S. team in the 2000 Olympics. But
now, at about 300 pounds, he absorbed the blows on screens and kept
his shot high, where defenders couldn't get to it. He made his future
coach, Houston's Rudy Tomjanovich, sitting courtside, smile.</TE>
<TE>   "I've liked what I've seen," Tomjanovich said.</TE>
<TE>   And the NBA probably has as well, which may be the point everyone
is missing about Yao.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors, getting a rare sellout in this area with an
estimated 1.5 million Asian-Americans, began selling their three-game
and 11-game "Great Wall" ticket plans to see Yao and teammates Mengke
Bateer (Denver) and Wang Zhi Zhi (Dallas), the latter not playing
Thursday because of a dispute with the Chinese team.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA is expecting huge revenues from previously untapped China
with Yao, as the NBA players test this man some regard as the
league's next great force.</TE>
<TE>   "People are going to come after you when you are a top pick,"
Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's great to be a target. You prepare much more."</TE>

<HD>Herta Could Fill American Void in F-1 Racing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Formula One racing, like soccer, captivates much of the rest of the
world but is not particularly popular in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Soccer, though, at least, has a USA presence in the World Cup.
There is no American presence in Formula One, even though one of its
17 races will be run in Indianapolis next month.</LD>
<LD>   There has not been an American driver in Grand Prix racing since
Michael Andretti's abortive season in 1993, when he and McLaren
called off their association with three races remaining. Until a week
ago, no American had so much as tested an F-1 car since 1994, when
Elton Julian of Beverly Hills drove for the Tourtel Larrousse team in
tests but never raced.</LD>
<TE>   Bryan Herta, a veteran of eight years in CART but unemployed since
his Zakspeed/Forsythe team folded after the 2001 season, may fill
that American void on the Grand Prix roster. The Hart High graduate
from Valencia tested a week ago with the Minardi team at Donington
Park in England and may drive in this year's final three F-1 races,
including Sept. 29 at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "I drove 30 laps over two days in a test with three other
drivers," Herta said after returning home. "We were told not to talk
about comparative speeds, so I'll just say that I was very pleased
with what I did. I am hoping it will get me in one of Minardi's cars
later this year."</TE>
<TE>   Also testing were Justin Wilson, last year's Formula 3000
champion; Matteo Bobbi, Minardi's regular test driver, and David
Saefens, Minardi's F3000 driver.</TE>
<TE>   Herta, 32, who won two CART races, at Laguna Seca in 1998 and
1999, took an old-fashioned approach to getting a Formula One ride.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw my chances gone of racing in CART again this year, I
flew to England over the winter and knocked on the door of nearly
every F-1 team. I said, 'Hey, I'm interested in doing this. How about
giving me a test?' "</TE>
<TE>   Australian Mark Webber is Minardi's No. 1 driver. Alex Yoong, a
Malaysian, started the season in the second car but was "given a
rest" after failing to qualify for several races. Anthony Davidson,
23, signed for two races, last week in Hungary where he failed to
finish, and Sept. 1 at the Spa in Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, the seat is open for Monza, the U.S. and Japan,"
Herta said. "I felt confident after the test. I was very comfortable
in the car, a last year's Minardi with a Cosworth engine. I know
their cars are some of the slowest on the Grand Prix grid, but I
would like to get my foot in the door and I have heard that Minardi
has plans for some exciting changes next year."</TE>
<TE>   Besides following a rigorous physical training program, Herta has
tried to stay sharp by driving a Panoz sports car with Bill Auberlen
of Redondo Beach in the American LeMans series and the 24 Hours of
LeMans. They have four top-five finishes in six races.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1991, when I drove in the Formula Ford World Cup in England, I
wanted to drive in Formula One but I couldn't raise enough money to
stay in Europe so I came home and drove Indy Lights and CART champ
cars," Herta said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough getting in over there. They don't think very highly of
American champ-car drivers. They have an elitist attitude and their
last experience with Michael Andretti didn't do much to improve their
idea of the American image."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Herta, a karting champion in the 1980s, filed
suit against CART when it appeared that the national karting program
he had helped sponsor would be dropped by the sanctioning body.</TE>
<TE>   "We've worked things out and it looks like it will be a happy
ending for everyone," he said. "Karting will continue to be the first
step up the ladder to CART. We had 40 races this year and the Grand
National championship at Las Vegas in November will give owners an
opportunity to identify talent at a young age.</TE>
<TE>   "Karting has become the way to start for nearly all of the top
drivers now, even NASCAR. Kevin Harvick, Tony Stewart and a lot of
other stock car drivers [are former kart drivers]."</TE>

care unit at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis to a private room,
his condition listed as stable. Priestley, who suffered multiple
injuries in an accident during practice Aug. 11 at Kentucky Speedway,
underwent surgery Monday to repair fractures in his nose and bones in
his face. He previously had surgery to repair fractures in his back
and feet.</TE>
<TE>   Indy Racing League driver Richie Hearn is recovering from surgery
last week on a badly broken right ankle. In an accident at Kentucky
Speedway, Hearn broke his ankle in five places, requiring four
screws.... Shane Scully, U.S. Auto Club western midget car series
points leader, has been released from Northridge Hospital and is
recuperating at home in Encino from injuries suffered during an Aug.
2 race in Belleville, Kan. Scully suffered a closed head injury,
broken right hand and contusions.</TE>

<TE>   Former world champion Greg Hancock of Balboa moved into first
place in the AMA National Speedway championship series with a win
last Friday at Auburn, Calif. One round remains, Sept. 20, at Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock, the national champion in 1995, 1998 and 2000, finished
ahead of three-time winner Mike Faria, Billy Janniro and former world
champion Billy Hamill. Hancock leads the standings with 36 points to
35 for Hamill and 34 for Janniro, all of whom are racing on European
circuits. The first American-based rider is Faria with 28.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa Speedway, where Hancock and Hamill got their start, is
not involved because it is not an AMA-sanctioned track. It will host
its own U.S. Nationals on Oct. 12. Saturday night's weekly program
will feature Harley-Davidsons on the tiny oval in addition to
speedway bikes and sidecars.</TE>

<HD>With Owens, Naturally, There's a Catch</HD>

<DL>SANTA CLARA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Terrell Owens claims he's a changed man, wiser now after months of
introspection.</LD>
<LD>   The 49ers, who desperately want the Pro Bowl receiver to be a
productive part of their offense, are ready to take him at his word.</LD>
<LD>   "He's trying, he really is," Coach Steve Mariucci said Thursday.
"Things are pretty damn good right now."</LD>
<TE>   But Owens is prone to dramatic mood swings, so it's unclear how
long the good feelings will linger. On the first day of training
camp, for instance, he told reporters he was ready to be a vocal
leader, a stable fixture in the locker room, a cool-headed pro to
whom rookies could turn.</TE>
<TE>   A day later, in a USA Today feature, Owens said of his teammates:
"It's sad to say, but there are not a whole lot of guys who I can say
really are my friends."</TE>
<TE>   He went on to say how the 49ers have "a lot of fake people" and "a
lot of two-faced people. And that goes from the top down."</TE>
<TE>   Had that come from another star player, it might have caused more
of a stir. Because Owens said it, though, it was just another
bombastic blip and barely caused a ripple. Owens doesn't have many
friends on the team and has alienated a lot of players.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how he's viewed, Owens insists it doesn't affect his
game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to let something somebody says or somebody thinks
about me distract me from what I do on the field," he said. "No
matter what happens or whatever comes up, I'm still able to go out on
that field and perform."</TE>
<TE>   That said, he's still determined to reinvent himself. The old
Owens, the one who did a celebration dance on the midfield star at
Texas Stadium? He's history. Gone, too, is the Owens who angrily
sulked in front of his locker after catching three passes in a loss
to St. Louis last season, and the one who angrily asked the 49ers to
put him on the expansion-draft list so he might begin anew in another
city.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers refused to do that, of course, because Owens is one of
the best playmakers in football, a receiver every bit as dangerous as
Minnesota's Randy Moss. Owens led the league with 16 touchdown
receptions last season, and his play this summer has been at the same
level, if not higher.</TE>
<TE>   But talent has never been a problem for Owens. His attitude and
mood swings are what have gotten him into trouble. After the 49ers
lost in overtime at Chicago last season--a game decided when Mike
Brown grabbed a deflection off Owens' hands and returned it 33 yards
for a touchdown--Owens essentially accused Mariucci of rolling over.
He said Mariucci didn't want to run up the score on his buddy,
Chicago Coach Dick Jauron, and therefore failed to put the game out
of reach.</TE>
<TE>   Mariucci responded by calling the accusation "utterly ridiculous"
and "completely void of any deep thought." A divide had already been
forming between player and coach, and now the chasm was even wider.</TE>
<TE>   The feud festered. After a loss to St. Louis in December, Owens
sat in a chair in front of his locker and sulked, too angry to speak
to teammates, let alone reporters. And smoke was streaming from his
ears after the 49ers lost to Green Bay in the first round of the
playoffs, a game in which he had four catches and felt frozen out of
the offense.</TE>
<TE>   "It got to a point where I was basically fed up," said Owens, who
returned home to Atlanta after the season. "I wanted out. It got all
the way back here, and people in the Bay Area reported about it. It
was just bad."</TE>
<TE>   Things didn't improve until April, when Mariucci flew to Atlanta
and met Owens and his agent in an airport hotel. The sides talked for
hours and ironed out their differences.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt it was necessary, and it was worth doing," Mariucci said.
"We had a productive discussion. We both got things off our chest
that we've been carrying for too long. We needed that."</TE>
<TE>   The two are friendlier with each other now. They chat on the
practice field--something that hardly ever happened last season--and
Mariucci recently asked Owens to be part of his "Dirty Dozen," an
advisory board of players.</TE>
<TE>   Owens has even made himself more accessible to reporters this
summer. But Thursday, a writer who regularly covers the team
approached him at his locker hoping to get a comment about a rookie
cornerback. The kinder, gentler Owens barely looked his way, shooing
him away with a flick of his wrist. Change takes time.</TE>

<HD>Interceptions Help Chargers Beat Rams</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Diego Chargers ended Ram reserve quarterback Marc Bulger's
successful run in exhibition games by intercepting two of his passes
in a 31-10 victory Thursday night at St. Louis.</LD>
<LD>   The Chargers (2-1) put the game away with a 21-point third
quarter, getting the first of three touchdowns one play after
Bulger's second interception. They shut out the Rams' starting
offense in the first quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The Rams, coming off three straight 500-point seasons, managed
only 87 yards and trailed, 3-0, at halftime.</LD>
<TE>   They weren't shut out in the first half during the regular season
last year.</TE>
<TE>   The teams meet Nov. 10 in the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Warner played a few snaps into the second quarter and
completed five of 10 passes for 56 yards for the Rams (0-3). Marshall
Faulk, making his first appearance of the exhibition season, played
three series and had one carry for 11 yards and two receptions for
seven.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger, who received a lot of playing time with backup Jamie
Martin sidelined by a collarbone injury, had been 26 of 39 for 349
yards and two touchdowns in exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Chargers, he was 19 of 27 for 177 yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Spurrier's quarterback situation got a little clearer when
the Washington Redskins traded Sage Rosenfels to the Miami Dolphins
for an undisclosed 2003 draft choice.</TE>
<TE>   The deal leaves Spurrier with three quarterbacks: Danny Wuerffel,
Shane Matthews and first-round pick Patrick Ramsey. All three will
make the team, with Wuerffel and Matthews vying for the starting job.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Qasim Mitchell, a 335-pound rookie offensive lineman, was taken to
a hospital as a precaution after experiencing heat-related problems
during the Cleveland Browns' practice at Berea, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Team spokesman Todd Stewart said Mitchell, an undrafted free
agent, was taken to the Cleveland Clinic for evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect him to be fine," Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   The Browns practiced in an occasional light rain and humid
conditions outdoors at their training complex.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Raiders waived quarterback Bobby Hoying.</TE>
<TE>   Hoying was Rich Gannon's seldom-used backup for most of three
seasons after arriving in a trade with Philadelphia in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   He injured his elbow early last season and never played. He
underwent surgery to repair a ligament in November, but the injury
still hasn't healed.</TE>
<TE>   Marques Tuiasosopo has played well as Gannon's new backup, and
veteran Rick Mirer probably will be the Raiders' third quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland still might re-sign Hoying if his elbow heals, Coach Bill
Callahan said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Offensive tackle Bob Whitfield had his contract restructured by
the Atlanta Falcons, opening the way to re-signing linebacker Keith
Brooking and defensive Patrick Kerney.... New England Patriot owner
Robert Kraft was recovering after undergoing heart bypass surgery.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to make a full recovery.</TE>

<HD>Giants Sweep the Mets</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Met Manager Bobby Valentine sat with his head buried in his
hands after another disheartening loss.</LD>
<LD>   "The last six or seven days I've treated it every way possible.
I'll just come up with another way tomorrow," Valentine said. "Just
about everyone in the lineup had good at-bats. It's just not enough.
Something is just missing."</LD>
<LD>   Ryan Jensen pitched six strong innings to win for the first time
in eight starts and the San Francisco Giants extended the Mets'
longest losing streak since 1991 to 11 games with a 3-1 victory
Thursday at San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   San Francisco won all six meetings with the Mets this season, only
the second time in franchise history the Giants have swept a season
series. They beat Florida nine times in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants remained 2 1/2 games behind the Dodgers in the NL
wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen (11-8) won for the first time since July 15 after giving up
one run and six hits. He walked two and struck out two.</TE>
<TE>   Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his 31st save. The Giants improved
to 10-0 in the regular season against the Mets at Pacific Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 6, Cincinnati 3--Tony Womack extended his hitting streak
to 11 games with a tiebreaking two-run homer in the fifth inning at
Phoenix as the Diamondbacks swept the six-game season series from the
Reds.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Finley had a solo shot, and four relievers combined for four
scoreless innings in support of Miguel Batista (7-7) to help the
Diamondbacks win for the 11th time in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Byung-Hyun Kim pitched the ninth for his 31st save, breaking the
franchise record set by Gregg Olson in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 9, Atlanta 2--Left-hander Mike Bynum shut down
baseball's best team in only his second big league start as the
Padres took two of three from the Braves at San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Bynum (1-0), who was promoted from triple-A Portland last Friday
and got a no-decision at Montreal the next day, held Atlanta to two
runs and six hits in 6 2/3 innings, struck out four and walked two.</TE>
<TE>   Brave starter Jason Marquis (8-8) left with a bruised left calf
after being hit by Phil Nevin's line drive in the third inning, and
center fielder Andruw Jones strained his left shoulder and right
wrist making a diving catch of Bynum's fly ball in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 14, Montreal 6--Jay Payton homered and drove in a
career-high five runs and Todd Zeile had a home run and three RBIs at
Denver in the Rockies victory over the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   Payton went four for five with a triple and three runs. He's
batting .408 with four homers and 15 runs batted in in 71 at-bats
since being acquired from the New York Mets on July 31.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 7, Milwaukee 0--Randy Wolf gave up four hits in eight
innings at Milwaukee and hit his first home run to lead the Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf (9-7) struck out seven and walked four as the Brewers fell to
7-20 against left-handers this season. The Phillies are 6-0 in Wolf's
last six starts.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, Pittsburgh 4--Fernando Vina doubled in two runs with
one out in the ninth inning to lift the Cardinals at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Gabe Molina (1-0) pitched a scoreless ninth to earn the victory,
the Cardinals' 12th in their last 15 and third in the four-game
series with the Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 9, Chicago 1--Roy Oswalt pitched eight innings for his
sixth consecutive victory and Brad Ausmus homered in the Astros'
six-run first at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Oswalt (16-6) gave up only a solo homer to Fred McGriff in the
seventh inning as he improved to 4-0 in five starts against Chicago
this season. Oswalt struck out six.</TE>

<HD>NBC Adds to Olympic Coverage</HD>
<DH>Television: Despite low ratings for 2000 Sydney Games,
network has big plans for Athens in 2004.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC, planning for the Athens Summer Olympics of 2004, is gearing up
to add to the already-mammoth programming schedule it presented from
the Sydney Games two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   In Athens, the third installment of its $3.5-billion contract to
televise the Games in the United States from 2000 through 2008, NBC
and its cable arms, MSNBC and CNBC, figure to add slightly to the 441
1/2 hours broadcast from Sydney in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The total has not been finalized, NBC spokesman Mike McCarley
said. The Aug. 13, 2004, start of the Games is 721 days away, and
McCarley said, "It's much too premature to tell but our early
schedules have us doing more coverage."</LD>
<TE>   Because of the time difference from Europe, coverage will probably
feature a mix of taped and live action.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the coverage on NBC, MSNBC and CNBC,
Telemundo--which NBC acquired earlier this year in a $2.7-billion
purchase--is due to present 90 to 100 hours of Athens 2004 coverage.
"When you add in Telemundo, we're taking the Olympics to a larger and
wider audience," McCarley said.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's ratings from Sydney resulted in the lowest marks for any
Olympics, Summer or Winter, since 1968. The average Nielsen rating
for the 17 nights of telecasts from Sydney was 13.8, meaning 13.8% of
U.S. homes tuned in to the Games. That rating was 36% lower than the
Atlanta Games, which NBC also televised.</TE>
<TE>   NBC showed five hours of competition each night from Sydney;
network executives said even during the 2000 Games that they had
erred, that five hours nightly was too much. They also believe that
staging the Games in September, as Sydney's were, is problematic for
U.S. viewers--because kids are back in school, parents are back at
work after the Labor Day break and the TV schedule is full of
baseball pennant races and a raft of NFL and college football games.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, virtually all of the Sydney Olympics were shown on tape
delay throughout the United States--the time difference from Sydney
to Los Angeles was 18 hours--and many U.S. viewers knew results long
before they aired on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   The time difference from Athens to Los Angeles is 10 hours. In
theory, that means it would be possible to present more events live.</TE>
<TE>   But, as was proven during the Salt Lake Winter Olympics earlier
this year, a taped Olympics does not necessarily translate into a
ratings loser.</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake Games were broadcast on tape in Los Angeles and
throughout the Pacific time zone; ratings, even on the West Coast,
far surpassed the 1998 Winter Games from Nagano, Japan, which were
televised by CBS.</TE>

<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BUENA VISTA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Morning has broken and the sun has performed its usual magic,
transforming a colorless sky into one full of dazzling reds.</LD>
<LD>   It sits low in the eastern sky, beckoning hordes of fishermen in
cruisers and skiffs, which are blazing foamy white trails toward the
deep blue sea ... to where the action is.</LD>
<LD>   But not everyone is so compelled. Gary Graham is among those who
have remained on the beach. With his faithful white dog by his side,
fly rod in hand, Graham is performing his usual magic, casting
gracefully, stripping in line, then casting again.</LD>
<TE>   Soon, there is a taker, a roosterfish that goes skittering through
the shallows for several minutes before Graham, playing the fish
masterfully, has the glistening predator at his feet.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a big rooster but that takes nothing from the experience
because, as he says, "Any rooster on a fly is a good rooster--I don't
care if it weighs a pound or 40 pounds."</TE>
<TE>   It's a point well made. Roosterfish are the broad-shouldered
bullies of southern Baja California's inner waters, as wary as any of
the more glamorous offshore species, with the exception of marlin.
They're difficult to fool and the bigger ones are strong enough to
empty the spools of all but the largest and most sophisticated
conventional reels.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Graham, with his simple fly-fishing rig, using flies
that mimic sardines and mullet, has fooled and landed dozens over the
years. Last year, he caught and released at least one roosterfish on
37 consecutive days, a remarkable feat.</TE>
<TE>   As owner of the Baja on the Fly guide service
(www.bajaonthefly.com), he has watched clients catch roosters up to
40 pounds, after battles that have lasted for more than an hour. They
have hooked much larger roosters but, with no boat to give chase,
they've been unable to stop them.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true of the really big jack crevalle, the pargo, the
amberjacks.</TE>
<TE>   These are the kings of the southern Sea of Cortez shallows, and a
growing number of people are discovering that the most exciting way
to experience them is with a fly rod--and with both feet planted
firmly in the sand.</TE>
<TE>   "I consider the beach to be the ultimate challenge, since there is
no way to follow the fish," Graham says. "It's just the angler and
the fish."</TE>
<TE>   A River Runs Through ...</TE>
<TE>   Not all of his customers feel that way coming in, and they come to
fish with Graham--the only outfitter in Baja California's East Cape
region--from all over the world.</TE>
<TE>   To most, the ultimate challenge is doing battle with the exotic
species of game fish this area is famous for: the marlin, sailfish,
tuna, dorado and wahoo. They bring 12-to 14-weight rods and an
assortment of big-game flies--large deceivers, mostly--and are sent
offshore via cruiser or skiff to the same areas the conventional
anglers fish.</TE>
<TE>   Trolling hookless lures or casting live bait to "tease" them close
to the boat, they then cast their flies, hope for a strike and hold
on for the fight of their lives if they get one.</TE>
<TE>   That's an exciting proposition, to be sure. But guests usually
reserve at least one day for the inner waters, which teem with not
only the larger predators but an array of smaller fish, from snook to
sierra mackerel, from bonefish to needlefish, from Mexican lookdowns
to African pompano.</TE>
<TE>   The offshore-inshore boat-fishing combinations have been popular
since Graham, 62, opened for business in 1994. But only in the last
few years have they come to discover the beauty of fishing from the
beach and, in fact, the ATV-led excursions have become one of
Graham's most popular draws.</TE>
<TE>   "The fun of this is just the drive on the beach and sight-casting
to fish," says Don Sloan, 62, a Borrego, Calif., resident who spends
a month here every year and occasionally serves as one of Graham's
beach guides. "When it happens, it's very explosive and it's probably
one of the best experiences you can have as a fisherman."</TE>
<TE>   Fishing the beach, Graham and Sloan say, in many ways is like
fishing a river, and with ATVs for access they and their clients have
about 30 miles of riverbank--mostly unspoiled coastline--from which
to cast.</TE>
<TE>   During the prime spring and summer months, though, most fishing is
done on a 12-mile ribbon of sand stretching just south of Buena
Vista, running past Rancho Leonero Resort, past the small town of La
Ribera, past Punta Colorada and out and slightly beyond the
lighthouse at Punta Arena.</TE>
<TE>   A brief tour with Sloan recently revealed little in the way of
action--an unusually abrupt change in water conditions had dispersed
the baitfish and their absence had resulted in far fewer predators
roaming the shores. And since baitfish inspire the predators to feed,
those that were patrolling the shores would do little more than
casually inspect any flies cast their way.</TE>
<TE>   But it was easy to see the possibilities this area held. When the
morning sun reached a certain point in the sky, you could see deeply
into the water. A series of deep cuts runs remarkably close to shore
and, like rivers, these cuts provide thoroughfares for the links in
the nearshore food chain.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, small schools of bait would flutter across the
surface, chased there, obviously, by much larger fish. But these
flurries were few and far between, and they were nothing compared to
what they'd be if the sardinas, or sardines, were schooling here.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, roosterfish were seen traveling through the watery
avenues, in twos or threes, raising the fishermen's adrenaline
levels. But the fish were not interested in anything thrown their
way.</TE>
<TE>   Long and slender needlefish also graced the shoreline, several
times, but were just passing through. One small fish was caught, but
it was only a listless puffer.</TE>
<TE>   Only days earlier, the situation had been much different. In an
area just south of Rancho Leonero, called the Ponds, Sloan cast a
large mullet fly before the sun was high enough to afford a glimpse
into the water.</TE>
<TE>   As he was stripping in line, with both hands, there was a blind
strike and a sizzling run toward a large stump sticking out of the
water 130 yards offshore.</TE>
<TE>   "What jacks will do is run right [under] the surface like a
submarine and when he got out there he got up on top and I could see
him running along by the stump," Sloan said, pointing offshore. "Then
he came in several times and ran up and down the beach."</TE>
<TE>   Sloan somehow managed to play the jack crevalle through a
minefield of stumps washed into the sea by last season's torrential
rains and, after about 25 minutes, "I surfed him up onto the beach,
jumped on him and grabbed him by the tail."</TE>
<TE>   The fish weighed 17 pounds before it was released. It was one of
the largest jacks ever landed on a fly rod from the beach by a Baja
on the Fly client or guide, and a perfect bookend for one caught days
earlier off Punta Arena by guide Lance Peterson. Both were caught on
eight-weight rods.</TE>
<TE>   The tour continued south past the Ponds, which required some
tricky maneuvering across a large arroyo, and past several makeshift
fish camps set up on the beach by locals, who were using lines
spooled around beer or soda cans.</TE>
<TE>   At each camp, Sloan waved and most of the fishermen waved back,
although one couldn't help but wonder what they thought of these
interlopers on their high-priced quad-runners, the long and whippy
fishing poles protruding from their rod holders.</TE>
<TE>   The tour swept down the long ribbon of sand, up and through the
parking lot of Hotel Punta Colorada, one of the more remote East Cape
fishing resorts, and all the way out to the lighthouse at Punta
Arena.</TE>
<TE>   There, with the vast desert as a backdrop and an equally vast
emerald sea washing up against their feet, those on the excursion had
about an hour to try to catch a fish before heading back to their
hotels in time to catch cabs to the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Though they wore the same glum looks most tourists wear on the day
they have to return to the bustling world they call home, they
marveled at their starkly beautiful surroundings, and seemed to
forget about all else as they sent their glittery deceivers out onto
the shimmering sea, hoping for the type of blind strike Sloan had
spoken of back at the Ponds.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, however, there were none.</TE>
<TE>   The Rooster Crows</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for Graham, there is always another day. And a day
later, next to the Rancho Leonero pier, as the hotel boats are
plowing out to sea, he's enjoying the sunrise, taking a few casts
before going home to prepare for the afternoon arrivals.</TE>
<TE>   The rooster crows early. The fisherman sets the hook, the dog
barks, and all seems right with the world.</TE>

<HD>Shaq Becomes Center of Tension</HD>
<DH>Worried about surgery, O'Neal feels terrible about missing
Hearn funeral</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He carefully sits on a tiny cushioned bench wedged in the corner of
Examining Room 6, engulfing the seat with his jeans and T-shirt and
sigh.</LD>
<LD>   There is a large chair in the middle of the room for patients, but
he wants no part of that.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll be fine right here," Shaquille O'Neal says.</LD>
<TE>   This is a different setting for an interview with the Laker
center, here at a podiatrist's office at the UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   But then, this is clearly a different Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   In his first extended interview this summer, his soft voice
cracks.</TE>
<TE>   "I gotta tell you, I'm pretty scared," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He says he has spent the last two months of the summer fretting
over surgery on his arthritic right big toe, which probably will take
place in the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't sleep some nights thinking about it," he says. "No
offense to anyone, but I don't want to spend the rest of my life
walking like Bill Walton."</TE>
<TE>   He says he understands how many people in town feel he should have
had the surgery earlier so he could be ready for the regular season.
But he hopes they will understand him.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to get three different opinions because this is my future,
my life, we're talking about," he says. "Then all three doctors had
different opinions. When doctors start fighting, I get nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Scared? Nervous? Sleepless?</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal is asked, what happened to Superman?</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't pull up his sleeve to show the tattoo. He doesn't flex
his muscles to show the attitude. He doesn't even smile.</TE>
<TE>   "He ain't here," O'Neal says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' third consecutive title season has been finished for
more than two months, but their most valuable player is still waiting
for the parade.</TE>
<TE>   As off-seasons go, Shaquille O'Neal's has been as pleasant as a
free throw.</TE>
<TE>   Amid pressure from his coach and criticism from the community, he
has undertaken what many feel has been a lackadaisical search for a
toe surgeon.</TE>
<TE>   Then Chick Hearn died, and O'Neal didn't come to the funeral.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was a charity basketball event scheduled in his name in
Tampa, Fla., and O'Neal didn't show because he said he was sick.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, a couple of days after he flew to Los Angeles from
his off-season home in Orlando, he decided to talk about it all.</TE>
<TE>   We met at the office of Robert Mohr, the podiatrist who will
perform the foot surgery.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, whose illness has prevented immediate surgery, was
scheduled for tests there that he hoped would clear him for the
procedure.</TE>
<TE>   During a 30-minute conversation before those tests, he was
reflective, remorseful and acutely mortal.</TE>
<TE>   We all wake up one day feeling that way, don't we? Despite
O'Neal's ability to lift a town on his 7-foot shoulders, this summer
the awakening apparently has happened to him.</TE>
<TE>   "I really feel like I'm getting older.... It's pretty scary," said
O'Neal, 30. "I never want you to see me looking like Patrick Ewing,
but I don't know...."</TE>
<TE>   This being Hollywood, you might think he was acting.</TE>
<TE>   But, um, if you've seen his movies, you know O'Neal isn't exactly
a great actor.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my biggest year, our biggest year, and I want to be there
for it," he said. "But when I ask the doctor if surgery will stop the
pain, he said it might, and it might not."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, O'Neal described the pain that he concealed
behind scowls and smirks during the NBA playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really bad," he said. "My foot hurt so bad I had no
elevation. My stomach and my butt were raw from the medicine I took
[Indocin, an anti-inflammatory]. Then I became reliant on that
medicine. If I didn't take it, I would have a horrible game. That's
when it got scary."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said that before many playoff games, he would lie in bed
for several hours while getting his foot massaged. He said he also
visited an acupuncturist for help.</TE>
<TE>   "Then when none of that helped, and my medicine was making me sick
all the time, I knew I was in trouble," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The adrenaline apparently carried him through the games, where he
averaged 36 points, 12 rebounds and 42 minutes while being named most
valuable player of the NBA Finals for a third consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   "But after the games, it hurt like hell," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Those who watched him limp to his car would agree.</TE>
<TE>   He said the search for an operation began almost immediately, but
three opinions later it became mired in understandable confusion.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing could have been done faster, but the doctors
started fighting," he said. "I didn't know what to do. It had to be
the right thing. I couldn't take any chances."</TE>
<TE>   Mohr said given the nature of the situation, O'Neal's caution was
understandable.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a potentially career-influencing decision, and if not
properly treated, it could ruin him," said Mohr, who said he is
perplexed by the perception of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody thinks it's his toe, like it's just a toenail, like
he's a big baby," Mohr said. "In actuality, it's not his toe, it's
his foot. It's the major propulsion joint of his whole foot."</TE>
<TE>   The official name of the joint, which stretches back from the big
toe, is the first metatarsal phalangeal joint.</TE>
<TE>   The official impact is huge.</TE>
<TE>   Said Mohr, who will shave bone spurs during the 45-minute
procedure: "The average person doesn't make their entire livelihood
jumping up and down on that joint. But Shaquille does. I can't think
of anything more important for him."</TE>
<TE>   Mohr confirmed that, while the shaving of spurs might give
O'Neal's toe more motion, it still might not relieve the pain.</TE>
<TE>   "If he has degenerative changes, Mother Nature only gives us one
layer of cartilage," Mohr said. "Maybe he'll have better motion, but
it might be painful motion, and he'll just have to keep playing
through it."</TE>
<TE>   It was during O'Neal's search for these answers that Hearn died.
Few who attended his funeral will soon forget that Kobe Bryant was
there but O'Neal was absent.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, O'Neal willingly addressed that.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel terrible I wasn't at Mr. Hearn's funeral, terrible,
terrible," he said. "I had a bad personal family problem at home, and
couldn't leave at that time, but I felt terrible."</TE>
<TE>   He was told that many thought his absence could undermine his
leadership position with the team. He cringed.</TE>
<TE>   "I had never turned my back on the Lakers, not once, and not this
time," he said. "I'm not that type of person. Chick was my family,
everyone there is my family, and I'll always be there for them."</TE>
<TE>   He said he sent hundreds of flowers, and remained home with
regret.</TE>
<TE>   "Like I said, I felt terrible about the whole thing," he said.
"Chick is a wonderful person, and I'll never forget him."</TE>
<TE>   About his other summer controversy--his failure to show at what
was billed as his charity basketball game in Tampa--he was more angry
than sad.</TE>
<TE>   "They called it my tournament, but it wasn't my tournament, I just
agreed to go to one of their parties," O'Neal said. "Then suddenly I
look up and the promoter has called it my tournament! When I do
something, I do it right, and that tournament had nothing to do with
me."</TE>
<TE>   He said that, if nothing else, the last three months have made him
more eager than ever for what is expected to be a landmark run at a
fourth championship.</TE>
<TE>   "The first three years were great, but this year is the big
one,"he said. "All the criticism and insults I've taken over this,
I'm coming back with a vengeance you've never seen."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said this go-fourth season is important because it would
establish Phil Jackson as the best coach of all time while vaulting
the Lakers into a class by themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "This year Phil has something to prove, I've got something to
prove, Kobe has something to prove," he said. "There is more at stake
than in the other years. You will see us play like it."</TE>
<TE>   As soon, of course, as O'Neal shows up, which still could be in
the season's first couple of weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what happens, I'll be there," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   If nothing else, a worried town can attach that answer to a
comforting question.</TE>
<TE>   Has he ever not?</TE>

<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>They say horses are some of the dumbest animals around, which I guess
really doesn't make them much different from baseball players.</LD>
<LD>   Now ordinarily the last thing I'm going to be upset about is an
athlete who can't talk, but in this case I'd love to get War Emblem's
take on how he feels.</LD>
<LD>   From what I can tell, most horsemen don't think much of War
Emblem, calling him "one-dimensional" because he likes to break from
the gate and then run as fast as he can until he wins the race.</LD>
<TE>   Horsemen apparently aren't much smarter than baseball players.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   RIGHT NOW War Emblem--the winner of the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness--is the best thing happening in a dying sport. Del Mar, of
course, is an annual aberration, drawing huge crowds because most of
the people who live around here have only the Padres and Chargers to
support, which makes for a depressing life and the need for escape by
the surf. Eventually, they're all going to laugh at the Chargers, and
we're all going to return to those quiet, nameless racehorse days of
small crowds at Hollywood Park and Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the first time in Del Mar history the winner of the
Kentucky Derby has run here in the year of its Derby victory, and
officials are expecting this year's Pacific Classic to draw 7,000
more fans than last year's race because of that.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the Sparks should think about having War Emblem make an
appearance at one of their games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THURSDAY WAS supposed to be a big day here. They had a big news
conference to pick post positions for the Pacific Classic, and
because the horses weren't talking, they called on trainers, owners
and jockeys to come to the dais. No one representing War Emblem,
however, stepped forward, including trainer Bob Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   Now as we know the going rate for an appearance fee for Baffert
these days is $50,000, so I just presumed Del Mar was cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe, as the rumors have persisted, Baffert has no intention
of running War Emblem, and has given only the appearance all week the
horse is going to run.</TE>
<TE>   That left others, whom no one really cares about, to do the
talking.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Bobby Frankel, the nattering nabob of negativism in horse
racing, was the first to chime in by telephone from Saratoga--and I
wonder if Baffert would have agreed to come to the phone for $25,000?
Anyway, the news conference began with track announcer Trevor Denman
asking Frankel about the Pacific Classic.</TE>
<TE>   "There are too many horses for that race track," groused Frankel.</TE>
<TE>   Well, you would have thought Frankel had just called the entire
Pacific Classic field a bunch of donkeys, because Denman went to the
mute button and quickly moved to the next person on the dais.</TE>
<TE>   No one seemed to care what trainer Doug O'Neill had to say,
however, because when Denman asked for questions, a reporter for the
Daily Racing Form wanted to talk to Frankel again. Frankel hadn't
hung up despite Denman's suggestion to get lost, and Mr. Sunshine
said, "The horses on the East Coast are a lot better."</TE>
<TE>   He also said, " ... with the exception of War Emblem," but by that
time Denman had him nearly drowned out, going to his "down the
stretch they come and Frankel has been left way behind."</TE>
<TE>   The reporter from the Daily Racing Form and another associate
immediately stood up and left the news conference, apparently upset
that only glowing things about Del Mar were going to be allowed to be
said on this day. I guess the Daily Racing Form prefers dirt to happy
turf talk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BECAUSE BAFFERT has put a lifetime ban--twice--on talking to Times
racing writer Bill Christine because he refuses to write only nice
things about him, I had a hunch he wasn't going to confide in
Christine whether War Emblem was going to run Sunday. So I sought out
Baffert in the paddock before the start of Thursday's first race
before his horse, Hezgotanothergear, ran.</TE>
<TE>   I watched the genius of Baffert at work. He avoided the horse the
entire time it was in the paddock, then gave precise racing
instructions to jockey Laffit Pincay: "Good luck," he said, and
Pincay nodded. The horse finished second, and refused to comment when
asked for an explanation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TRACK OFFICIALS wanted Baffert at the news conference, but he said
he didn't come for fear of saying the wrong thing. I hope Christine
rips him.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he has every intention of running War Emblem on
Sunday--even after I made him swear on a saddle cloth he has not been
pulling a fast one on everyone and is going to scratch the beast an
hour before post time. He said the $10,000 fee to enter the race gets
him a great meal in the Director's Room, and he doesn't want to put
that in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   "I scratch the horse, and you can bet those people in the
Director's Room will be yelling at me to put the lamb chop down,"
Baffert said. "He's going to run."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A TIP: Baffert said the Pacific Classic is a three-horse race, as
far as he's concerned, between War Emblem, Sky Jack and Milwaukee
Brew.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WAS told boxing promoter Bob Arum was not at Del Mar on
Thursday, and instead had taken his five grandchildren to

<HD>Milton Helps Lift the Sparks</HD>
<DH>WNBA: Forward scores 13 points in first seven minutes of
second half in 75-67 win over Starzz.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Lisa Leslie was scoreless in the second half and finished with 12
points. Mwadi Mabika, recovering from a sprained left ankle, made
only three of 11 shots. The Sparks shot 35.3% from the floor and
63.6% from the free-throw line.</LD>
<LD>   None of it did the Utah Starzz any good.</LD>
<LD>   It seems no matter how bad the Sparks are at the beginning of the
game or how ragged they are at the end, they are able to beat Utah,
just as they did Thursday with a 75-67 win before 14,823 at the Delta
Center.</LD>
<TE>   The Sparks took a 1-0 lead in the Western Conference finals
because DeLisha Milton came off the bench and led all scorers with 17
points. She was most instrumental the first seven minutes in the
second half, when she scored 13 points, among them two consecutive
three-pointers to push the Sparks ahead, 44-37, and break open what
was a close game.</TE>
<TE>   "I just took the shots that were given to me," said Milton, who
made three of five three-point attempts. "[Utah center Margo] Dydek
was the person guarding me and we know she rarely leaves the middle.
It's a good thing I worked on my three-point shooting in the
off-season."</TE>
<TE>   Also crucial was Tamecka Dixon, who scored all of her 13 points in
the second half despite being saddled with five fouls.</TE>
<TE>   "The key with us is we have an offensive threat at every
position," said Dixon, one of five Sparks to score in double figures.
"You have to play an almost perfect defense to stop us one-on-one
because we're either going to get a shot for ourselves or create one
for another teammate."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks can wrap up the best-of-three series Saturday in Los
Angeles if the Starzz don't solve the defensive schemes the Sparks
utilize or maintain their poise under fire.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks forced 21 turnovers by shutting off passing lanes and
blocking shots (10). No Utah player was more frustrated than Adrienne
Goodson, who made only two of 15 shots and scored seven points. On
four occasions Goodson drove through the lane and thought she had an
easy layup, only to have the shot rejected by Leslie or Milton.</TE>
<TE>   And once the Sparks--who led, 34-32, at the half--got their
second-half lead as high as 16 points (65-49), the Starzz, who shot
only 37.1%, collapsed under the weight of bad passes, bad shots and
bad judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "We had an opportunity to win tonight," said Starzz forward
Natalie Williams, who had 14 points and 11 rebounds. "We have to cut
down on our turnovers. Against a team that good we have to cut them
at least in half. That's one thing that broke the camel's back right
there."</TE>
<TE>   Added Starzz guard Marie Ferdinand: "Our offense is meant to pass
and cut. It's not a lot of dribbling. We dribbled the ball a lot, and
that's one of the reasons we turned the ball over."</TE>
<TE>   Ferdinand scored 13 points but had six turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks might have expected the Starzz to be drained after
three tough games against Houston. But Utah, if anything, was
galvanized by its first-round victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We were prepared for this by those three games with Houston,"
Coach Cindi Harvey said. "That was better than practicing each other.
It was an advantage having to play a good offensive team like Houston
to get ready for a better offensive team like L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks appeared rusty from their four days off. They missed 16
of their first 20 shots, blowing layups and 18-footers. Their
situation grew more worrisome when Dixon, who had the thankless job
of keeping up with Ferdinand, had four fouls in less than 12
first-half minutes.</TE>
<TE>   But the Starzz couldn't break away. Their biggest lead was 20-14
with 10:47 left in the half.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, I thought we had a good chance," said Spark Coach
Michael Cooper. "I had been concerned about our legs and wind as far
as game conditioning. But we hung in there."</TE>
<TE>   A 13-4 run put the Sparks ahead, 27-24, and the Sparks kept the
lead the rest of the half. Teasley picked up the offensive slack for
Dixon, scoring 10 points of her 11 points.</TE>

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lake Elsinore Storm might be a minor league baseball franchise,
but they're ready to "big league" the competition.</LD>
<LD>   The Storm, a California League affiliate of the San Diego Padres,
is offering baseball fans a chance to "strike back" against major
league players and owners with a ticket-swapping promotion.</LD>
<LD>   Fans can exchange a ticket to a major league game dated Aug. 30 or
later for the equal value of a ticket or tickets to Lake Elsinore's
game Aug. 27 against the Bakersfield Blaze.</LD>
<TE>   "The fans are frustrated with today's climate. This gives fans the
opportunity to voice their opinions and to strike back at the owners
and the players' union," Storm General Manager Dave Oster said.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, Oster said that a person with four box-seat tickets
worth $25 each to a major league game would receive 15 box-seat
tickets worth $7 each to the Storm game.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the strike back promotion, the Storm will give free
admission to fans named Donald, Bud or Allan (Commissioner Bud
Selig's first name).</TE>
<TE>   In conjunction with the promotion, Lake Elsinore has unveiled a
revenue-sharing plan where the team will tax each dollar made over
$15,000 at 1% and split it equally among the other nine California
League franchises.</TE>

<HD>Stratton Earned Chick's Trust</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although Chick Hearn was a devoted husband for nearly 64 years, there
was another woman in his life.</LD>
<LD>   She was Hearn's frequent companion on the road, always sitting in
the seat next to his on Laker charter flights. She met him for lunch
on game days and hung on his every word in the evenings.</LD>
<LD>   It certainly wasn't love at first sight, but Hearn grew fond of
her.</LD>
<TE>   So did Hearn's wife, Marge.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Stratton became a dear friend to both.</TE>
<TE>   Stratton, who has been producing and directing Laker telecasts for
Channel 9 since 1977, was on the road with the Lakers when Chick had
heart surgery in December, but she was with Marge in the hospital
when he had hip surgery in February. And she stayed by Marge's side
after the fall that led to Chick's death Aug. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "She is almost like a sister to me," Marge said this week.</TE>
<TE>   When it was mentioned that Stratton was "the other woman" in
Chick's life, Marge chuckled.</TE>
<TE>   "Just be careful how you write that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   When Stratton first got the Laker assignment, few women were
working in sports in any capacity. Certainly none were producing and
directing NBA telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Stratton had been a sports fan as a youngster in Auburn, Pa.,
where her father was the principal and basketball coach at a tiny
12-grade school. When she went to work in television at WMAL in
Washington, her duties included being film editor for "The Sonny
Jurgensen Show" when Jurgensen was the Redskins' quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   She met her husband, Dick Stratton, at WMAL. They were married in
1971 and came to Los Angeles the next year, when Dick was named
executive producer at Channel 11.</TE>
<TE>   Susan did some free-lance directing before landing a job at
Channel 9, where in 1974 she volunteered to produce and direct Ram
exhibition games, as well as the weekly show starring Coach Chuck
Knox.</TE>
<TE>   When Channel 9 got the Laker package before the 1977-78 season,
the station's general manager at the time, Lionel Schaen, named Susan
the producer-director.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn was not pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "He was against it," Stratton said. "No woman had ever produced
and directed an NBA telecast, but it wasn't just that I was a woman.
I had no professional basketball experience."</TE>
<TE>   What Hearn and Stratton soon learned was that they had one
important thing in common. Each was a perfectionist.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to get it right, and I wanted to get it right,"
Stratton said.</TE>
<TE>   The turning point occurred about a month into that first season,
when the Lakers were in Piscataway, N.J., to play the New Jersey
Nets. The Nets and Rutgers shared the arena and Rutgers had played
there earlier in the day.</TE>
<TE>   "We had no time to set up and I told everyone we couldn't go on
the air," Stratton recalled. "Well, we did anyway, and it was a
disaster. Audio problems and everything else."</TE>
<TE>   Stratton said then-Laker owner Jack Kent Cooke called the next
day. She figured her days as a Laker producer-director were over. But
it was just the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Cooke told me that he had heard that I had tried to cancel
the telecast, that the problems weren't my fault and that he
supported me," Stratton said. "And he told me that Chick also
supported me.</TE>
<TE>   "From then on our relationship began to improve."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn, interviewed in 1996 about Stratton, said, "I figured she'd
be gone after one telecast. Boy, was I wrong. If there is a hall of
fame for women directors--forget the women part--she belongs in it."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn no doubt would have said that Susan Stratton also belongs in
the hall of fame as a friend too.</TE>
<TE>   Honors Keep Coming</TE>
<TE>   Marge Hearn said she has committed to five charity functions at
which her late husband will be honored.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Brad Sherman (D--Sherman Oaks) visited her home in Encino on
Monday and presented her with a flag that had flown at half-staff in
honor of Chick over the Capitol in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Sherman plans to introduce a bill in Congress on Sept. 4 to rename
the post office in Encino after Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   The Replacements</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are still at least a month away from naming the
replacements for Hearn. It will take three broadcasters to fill the
void--a TV play-by-play announcer, a radio play-by-play announcer and
a radio commentator.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Sunderland remains the front-runner for the TV job and his
longtime friend Chris Marlowe has applied for the radio play-by-play
job. Another candidate for that job is Fox Sports Net's versatile
Bill Macdonald.</TE>
<TE>   Terrible Idea</TE>
<TE>   It's bad enough that Channel 9 delayed two Angel telecasts from
New York and will delay two more from Boston--tonight's and Monday
night's.</TE>
<TE>   Making matters worse was what happened Tuesday night in New York.</TE>
<TE>   On the telecast, which was delayed an hour, the Angels were
leading the Yankees, 5-2, in the third inning. Meanwhile, a real-time
score of 5-5 in the fifth was shown on the bottom of the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Just another reason to show the games live.</TE>
<TE>   Unusual Doubleheader</TE>
<TE>   Fox will televise the Angels and Red Sox on Saturday at 10 a.m. to
35% of the country, followed by the Dodgers and Atlanta Braves at 1
p.m. However, in Los Angeles the Dodger game won't be on Fox's
Channel 11 but rather Dodger flagship station Channel 13, which is
also owned by Fox.</TE>
<TE>   The idea was to avoid the possibility of the Angel game running
over into the Dodger game.</TE>
<TE>   The announcers for the Angel game will be Mel Proctor and Jerry
Remy. The announcers for the Dodger game will be Kenny Albert and Tim
McCarver.</TE>
<TE>   Vin Scully, who took a couple of days off because of laryngitis,
may be back for tonight's game, which will be televised by Channel
13.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's 5 p.m. game against the Braves will be broadcast on the
Dodger radio network as well as ESPN Radio, including KSPN (1110) in
Los Angeles. KSPN gets one exception date to blackout rules, and this
is it.</TE>
<TE>   Recommended Viewing</TE>
<TE>   A one-hour special, "30 Years of Greatest Sports Legends: a
Producer's Scrapbook," will be televised by Channel 7 Saturday at 4
p.m. The special will include highlights from the series that began
in 1972 and became the longest-running syndicated sports series in
television history.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Berl Rotfeld, his son Steve and producer Mike Tollin, who
now produces HBO's "Arli$$," are among those who reminisce on the
special.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition game between the Oakland Raiders and San Francisco
49ers will be televised on Channel 2 Saturday at 6 p.m., with Jim
Gray, Sean Jones and Jim Plunkett calling the action. Gray was asked
by Raider owner Al Davis to fill in for Charlie Jones this season.
Jones is recovering from radiation treatment for prostate cancer and
says he is feeling better.... ESPN will use Dennis Green as a studio
analyst for ESPNEWS. Green will also be a frequent contributor on
ESPN Radio and special editions of "NFL 2Night" on ESPN2. ESPN
earlier had hired Bill Parcells as an analyst for "Sunday NFL
Countdown."</TE>
<TE>   The Mighty Ducks have named John Ahlers, who comes from the Tampa
Bay Lightning, as their new television play-by-play announcer. He
replaces Chris Madsen, whose contract was not renewed.... Al
Michaels, Melissa Stark and Dan Fouts will be among those on the "ABC
Primetime Preview Weekend" Saturday and Sunday at Disney's California
Adventure Park in Anaheim.... The NBA has agreed to a three-year deal
with Telemundo (Channel 52 in Los Angeles) for the Spanish-language
network to carry 15 regular-season game and up to 10 WNBA games.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   In the September issue of Maxim magazine, Fox's Jillian Barberie
picks the Miami Dolphins to win the Super Bowl. Why?</TE>
<TE>   "I had a boyfriend when I was 17 who was a huge Dan Marino fan,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   Someone might want to tell Barberie that Marino retired after the
1999 season.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the first play, linebacker Spencer Havner made a teeth-rattling
tackle, bringing down tailback Akil Harris.</LD>
<LD>   Then tight end Mike Seidman made a dazzling catch down the
sideline for a 40-yard gain and had choice words for Ricky Manning
Jr. when the cornerback belted him at the end of the play.</LD>
<LD>   Next came a hard hit by freshman linebacker Justin London.
Finally, free safety Matt Ware picked off a pass thrown by freshman
Drew Olson and returned it for a touchdown to whoops and hollers.</LD>
<TE>   It was only 30 plays, but UCLA's first live scrimmage Thursday put
a charge into a team that had begun to drag after six days of
training camp.</TE>
<TE>   This was a lot more spirited than the "pillow fighting" Coach Bob
Toledo had described a day earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what it's all about; that's what we've been waiting for,"
said Manning, a senior whose constant chatter during practice is
making him the undisputed team leader.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo told the players after practice there is urgency to their
preparation, reminding them that their first opponent, Colorado
State, was playing a game at that very moment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's halftime right now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, full contact results in injuries, and although no
Bruin has been seriously hurt, the tent that serves as a training
room at Cal Lutheran was standing room only.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Rodney Leisle still hasn't practiced because of a
sore knee, and Thursday his counterpart, Sean Phillips, sprained an
ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Safety Kevin Brant has vertigo, tight end Blane Kezirian pulled a
calf muscle, receiver Craig Bragg pulled a hamstring, receiver Josh
Roenicke has a separated shoulder and the scrimmage ended with
offensive lineman Jason Nitz injuring a knee.</TE>
<TE>   All except Bragg are reserves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Receivers Junior Taylor and Jon Dubravac mastered the waiting
game. Maybe that's why no Bruin is more eager to get into a football
game.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, a freshman from Mesa, Ariz., was expected to contribute a
year ago, but academic problems kept him from enrolling until the
winter quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Dubravac, a senior, did contribute in 2000, ranking third among
receivers with 14 receptions, including a touchdown against Oregon
State. Then back problems forced him to sit out last season.</TE>
<TE>   But both players did what it took to get on the field, Taylor
mending his academics and Dubravac mending his back.</TE>
<TE>   Said Taylor: "I'm patient, I know I'm going to play a role this
year, It just feels so good to be part of the team."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dubravac: "There have been guys with similar back injuries
who had to take a medical retirement. It's great to run around out
here and just have the normal football aches and pains."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor is behind Bragg and junior Ryan Smith at split end.
Dubravac is battling junior Garrett Lepisto for the second-team spot
behind Tab Perry at flanker.</TE>
<TE>   For now, fighting their way up the depth chart is enough for
Taylor and Dubravac. Getting on the field at all was a long time
coming.</TE>
<TE>   "When you've been waiting as long as I did, it's good just to get
the rust off the gate," Dubravac said.</TE>

<LD>USC tailback Sultan McCullough switched numbers four times in the
last week while waiting for his left hamstring to heal.</LD>
<LD>   McCullough's No. 4 practice jersey was too large, so he donned 19,
46, even Marcus Allen's retired No. 33 while he paced the sideline
and sat on the trainer's table as teammate after teammate joined the
injured list.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, McCullough wore No. 2 as he began his push to become
the Trojans' No. 1 tailback. He returned to contact drills and did
not appear tentative making sharp cuts and absorbing several solid
hits.</LD>
<TE>   "You can't get timid--that's when you're going to hurt it again,"
said McCullough, a senior who was the team's leading rusher the last
two seasons. "I go out and give my all. If anything happens, it
happens."</TE>
<TE>   McCullough began training camp listed behind transfer Justin
Fargas on the depth chart. But with Fargas and Darryl Poston slowed
because of hamstring problems, McCullough can make a move to the
starting lineup for the Sept. 2 opener against Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   Poston could be up to speed by today. Fargas, however, is expected
to sit out a scrimmage on Saturday and not return until Monday, Coach
Pete Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, therefore, are taking it slow with McCullough.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to put him in more than a couple plays in a row,"
Carroll said. "We wanted to make sure we didn't fatigue him and put
him in a vulnerable position."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   William Buchanon became the latest player to switch from offense
to defense as the Trojans continue searching for depth at cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanon, a 6-foot-4 redshirt freshman from Oceanside, was moved
from receiver to the same position his father, Willie, played as an
All-American at San Diego State in 1971 and during an 11-year NFL
career with the Green Bay Packers and San Diego Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman linebacker Dallas Sartz stood out for the second
consecutive day, intercepting a pass, knocking down another and
almost intercepting a third.</TE>
<TE>   Sartz, 6 feet 5, 210 pounds, is playing behind Matt Grootegoed at
strongside linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   "Being 6-5 out there is such an advantage," Carroll said. "He's
such a natural athlete and he has such tremendous range, if he gets
in the same place other guys do, he has a lot more playmaking range."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Matt Cassel, who has a chipped bone in his right knee,
is scheduled to return to drills on Monday, but Carroll said that
Matt Leinart is probably the No. 2 quarterback behind Carson Palmer
for the Auburn game.... Senior receiver Kareem Kelly, out since
Sunday because of a right hamstring strain, returned to contact
drills.... Defensive lineman Kenechi Udeze, who had an MRI exam
Wednesday night, practiced and said he had a bruised bone in his left
knee.... Freshman defensive lineman LaJuan Ramsey did not practice
because he is not yet approved by the NCAA clearinghouse. Compton
Dominguez High was late in sending Ramsey's transcripts. Carroll said
Ramsey can rejoin practice when the NCAA approves the transcripts....
Linebacker Melvin Simmons blocked a 50-yard field-goal attempt by
David Davis at the end of a two-minute drill.</TE>

<HD>Vincent Is Not Optimistic</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Former commissioner says Selig wants 'total
victory' and is missing his chance to avert strike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Watching baseball's latest labor conflagration from the safe haven of
his Connecticut home, former commissioner Fay Vincent said Thursday
he suspects that Commissioner Bud Selig is so committed to "total
victory" that he will miss the opportunity that the players union has
provided to avoid another work stoppage.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't get back 25 years of mistakes all at once," Vincent
said, adding that he tried to approach labor relations during his own
tenure as an "incrementalist."</LD>
<LD>   "You go at it hoping to get 4% or 5% each time and over time
making progress," he said. "Meantime, you have to build a partnership
and trust [with the union]. That makes so much sense, but nobody has
ever been able to persuade Bud to do it.</LD>
<TE>   "I mean, he's been running baseball labor for 25 years and the
result is that you have these confrontations every five years,
destroying all of the good will you've established, and now you
finally have fans throwing up their hands and saying 'that's enough.'
"</TE>
<TE>   In his brief tenure as commissioner, Vincent approached the union
as a conciliator only to be forced from office on Sept. 7, 1992, by a
coalition of hardline owners led by Selig, of whom Vincent said, "I
badly underestimated him."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Vincent said, Selig has a chance to wrap up a compromise deal
"he would be roundly applauded for except by the seven or eight hawks
he works for."</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to a militant group that is said to be pressuring
Selig to hold firm and only agree to a deal that will restrict salary
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent, however, said that the union has offered much more "than
anyone would have predicted, but instead of taking a third or half of
the loaf, my guess is that Bud will miss the opportunity to make the
best deal he can before Aug. 30 and declare victory."</TE>
<TE>   Reached Thursday, Selig said that if he was pursuing total
capitulation by a union that seldom capitulates, he would be seeking
more revenue sharing and a salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of my people want a lot more than what we're negotiating
for," he said. "Some of them have spoken out on that recently. The
inherent nature of our proposals are only aimed at improving
competitive balance.</TE>
<TE>   "As [Atlanta President] Stan Kasten said recently, we're not
asking for half as much as two other leagues [the NBA and NFL] have
already."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but will Selig, boasting broader power and authority than
any previous commissioner, take what's on the table if there is no
agreement before the Aug. 30 strike date?</TE>
<TE>   "I take the cynical view," Vincent said. "You figure out what
makes the most sense, what is in baseball's best interest, what the
most people would do, then you predict the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   "If your objective is total victory, it's hopeless."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, said Vincent, he doesn't have to deal with any of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul Beeston [baseball's former chief operating officer] and I
have been sent to Siberia," he said, "and it isn't at all bad."</TE>

<HD>Another Plea in Williams Case</HD>
<DH>Jurisprudence: Second man admits tampering with evidence
and will testify against the former NBA center.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FLEMINGTON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>A second man pleaded guilty Thursday to charges he helped cover up
Jayson Williams' role in the shooting death of a limousine driver and
will testify against the former NBA star.</LD>
<LD>   John W. Gordnick told the judge he took the clothes Williams was
wearing when the driver was shot, hid them in a car and didn't turn
them over to authorities for several weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "I guess I just saw Jayson in a difficult situation. I wasn't
thinking straight and I, I reacted," Gordnick said.</LD>
<TE>   He pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence, and prosecutors will
recommend probation. He could have faced nearly 12 years in prison if
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, the former All-Star forward for the New Jersey Nets, has
pleaded innocent to first-degree manslaughter and charges he tampered
with witnesses and evidence in the driver's Feb. 14 shooting at his
mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors accuse Williams of recklessly handling the 12-gauge
shotgun that fired and hit Costas Christofi in the chest, then trying
to make it look as if the driver fired the gun.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on all charges, Williams could face nearly 45 years
in prison. He remains free on $270,000 bail. A status hearing was
scheduled for early September.</TE>
<TE>   "John Gordnick's plea bargain with the prosecution in no way
affects our readiness for trial," said Williams' spokeswoman, Judy
Smith. "A tragic accident has occurred and Mr. Williams is prepared
to present the true facts to a jury of his peers."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' other co-defendant also has agreed to testify against
him. Kent Culuko pleaded guilty in April to tampering with evidence
and witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Culuko is a former NBA player who was waived by the Nets in 1997.
Gordnick helps coach summer basketball camps operated by Culuko.</TE>
<TE>   Christofi, 55, was invited inside Williams' mansion after picking
up Williams' friends at a Harlem Globetrotters' game in Bethlehem,
Pa., prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Gordnick told the judge he walked into the room after the shooting
and saw Williams standing naked, holding his clothes. At Williams'
request, Gordnick said, he took them and hid them under the seat in
his car, knowing they would be part of an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "He ran toward me, and he had clothes in his arms," Gordnick said.
"I remember him saying something to the effect of, 'Here J.G., here
J.G.!' "</TE>
<TE>   Williams, Gordnick and Culuko also allegedly tried to replace
Williams' fingerprints on the shotgun with the victim's and persuade
other guests at the mansion to say Christofi was upstairs alone at
the time of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-10 Williams was among the NBA's best rebounders when
leg injuries ended his career. The center retired in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, Williams was suspended from his job as an NBA
analyst for NBC.</TE>

<HD>Monumental Honor for Slain Irish Leader</HD>
<DH>History: Thousands turn out for the unveiling of Michael
Collins' statue 80 years after his death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLONAKILTY, Ireland</DL>
<LD>Eighty years after former comrades assassinated Michael Collins, the
pragmatic rebel mastermind of Ireland's fight for independence was
honored Thursday with his first public statue--a measure of how long
it has taken for the wounds of civil war to heal.</LD>
<LD>   Senior figures from Ireland's two major parties, drawn from
opposite sides of that brutal 1922-23 conflict, joined more than
5,000 visitors and actor Liam Neeson to unveil a bronze likeness of
Collins in Clonakilty, his home village on the south coast of County
Cork.</LD>
<LD>   "In Collins' day, the buck always seemed to stop with him. He is
my hero. He still inspires me," said the Northern Ireland-born actor,
who portrayed the Irish Republican Army commander in the 1996 film
"Michael Collins."</LD>
<TE>   Historians and politicians increasingly laud Collins, who was
killed Aug. 22, 1922, in a roadside ambush. Just 31 but already a
general, he commanded the army of the fledgling Irish Free State.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the George Washington of Ireland," said Tom Morrissey, a
retired American policeman who led U.S. fund-raising efforts for the
12-foot, $100,000 Clonakilty monument. "It's crazy that he's never
had a proper statue before."</TE>
<TE>   All sides agree Collins helped organize the Irish Republican Army
into an effective guerrilla force in the 1919-21 war of independence
against Britain. He became an expert intelligence gatherer, directing
a wave of assassinations of senior police agents in Dublin.</TE>
<TE>   But Collins was branded a traitor by hard-line colleagues when he
accepted a 1921 treaty with Britain that fell short of independence
but laid foundations for the modern Irish state. Collins acknowledged
that by agreeing, "I may have signed my own death warrant."</TE>

<HD>Yugoslavia Ships 6,000 Nuclear Reactor Rods</HD>
<DH>Security: Under heavy guard, material is moved through
capital for flight to Russia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia</DL>
<LD>Serbian police sealed off nearly half of the capital early Thursday
while 6,000 unused nuclear reactor fuel rods were taken to the
airport for shipment to Russia.</LD>
<LD>   Helicopters hovered over the city as heavily armed police officers
guarded the 22-mile route to the airport from the Vinca Institute of
Nuclear Sciences, just outside Belgrade, the Yugoslav and Serbian
capital.</LD>
<LD>   The heavy security was aimed at preventing a terrorist attack,
said Dragan Domazet, minister of technology, science and development
for Serbia, the larger of Yugoslavia's two republics.</LD>
<TE>   Domazet said the rods, each about 4 inches long and 1 inch in
diameter, could be used to help develop nuclear weapons. The Soviet
Union gave the fuel rods to the Vinca institute in 1976 for research
work.</TE>
<TE>   The Serbian government in recent years has instituted a program to
reduce environmental hazards, including nuclear materials.</TE>
<TE>   Domazet said that the removal of nuclear fuel was organized with
the help of international groups and the U.S. government, which
donated $10 million to decommission Vinca.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing the rods to the airport took about six hours, a police
officer said.</TE>
<TE>   The Vinca nuclear reactor was developed upon the institute's
founding in 1948 as a part of the former Yugoslav federation's
nuclear program. The reactor was closed and partly decommissioned in
the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Today the Vinca institute is devoted to a wide variety of
scientific research.</TE>

<HD>China Redefines Extra Offspring as Burden Rather Than
Offense</HD>
<DH>Population: New law calls for parents of more than one
child to pay a 'fee,' not a fine.</DH>

<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>China is revising its notorious one-child policy to remove the stigma
it had attached to people who desire a larger family.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of fines, families with unauthorized births will pay a
"social compensation fee" to reflect the collective cost rather than
the individual fault of bearing additional children.</LD>
<LD>   The change might seem semantic, but experts say it marks a
significant step toward a kinder and gentler family-planning
policy--and an acknowledgment of transformations in Chinese society.</LD>
<TE>   "The name change could ease tensions between officials and parents
who want more children," said Shen Anan, a demographer at the
Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. "It could also slow down the
pace of population control and improve China's image in the world."</TE>
<TE>   The one-child policy, which was begun in the early 1980s, has been
widely criticized as a draconian exercise in social engineering. Much
of the West has heard horror stories of infanticide and forced
sterilization in the world's most populous country.</TE>
<TE>   In practice, however, the policy--which Chinese officials view as
a weapon of last resort against a population time bomb--has always
been unevenly implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Even official figures show that as many as 80% of Chinese children
under 14 have siblings.</TE>
<TE>   The new law, which goes into effect next month, is more evidence
that the unpopular approach might be nearing an end.</TE>
<TE>   "The one-child policy was a reaction to the extreme population
pressures of the time," said Shen. "In another 15 years or so, the
birth control policy as we know it will no longer exist."</TE>
<TE>   For ordinary people, the change also represents a move toward the
rule of law. Despite its prominence in daily life, the one-child
policy actually is being legislated for the first time. In the past,
people obeyed it simply because the government told them to.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sea change in how people see things," said Siri Tellier,
the Beijing-based China representative for the United Nations
Population Fund. "They now know they have rights."</TE>
<TE>   Two decades of breakneck economic changes and a blossoming of
personal freedoms have made the Chinese people much harder to
control.</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the days of a cradle-to-grave welfare system in which the
state could tell its citizens where to work, who to marry and when to
procreate. Now that people must fend for themselves in a competitive
market economy, much of that leverage is gone.</TE>
<TE>   Increased wealth and better education have even resulted in a
negative population growth in some parts of the country. Large cities
such as Shanghai now worry about a huge population of elderly who
have fewer children to care for them.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean Beijing can afford to give up the fight against
overpopulation. Though the government says it met the goal of
containing growth to a population of 1.3 billion at the beginning of
this century, the true population figure remains elusive. Millions of
migrant workers crisscross the land and produce unauthorized children
who don't get counted in the census.</TE>
<TE>   The existing policy significantly altered birthrates in the cities
but barely made a dent in the countryside, where the vast majority of
Chinese live.</TE>
<TE>   Although penalties ranging from stiff fines to confiscation of
land to forced abortions were rampant in the 1980s and early '90s, it
has become much easier in recent years to parent extra children
through loopholes and lax enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Rural families and ethnic minorities can legitimately have more
than one child, especially if the first child is a girl. Some have
many more than two in the traditional quest for a male heir, either
by paying fines or becoming migrants.</TE>
<TE>   City dwellers also can have a second child if both parents were
only children.</TE>
<TE>   Others, sporting newfound wealth, gladly pay the fines. Some local
officials have encouraged unplanned births to collect more fees.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new law, local officials will no longer be able to
pocket those fees and must turn the money over to the central
government.</TE>
<TE>   This is believed to be a tremendous disincentive for overzealous
cadres.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very happy with the policy that limits the power of
family-planning workers," said Tellier, of the U.N. Population Fund,
whose agency helps the Chinese experiment with alternatives to rigid
birth quotas.</TE>
<TE>   But forced abortions and sterilization haven't gone away. That's
why the Bush administration recently pulled U.S. funding for the
agency for working with Chinese family-planning officials.</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, credit the agency with helping the Chinese
embrace a more voluntary form of birth control, which optimists
believe is the shape of things to come.</TE>
<TE>   "If they realized that population growth will not increase in a
scary manner even with programs that respect individual rights," said
Tellier, "then they will surely accept it."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has quietly imposed sanctions on a North
Korean company for selling Scud missile parts to Yemen, State
Department officials said Thursday night.</LD>
<LD>   The administration decided on the penalties against Changgwang
Sinyong Corp. last Friday, an official said on condition of
anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   The official said the U.S. government imposed the sanctions
because of the company's sale of missile components, but would not
say which country bought them. A second official named Yemen as the
purchaser.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. authorities asked Yemen why it bought the parts, and
officials in that country apologized, promised not to do so again and
pledged to help in other areas, one official said.</TE>
<TE>   No penalties are planned against Yemen, which is an ally in the
U.S.-led war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Under the sanctions, Changgwang Sinyong will be barred for two
years from obtaining new individual export licenses through the U.S.
Commerce or State departments for any controlled missile technology
items.</TE>
<TE>   The sanctions will have little practical effect, one official
said, because there is so little commerce between the United States
and North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2000, 17 American sailors were killed in an attack on
the destroyer Cole during a refueling stop in Yemen. The blast was
blamed on Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Talk Spins Out of Control</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOYLE McMANUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush and his aides are scrambling to cool what they deride
as a "frenzy" over the prospect of war with Iraq, with signals that
military action, if it comes, may be a long way off.</LD>
<LD>   "The president hasn't committed to military action yet," a White
House official said Thursday. "We don't have a plan yet. The debate
presumes that we're ready to launch coordinated action against Iraq,
but we're not."</LD>
<LD>   "We would be the first to say that we need to talk more about
this," another official said. "There will be more consultation and
more debate before any action is taken."</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Bush dismissed "this kind of intense speculation"
over his intentions on Iraq, and Secretary of Defense Donald H.
Rumsfeld called it "a frenzy."</TE>
<TE>   But their efforts to calm the debate came only after months of
declarations that the Bush administration is committed to
overthrowing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and is willing to do so
by force if needed.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has frequently warned that Hussein will use chemical,
biological or nuclear weapons unless the United States acts first.</TE>
<TE>   "America must act against these terrible threats before they're
fully formed," Bush said last month. "We will use diplomacy when
possible, and force when necessary."</TE>
<TE>   But having made the threats, Bush appears to have lost control of
the debate that followed.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the White House's statements on Iraq have drawn
protests from U.S. allies, including Germany and Canada, and appeals
for caution from such foreign policy experts as former Secretary of
State Henry A. Kissinger and former National Security Advisor Brent
Scowcroft.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration has allowed its rhetoric to get ahead of
events," said a former aide to a Republican White House who asked not
to be identified. "They need to convey a sense that they have thought
this policy through carefully. They haven't done that yet."</TE>
<TE>   In their defense, Bush aides say they believed that strong
language was necessary to draw world attention to the threat they see
in Iraq, and to convince other countries that the United States is
serious about seeking regime change.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants to ... be associated with an effort that may be
difficult if it appears that the leader of that effort is uncertain,"
a senior official explained.</TE>
<TE>   But if people got the impression that the administration was close
to launching "preemptive action" against Iraq--a phrase the president
used in June--that was a misunderstanding, the officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they said, Bush will probably take time this fall to
settle on a plan of action against Iraq and to persuade Congress and
U.S. allies to support the effort.</TE>
<TE>   "The overall case for seeking a change in the regime has now been
made," one official said. "The next step is winning support for a
plan of action. That case hasn't been made because there's no plan
yet.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a democracy. You need to explain what you're going to
do," he added. "When the president decides what he wants to do, we'll
explain it fully, and nobody will be surprised."</TE>
<TE>   He refused to say how long the next stages might take. But he
emphasized that Bush has not yet decided how he plans to overthrow
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have said the president's options include stepped-up
diplomatic and economic pressure; covert intelligence operations; and
at least three different scenarios for military action, ranging from
an Afghanistan-style campaign using only 70,000 troops to a
full-scale invasion of more than 250,000.</TE>
<TE>   "He could decide to use more than one of those methods," the
official noted.</TE>
<TE>   Once Bush settles on a plan, he will seek public and allied
support, "and that will take time," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has not yet sought public backing from most U.S. allies
because he does not think he can get it without a plan in his hand,
the official added.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're dealing with reluctant allies who are opposed to
anything that strikes them as risky, they'll try to talk you out of
it or get you to delay," he said. "But if you go to them with a plan
and say, 'We've made up our minds, and are you with us or not?' it
changes the equation."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the official said, Bush has already consulted widely with
members of Congress and other governments, and will continue to do so
in the months to come.</TE>
<TE>   Among other meetings, he said, the president is scheduled to
attend a gathering of Pacific Rim leaders in Mexico in October and a
summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the Czech
Republic in November.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Bush is not likely to seek the approval of the
United Nations Security Council for his plans on Iraq, partly because
of fears that Russia or China would veto any resolution. Instead, the
United States may merely try to assemble an informal coalition in
support of whatever action it takes, they said.</TE>
<TE>   And, officials said, they expect a more extensive debate in
Congress as the time for action nears. Last month, when the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on the issue, the
administration declined to provide any officials to explain its
policy, saying it was too early.</TE>
<TE>   "The president believes it's constructive to have a national
discussion about Iraq," White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer
said Thursday. "There are important voices to be heard on all sides
... and the president will continue to listen to thoughtful cases
from all people. He thinks it's good for the country, it's good for
the world, it's good for Saddam."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Fleischer complained, the portrayal of the debate in the
news media had gone overboard, climaxing in headlines this week about
Rumsfeld's meeting with Bush at the president's ranch in Crawford,
Texas, that marveled that the session did not focus on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "The press yesterday and the day before yesterday reached an
absurd point of self-inflicted silliness," he said. "There have been
meetings about Iraq in the past. There will be meetings about Iraq in
the future. Yesterday's meeting was not about Iraq."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush arrives in California today to raise desperately
needed cash for gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr., a routine visit
that has turned into a political predicament for the White House.</LD>
<LD>   Bush advisors have cringed at the prospect of an appearance by the
president, who has professed zero tolerance for corporate wrongdoing,
alongside a candidate whose family investment firm faces a
$78-million judgment in a case involving alleged fraud.</LD>
<LD>   So even as the president proceeds with the trip--amid feelings
that he has little choice--the White House is working to contain any
political damage by steering clear of the corporate ethics issue and
limiting Bush's appearances with Simon.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats have been gleeful as Republicans squirm. Instead of
Simon "getting hard time," Bush "will raise him easy money," taunted
Bob Mulholland, political director of the California Democratic
Party.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Gov. Gray Davis will further accent the corporate
accountability issue today by announcing a series of steps aimed at
cracking down on business misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   National Republican strategists, already fretting over Simon's
candidacy, were blindsided last month when a civil jury in Los
Angeles returned the multimillion-dollar verdict against William E.
Simon &amp; Sons, the family's investment firm. The verdict, which Simon
attributes to misguided jurors, left Bush with an unhappy choice:
abandon the party standard-bearer in the nation's biggest state, or
appear alongside Simon at a time when Bush has tried to toughen his
image as a corporate fraud-buster.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, according to several people familiar with the
president's plans, it was decided that canceling the trip would exact
a greater price than coming to California--particularly on a Friday
in late August, when electioneering is hardly at the top of people's
minds.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a donor community, there's a conservative cadre they want
to keep happy, and they hurt themselves politically if they pull
out," said one Republican strategist who advised the White House on
the trip and asked not to be named. "They're going to try to do this
under the radar as best as possible."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Bush will appear without Simon at community forums in
Stockton and Santa Ana, the events likely to draw the most news
coverage, particularly outside California. Bush and Simon are to
appear together at a luncheon fund-raiser in Stockton and an evening
reception in Dana Point--where ticket prices have been slashed--with
coverage limited to a handful of reporters. A third and final Simon
fund-raiser, a private breakfast in a Westwood office tower, is
scheduled for Saturday morning, just before Bush leaves the state for
a campaign stop in New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   (A fourth Bush event, a private dinner Friday night in Dana Point,
will raise money for the California Republican Party and its
get-out-the-vote drive. The entire GOP ticket has been invited.)</TE>
<TE>   To avoid potential embarrassment on his California swing, the
president will avoid the issue of corporate responsibility, according
to a second strategist who helped plan Bush's trip.</TE>
<TE>   More to the point, "You will not get the president standing up and
declaring Simon's innocence," this Republican strategist said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the Simon court case as he inspected a forest fire in
Oregon on Thursday, Bush said only that Simon had expressed
confidence that the judgment against his family firm ultimately would
be overturned. "Bill Simon assures us that when the courts look at
this case, he'll be innocent, and I take the man for his word," Bush
said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Bush's political bind--and Democratic efforts to embarrass
the president by quoting his hard-line statements against corporate
fraud--Simon aides expressed delight over the president's visit. They
said there was no evidence that the White House wished to distance
itself from the GOP nominee.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk to them daily," said Sal Russo, chief strategist for the
Simon campaign. "There's never been one expression whatsoever of any
hesitation at all. None. Zero."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's fund-raising flagged immediately after the fraud verdict,
but has lately picked up in advance of Bush's visit. The GOP nominee
hopes to collect between $3 million and $3.5 million from the
president's three stops. Earlier this year, Bush raised nearly $5
million for Simon during an April campaign swing, making the
president the candidate's single-biggest fund-raising asset, apart
from Simon's substantial family wealth.</TE>
<TE>   In all, after Saturday, Bush will have made five fund-raising
appearances for Simon, a sign, according to Russo, of his commitment
to Simon's candidacy. "I don't know if they've even done five for
Jeb," said Russo, a reference to the president's brother, who is
seeking reelection as Florida governor.</TE>
<TE>   But strategists close to the White House said pointedly that, once
Bush leaves California on Saturday, he will have fulfilled his
commitment to Simon. "Unless Davis craters and polls show [the race]
even at the end of October," the president plans no return visits,
nor will he appear in any of Simon's advertising, one GOP strategist
said.</TE>
<TE>   During a campaign stop Thursday in East Los Angeles, where he
appeared alongside former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Simon
would not say whether his campaign had alerted the White House to his
legal difficulties before the fraud verdict came down late last
month. "We've been in constant touch with them every day," was all
Simon would say.</TE>
<TE>   He also cast a positive light on the cut in ticket prices for
tonight's Orange County event, where prices have been slashed from
$1,000 a head to as little as $250.</TE>
<TE>   "We have volunteers who have been very supportive and worked very
hard and could not afford to attend the event" at Dana Point's swank
St. Regis Hotel, Simon said. "We want to send the word out far and
wide that we are a party that is going to be supportive."</TE>
<TE>   For all the tumult, Bush had little choice but to visit California
this week, Republican observers said. For one thing, he had given his
word. But there were strong political incentives, as well.</TE>
<TE>   Many party conservatives remain touchy about Bush's perceived
favoritism toward former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who was
coaxed into the governor's race partly at the urging of the White
House. Riordan lost badly to the more conservative Simon in the March
GOP primary, thanks in good part to a multimillion-dollar
anti-Riordan advertising blitz by the Davis camp.</TE>
<TE>   "To abandon Simon would be seen as a betrayal by the right," said
Marshall Wittmann, a political analyst with the conservative Hudson
Institute, a policy think tank. "Nor can the White House afford to
simply write off the largest, most populous state in the country."</TE>
<TE>   California has long been a vexing place for Bush, as it was for
his father during the elder Bush's doomed 1992 reelection effort. The
junior Bush outspent Vice President Al Gore in 2000 by roughly $20
million and still lost California by 1.3 million votes, a margin that
more than accounted for Bush's trailing in the popular vote
nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Once he took office, Bush waited 3 1/2 months to pay his first
visit. Today's stop will be his fifth trip to California as
president. On previous visits, Bush has courted swing voters in
places like the Inland Empire, or sought to broaden his appeal by
appearing in Democratic strongholds such as South-Central Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   On this trip, Bush will do a bit of both, with stops in the
Central Valley, home to many political independents, and an
appearance with Latino supporters in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   While most political handicappers view heavily Democratic
California as an uphill fight for Bush in 2004--a view shared at the
White House--waging a competitive campaign here could improve his
reelection prospects by diverting time and attention that the
eventual Democratic nominee would rather spend elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if he loses California, if he does so by a narrower margin
than last time, that helps him in the popular vote nationally," said
Jack Pitney, a government professor at Claremont McKenna College and
former national Republican Party operative. "I'm sure that's a
consideration on the minds of Bush strategists."</TE>

<HD>Coonskin Cap Clings to 'Crockett'</HD>
<DH>Fess Parker, who rocketed to fame as TV's frontiersman, has
found the label hard to escape, even with success in very different
ventures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOS OLIVOS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Heavy hangs the coonskin cap.</LD>
<LD>   It's been almost 50 years since Fess Parker donned the fuzzy
headgear that launched the first blockbuster cultural phenomenon of
the baby boom generation.</LD>
<LD>   At its peak, the frenzy started by Parker's Davy Crockett
character helped sell 5,000 coonskin caps a day, causing the price of
raccoon fur to jump from 25 cents a pound to $8. Before it was over,
Crockettmania accounted for $300 million in sales of everything from
Davy wristwatches to lunch boxes.</LD>
<TE>   "I will immodestly tell you it was bigger than anything, ever,
including The Beatles and Elvis," Parker says in a rumbly Texas drawl
as he cuts into a stack of hot cakes. Dressed in a work shirt and
jeans, he eats breakfast frequently these days at his wine country
inn north of Santa Barbara, where he pursues his second career as a
developer, hotelier and vintner.</TE>
<TE>   His wines earn far better reviews than his acting ever did. His
patronage is sought by politicians. His generosity is well-known: He
donated land for a park in Santa Barbara and he's at the front of
every fund-raiser's Rolodex in the Central Coast.</TE>
<TE>   But, try as he might, Parker never managed to escape the shadow of
the coonskin cap. At first, it looked as if it would be the end of
him. The Crockett craze lasted only a year, but he was so typecast by
his boss, Walt Disney, that he couldn't get other acting jobs. When
he finally did, it was to play another guy in a coonskin cap, Daniel
Boone.</TE>
<TE>   The fans were unyielding. They wanted their hero to stay just as
he was when he came into their living rooms during evenings in
1954--unblemished, accessible, upstanding. That was yet another
burden--trying to live up to a Hollywood caricature.</TE>
<TE>   Now 78 and looking forward to what might be his most ambitious
project--a top-drawer resort hotel on the beach in Santa
Barbara--Parker says he is at peace with his backwoods doppelganger.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't always a comfortable fit," he says of the cap. But the
passage of time has helped him rediscover "what a fabulous streak of
luck I had."</TE>
<TE>   A couple years ago, he made an important connection. "I've learned
a thing or two from Davy Crockett," he said at the time. "I don't
give up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The first thing you notice about the man who mangled the English
language on screen with phrases like "perzactly" and "discombobulated
flutterbation" is his delicate, almost courtly manner. He calls
visitors Mr. So-and-so, not by their first names. His staff--he
employs about 500 people--refers to him as Mr. Parker, never Fess.
And he becomes noticeably uncomfortable when asked how much money he
has, joking that if "all the money I owed was income, I'd be well
off."</TE>
<TE>   The only ostentatious bauble he shows off is a gleaming,
air-conditioned Humvee, which he fires up after breakfast for a tour
of his ranch in the yellow cattail canyons of the Santa Ynez Valley.
The Humvee, which he calls a "Lincoln on steroids," was a gift from
his wife of 42 years and the rest of his family on his 75th birthday.
The party was held at a lake on the ranch, next to a hand-built
re-creation of the Alamo, the Texas fort where Davy Crockett and the
rest of a small band made its last stand against the Mexican army.</TE>
<TE>   About half of his 3,000 acres is in wine grapes. Parker's other
holdings include a partnership with Hilton in the Fess Parker
Doubletree Inn on the beach in Santa Barbara, the 21-room Wine
Country Inn in Los Olivos and the winery in Foxen Canyon. He also has
a home in Montecito, not far from Oprah Winfrey's.</TE>
<TE>   A man for whom doing the right thing in just the right way matters
a lot, he starts to park the Humvee at the rear of the winery, then
backs out so that he can park in front. He says that offers the most
scenic approach.</TE>
<TE>   This fussiness, besides being very un-Crockett-like, is an object
of mirth for family members who chide him for being too concerned
with appearances. But he's right. The view of the winery from the
front is a dramatic one. Set back on what must be the largest and
greenest lawn in this dry valley, the gabled building has a big, cool
front porch. The whole thing resembles the Big House on a Texas ranch
and a visitor half expects a gang of folks to come piling onto the
porch in welcome. Instead, as Parker climbs up the steps, Shirley
Borrow squeals, "I'll just die."</TE>
<TE>   The 67-year-old Michigan tourist is almost beside herself at
actually meeting him. Parker smiles and shakes hands. This is the
part of the business that comes easily to him. Parker has no idea how
many hands he has shaken in his lifetime, though he knows he shook
3,000 a day during the height of Crockettmania. "My hands got really
sore," he says. "Housewives [who squeezed hard] hurt the most."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The real Davy Crockett was hardly Disney material. He was not born
on a mountaintop and, needless to say, he did not kill a bear at 3,
though at 41 he was still agile enough to dispatch 105 bears in six
months. The real Davy was a rough-edged frontiersman who neglected
his wives, drank with gusto and feuded with superiors.</TE>
<TE>   While Disney's vision of Davy Crockett was of a man who never took
or gave offense thoughtlessly, the real Davy reacted this way when he
lost an 1834 congressional race to a peg-legged opponent: "Since you
have chosen to elect a man with a timber toe to succeed me," he
thundered, "you may all go to hell, and I will go to Texas."</TE>
<TE>   Parker's early life, on the other hand, could have been drawn by
Walt himself. He grew up the only child of a Texas merchant and a
strong-willed mother. His father was "movie star" handsome, with coal
dark hair, and operated a feed store in San Angelo. Just as his son
would, the elder Fess had a way with people. "My dad would start down
the street to pay the gas bill and it would take him 30 minutes to
get there," Parker says.</TE>
<TE>   After a stint in the Navy in World War II, Fess Parker headed for
Hollywood and USC, where he took a drama class from William DeMille,
the older brother of director Cecil B. DeMille. After one scene, he
asked the professor how to break into pictures. "I wouldn't have any
idea," DeMille said.</TE>
<TE>   Parker was undeterred. His break, though it hardly seemed so at
the time, came in a bit part in the 1953 science fiction movie
"Them," a nuclear-age picture about supersized ants. For some reason,
Walt Disney saw the picture. The rest, as they say, is in the bio.
The first of three one-hour telefilms, called "Davy Crockett Indian
Fighter," had its premiere on Dec. 15, 1954. By the time the second
show aired a few weeks later, the country was crazed for Crockett.</TE>
<TE>   Crockett collectibles flew off department store shelves. Disney
sent Parker on a tour of 42 cities and 13 countries. "In one place,
the crowd pushed in a plate-glass window," Parker says. Another time,
"I ran for the car with the crowd chasing me. A girl jumped in and a
guard hit her and shoved her out. It was a dangerous time."</TE>
<TE>   Then, as quickly as it began, the craze ended.</TE>
<TE>   But its seeds had burrowed deeply into the brains of all those
coonskin cap-wearing children. Men in business suits still approach
him with tears in their eyes to say what Davy meant to them, Parker
says.</TE>
<TE>   Leo Braudy, a USC professor who studies popular culture, said the
affection for Crockett grew out of a hunger for a return to times
when heroes were believed to walk the land and protect the innocent.
A world war had just killed millions and the Communist bloc had
acquired nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, American society seemed to be
dominated by organization men in gray flannel suits who either
kowtowed to the boss or developed drinking problems and cheated on
their wives.</TE>
<TE>   If Davy Crockett shaped viewers, the viewers did the same for Fess
Parker. "I had hoped to have an opportunity to have a few more
challenges in the film business," he says. But after Crockettmania,
few people had the appetite to see the rugged-looking actor dressed
in a suit and tie and bouncing around the bedroom with Doris Day or
warbling with Debbie Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   Director John Ford told Disney he wanted Parker for a leading role
in the classic John Wayne vehicle "The Searchers." A modern western
filled with plot twists worthy of Tennessee Williams, the role could
have given Parker a chance to show his acting chops. But Disney said
no, driving a wedge between him and Parker that lasted for years. Now
Parker has mellowed and recognizes that, without Disney, he wouldn't
have had a career in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from putting on the buckskin a few years later to play
Daniel Boone on television, Parker saw his career packed away along
with millions of castoff coonskin caps.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even before leaving Hollywood, Parker showed the business acumen
that would make him successful. He demanded a 10% cut of Crockett
merchandise sales, though he got only "a couple hundred thousand"
because the rights got tangled up in litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the sum helped give him a start in his next career, real
estate. He bought 30 acres on the beach in Santa Barbara and another
350 in what is now Silicon Valley. He later sold land to the Marriott
hotel chain, which built a theme park. He made a chunk on that deal
but says he "probably left hundreds of millions of dollars on the
table" by not keeping the land longer.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mind, because I wouldn't have had the adventures I had,"
he says. "When I say I don't mind, I'm lying."</TE>
<TE>   He opened the winery 12 years ago with his son, Eli, now the
winemaker, and his daughter, Ashley. Since their goal was to produce
a world-class wine, his family argued against using the Fess Parker
name, which carried inevitable associations with skillet-lickin' and
moonshine.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't want the crassness [of Hollywood] entering the temple
of wine," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The label was simply Parker. The wines were good, but the Parkers
found it difficult to get attention for their label in the crowded
wine industry. Fess Parker finally called on old Davy Crockett for
help, even putting an image of a coonskin cap on the new Fess Parker
label.</TE>
<TE>   That solved one problem, but created another. As the family had
feared, welcoming Davy in from the cold guaranteed they would not be
taken seriously in the wine community.</TE>
<TE>   "What would an old TV actor know about fine wine?" asked a San
Francisco critic, who didn't stop at the winery when he toured Santa
Barbara's wine country several years ago. Parker ordered his staff to
send the man a couple of his best bottles, with a plea to give them a
try.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to report," the man wrote in a review of the wine, "it
goes well with crow."</TE>
<TE>   Parker's wines have won 30 medals in national competition. They
sell for as much as $45 a bottle in the winery, and much more in
restaurants. A noted wine critic, Robert Parker, no relation, praised
them as "some of the finest wines and wine values emerging from the
Santa Barbara region."</TE>
<TE>   Fess Parker's business success, like his earlier success in
Hollywood, was the result of a brash belief in self combined with an
unyielding persistence disguised by aw-shucks mannerisms. According
to Parker, the combination is very Texan</TE>
<TE>   Parker's touch is not always golden. The Los Olivos inn is having
a tougher time than the winery.</TE>
<TE>   He also suffered a setback three years ago when he tried to bypass
local planners, with whom he often feuded, and asked the voters to
let him construct a bigger hotel than the city wanted.</TE>
<TE>   He spent more than $600,000 to put the initiative on the ballot,
making it the most expensive city election in Santa Barbara history.
The battle briefly tarnished Parker's reputation. Opponents suggested
that he was being high-handed. Mischief-makers went so far as to try
to sabotage Parker's petition drive by signing names like "Mike
Fink," Davy Crockett's arch-enemy in the riverboat adventure. In the
end, Parker's hotel lost at the polls.</TE>
<TE>   After five decades of coming to grips with his complicated
relationship with Davy Crockett, Parker knew what he had to do next.
The hotel fight would not be his Alamo. He adapted to the local rules
and is now lining up financing for a 150-room beachfront hotel that
is to compete with the Bacara and Biltmore resorts.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean he doesn't still carry scars from his battles.
He still grumbles about what he considers the anti-business elitism
of his neighbors. There's an attitude in Santa Barbara, he says,
"that if you live here, you have achieved a higher state." Parker
doesn't see himself fitting in with that. He's more of an adventurer
in which the frontier is an untilled idea.</TE>
<TE>   To live up to the Disney legend required a high standard of
behavior, but Parker insists the responsibility of playing Davy made
Fess a better man. He still puts in a full workday, sometimes as long
as 12 hours. His daughter calls him "the shark," and not because of
his bite. She said he's afraid that if "he stops swimming, the
party's over."</TE>
<TE>   She also contends the size of her father's fortune has been
overestimated. "A lot of people think he's rolling in it," she says.
She fields 10 requests for donations every day.</TE>
<TE>   But if things work out, the family will emerge as wealthy as
everyone assumes it already is. "We are on the cusp of being very
profitable," she says.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Opera's 'War and Peace' Casualty of Donor Discord</HD>
<DH>Arts: A request for $600,000 more from Kirov showpiece's
biggest donor is turned down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Opera, a company whose international profile has been
raised since the appointment of Placido Domingo as artistic director,
has abruptly canceled the most ambitious production of its coming
season because of a financial disagreement with its biggest donor.</LD>
<LD>   "War and Peace," a $3-million production featuring the forces of
the acclaimed Kirov Opera, was supposed to open Oct. 23 at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. High-tech investment billionaire Alberto
Vilar, acknowledged as the leading donor for opera worldwide, had
pledged $1 million to the production, which he also supported at its
Kirov premiere and subsequent productions in London and New York.</LD>
<LD>   But the budget for the local engagement grew by $600,000--the cost
of adapting the massive production to the Pavilion stage. When Vilar
was asked to supply the extra funds and also to move up the payment
on his $1-million pledge, he declined both requests.</LD>
<TE>   More than an embarrassing public relations problem, the move
signals that Domingo's ambitions for the company--whose budget has
grown by $10 million since the globe-hopping tenor took the
reins--may not yet be matched by its financial strength.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Thursday, Edgar Baitzel, L.A. Opera's director of
artistic operations, acknowledged that the need to cancel "War and
Peace" had as much to do with growing pains at the company as it did
with Vilar's refusal to pay extra--or to pony up in advance.</TE>
<TE>   "War and Peace" will be replaced by another Kirov production,
Shostakovich's "Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk," but the Prokofiev work had
been highly anticipated after its well-received run at the
Metropolitan Opera earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking by phone from Salzburg, Austria, Vilar said he had
already spent a total of $4 million on "War and Peace," "which is
about as much as anybody wants to put into any opera."</TE>
<TE>   Vilar's agreement with L.A. Opera was to pay half of the $1
million on the opening date, and the rest a year later--an
arrangement Vilar says is standard for all opera company productions
he underwrites worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "Every house is treated the same," Vilar said. "I have already
spent a lot of money on this opera, and then all of a sudden, I heard
about this two weeks ago--they needed all this money up front."</TE>
<TE>   Vilar said he has no plans to change his payment arrangement with
Los Angeles Opera in the future because, if he does, "somebody else
will call me up and say: 'You made an exception for L.A.' "</TE>
<TE>   "When Alberto told us three weeks ago that we could not expect the
pledged money until the end of this calendar year, we of course
understood," Domingo said in a prepared statement. "On the other
hand, we were in no position to immediately lay out this large sum of
money in advance of the Kirov's visit."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Vilar promised $10 million to L.A. Opera for new
productions--the largest single donation in the opera's history. The
$1 million for "War and Peace" was to have been part of that
long-term gift.</TE>
<TE>   Both opera executives and Vilar insist that L.A. Opera's decision
to pull the plug on "War and Peace" has nothing to do with Vilar's
ability to pay the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Since late last year, Vilar has been dogged by rumors that he is
not making good on his pledges to the arts, even though the
organizations involved report that he has honored all of his
contractual obligations. The rumors were fueled by the fact that
Vilar's privately held company, Amerindo Investments Inc., a
$5.5-billion company at the beginning of 2000, saw its assets fall to
$1.6 billion by the end of last year. Although no figures are
available for 2002, Vilar has confirmed that recent stock market
downturns have continued to affect his company.</TE>
<TE>   This year has also been marked by a spate of bad health for Vilar.
He underwent a series of back surgeries and an emergency operation in
late November for a perforated gall bladder.</TE>
<TE>   In a Times interview last month, Vilar said that health problems
had caused him to "miss a few payments" to organizations to which he
donates funds. He added that financial problems at Amerindo had led
him to delay payments in some cases, an option that is written into
some of his agreements. But he but maintained that he has never
failed to deliver a donation on the agreed-upon schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Both Vilar and opera company leaders insist Vilar's decision does
not represent a rift in the relationship between L.A. Opera and the
New York money manager. The company confirms that Vilar, an L.A.
Opera board member and close friend of Domingo's, has met all of his
financial obligations to date.</TE>
<TE>   "We trust Alberto," Baitzel said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many major opera companies around the country, Los Angeles
Opera has virtually no endowment to cover unexpected costs or funding
delays, Baitzel said. And since Domingo took over the company in July
2000, its budget and ambitions have been expanding. In the 2001-2002
season, the first to be programmed by Domingo, the company's annual
budget grew from about $20 million to about $30 million, Baitzel
said.</TE>
<TE>   With the Los Angeles Philharmonic leaving the Pavilion next year
for the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the opera company hopes, by 2008,
to dramatically increase its schedule of productions and performances
and double its current budget.</TE>
<TE>   As it was for Vilar, 2001 was a rocky year for L.A. Opera. The
company struggled with administrative money problems, and blamed
Sept. 11 for disappointing ticket sales for the first two operas of
the 2001-2002 season, "Queen of Spades" and "Lohengrin," which both
opened in September.</TE>
<TE>   Also in September, Ian White-Thomson, the opera's executive
director and Domingo's co-equal, abruptly resigned, calling the job
"more pain than fun." Since November, White-Thomson's role has been
filled by two people: Baitzel, hired originally as Domingo's right
hand for programming and casting, and the company's then-director of
development, Elizabeth Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Baitzel said that the company is currently operating slightly in
the black--it ended the 2001-2002 season with a $150,000 surplus--but
added that the delayed-payment structure of its arrangement with
Vilar, which was struck under White-Thomson's leadership, will remain
problematic as long as the company is operating without a significant
endowment.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays, if we were to be offered such a pledge, we would insist
on a different structure," Baitzel said. Added Kennedy: "The cushion
isn't there, and we now understand better how that works."</TE>

<HD>Bush's Forest Safety Plan Kindles a Debate</HD>
<DH>Policy: He moves to ease the way for 'salvage logging' in
burned-over areas. Foes say it's a Trojan horse that opens the way
for loggers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Bush administration spells out an aggressive new fire
prevention strategy that would increase logging on public lands, the
U.S. Forest Service is preparing to auction off tens of thousands of
acres of marketable timber left standing in areas that have already
burned.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly half of that timber is in California's Sierra Nevada, where
30,000 acres in remote national forests are on the auction block this
year. The area is currently subject to strict limits on logging under
a plan developed during the Clinton administration to protect
old-growth trees and wildlife habitat.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, President Bush unveiled a proposal to make it easier
to remove trees and brush from fire-prone forests by making it more
difficult for opponents of the logging to use environmental laws to
delay or cancel the projects.</LD>
<TE>   Until now, the Forest Service has been required to consider
objections to plans such as those underway in the Sierra, but that
avenue of appeal would be restricted if Congress goes along with the
administration's proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of cutting trees in fire-damaged forests, a practice
known as salvage logging, say it is a good way for the Forest Service
to make money from wood that might otherwise rot, and use some of the
proceeds to replant and restore a thinner, more balanced forest where
fires will be less likely to burn out of control.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is something of commercial value that can be taken
without any environmental damage, then the proceeds can be reinvested
to restore the land," said Mark Rey, a former timber industry
lobbyist who, as the Bush administration undersecretary overseeing
the Forest Service, is putting salvage logging on a fast track.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have to rely exclusively on appropriated [tax] money, we'll
never get this thing done," Rey said.</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists regard salvage logging as the ecological
equivalent of mugging a fire victim. Salvage sales, they say, allow
timber companies to cut many trees that survive the flames in areas
far removed from towns or cities that could be threatened by
wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   And, foes of the practice contend, the contracts seldom require
timber companies to remove the very fuel that stokes wildfires--the
smaller trees and underbrush for which there is little or no market.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, conservationists say, burned-over forests are further
weakened by depriving them of their most fire-resistant trees as well
as large standing snags and fallen logs that shelter wildlife and
restore nutrients to the forest soil.</TE>
<TE>   "The Forest Service is using fire as a Trojan horse to get into
our forests," said Brian Vincent, an activist with the American Lands
Alliance in Nevada City who is battling the sales in the Sierra
Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   "They're using all kinds of explanations, like restoration,
salvage, thinning, fuel reduction. But when you take the ribbons and
bows off the box, it's still a timber sale."</TE>
<TE>   Although salvage logging received only passing mention in the Bush
plan, the administration already has been pushing such projects.
Among them is a 41,000-acre auction in Montana's Bitterroot National
Forest that was delayed by a federal judge in December because the
administration had sought to preempt a public-comment period.</TE>
<TE>   In California, if the salvage plans are carried out, at least 250
million board-feet of timber--enough to fill 50,000 log trucks--will
roll out of nearly every national forest in the Sierra, from Lassen
south to Sequoia, some of it cut from fragile watersheds and the high
elevation habitat of endangered spotted owls, northern goshawks and
Pacific fishers. The work is scheduled to begin this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Both the administration and its critics agree that many forests,
including some that have burned recently, are tinderboxes.</TE>
<TE>   And both sides blame decades-old policies of quickly suppressing
fires and allowing unchecked growth of younger trees and shrubs amid
wider-girthed old stands. One day, they hope, naturally occurring
fires that do not flare out of control will do nature's
housecleaning.</TE>
<TE>   Where they disagree is whether commercial logging has any role in
returning forests to a more healthy, fire-resistant state.</TE>
<TE>   The advocates say that without thinning, the burned-over forests
are more likely to burn again.</TE>
<TE>   "Left to its own devices, most of the forests will shrub over and
they'll stay that way for decades," said Mike Landram, regional
silviculturist for the U.S. Forest Service in California. "That's
fine if we want our forests to be shrub fields. But what we have said
is we favor old forests, and we don't have enough old forests.</TE>
<TE>   "If the delays continue, then the net result is the American
people get to have all these large stands of dead wood, and the
alternative way of getting it removed is your tax dollars," Landram
added.</TE>
<TE>   While salvage may help clear out dead wood, the vast majority of
the money it generates goes into planning further salvage sales,
according to congressional reports.</TE>
<TE>   For example, timber companies paid more than $2 million to salvage
18.5 million board-feed of timber from the 1999 Pendola fire in Tahoe
National Forest, according to the Forest Service. Of that sum,
$235,594 was spent on reforestation, and the Forest Service spent
nearly $300,000 of additional tax money to clear out smaller fuels
and replant new trees.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can use a timber sale to offset some of the cost, why
wouldn't we do that and save the taxpayers' money?" said Steve
Eubanks, forest supervisor for the Tahoe National Forest, where about
9,500 acres of timber are being considered for salvage logging this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would we not take advantage of trying to offset some of the
costs by doing that?"</TE>
<TE>   The timber industry, meanwhile, has grown increasingly impatient
at the prospect of having to fight to cut even the dead wood left
from a fire.</TE>
<TE>   "That whole concept of mugging a burn victim is ludicrous," said
Tom Nelson, director of forest policy for Sierra Pacific Industries,
a top participant in Forest Service salvage sales in California.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving dead logs behind just creates the conditions for the next
fire, Nelson said. "It's still out there, it's still fuel and the
brush is going to grow up under it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of spending $17 million to put out a fire that destroys
the habitat, why not spend the money to get in and thin it? You get
the products and you save the habitat. There's nothing pretty about
the aftermath of a wildfire."</TE>
<TE>   When you get down to the details, there's nothing pretty about the
way salvage logging is done, according to those fighting companies
like Sierra Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Hanson and Rachel Fazio of the John Muir Project, an
environmental group in Cedar Ridge, Calif., have marshaled biologists
and silviculturists to their cause. They have bypassed "No
Trespassing" signs in order to walk nearly every acre of the largest
proposed salvage projects to gather evidence to support their appeals
in three Sierra forests.</TE>
<TE>   The pair have infuriated forest rangers and logging companies, and
weathered accusations of environmental terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about [forest] health. It's not about protecting
communities. It's about profit," Hanson said during a recent session
of what he calls "ground-truthing" salvage plans. "Let's not sit
there and say it's about protecting communities that are five, 10, 20
miles away."</TE>
<TE>   In the woods, they point out massive trees marked for harvest that
have green crowns and barely a scorch mark at their base. Smaller
trees that were severely scorched are not marked for cutting. These
are the real culprits, Hanson and Fazio contend, that become the
kindling that fuels wildfire and carries it high into the crowns of
taller, older neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Even in severely burned areas, the two said they have found
evidence that spotted owls have returned to perch on dead trees,
which often provide nesting cavities and hiding places for other
species as well.</TE>
<TE>   On a backwoods logging road of the Tahoe National Forest, Hanson
and Fazio conducted their own inspection last month. Hanson knelt
before a freshly cut ponderosa pine felled as a potential hazard to
loggers in preparation for salvage operations. All around it were
supple green limbs hacked from the trunk. Hanson counted the rings,
losing track at 360. Fresh sap oozed from the pink cambium, the
membrane that transports a tree's nutrients just inside the bark,
which measured 5 inches thick in most places. The fire had burned its
way less than an inch into the bark.</TE>
<TE>   Hanson and Fazio made similar discoveries in three other Sierra
Forests they visited this summer.</TE>
<TE>   "This tree probably has seen at least half a dozen fires more
severe in its lifetime," Hanson said, pointing to a lightly scorched
red fir that predates the Declaration of Independence.</TE>
<TE>   The tree stands on a swath of the Lassen National Forest that will
be logged unless the Muir Project's appeal prevails.</TE>
<TE>   "We see this over and over again," Hanson added. "They just don't
think anyone will go out and check."</TE>
<TE>   Arguing tree-by-tree is crucial to both sides in the salvage
battle. If enough of a stand can be declared dead--more than
75%--loggers can cut much bigger trees. That rule applies to healthy
forests governed by the Sierra Nevada Framework, which was developed
during the Clinton era and covers 11.5 million acres of federal land
in the Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   When it was adopted last year, the framework plan was hailed as a
landmark attempt to promote habitat preservation in a dozen national
forests in the Sierra, particularly on 4.5 million acres of
old-growth forest that is ideal for endangered species like the
spotted owl.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of the battle over salvage logging in the Sierra
forests may turn on the meaning of the word "dead."</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service follows guidelines that declare a tree dead
based on a percentage of scorched needles in its crown, or if the
heat killed the cambium inside the bark.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say the guidelines allow some trees that have a
good chance of survival to be cut down. The Forest Service counters
that its predictions of which trees will die are 75% to 80% accurate,
and it is willing to live with that outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now there are more trees dying by far than what the Forest
Service is harvesting. There's plenty of dead trees out there. The
idea of running out of dead trees is ridiculous," said Nelson of
Sierra Pacific Industries.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, faced with arguments that many trees can survive even
severe scorching, Forest Service officials in the Tahoe National
Forest banned any salvage logging of trees that still show green
needles. Other forests, including the neighboring Eldorado, have not
followed suit. Each forest is free to tailor its own plan.</TE>
<TE>   Caught between forest antagonists, many Forest Service veterans
are anxious to find a middle ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, all this business is, is trying to make the kind of
forest we want to be there," said Landram, the Forest Service
silviculturist.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the middle of a great national debate over what the
forests are for."</TE>

<HD>Terror Probe Feuds Revealed by Secret Court</HD>
<DH>Law: In unprecedented disclosure, documents cite 75
misleading FBI warrant requests and an order curbing Ashcroft's bid
for more powers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a rare glimpse into the inner workings of one of the nation's most
secretive courts, documents released Thursday show that the federal
judges have voiced grave misgivings for years about the way the
Justice Department has handled classified wiretaps and searches in
terrorism cases.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI gave false information in more than 75 requests for
top-secret warrants brought in recent years before the special court,
which hears cases related to international terrorism and espionage
probes, the documents revealed. Known as the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act court, or FISA court, the panel reviews government
requests to spy on suspected foreign agents or terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   The special court was so concerned by Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's
behind-the-scenes efforts to broaden the FBI's spying abilities after
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that in May it secretly ordered
Ashcroft to scale back the regulations, the documents showed.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which had asked the
FISA court for access to the documents in July, released 55 pages to
the public. Committee members had expressed concern about what some
saw as a clampdown on information about the administration's
anti-terrorism campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, the documents said, former FBI Director Louis J.
Freeh falsely certified to the court that the target of the warrant
was not under criminal investigation, when in fact he was.</TE>
<TE>   In another instance, information was improperly shared between
criminal and intelligence investigations, despite claims by the FBI
that the firewall between the two had been honored, the court said.
And in another case, the FBI failed to disclose to the court that the
bureau had a "previous relationship" with the target of a warrant,
who had been interviewed by a criminal prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Justice Department appealed the order to scale
back the regulations, marking the first time the department has
initiated such an appeal of a ruling by the FISA court, which is so
secretive that it meets in a windowless chamber deep inside the
Justice Department, its operations heavily guarded.</TE>
<TE>   "We think [the judges] got it wrong," said a senior Justice
Department official, adding that the error-riddled warrant requests
occurred before Ashcroft took office and reforms have been instituted
to correct the problem.</TE>
<TE>   The department believes the court's May ruling unnecessarily
limits its ability to let prosecutors, FBI agents and intelligence
operatives share information in rooting out international terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "As a practical matter, their opinion limits our ability to engage
in the kind of coordination which we believe is both helpful and
necessary to our ability to protect national security," Justice
Department spokeswoman Barbara Comstock said.</TE>
<TE>   The tensions revealed in the newly released documents cut to the
heart of the ongoing debate about how far the FBI and the Justice
Department should be able to go in gathering intelligence in the
fight against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   . FISA court Presiding Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said that it
was the first time in its 23-year history that the entire court has
released an unclassified opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Judges Were Hesitant</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the judges indicated privately that they would not
release the documents to Congress because it could compromise the
separation of powers, according to a congressional official who asked
not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all pretty surprised to get them," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, hailed the release of the documents as a "ray of sunshine
for the judicial branch."</TE>
<TE>   Lashing out at "the administration's lack of cooperation," Leahy
said the documents provide "a window on the process that will help us
better understand how the laws are being implemented and how well
they are working."</TE>
<TE>   The FISA court has approved thousands of requests over the years
from the Justice Department allowing federal agents to conduct secret
searches and surveillance of people in the United States who are
suspected of having links to foreign agents or powers, often
involving terrorism or espionage.</TE>
<TE>   Requests are hardly ever denied, and the 11-member court noted in
an unclassified opinion included in Thursday's documents that such
warrants are "highly intrusive." In fact, the suspect is never
notified that he is the target of a search or a surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 attacks, the Justice Department came to rely
more heavily on the secret surveillances as a way of gathering
intelligence on terrorism suspects, and Ashcroft convinced Congress
to loosen the rules for such operations as part of the USA Patriot
Act.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence-gathering no longer has to be the primary purpose for
executing an intelligence warrant, but merely a purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft effectively reversed a trend that began in the mid-1990s,
when then-Atty. Gen. Janet Reno erected a high firewall between
intelligence-gathering investigations and criminal probes to guard
against undue invasion of privacy. She frustrated federal
investigators by ordering that intelligence operatives have virtually
no contact with criminal prosecutors, who must meet higher legal
standards to win approval of wiretaps and searches.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft, in a plan presented to the FISA court in March, moved to
eliminate that "bright line" by giving criminal prosecutors broad new
powers to take part in intelligence operations.</TE>
<TE>   "The attorney general seized authority that has not been granted
to him by the Constitution or the Congress," Marc Rotenberg, head of
the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center, said
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The FISA court, in its May 17 ruling, appeared to agree. The
justices said that the department went too far in loosening the
regulations that govern intelligence-gathering, and they scaled back
part of Ashcroft's plan.</TE>
<TE>   The court found that parts of Ashcroft's plan "are NOT reasonably
designed" to safeguard privacy rights.</TE>
<TE>   The court said the plan could mute the intent of the law to gather
information for foreign intelligence operations, not for criminal
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   The court's hesitancy to endorse Ashcroft's plan for broadened
intelligence-gathering operations appeared rooted in a years-long
series of run-ins with the FBI over the accuracy of the bureau's
warrant requests.</TE>
<TE>   The court said in September 2000 that the FBI came forward to
"confess error in some 75 FISA applications related to major
terrorist attacks directed against the United States." More errors
turned up later.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the FBI's run-ins with the court over misleading warrant
requests had leaked out publicly in recent months. Some FBI officials
blame the tensions for creating a chilling effect that led the bureau
not to seek a warrant in the summer of 2001 against suspected "20th
hijacker" Zacarias Moussaoui, who was jailed in Minneapolis on an
immigration violation.</TE>
<TE>   But the full extent of the problem--and the fact that dozens of
FBI warrant requests were found to contain errors--had never been
disclosed before.</TE>
<TE>   Those errors usually centered on misstatements or omissions of
facts by the FBI in claiming that criminal prosecutors were not
involved in intelligence-gathering operations, the court said in its
May opinion.</TE>
<TE>   The documents released Thursday did not cite specific cases by
name.</TE>
<TE>   The problem became so severe that the court convened a special
session in November 2000 to consider "the troubling number of
inaccurate FBI affidavits," and one agent was barred from appearing
before the FISA court to present warrant requests, the court said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials have been investigating the false
claims by FBI officials for more than a year, but "how these
misrepresentations occurred remains unexplained to the court," wrote
U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth, then the presiding judge of
the FISA court, in the May 17 opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Top officials of the Justice Department said they were gravely
concerned about the FISA court's decision to scale back Ashcroft's
March regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the secret decision was issued by the court as a whole
in May, Justice lawyers spent months determining how to appeal, and
finding a specific case to appeal, before filing the paperwork
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't overstate the delicacy of this, the difficulty of this,
the significance of this," said the senior Justice Department
official. "We don't want to tank the FISA program. We don't want to
mess up our relations with the FISA court."</TE>
<TE>   A Blow to Law Is Seen</TE>
<TE>   Justice officials said the May ruling did not force them to stop
conducting any particular investigations, but rather that it
prevented them from implementing key provisions of the Patriot Act.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like we got nowhere with the [implementation of] the Patriot
Act, and were not able to coordinate things like we wanted to and
needed to," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials also stressed that the 75 cases cited
in the May ruling occurred before President Bush took office, and
said that the problems were corrected by a succession of legal
reforms within the department over the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   They cited a speech given last year in which Lamberth credited
Ashcroft for ensuring that all FISA applications were "well scrubbed"
and free of inaccuracies that had plagued earlier applications. "The
process is working," Lamberth said in the speech.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the old problems had been remedied," Comstock said.</TE>

<HD>Leaders Are Worlds Apart After One Round at Sahalee</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This World Golf Championship certainly lived up its name Thursday, as
Retief Goosen of South Africa and Toshi Izawa of Japan each had a
six-under-par 65 to share the lead in the NEC Invitational at
Sammamish, Wash.</LD>
<LD>   Davis Love III and Phil Mickelson were at 66 with Darren Clarke of
Northern Ireland, while players from five other countries were also
right in the mix on a sunny, picturesque afternoon at Sahalee Country
Club.</LD>
<LD>   Tiger Woods found the tree-lined course east of Seattle a little
more difficult to navigate than Firestone, where he had won the last
three NEC Invitationals. Woods is the only winner in the three-year
history of the event.</LD>
<TE>   Woods overcame a double bogey on the 17th hole to post a
three-under 68, a good start in his bid to become the first player
since Walter Hagen at the PGA Championship (1924-27) to win the same
tournament four years in a row.</TE>
<TE>   He was angry after the double bogey, the result of a six-iron that
came up short and went into a pond. Asked what made him so upset,
Woods paused and replied, emphasizing every word, "The ball ended up
in the water."</TE>
<TE>   Goosen and Izawa had no such problems.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the $5-million purse and a world-class field of 78
players, the tournament had the feel of a holiday. The crowds were
not quite as large or boisterous as the PGA Championship last week,
and the pressure wasn't as great.</TE>
<TE>   Better yet for Goosen and Izawa, they managed to shake off their
shabby weekend at Hazeltine (79-75 for Goosen, 75-78 for Izawa).</TE>
<TE>   Justin Rose of England was among those at 67, and the group at 68
included Thomas Bjorn of Denmark, Sergio Garcia of Spain, Craig Perks
of New Zealand and Vijay Singh of Fiji. Singh won the PGA
Championship at Sahalee four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charles Howell III birdied three of the first four holes en route
to a seven-under 65 and a one-stroke lead in a bid for his first PGA
Tour victory at the $3-million Reno-Tahoe Open at Reno.</TE>
<TE>   John Rollins, J.L. Lewis and Tom Pernice Jr. were tied for second
at 66 after the first round at the 7,472-yard, par-72 Montreux Golf &amp;
Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Ben Crane of Oregon, Britian's Luke Donald, Australia's
Steve Allan, Eduarado Herrera, Jonathan Kaye and Boo Weekley all were
next at 67.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jill McGill and Danielle Ammaccapane shot six-under 66s to share
the lead in the Betsy King Classic at Kutztown, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   McGill, winless in her seven-year LPGA Tour career, holed a
pitching wedge from 110 yards for an eagle two on the 14th hole.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle McGann, Carri Wood, Wendy Doolan and Michelle Ellis
opened with 67s. Tournament host Betsy King shot a 73, and defending
champion Heather Daly-Donofrio had a 76.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Henry Liaw of Rowland Heights, at 16 the youngest player to
qualify for match play, advanced to the quarterfinals of the U.S.
Amateur at Oakland Hills Country Club in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Liaw, the 2001 U.S. Junior Amateur champion, made a curving par
putt on No. 18 to halve the hole and defeat Nebraska senior Seth
Porter, 1 up, in the round of 16. Earlier in the day, he beat J.J.
Jakovac, 3 and 2, in the round of 32.</TE>
<TE>   Medalist Bill Haas, the son of veteran PGA Tour player Jay Haas,
earned a quarterfinal berth with a 2-and-1 victory over D.J. Trahan,
the NCAA player of the year while at Clemson and the 2000 U.S. Public
Links champion.</TE>

<LD>Without question, the best main-track filly or mare in the country is
Azeri.</LD>
<LD>   Two other 4-year-old fillies who will be trying to upset her in
the Breeders' Cup Distaff in a couple of months at Arlington Park
will be getting together in today's $400,000 Personal Ensign Handicap
at Saratoga.</LD>
<LD>   Summer Colony and Dancethruthedawn, who have combined to win five
of nine in 2002, head a field of six in the Grade I at 1 1/4 miles.</LD>
<TE>   Owned and bred by Edward Evans, who is quietly having a successful
year, and trained by Mark Hennig, Summer Colony, a daughter of Summer
Squall, has the distinction of being the only horse to defeat Azeri.</TE>
<TE>   That victory--due in large part to Azeri being taken off a slow
pace--came in the La Canada Handicap on Feb. 9 at Santa Anita and was
the first of her three graded stakes wins at three tracks this year.
One of her other victories was by a nose over Dancethruthedawn in the
Pimlico Breeders' Cup Distaff on May 17.</TE>
<TE>   She has won two of her previous four at Saratoga, including a 32
3/4-length domination of maidens over a wet-fast track a little over
a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Owned and bred by Sam-Son Farms and trained by Mark Frostad,
Dancethruthedawn will be seeking her second Grade I victory of the
meet. The 2-1 favorite in the Go For Wand on July 28, the Mr.
Prospector filly rolled home by nearly four lengths over
Transcendental, who is also running today.</TE>
<TE>   The other four participants are Two Item Limit, who has lost eight
in a row since taking the 2001 Black Eyed Susan at Pimlico, Critical
Eye and Starrer.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Fateful Dream, third behind Special Ring in that
one's record-setting victory in the Wickerr earlier in the Del Mar
meet, heads the field in the $75,000 Harry Brubaker Handicap. The
seventh on the card, the Brubaker is at 1 1/16 miles on the turf and
drew seven others.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Richard Migliore. The jockey was steamed after being
disqualified out of a victory on Monday at Saratoga and was promptly
fined $2,000--half for his outburst and the other half for taking off
the remainder of his mounts. Migliore, who has been riding very well,
had a right to be angry. The stewards' decision was horrible.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: The field in the 11th at Sacramento. The 12 original
entrants in the maiden claimer are winless in 103.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Warn Me Again and French
Rebel in the third, all in the fourth and singling Slippery When Bet
in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/55. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $22.80/$334.60. Total money bet: $442.</TE>

<DL>SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.</DL>
<LD>An intentional walk had taken the bat out of the hands of Worcester's
power hitter. Along came Ryan Griffin.</LD>
<LD>   His three-run homer in the bottom of the sixth inning gave
Worcester, Mass., a 5-2 victory over Harlem, N.Y., on Thursday night
in a U.S. semifinal at the Little League World Series.</LD>
<LD>   "I couldn't believe it was going--I couldn't believe the game
ended like that," Griffin said. "I was just trying to hit it into a
gap in left or right field."</LD>
<TE>   Gordie Lockbaum walked to lead off the sixth inning and Frank
Flynn, who hit Worcester's only home run of the tournament, was
intentionally walked. After one out, Griffin battled through an
eight-pitch at-bat and sent the ball sailing over the right-field
wall.</TE>
<TE>   Harlem right fielder Fernando Frias threw his cap near the fence
in obvious disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "Ryan, the last couple games, has been putting it into the dirt,"
Worcester Manager Fran Granger said. "We worked on that and worked on
it. Tonight, it paid off."</TE>
<TE>   Worcester will play Louisville, Ky., in Saturday's U.S.
championship game.</TE>
<TE>   The international championship will feature Willemstad, Curacao,
Netherlands Antilles against Sendai, Japan. Curacao beat Valencia,
Venezuela, 3-0, Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Harlem was swinging for the fences in the top of the sixth, but
Jeremy Lopez grounded out and Alibay Barkley and Javier Lopez were
struck out by Keith Landers.</TE>
<TE>   "That has been our nemesis, if you will, the off-speed pitch --
and it reared its head again," Harlem Manager Morris McWilliams said.</TE>
<TE>   Harlem, which led, 2-0, in the third inning, left the bases loaded
in that inning and again in the fourth. Worcester tied it in the
third on a sacrifice fly by Flynn and a passed ball.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Beaten at 2-5 in his most recent appearance July 11, Dashin Bye will
try to make amends in tonight's ninth, a $12,550 allowance at 350
yards.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Mike Levi and Blane Schvaneveldt and trained by
Schvaneveldt, the 4-year-old son of First Down Dash was third, beaten
by a neck, in his second start of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   In his first race of the year on June 22, Dashin Bye had been
fourth in the Spencer Childers Handicap, a race won by A Ransom.</LD>
<TE>   Those two defeats mean the California-bred has already lost one
more race this year than he did in all of 2001. Dashin Bye won five
of six as a 3-year-old at three tracks. He had two wins apiece at
Lone Star Park and Ruidoso Downs, then won again at Los Alamitos Oct.
20.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Badilla Jr. will ride Dashin Bye, whose foes include Drop Your
Sox, A Secret Account, Dash Stepper, All American Jewel and Mutts
Dandy Effort.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Icey Gambler. 2. Twelve Again. 3. Sue Sues Asset. 4.
Rubys Diggity Vet. 5. Departure Time. 6. Traffic Attraction. 7. Jake
Blues. 8. Babe With Rhythm. 9. Dashin Bye. 10. You Move Me.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Single Icey Gambler in the first, use Twelve Again, Rio
Cheng and Pretty Dashing in the second, Sue Sues Asset and What A
Swetie T T in the third, and Rubys Diggity Vet, Wanta Wild Dash and
Summers Secret in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Legal Thief switches to jockey Ramon Guce in
the fifth after a solid third despite a wide trip on Aug. 2. With
Reflections steps up in the eighth after having been claimed for
$10,000 by trainer Jaime Gomez.</TE>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fifth-seeded Martina Hingis completed her first three-set match since
returning from a three-month injury layoff, but it wasn't enough
against an energized Anastasia Myskina.</LD>
<LD>   The unseeded Myskina defeated Hingis, 6-7 (2), 6-4, 6-0, by
winning the last 11 games in their Pilot Pen quarterfinal match
Thursday night at New Haven, Conn. Hingis was up, 4-1, in the second
set and was a break point away from 5-1 but couldn't close out
Myskina.</LD>
<LD>   Ankle surgery in May kept Hingis off the tour for three months.
Despite the loss, the former No. 1 player said she was pleased with
her overall play as she prepares for next week's U.S. Open.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to keep my head up and look forward to the Open,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Myskina will play Lindsay Davenport in a semifinal today.
Davenport advanced with a 7-6 (7), 6-3 victory over Amelie Mauresmo.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time defending champion Venus Williams breezed into the
semifinals with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over qualifier Laura Granville. In
the other semifinal, Williams will play Daniela Hantuchova, who
defeated Patty Schnyder, 6-4, 6-3.</TE>

<TE>   NASCAR Busch Series driver Mike Harmon escaped virtually uninjured
after a spectacular crash split his car in half when he hit an
unsecured gate at Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon was treated for a bruise on his right side at Wellmont
Regional Medical Center in Bristol, then returned to the track.</TE>
<TE>   He was entering Turn 2 during the morning practice when his car
hit an outside wall that doubles as a crossover gate.</TE>
<TE>   When closed, the wall is bolstered by six thick metal posts, but
they were not in place, causing the gate to give way on contact.</TE>
<TE>   The concrete sliced through the front of Harmon's Chevrolet, and
the pieces shot down the track. Harmon, surrounded by his intact roll
cage, came to rest on the apron in Turn 2. His engine and steering
column dropped off halfway down the back straightaway.</TE>

his back in a weight-training accident July 22 in his native Czech

<LD>A Glendale High football player was moved out of intensive care and
listed in fair condition Thursday after collapsing and losing
consciousness at a practice Wednesday on the school's athletic field.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Chamberlin, a 6-foot-3, 280-pound 14-year-old, had a
temperature of 107 degrees and symptoms related to heatstroke, said
Steve Rutledge, spokesman for Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, where
Chamberlin was transferred in critical condition Wednesday from
Glendale Memorial Hospital. Chamberlin, a sophomore, was unconscious
and on a respirator much of Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "He was starting to come around late [Wednesday] night," Rutledge
said. "He still had tubes down his throat to help with his breathing,
but he was responsive and answering questions. He has been awake,
alert and taking in fluids."</LD>
<TE>   Chamberlin could be released as early as today, Rutledge said.
Chamberlin's family, through the hospital, declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Coach Loi Phan said the offensive lineman, who played on
the freshman-sophomore team last year, drank water during each of the
three scheduled breaks in a two-hour practice that began at 8 a.m.
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The high temperature in Glendale was an unseasonably cool 76
degrees Wednesday. Phan said it was much cooler in the morning on the
first day of fall practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Every guy would wish for this type of weather during double
days," Phan said.</TE>
<TE>   Chamberlin, who has asthma, participated in most of the
conditioning drills but asked if he could get his inhaler after
complaining of dizziness, the coach said. After using the inhaler,
Chamberlin tried to take part in another drill but fell to his knees
moments later and began to roll on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "He was breathing fast," said Phan, who said a trainer wasn't
present Wednesday. "We checked to see if he was conscious. We shook
him and asked him questions, but we couldn't get him to answer or
respond. So we made the call to 911."</TE>
<TE>   An ambulance was at the field two to three minutes after the call,
Phan said.</TE>
<TE>   Chamberlin kept his inhaler in a bag on the field and Phan said he
doubts that asthma played a part in the player losing consciousness.
The coach, an asthma sufferer himself, said he makes it a priority
for those with that condition to have an inhaler readily available.</TE>
<TE>   Phan said it is the first time a player has collapsed in his 17
years of coaching.</TE>
<TE>   He cautioned about the need for players to hydrate themselves on a
daily basis.</TE>

<LD>The death threat that this week forced midfielder Neil Lennon to
withdraw from Northern Ireland's game against Cyprus on Thursday
prompted the 31-year-old to quit international soccer.</LD>
<LD>   Saying "enough is enough," Lennon said he could no longer put his
family through the ordeal every time the national team plays.</LD>
<LD>   "My parents are pretty distraught, really," Lennon told Ulster
Television.</LD>
<TE>   "I've got a 10-year-old daughter who knows nothing about this ...
and we're going to try to keep her away from it as much as we can.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I can't put them through this every time.... I've
thought long and hard about it and decided that I probably won't be
going back to play for Northern Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only my parents and my family that I have to think
about. I've got to think about the team. The focus is taken away from
the team altogether when things like this happen, and it's not the
first time it has happened."</TE>
<TE>   The Loyalist Volunteer Force, a Protestant paramilitary group,
Thursday claimed responsibility for the death threat against Lennon,
who is Catholic and plays for Scottish champion Glasgow Celtic, a
predominantly Catholic-supported team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minute of Silence</TE>
<TE>   The English Football Assn. Thursday ordered that all games in the
English league this weekend, starting with tonight's match between
Manchester United and Chelsea, be preceded by one minute of silence
in honor of murdered 10-year-olds Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.</TE>
<TE>   Both girls were wearing replicas of David Beckham's Manchester
United jersey when they went missing.</TE>
<TE>   Their bodies were discovered Saturday, and Beckham, England's
national team captain, has since paid his respects to their families.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Uruguayans on Move</TE>
<TE>   Midfielder Gustavo Varela, 24, Thursday signed a four-year
contract to play for Schalke '04, becoming the second Uruguayan World
Cup player to join the German Bundesliga club in the last week.</TE>
<TE>   "He is very fast and highly skillful," Coach Frank Neubarth said
of the former Nacional of Montevideo player, who will be linked again
with defender Dario Rodriguez, acquired earlier from Penarol.</TE>
<TE>   A third Uruguayan national team player, midfielder Pablo Garcia,
Thursday moved on loan from AC Milan in Italy to Osasuna Pamplona in
Spain, where he will play for former Mexico national team coach
Javier Aguirre.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mullan Suspended</TE>
<TE>   The game-ending hard slide tackle Galaxy reserve forward Brian
Mullan put on Kansas City Wizard defender Nick Garcia during the
Galaxy's 2-1 win Wednesday night has earned Mullan a red card
suspension and $250 fine, it was learned Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Referee Alex Prus did not show Mullan a red card at the time of
the play, which precipitated a bench-clearing screaming match between
the teams, but he included it in his official report to the league.</TE>
<TE>   Mullan will sit out the Galaxy's game Saturday at Dallas, an
absence that may hurt the Galaxy more with Cobi Jones' status day to
day because of a sprained right big toe.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defense, rebounding, a strong bench, no second-half turnovers and a
tiring opponent kept the Washington Mystics in the game. Chamique
Holdsclaw won it.</LD>
<LD>   Holdsclaw had three consecutive brilliant plays in the final five
minutes Thursday night to send the Mystics to a 79-74 victory over
the New York Liberty at Washington in Game 1 of the WNBA Eastern
Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   A give-and-go assist to Annie Burgess, a baseline move for a layup
and a rifled backdoor pass to Stacey Dales-Schuman highlighted a 12-3
run that put the Mystics ahead for good.</LD>
<TE>   "Our team was out there making shots, so I wasn't really pressing
on the offensive end," said Holdsclaw, who had 20 points, nine
rebounds and six assists. "Then, as time went down, I saw some
opportunities to make some plays, and I just took it to the basket
with confidence."</TE>
<TE>   The Mystics had 14 offensive rebounds and got 30 points from their
reserves. The Mystics also had four days off after sweeping
Charlotte, while the the top-seeded Liberty had only one day off
after its three-game series victory over Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Game 2 on Saturday and Game 3, if necessary, on Sunday will be in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Tari Phillips led New York with 21 points. Liberty guard Teresa
Witherspoon sprained her left ankle but played on with it taped.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Referee Bill Stokes, who collapsed Tuesday night during the
Comet-Utah Starzz game at Houston, was "resting comfortably and
improving daily," his family said in a statement in which they also
requested privacy.</TE>
