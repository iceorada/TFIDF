<HD>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream</HD>
<DH>Child of My Heart, A Novel, Alice McDermott, Farrar, Straus

<AU>David Ebershoff</AU>
<BD>David Ebershoff is the author of "Pasadena," "The
Danish Girl" and "The Rose City."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One winter afternoon in Queens, circa 1960, Theresa, the 15-year-old
narrator of Alice McDermott's wondrous new novel, takes her little
cousin Daisy to a candy store. They buy 100 lollipops and bring them
home to Daisy's siblings, six brothers and a skeptical sister, who
asks, as any child would, "Where'd you get these?" Before Daisy can
answer, Theresa is inventing a sugary but morbid fantasy about an old
couple whose only child, 50 years ago to the day, dreamed of a
lollipop tree in his frontyard at dusk, and then suddenly died. Each
year on the anniversary of his death, in the brief February hour
between daylight and dark, the couple hang lollipops on their front
willow for the neighborhood children.</LD>
<LD>   By the time Theresa finishes telling the story, with the 100
lollipops as her evidence, the six boys have turned their backs to
the television set, so entranced are they. But Bernadette, the cynic,
demands of Daisy to know whether this is true. Daisy -- tiny, shy and
only 8 -- neither confirms nor denies the tale. She shrugs her
shoulders and says, "You should have come." Theresa, herself in the
twilight hour between childhood and the world of adults, is pleased:
"Child of my heart," she thinks.</LD>
<TE>   Like William Trevor, Alice McDermott is a genius of quiet
observation. Her antenna is perpetually raised and turning, humming
and warm with reception. Her novels possess a satisfying sameness, in
the same way that Jane Austen's novels share certain similarities in
content and tone but are uniquely enchanting. Readers of "Charming
Billy," her 1998 novel that won the National Book Award, will
recognize the setting of "Child of My Heart" on the eastern end of
Long Island and its elegiac, end-of-summer tone.</TE>
<TE>   Theresa is the only child of middle-class Irish Catholic parents
who moved to a fisherman's cottage in tony East Hampton when she was
a toddler because, as Theresa explains, "[t]hey knew rich people
lived way out on Long Island, even if only for the summer months, and
putting me in a place where I might be spotted by some of them was
their equivalent of offering me every opportunity." By the time she's
a young teenager, many people in East Hampton have indeed noticed
her, both for her beauty ("a young Elizabeth Taylor") and for her
uncanny ability to win the hearts of children and small animals
alike. She spends her summers baby-sitting, cat-sitting and
dog-walking for her fecklessly rich neighbors and peers with perfect
vision into their expensive but immature lives.</TE>
<TE>   Theresa is what she would call a "wise soul." Like her patron
saint, she has a rare and spiritual understanding of the spectrum of
human souls. She describes people in swift and accurate swipes,
summing them up unequivocally. Daisy's mother is "a thin and wiry
woman, only, it seemed, a good night's sleep away from being pretty."
The very young wife of a famous septuagenarian painter, is "thin and
tall, with something severe about her face ... a certain gray
roughness to her otherwise flawless skin that would put you in mind
of expertly poured concrete." When she speaks for the first time with
the painter himself, an artist whose infant daughter Theresa
babysits, she intuits their fundamental differences. " 'I hear you're
a babysitter par excellence,' he said -- not the way I would say it,
but the way someone who really spoke French would say it. I told him
I just liked children. He nodded slowly, as if this were a sad but
complex piece of information."</TE>
<TE>   The novel spans the few summer weeks when Daisy leaves her home in
Queens -- a household of 10 living on a transit cop's salary -- to
visit Theresa in East Hampton. "Poor Daisy," her family collectively
refers to her. They only think about her in terms of her physical
frailty: "Her ears stood out like the handles on a teacup. Her skin,
the bones of her bare shoulders seemed teacup thin, pale blue and
fragile." There is something fairy-like about Daisy -- all quiet bone
and wild red hair -- that makes her family feel as if there's little
they can do to save her from the world. Only Theresa has paid her any
attention in her short life, and hence the almost magical event of
her visit to her cousin's in East Hampton.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately, Daisy becomes Theresa's sidekick as she makes her
rounds walking the dogs and minding the children of people too busy,
or lazy, to do it themselves. Their first day together is a long,
masterful arc that runs about 70 pages; everything about it, in
McDermott's skilled hand, possesses the joyous, free-spirited,
soul-exhausting quality of a child's summer day: "There was the
lovely scent of fading summer afternoon in the air -- maybe a hint of
the unseen children's suntan lotion." Yet, as every child knows,
melancholy, or worse, can shadow even the most perfect day.</TE>
<TE>   As a guide to the many layers of this world -- the social
hierarchies, the expectations about gender, and, most important, the
division between children and adults -- Theresa is both innocent and
wise; she is a step or two from the center of things but never
ironically detached. She understands things, "in a way that
fifteen-year-old girls know things -- intuitively, in some sense; in
some sense based purely on the precise and indifferent observation of
a creature very much of the world but not yet of it." She's a spirit
hovering, momentarily, between the complex fairyland of childhood and
the lumbering reality of adults, a narrator whose hand the reader
never wants to release -- a hand that Daisy holds and trusts even as
the surrounding world darkens.</TE>
<TE>   It is no coincidence that Theresa refers to herself as "Titania
among her fairies." She even nicknames two of the kids she baby-sits
Peaseblossom and Cobweb. It is apt that McDermott weaves into her
story elements of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," for this novel casts
the same mystical spell as Shakespeare's fantasy. Theresa is, like
Titania, queen of the fairies, "a spirit of no common rate; / The
summer still doth tend upon my state," and the admixture of events of
that brief summer in East Hampton possesses the music of discord,
"such sweet thunder," as Shakespeare writes.</TE>
<TE>   Like a summer storm at first far away, the momentum of McDermott's
story is both uncertain and ominous. Just when you think these
childhoods are too precious, she reminds you just how perilous
childhood can be. For on this fine day -- a day we come to believe as
Daisy's first true extended moment of happiness -- tragedy looms all
that much greater when, late at night, Theresa, while rubbing Noxzema
into Daisy's sunburned skin, discovers foreboding bruises upon her
feet. Because Theresa's greatest fear is the end of childhood (none
more so than her own), she decides to wait before telling anyone what
she knows.</TE>
<TE>   It is a fateful decision, born of a child's wish for the world not
to change, but the bruises continue to reappear on Daisy's tiny body.
One night as the girls are preparing for bed, she looks into her
hands. "Out, damned spot," she says, but Theresa lovingly admonishes
her. "I put a finger to her lips. 'Darn,' I said. 'Out darn spot.' "
Without another word, McDermott makes it clear that the spot Daisy
and Theresa are wishing away is the bruise of early leukemia. All
Theresa can offer is baby aspirin.</TE>
<TE>   Soon the storm will arrive, and Daisy will be taken away. Theresa,
in the torment of her changing world, finds herself drawn to the
"old, old man" artist. McDermott's denouement -- a mix of candy and
cancer, purity and prurience -- isn't so much a malevolent exchange
between adult and child as an inexorable culmination of shuddering
events.</TE>
<TE>   Like Jane Austen, McDermott, one of our finest novelists at work
today, is the master of a domain that in the hands of most writers
would be limiting. In "Child of My Heart," she has transformed her
trademark material of Irish American life into a poignant and
rewarding fictional world. "Child of My Heart" extends her artistic
triumphs, and we should rejoice.</TE>

<HD>A trailblazer for American imperialism</HD>
<DH>Pathfinder, John Charles Fremont and the Course of American
Empire, Tom Chaffin, Hill and Wang: 560 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard White</AU>
<BD>Richard White is the author of "'It's Your Misfortune
and None of My Own': A New History of the American West." He is a
professor of American history at Stanford University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The great mystery of the United States to outsiders is how a country
that has achieved so much wealth and power, for good and evil, has
had a public life so dominated by mediocrities, by men such as John
C. Fremont. To succeed, Fremont relied on political expediency, a
network of connections that gave him opportunity and allowed him to
survive his mistakes, personal ambition, greed and the ability to
project images of substance where there was, in fact, precious little
substance. Dashing and brave, he symbolized republican values and a
vibrant nationalism that masked what accompanied the expansion of
empire: sordid ambitions and an ability to bear up well under the
sufferings of others.</LD>
<LD>   Fremont, or "The Pathfinder," as his 19th century contemporaries
styled him, was an imperial figure. The explorer and popularizer of
the West in the American mind was feckless, often reckless, and if he
had not had such an abundance of bad judgment, he would have had no
judgment at all. Only when he had risen to a point where it was
impossible to disguise his limitations did he descend into a long
twilight of impoverishment and embarrassment. His wife, Jessie (the
daughter of powerful expansionist Missouri Sen. Thomas Hart Benton),
who was so critical to his success, went down with him.</LD>
<TE>   He was, however, blessed with protectors whose aid prevented his
failures from impeding his rise. He was an explorer, a popular hero,
an author, an officer instrumental in the conquest of California, a
senator, a millionaire (briefly), a presidential candidate and a
Civil War general. For a man with important connections, American
political life is eminently forgiving.</TE>
<TE>   The names of numerous American places, many of them now enveloped
in the suburbs, commemorate Fremont, and, like them, Fremont's name
has become part of the vaguely familiar suburbs of American history.
In the mid-19th century, however, he seemed to have been at the
center of expansion, politics, war and business. He was not really an
explorer, however, but an officer in the Topographical Engineers, a
group of surveyors and mapmakers. Others had traveled the routes
before him, and Indians as well as non-Indians were virtually
everywhere he went.</TE>
<TE>   After a typical Fremont accident in which a boat overturned on the
Kansas River in 1842, losing much of the expedition's supplies,
Fremont wrote that only a traveler in a "strange and inhospitable
country" could imagine his dilemma. The next day, however, Kansas
Indians appeared and provisioned him with a cow, a calf, butter,
pumpkins, beans, onions, lettuce and 30 pounds of coffee. This wasn't
exactly Webvan, but neither was Fremont in most of his travels far
from succor and supply. Fremont was a fairly competent cartographer
and, with his wife's help, a skilled writer whose reports publicized
him as much as the country they covered. Sometimes, even given the
limited tools and skills he possessed, he was a shrewd observer. He
was the first, according to Tom Chaffin, to recognize that the Great
Basin did not have an outlet to the sea. But his ethnography rarely
rose above dismissive judgments about Indians, despite the dependence
of virtually all of his expeditions on members of the Delaware tribe
and other Indian hunters.</TE>
<TE>   He was capable of incredible daring, as in his winter crossing of
the Sierras in 1844, but his success seems more luck than skill. His
last two expeditions to seek a railroad route from St. Louis to the
Pacific Ocean were privately financed and ended in disaster. In
1848-49, his expedition became trapped in the winter snows of the San
Juan Mountains. Nearly a third of the 32-man party died, and at least
one seems to have been cannibalized by his comrades. When the next
expedition blundered into serious trouble, Fremont gathered his men
for a campfire chat whose theme was the importance of not eating each
other. This does not inspire confidence in a leader.</TE>
<TE>   Even before that, there were plenty of reasons to question his
leadership. Leading a government expedition into California at the
time of the Mexican War, his actions were sometimes bizarre, often
indecisive and occasionally murderous. His tendency to vacillate
between indecision and overplaying his hand ended up with his arrest,
court-martial and expulsion from the Army because of his
insubordination while military governor in California.</TE>
<TE>   Fremont as usual landed on his feet. Blessed with gold on his
Mariposa Ranch in the Sierra foothills, a ranch he had acquired by
sheer luck, he proceeded to squander the fortune. Elected as one of
the first two senators from California, his anti-slavery sentiments
-- one of the few moral chords that ever vibrated in him -- led to
his selection as the Republican Party's presidential candidate in
1856. He ran under the slogan of "Free Men, Free Soil and Fremont."
He lost, and along the way, his sexual escapades and other poor
choices alienated many of his advisors, who regarded him as both
inept and immoral.</TE>
<TE>   He retreated to California to try to resurrect his fortune, but
with Abraham Lincoln's victory, the new president made him a Union
major general and put him in command of the Western theater in
Missouri. (In a war full of political generals, Lincoln could not
ignore his party's previous presidential nominee.) The result was the
usual Fremont alchemy: He turned golden promise into the dross of
failure. Admittedly, he faced grave challenges, but while he was in
command, Confederate armies occupied half of Missouri, and, with his
premature proclamations on executing Confederates and freeing slaves,
he subverted Lincoln's strategy to keep the border states in the
Union.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he was a key promoter of the Memphis, El Paso and
Pacific Railroad, which defrauded French investors of millions while
building six miles of track. A French court convicted him in absentia
of fraud and sentenced him to five years in prison. He avoided France
after that.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to think of a single equivalent to him today. Like John
Glenn, he turned fame as a government explorer into a political
career. Like George W. Bush, he had a checkered financial career and
owed much of his prominence to familial connections, although in
Fremont's case they came by marriage. Like Oliver L. North, he
managed to turn a kind of bungling ineptitude and failure into public
prominence. As a politician, he combined the financial acumen and
political judgment of Bill Simon Jr. with the sexual impropriety of
Bill Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   As unimpressive as all this may sound, Chaffin is right in casting
him in imperial terms. It is his exact role that is in question.
During Fremont's career, American armies dispossessed Indians and
seized one-third of Mexico. American diplomats outmaneuvered the
British and Russians to gain the Oregon Country and Alaska. Chaffin's
argument is that Fremont turned his father-in-law's version of empire
-- an empire of commerce focusing on a "road to India" -- into the
continental empire that his contemporaries achieved. But Fremont was
more an agent of imperialism than a theorist, and Chaffin makes him
carry an ideological and intellectual burden that he cannot bear. But
reduced from architect to agent, Fremont is still a nice symbol of
American Empire. "Our road," Collis P. Huntington of the Southern
Pacific Railroad told him, "goes over your buried campfires and
climbs many a grade you jogged over on a mule; I think we rather owe
you this." Fremont supposedly made empire possible. What Huntington
didn't mention, nor does Chaffin, is that while governor of Arizona
(his last public failure), Fremont had taken money from the Southern
Pacific and worked for its interests. Fremont may be a model for our
imperial future as well as for our past.</TE>

<HD>As Headquarters Takes Shape, AOL Tries to Define Its Future</HD>
<DH>By the time the troubled media giant is ready to occupy its
new home in 2004, its own form may have changed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Thrusting out from a corner of the $1.8-billion AOL Time Warner
Center -- now under construction across from Central Park -- will be
a 10-story glass shaft shaped like an upended prism and nicknamed
"The Prow."</LD>
<LD>   AOL Time Warner Inc., lead tenant of this most expensive building
in U.S. history, plans to use it as a mammoth display case for an
artistic creation that, without making a blatant commercial
statement, will somehow reflect the loftier aspirations of the
world's biggest media conglomerate.</LD>
<LD>   After a year of pondering, a committee of engineers, artisans and
set designers has a working concept: a sculptural object, a bit like
a mobile but not wind-driven and definitely not electronic or
neon-lit, team leader George Ladyman said recently. It will change
shape, he said, but in a stately and predictable way, not unlike the
grand mechanical clocks that dominate town squares in Switzerland.</LD>
<TE>   "The intent is not to be Times Square but elegantly quiet," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   If it sounds as if Ladyman is grappling with abstractions, his
task echoes his employer's own struggle to redefine itself in the
wake of what critics consider one of history's most disastrous
corporate mergers.</TE>
<TE>   As AOL Time Warner pushes forward with preparations to occupy the
lavish new headquarters sometime in early 2004, it still must contend
on multiple fronts with negative fallout from the January 2001 merger
that created the company.</TE>
<TE>   Irate investors, whose shares have lost two-thirds of their value
since the marriage of America Online Inc. and Time Warner Inc.,
accuse the deal's architects of swallowing their own hype about such
amorphous concepts as synergy and cultural cross-pollination when
they should have focused on more practical issues, such as rising
debt and shrinking revenue streams.</TE>
<TE>   "They drank the Kool-Aid," as Florida hedge fund manager Douglas
A. Kass once put it.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of turbocharging the growth of a collection of dowdy "old
media" assets, America Online has been nothing but a drag on the
combined company. Subscriber growth at the Internet unit has
stumbled, and ad revenue has plunged headlong.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, AOL is the target of federal criminal and civil
investigations into suspected phony bookkeeping. Those probes have
spawned shareholder lawsuits against the parent company.</TE>
<TE>   America Online's new management team is scrambling to retool its
business plan to attract free-spending subscribers while fending off
stiff competition from the likes of Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc.
The AOL Time Warner board Thursday received a preview of the plan,
which is scheduled to be unveiled Dec. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure from bond-rating firms to pare down debt, AOL Time
Warner is preparing to spin off its cable television properties in a
stock offering that probably will come next year. The company also
may shed other businesses, including one or more of its Atlanta pro
sports franchises.</TE>
<TE>   In short, AOL Time Warner may have done a lot of shape-shifting of
its own by the time Ladyman's sculpture is unveiled.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Function, Not Metaphor</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Chief Executive Richard D. Parsons resists
attempts to attach any deep corporate symbolism to the new
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "The headquarters is more functional for us -- and a part of
something good for the city," Parsons said in a recent interview. He
called the project "the Rockefeller Center of the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, when developer Stephen M. Ross of Related Cos. approached
Time Warner with an opportunity to anchor a complex that would
combine office, retail, residential and performance space, Parsons
said that he and other executives recognized it as both an answer to
their own real estate problems and "a galvanizing concept from the
point of view of the city."</TE>
<TE>   The two-tower, 53-story complex, slated to open in stages
beginning in September, is arguably the most important construction
project for New York since the World Trade Center more than 30 years
ago. The site, on Columbus Circle at the southwest corner of Central
Park, was an eyesore for a generation, as one plan after another fell
victim to municipal infighting, economic setbacks and the opposition
of Upper West Side neighborhood activists.</TE>
<TE>   The building will house not only AOL Time Warner's headquarters
and the main New York broadcasting studio of its CNN unit but also
the posh Mandarin Oriental Hotel, a multilevel retail and restaurant
gallery, 198 luxury apartments priced from $2 million to $30 million
and the new home of Jazz at Lincoln Center, the organization headed
by trumpeter-composer Wynton Marsalis.</TE>
<TE>   More than simply providing space, the project is meant to help
define a burgeoning "media and entertainment corridor" on Manhattan's
West Side, stretching from Madison Square Garden to Harlem's Apollo
Theater and including the Broadway theater district, Radio City Music
Hall, the big TV networks, Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center.</TE>
<TE>   As one of New York's leading corporate citizens, Time Warner was
partly motivated by a sense of civic duty, Parsons said. But the
building also made business sense. AOL Time Warner, which occupies
2.6 million square feet of space in more than half a dozen Midtown
locations, was facing lease expirations that would have forced it to
sign new contracts at top dollar, Parsons noted.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Strategy Question</TE>
<TE>   The 800,000 square feet of space in the new building will allow
the company to shift its executive offices from their cramped
quarters at Rockefeller Center while providing state-of-the-art
studio facilities for CNN and its business-news sibling, CNNfn. The
new complex, featuring broad expanses of working space, ought to
boost productivity for people such as Parsons, who likes to "manage
by walking around."</TE>
<TE>   Some observers are skeptical about whether the building
accomplishes any strategic purpose beyond establishing a trophy
address. At AOL Time Warner's annual meeting last May in the Apollo
Theater, a shareholder blasted management for wasting investors'
money "replicating the Taj Mahal."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand the logic of it," Merrill Lynch analyst
Jessica Reif Cohen said recently. "They're not consolidating the
operations at all. In a way, it's just another building."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, most of the company's operating units won't be making the
move to Columbus Circle. For example, "American Morning with Paula
Zahn," the CNN morning news show, will remain in its gleaming new
studio on Seventh Avenue. The Time Inc. publishing division, HBO and
Warner Music Group also are staying put.</TE>
<TE>   According to a former architect for Time Warner, even CNN's main
news bureau was reluctant to give up its dingy rabbit warren next to
Penn Station.</TE>
<TE>   Architect Christopher Choa, a partner at HLW International,
represented Time Warner in the project's early design phases. Choa
recalled the CNN people as "very prickly.""They were being forced to
be in the building, so they were going to fight every decision tooth
and nail," Choa said.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, CNN still was a new member of the Time Warner family,
having come aboard as part of Time Warner's 1996 acquisition of
Turner Broadcasting Corp. Choa diagnosed the network's fractiousness
as resentment over its loss of autonomy.</TE>
<TE>   After the AOL merger was completed, the architect said, executives
from the America Online side played only a background role in
discussions about the new headquarters, while CNN continued to be
"the strongest AOL Time Warner personality."</TE>
<TE>   A former CNN executive, speaking on condition of anonymity,
acknowledged the tension but said the network's overriding goal was
simply to fight for the best space it could get. "We ended up being a
little more engaged than we wanted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As Parsons remembers it, some CNN executives initially may have
resisted the move on budgetary grounds, but "the news people got the
joke immediately." Broadcast pros, he said, could instantly
appreciate the value of an interior working space with column-free
spans as much as 55 feet wide. Better still, the new studio's front
porch will overlook a dramatic Central Park archway that is bound to
become a familiar backdrop for live reports -- the Gotham equivalent

<TE>   The price tag for AOL Time Warner's piece of the complex is about
$800 million.</TE>
<TE>   "In the overall scheme of things, it isn't a huge number," Merrill
Lynch's Cohen said. But considering the pressure to reduce debt, she
added, "I don't want to underplay the significance."</TE>
<TE>   Cost considerations have forced AOL Time Warner to make some
sacrifices at the new complex.</TE>
<TE>   Ladyman, perhaps best known as designer of the Six Flags
attraction "Batman, the Ride," initially pushed for a promotional
exhibit like Manhattan's popular Sony Wonder Technology Lab -- not a
store but a museum-like place to interact with the company's brands
and products. The idea was dropped as too expensive.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided there were other ways to achieve the same kind of
impact," Ladyman said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the company will provide tours of the CNN studios and
construct in its lobby a huge, programmable "media wall" that can
screen live news and entertainment programs as well as movie trailers
and promotional clips.</TE>

<HD>Stock Buybacks Face Increasing Scrutiny</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After shares of Tenet Healthcare Corp. plunged nearly 50% in a week,
the hospital company resorted to a corporate strategy common in times
of crisis: It used its own cash to buy the stock in the open market,
spending at least $140 million in the five days ended Nov. 15.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet said the message was that the stock's collapse, in the wake
of a federal investigation of the company's billing practices, was
"overdone." If the share price revives, the company's buyback may
look like a smart move. But if the price sinks further, shareholders
may wish their capital hadn't been wasted.</LD>
<LD>   Stock buybacks, a favorite management use of cash during the bull
market of the late 1990s, nowadays face a much more critical review
by shareholders -- a trend that may become more pronounced if tax-law
changes boost the appeal of cash dividend payments.</LD>
<TE>   A buyback program is supposed to be an indication that management
believes its share price is undervalued, and that the stock is the
best investment the company can identify at the moment.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, a buyback can help boost a stock's price two ways --
first, as the company enters the market to snap up the shares, and
second if the purchases reduce the number of shares outstanding,
thereby raising the company's per-share earnings over time.</TE>
<TE>   But many companies were announcing hefty buyback programs in 1999
and early 2000, as the stock market was cresting. The bear market
since has made many of those purchases appear misguided.</TE>
<TE>   More troubling to many institutional shareholders is that some
companies have been buying back stock only to supply the shares
needed for management stock option plans, said Robert Willens, a tax
expert at brokerage Lehman Bros. in New York. If a company's
outstanding share total hasn't declined much despite years of
buybacks, it's legitimate to ask which party -- management or
shareholders -- is the true target beneficiary of a buyback program,
Willens said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some companies have used buybacks to aggressively reduce
the number of shares outstanding, said David Fried, a Pacific
Palisades money manager and publisher of Buybackletter.com, which
tracks buyback programs to identify appealing stocks.</TE>
<TE>   He cites Deluxe Corp., the nation's leading check printer. The
company has cut the number of shares outstanding to about 61.8
million from 81 million in 1998. The stock price has soared 116%
since the end of 2000, helped in part by investors' renewed respect
for fundamentally strong businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Fried argues that buybacks can be a very effective tool in
boosting shareholder value, if the programs indeed reduce outstanding
shares.</TE>
<TE>   He agrees that shareholders are much more likely to scrutinize the
wisdom of buyback programs now, but says that may make newly
announced programs more meaningful -- "because everybody's being more
careful."</TE>
<TE>   Given record-low short-term interest rates at a time when many
stocks remain near multi-year lows, it may even make sense for more
companies to borrow to buy back stock, Fried said.</TE>
<TE>   But if Congress changes tax laws to make dividends more attractive
to investors, corporate managers could face a clamor to use excess
cash for dividends rather than share buybacks.</TE>
<TE>   Even without a shift in the tax code, the shareholder argument for
dividends over stock buybacks is that a dividend, once set, becomes a
serious commitment for management to meet each quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Buybacks, by contrast, can be announced with great fanfare, but
managers may or may not follow through on those plans.</TE>
<TE>   A joke that has circulated on Wall Street is that buybacks of
shares are the equivalent of dating, whereas a dividend is the
equivalent of marriage.</TE>

<LD>Terrorists did more than bring down the twin towers of the World
Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. They also toppled a key pillar of the
national economy: the insurance industry.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Congress came to the rescue by passing legislation that
places a limit on how much insurers have to pay on future terrorist
incidents. The bill, which President Bush is expected to sign
shortly, is designed to protect companies from disastrous losses and
enable them to resume writing insurance against terrorism risks.</LD>
<LD>   Given that many of the insurance industry's troubles were of its
own making, it's understandable that consumer and taxpayer groups in
Washington have criticized the legislation as a "bailout" for the
politically powerful.</LD>
<TE>   But "necessary evil" would be a more accurate term.</TE>
<TE>   Truth is, since the attack on the World Trade Center, the
resulting scarcity of terrorism insurance has caused real distress
for everyone from developers to contractors to building owners to
high-rise tenants. Few in the public at large paid attention to that
distress, but then who focuses much on insurance?</TE>
<TE>   "People think insurance is boring, but it is so fundamental to the
economy," says Janet Jones, president of Elkins/Jones, a large Santa
Monica-based insurance brokerage firm.</TE>
<TE>   The 3,200 companies that peddle property and casualty insurance,
taking in $300 billion in premiums each year, provide the protective
shield on which the commercial world depends. Simply put, nothing
gets erected without insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The insurance industry already was hurting when the terrorists
struck.</TE>
<TE>   Most companies had slashed premiums during the 1990s, seeking to
increase their share of business and attract money that could then be
invested in stocks and bonds. But the bull market ended, and company
investment gains shrank just as underwriting losses mounted.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, premiums proved inadequate to cover rising damage claims
for a variety of hazards. Included in the litany: asbestos, "killer
mold," tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the horror of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance companies have stepped up to pay claims that so far
total $50 billion and certainly will go higher. Yet they have shied
away from underwriting new policies against future episodes of
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Many reinsurance companies -- those that back up primary insurers
by covering the highest levels of risk -- also have refused to cover
terrorism because they could find no precedent for the Sept. 11
tragedy, no grounds for calculating the odds.</TE>
<TE>   "They feared that the risk was more than they could ever dream
about," says Edward Abbott, chairman of Abacus Capital, a real estate
investment firm based in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, banks and other lenders have been demanding
that real estate interests buy terrorism insurance. In turn, property
owners have found themselves in a terrible squeeze.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, only a relative few firms -- including American
International Group Inc., the Lloyds of London pool of underwriters
and smallish Ace Ltd. of Bermuda -- have continued to write terrorism
coverage. And their offerings are hugely expensive. Premiums run
nearly $1.5 million to cover a $20-million office building, compared
with conventional insurance charges of $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   The higher rates even have trickled down to homeowners. Their
insurance bills are expected to rise an average of 9% next year on
top of an 8% increase this year. Through the 1990s, by comparison,
homeowners' insurance rose about 3% annually.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone with property is "affected by the increased cost of
reinsurance generally," explains Marcia Salkin, a government affairs
official at the National Assn. of Realtors in Washington.
"Ultimately, we are all dependent on the financial stability of the
insurance industry."</TE>
<TE>   Will the new law deliver? Probably.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation creates a three-year, $100-billion program under
which the government will cover 90% of terrorism-related losses after
insurance companies pay an initial amount. Insurers will be
responsible for the remaining 10%.</TE>
<TE>   The industry will be required to repay the government -- through a
surcharge on commercial policyholders -- for payments up to $10
billion in the first year, $12.5 billion in the second year and $15
billion in the third year.</TE>
<TE>   The law also requires that practically all property-insurance
companies offer terrorism coverage, so the very numbers of additional
firms in the market should push rates down.</TE>
<TE>   "Things could get cheaper," says Michael Biletski, a managing
director of Aon Corp., a large Chicago-based insurance brokerage and
services firm. After all, one way companies may compete for business
is "by quoting low premiums."</TE>
<TE>   Longer term, the industry's specialized think tanks -- such as
Applied Insurance Resources of Boston -- are likely to devise
sophisticated calculations of terrorism risks, just as they have done
for hurricanes and earthquakes. Such financial models are based on
loss histories and advice from experts in Britain and Israel,
countries all too familiar with terrorists' bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The need for terrorism insurance is, in many ways, a sad</TE>
<TE>   reflection on the times in which we live. But it is a need
nonetheless.</TE>

<HD>Oil Analysts Confused on Gasoline Policy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two oil analysts who predicted wartime gas prices of $4 a gallon
in "State Could Face Gasoline Price Hikes" (Nov. 18) unfortunately
confused foreign and environmental policy and inappropriately used
out-of-date information.</LD>
<LD>   The state government's policies are designed to ensure the
cleanest-burning gasoline at the lowest possible price. No one can
say for sure what will happen to the global price of crude oil in
unsettled times. But this much is certain: the state's deadline for
removing MTBE from gasoline does not occur in the next few months. It
is Dec. 31, 2003.</LD>
<LD>   When that deadline was set, the oil companies were given a full
extra year in order to prevent high gas prices. In his executive
order, Gov. Gray Davis specifically referred to his commitment to
prevent a price spike as the reason he postponed the mandatory
removal of MTBE. (The ban is needed because MTBE pollutes ground
water.)</LD>
<TE>   To be clear: No new environmental rule is being introduced in
January. With California's clean fuel and advanced vehicles, ethanol
is no longer a "clean air additive" except in limited, specific
circumstances. It is renewable, may be made in the U.S. and is a
volume extender. It should be accepted or rejected based on those
merits.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the federal administration is rigidly enforcing
obsolete requirements for ethanol. If California is forced to put
ethanol into virtually every gallon of gas, that will be because of
decisions made in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento will continue to advocate maximum flexibility for our
refiners, in most cases producing clean burning gasoline (with or
without ethanol) in the manner that best fits their circumstances.</TE>

<LD>Question: My husband and I are trying to determine whether settling a
delinquent credit account for less than we owe might be better than
continually making late payments. We are talking about thousands of
dollars in debt that carries high interest rates. We're really
strapped, mostly from using credit cards to keep our kids in college,
and just cannot get on top of some of these debts. They have been
dogging us for six to seven years, and they're just getting larger.
How much damage does a settlement with a creditor actually do?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Typically, a lot.</LD>
<LD>   Settling a debt for less than you owe will leave a big black mark
on your credit for the next seven years. Although you won't be dogged
by creditors anymore, you also won't get much slack from other
lenders if you try to apply for credit during that time.</LD>
<TE>   A history of late payments, by contrast, is something that can be
ameliorated. In other words, you can make up for a record of paying
late by establishing a consistent, recent history of on-time
payments.</TE>
<TE>   There's no easy way out of the hole you've dug for yourselves.</TE>
<TE>   The best way to get on top of your debt is to do whatever it takes
to pay it off. Tighten your belts, take a second job, sell a second
car. If the kids are still in college, have them take a semester off
to work and help with their own bills.</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, don't believe any company that tells you that they
can settle your debt for pennies on the dollar and not hurt your
credit. If it sounds too good to be true....</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Find a Resting Place for Money You'll Need Soon</TE>
<TE>   Q: I'm in the military, stationed overseas, and I'm saving more
than 90% of my pay (thanks to no rent, utilities or children).
Unfortunately, savings accounts are no place to really make a return
on my money. I have roughly $15,000 that I'm adding to rapidly, and
would love advice about what to do with it for the next six to eight
months. I eventually want to buy a car with cash when I'm reassigned
to Germany, but would like to have my money working for me until
then.</TE>
<TE>   A: Sometimes our money doesn't need to work for us. Sometimes the
best thing we can do is give our money the day off.</TE>
<TE>   As you'll probably need this money within the year, your priority
should be to keep it somewhere safe and liquid. You want the money to
be there when you need it, after all. Any investment that offers you
high returns is going to entail the risk of losing money, which means
your dream of a new Mercedes could turn into the reality of a
secondhand Beetle.</TE>
<TE>   You might look into investing the cash in a money market account,
which offers slightly higher returns than a savings account. You also
could consider short-term certificates of deposit (check
www.bankrate.com for recent rates).</TE>
<TE>   If you plan to accumulate more money than you need for a car, and
can leave your investment alone for several years, you can think
about ways to put it to work.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best options would be to put $3,000 into a Roth IRA
invested in stock mutual funds and commit to leaving it alone for 30
years, no matter what happens to the markets in that time. By the
end, your returns should more than outpace inflation, and your
withdrawals in retirement would be tax free.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Credit Bureaus Will Look Into Any Surprises</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have 40-plus inquiries on my credit reports at each of the
three credit bureaus. Someone unknown to me apparently was trying to
get mortgage loans. I've tried to contact each of the mortgage
lenders but the process has been tedious. Is there a better way to
handle this?</TE>
<TE>   A: Your first step should be to contact the bureaus, rather than
the lenders, and ask them to investigate these inquiries. Make it
clear you did not authorize them and that you want them removed from
your record.</TE>
<TE>   Because someone is obviously trying to steal your credit identity,
it would also be smart to have a fraud alert put on your files at all
three bureaus. This would make it a bit more difficult for you to get
credit but should help prevent the thief from being able to open
accounts in your name.</TE>
<TE>   You can find out more information about identity theft by visiting
the Federal Trade Commission's Web site, www.ftc.gov.</TE>

<HD>Internet Gambling Makes It Even Easier to Lose Your Shirt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the quiet of their homes, gamblers are clicking their way ever
deeper into debt.</LD>
<LD>   Internet-based gambling -- highly controversial, the subject of
pending legislation and illegal in many states -- is soaring, said
Sebastian Sinclair, president of Christiansen Capital Advisors, a New
York-based company that keeps gambling industry statistics.</LD>
<LD>   Bets placed over the Internet are expected to total about $4
billion this year. That's about one-third more than last year, and
the total is expected to quadruple over the next four years, he
added.</LD>
<TE>   Although all types of gambling are relatively controversial,
Internet gambling is more so for two main reasons.</TE>
<TE>   First, it's illegal in many states -- the only places consumers
can gamble legally are licensed casinos and sports-betting operations
that have been approved by the appropriate state government. In
California and most other states, Internet sites don't qualify, but
operators get around the rules by establishing their businesses
offshore. Still, consumers who use the sites in states where gambling
is illegal are violating the law.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, some experts say Internet games encourage compulsive
gambling, an addictive behavior that can savage family finances.</TE>
<TE>   "The substance that people with gambling problems abuse is money,"
said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Counsel on
Problem Gambling in Washington. "Where a cocaine addict might be able
to go through $1,000 in drugs in a night, for a gambler that's just
one hand of blackjack."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Credit Card Debt</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, Internet gamblers often use credit cards to
place their bets. Not only can that greatly increase the amount of
money immediately available for gambling, losses racked up on losing
bets come back to haunt the gambler at the end of the month -- and
with an interest rate attached that can run 20% or higher.</TE>
<TE>   Heather M., a Palm Springs writer who asked to remain anonymous,
lost $40,000 over a five-year period playing video poker on her home
computer.</TE>
<TE>   "I won $4,000 one night when my husband was watching a television
special on Internet gambling," she said. "I said, 'Right, honey.
Isn't that awful? Come and look at this.' But it was the beginning of
a nightmare. I was completely out of control."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, problem gamblers are not the sole purview of the
Internet. Giman Gandapermana says his family's finances were ruined
by gambling, but it was an Indian casino that opened near his home in
Yucaipa that proved his family's undoing. Gandapermana said he's
still struggling to pay off $50,000 in credit card debts for gambling
losses that were largely run up by a family member.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to the vast expansion of Indian gaming establishments,
California recently surpassed New Jersey in gambling revenue, with
about $6 billion in annual receipts. The Golden State's legal
gambling revenue now ranks second only to Nevada, which boasts
gambling receipts of $9.3 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   "You borrow money and say, 'I'll pay it back when I win,' " said
Gandapermana, a clinical scientist. "But you still have to pay the
bills."</TE>
<TE>   The average problem gambler has 14 to 16 credit cards and owes
friends and family members thousands of dollars, Whyte said.</TE>
<TE>   "For the problem gambler, the only time you have to admit that
you've lost is when you are out of the game," he said. "As long as
you can keep gambling, as long as you can beg, borrow or steal enough
to keep going, you can tell yourself that you're one bet away from
winning it all back."</TE>
<TE>   Although all types of gambling can create debts, Internet gambling
may cause people to fall further faster because it allows gamblers to
feed their addiction quickly, privately and at any time of the day or
night.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no lag time between the urge to gamble and the ability
to scratch that itch," said Tom Tucker, executive director of the
California Council on Problem Gambling.</TE>
<TE>   "With traditional gambling, you have to decide to get up and get
dressed and go to the ATM and then to the casino," Tucker said. "With
Internet gambling, you can sit there in your shorts and use your
credit card to clean out your family bank account."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Heather M. was usually dressed in her pajamas while
gambling online.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Curbing Online Casinos</TE>
<TE>   Both business and government have taken steps to curb
Internet-based gambling. The House of Representatives this year
passed an Internet gambling measure that would have barred banks from
funding Internet bets. The measure failed to pass the Senate.
However, industry experts expect the bill, or something similar, to
be reintroduced next year.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer turned his
attention to online gaming, securing an agreement from New York-based
Citibank to block credit card sales from online casinos. Other credit
card issuers, including MBNA Corp., Discover Financial Services and
American Express Co., have followed suit.</TE>
<TE>   Credit card companies have a compelling business reason to deny
the charges. Because online gambling is illegal in most states, these
companies may have difficulty collecting the debt if gamblers dispute
the charges. A California woman won a suit three years ago that wiped
away $70,000 of her online gambling debts. Her claim: Online gambling
is illegal, so the debt is unenforceable. Web sites, such as
www.gamblersrecover.com, have since sprung up to promote the same
argument.</TE>
<TE>   But there's little to stop online gambling sites from miscoding
the transaction to get it through, industry experts say. Every type
of transaction -- from a retail sale to a dinner purchase -- has a
numeric code to signal the type of sale. If a casino codes a gambling
purchase as entertainment or food, for example, it would be difficult
for the credit card company to know any better.</TE>
<TE>   As long as there are gamblers who have computers, there will be
sites ready, willing and able to take their money, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fundamental factor that's driving this industry is demand,"
Sinclair said. "Demand creates supply. And there is tremendous demand
that will make Internet gambling difficult to stop."</TE>

<HD>Tax Talk Stokes Interest in Dividends</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the late 1990s, a generation of stock investors came to regard the
cash dividend as a quaint concept whose time had come and gone.</LD>
<LD>   But 2  1/2 years of mostly falling share prices have given new
life to the idea that equities should provide investors with a
regular payment of cash money -- an income stream that would be there
even if capital gains weren't.</LD>
<LD>   The idea may get a big boost in 2003: Wall Street is abuzz with
talk that the new Republican-controlled Congress will seek to change
tax laws to enhance the appeal of dividends.</LD>
<TE>   Even firms that historically have been unwilling to share profit
with stockholders via the payment of dividends -- including many
technology giants -- could feel compelled to change their policy if
Congress acts.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, at computer networker Cisco Systems Inc.'s annual
meeting, the company faced a shareholder resolution calling for the
initiation of a dividend. The measure, opposed by management, failed
by a 10-1 ratio, Cisco said.</TE>
<TE>   But CEO John Chambers told shareholders that Cisco isn't
inherently opposed to paying dividends. "If tax policy were to change
or if we would hear more shareholders want to do it, we always want
to listen," Chambers said. "We don't have a religious view on
dividends."</TE>
<TE>   Can small investors learn to care about dividends? Should they
care? For many, it could be a tough sell. Long-term investors can
argue that they don't buy stocks for current income, and that they
don't need it in tax-deferred retirement accounts. Some may not
relish having to decide how to reinvest that cash each quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Dividend proponents say those concerns miss the point. If stock
price appreciation is much harder to come by in this decade than the
last -- a distinct possibility -- then dividend income could mean the
difference between a poor return and a decent return on equities.</TE>
<TE>   That may be conceptual now, but it won't be in 2010 if investors
are looking back and asking why their portfolios haven't grown.</TE>
<TE>   "A dividend," said Charles Carlson, editor of the dividend-focused
DRIP Investor newsletter in Hammond, Ind., "is a bird in the hand."</TE>
<TE>   History shows that in the 1940s, 1960s and 1970s, a large portion
of the average annual total return on blue-chip stocks came from
dividends.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, for example, the average total return on the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was 7.8% a year, according to data
tracker Ibbotson Associates. Dividend income accounted for 3.3% of
that total; the rest was capital appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   An economic question also is part of the debate over dividends:
Should company managers hoard profit and make the decisions as to how
to spend that money, or would the economy be better off if managers
gave more of the money to investors and let them decide where to put
it -- for example, into other stocks, into goods and services or
toward some other use?</TE>
<TE>   "I think the market is pleased when capital is dispersed," said
Harry DeAngelo, a USC business professor who has studied the issue of
capital allocation. He believes that corporate managers have a
tendency to retain an excess amount of profit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Double Taxation</TE>
<TE>   The problem for the cash dividend is that the federal tax code has
long been stacked against it, because the law facilitates double
taxation: First, companies pay income tax on their gross profit. If
firms then share any of their net profit with stockholders through
dividends, the investors owe personal income tax on those dividends.</TE>
<TE>   The double-taxation issue hasn't put an end to dividends. Indeed,
the majority of blue-chip companies have continued to make payouts.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Exxon Mobil Corp. pays an annual dividend of 92 cents
a share, which at the stock's Friday price of $34.22 works out to an
annualized dividend yield of 2.7% (divide the dividend by the share
price). That's far above the current record-low 1.01% average yield
on money market mutual funds.</TE>
<TE>   But the overall significance of dividends declined sharply in the
1990s, in part because tax-code changes in 1997 added new emphasis to
the appeal of capital gains over dividends.</TE>
<TE>   The top federal capital gains tax rate (that is, the tax on gains
realized on assets held more than one year) was cut from 28% to 20%
in 1997. By contrast, dividends have continued to be taxed as
ordinary income, at a current top tax rate of 38.6%.</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 capital-gains tax cut occurred as Americans increasingly
were turning to the stock market through retirement savings plans.
What's more, the continuing drop in interest rates and inflation in
the 1990s, and the rise of the Internet, fueled a new excitement for
hot young companies that held the promise of a substantial payoff --
but in the form of a soaring stock price, not through cash dividends.</TE>
<TE>   Even for established companies, by the late 1990s, the preferred
method for returning profit to shareholders was via stock buybacks
rather than dividends. In a buyback, a company buys its own shares in
the market, with the idea of helping to drive up the price and
produce a capital gain for shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Again, the tax code favored buybacks: Companies could borrow money
to use for buybacks and get a deduction for the interest expense.</TE>
<TE>   "The tax code has a huge and irrational bias toward favoring
debt," said Robert Willens, a tax expert at brokerage Lehman Bros. in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   By the bull market peak in early 2000, the dividend was a relic.
The average dividend yield of the S&amp;P 500 index firms hit a record
low of 1.1%. That was a function both of the stagnation of dividend
growth in the late '90s and the surge in share prices.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 dividend yield since has risen modestly, to about 1.7%
now. But the rebound has been limited because the plunge in stock
prices during the bear market (which automatically would be expected
to push yields up) has coincided with a slide in the number of firms
raising dividend payments: As corporate earnings crumbled in 2001,
companies became more reluctant to pay out in dividends what little
profit they had.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, a total of 1,701 U.S. companies raised dividend payments,
according to S&amp;P. In 2001, the number of firms raising dividends
plunged to 1,326.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Below-Average Yield</TE>
<TE>   The result is that the S&amp;P 500 annualized dividend yield still is
far below its 80-year historical average of about 4.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Other factors also have been involved in depressing the S&amp;P yield.
One is that S&amp;P officials have significantly restructured the index
since the mid-1990s, adding many technology firms that don't pay
dividends.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, 436 of the 500 companies in the index paid some kind of
dividend. Today, 351 of the 500 are dividend payers.</TE>
<TE>   But could changes in tax laws turn more companies into dividend
payers? And would that benefit investors, and the economy, in the
long run?</TE>
<TE>   Congress certainly could make it more palatable for companies to
pay, or raise, cash dividends. One proposal that has been floated
periodically is to allow companies to take a tax deduction for
dividends they pay.</TE>
<TE>   Another proposal would bring back, and raise, the "dividend
exclusion" that investors were allowed until 1986. Until then,
investors could exclude from tax the first $200 of dividends they
received each year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be looking for a dividend exclusion, but at a much higher
level -- perhaps $800 to $1,000 per person," Lehman's Willens said of
possible tax-reform ideas.</TE>
<TE>   The effect could be to make stock dividend income more appealing
than, say, interest earned on Treasury bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Another idea: Tax dividends at the same maximum 20% rate that
applies to long-term capital gains, putting dividend income on equal
footing with gains.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Talk in Congress</TE>
<TE>   In Congress, there is talk about proposals like these. But so far,
it is just talk. Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Calif.), the chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, has not laid out any agenda for
addressing dividend taxation, an aide said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But in an interview on CNBC in September, Thomas suggested that
the approach of a dividend-deduction for companies was appealing to
him. He also said, however, that taxing dividends and capital gains
at the same rate is "one of the good options that we have out there."</TE>
<TE>   If Congress can resolve issues of lost Treasury revenue because of
a dividend tax change, and President Bush goes along, many companies
would be compelled to rethink their dividend policies, Willens and
others said.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, dividends are no panacea. A dividend can cushion a
stock's price, but won't necessarily keep it from collapsing. In
other words, stocks are risky investments, dividend or no.</TE>
<TE>   Dividends also aren't sacred. Companies generally are loath to cut
dividends once their level is set -- because it sends a troubling
message to the market, but cuts do happen. Many utility stock
investors have found that out the hard way since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Would higher dividend payouts help the economy? That will remain
an open question. Managements must retain enough profit to keep the
business growing and perhaps to fund big opportunities that come
along, or risk starving the company.</TE>
<TE>   But the din of criticism about failed mergers over the last
decade, and more recently about the level of executive enrichment at
shareholders' expense, may add to pressure on companies to become
much more generous with dividend payouts.</TE>
<TE>   "There is such a level of corporate distrust at this point," said
USC's DeAngelo. A shift to higher dividends, he said, "would be a way
of responding to that."</TE>

<LD>Asia Global Crossing Files for Chapter 11</LD>
<LD>   Asia Global Crossing Ltd., a key asset of ailing Global Crossing
Ltd., filed a Chapter 11 petition to reorganize its debt and sell its
assets to a new venture formed by a Chinese telecommunications
company.</LD>
<LD>   The long-expected petition, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New
York, would turn over control of 24,200 miles of a sophisticated
underwater high-speed, fiber-optic network to Asia Netcom, created by
government-owned China Netcom Communications Group Corp., for $120
million. Joining in Asia Netcom are venture firms Newbridge Capital
and Softbank Corp.'s Softbank Asia Infrastructure Fund. Asia Netcom
would have a $150-million bank line of credit under the deal.</LD>
<TE>   The deal, if approved by the court, would represent the first
overseas investment by a Chinese telecom firm and one of the few
investments by any government-run enterprise.</TE>

<TE>   Tenet Says SEC Has Begun Informal Inquiry</TE>
<TE>   Hospital chain Tenet Healthcare Corp., already under federal
scrutiny for its Medicare reimbursements, said the Securities and
Exchange Commission has begun an informal inquiry into the company,
including examining the unusually high volume of Tenet stock trades
in the last few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In an open letter to shareholders, Tenet Chairman and Chief
Executive Jeffrey C. Barbakow said executives met with regional SEC
representatives. The meeting included questions about Tenet's
Medicare payments and sales of Tenet shares by company insiders.</TE>
<TE>   Barbakow said he did not know whether the SEC intends to launch a
formal investigation, but he said the Santa Barbara-based company was
cooperating fully. In a formal investigation the SEC typically
obtains subpoena powers to gather additional information.</TE>

<TE>   BMG Unveils Revamped Royalties</TE>
<TE>   Breaking ranks with industry rivals, Bertelsmann Music Group
launched what the company called a "fairer, more transparent"
accounting system for royalty payments, a move that artist
representatives say could ease the controversy over whether
performers are being cheated by their labels.</TE>
<TE>   BMG, home to such acts as Carlos Santana, OutKast and Britney
Spears, is the first major music company to scrap contract deductions
that artists say obfuscate their earnings.</TE>
<TE>   The action came as lawmakers in California and New York have begun
to scrutinize complaints from pop stars about questionable accounting
practices in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   In the years ahead, BMG plans to introduce a contract model in
which the company would control an act's recording career for fewer
years but share in new revenue streams, including concert proceeds
and sponsorship and film deals.</TE>
<TE>   None of the four other music giants -- Universal Music Group, Sony
Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and EMI Group -- intends to
follow suit anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trade Pact to Benefit Some California Firms</TE>
<TE>   Some California technology firms will enjoy lower tariffs and
streamlined customs processing under a wide-ranging free-trade
agreement between the U.S. and Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   The pact, the first for the United States in Asia, is expected to
bolster U.S. efforts to create a free-trade zone across the southeast
part of the continent, already the third-largest market for U.S.
goods.</TE>
<TE>   Expanding U.S. commercial relations in Asia is good news for
California. In addition to helping Silicon Valley firms such as
Solectron Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which use Singapore
as a regional base and production platform, the accord expands access
to the Asian city-state for banks, insurance companies and law firms.</TE>

<TE>   L.A. Developer Faces $184-Million Verdict</TE>
<TE>   A jury awarded $184 million in damages to former investors in a
series of limited partnerships run by Los Angeles apartment tycoon
Alan I. Casden.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles jury awarded $92 million in punitive damages to
about 18,000 investors who sold their interests in Casden-run
partnerships that owned apartment complexes. The action came four
days after the same panel granted $92 million in general damages to
the investors after finding Casden and his associates at Casden
Properties Inc. guilty of violating federal securities laws and
breaching their fiduciary duties.</TE>
<TE>   Casden Properties is owned by Denver-based Apartment Investment &amp;
Management Co. Casden is expected to appeal.</TE>

<TE>   Boeing Launches New Delta IV Rocket</TE>
<TE>   After more than $1.5 billion in development costs and a year of
delays and with much of its reputation on the line, Boeing Co.
launched its new Delta IV rocket, putting the company back in the
race against its archrival Lockheed Martin Corp. for supremacy in
space.</TE>
<TE>   Powered by the nation's first new rocket engine in nearly three
decades, the Delta IV took off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., and placed
a European communications satellite in orbit, lifting the prospects
for Boeing's hobbled launch business.</TE>
<TE>   More than 5,000 Boeing engineers and designers work on the rocket
program in Huntington Beach and Canoga Park. The Delta IV's success
means Boeing can better compete with Lockheed to win more launch
contracts from the Air Force, which now is the primary customer given
the meltdown of the U.S. telecommunications business and the
resulting slump in the commercial satellite industry.</TE>
<TE>   In August, Lockheed successfully launched its new rocket, the
Atlas V. A Delta IV failure would have put in jeopardy Boeing's
prospects for launches worth as much as $40 billion over the next 20
years.</TE>

<TE>   Billionaire Proposes to Buy Vivendi Assets</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire Marvin Davis and a group of investors approached
Vivendi Universal with a proposal to buy its entertainment assets,
including Universal Studios and its theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   Some Vivendi insiders said the $13-billion offer was too low to be
taken seriously, but others said that, depending on how it was
structured, it could provide the answer to many of Vivendi's
financial woes -- including nearly $19 billion in media debt.</TE>
<TE>   Resistance is expected from Barry Diller, co-chief executive of
Vivendi's entertainment unit. Diller has been cool about Davis'
overtures, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PUC to Probe Gas Market Activity</TE>
<TE>   State regulators ordered an investigation of whether market
manipulation figured in natural-gas price spikes that inflated
customer bills and power generation costs during the 2000-01 energy
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Without discussion, the California Public Utilities Commission
voted 4 to 0 to examine gas trading practices by Sempra Energy -- the
parent of Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric --
and other companies.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is the latest effort to root out the causes and
place blame for the energy crisis that brought major utilities to
their knees and thrust the state into the power-buying business.</TE>
<TE>   The probe initially will concentrate on Sempra and its
subsidiaries. But it will expand to include Edison International's
Southern California Edison and PG&amp;E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co., their affiliated companies and several gas suppliers. The PUC
ordered them to preserve their documentation and tell the commission
what they know about gas market activity that may have affected
prices.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Labor Stages Protests at 400 Wal-Mart Stores</TE>
<TE>   Organized labor launched an offensive against Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
-- the nation's largest retailer and an emphatically nonunion
employer -- by staging protests outside 400 stores across the
country.</TE>
<TE>   The protests, which drew support from feminists, students and
religious leaders, were an attempt by labor to stir debate about the
giant discounter and to build allies in its long-running campaign to
organize Wal-Mart employees. The United Food and Commercial Workers
union in particular has poured resources into its attempts to block
or organize Wal-Mart, so far with limited success.</TE>
<TE>   Other unions, including those representing garment workers and
janitors, have said their members' jobs and wages are threatened by
Wal-Mart's growth.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters say Wal-Mart's emphasis on low prices comes at the
expense of employee wages and benefits. In addition, the National
Organization for Women alleges the corporation discriminates against
women, saying they make up a majority of low-paid sales clerks but
are rarely placed in management positions. The company denies that
allegation.</TE>

<TE>   Dow Climbs for Seventh Straight Week</TE>
<TE>   Blue-chip stocks notched their seventh straight week of gains, the
longest streak in more than four years, as more investors bet that
the bear market finally ended in early October.</TE>
<TE>   Some upbeat economic reports help stoke the week's rally, despite
the continuing threat of war between the U.S. and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   With the market in what has historically been its strongest period
of the year -- November through January -- many institutional money
managers don't want to take the chance of missing a substantial
rebound, analysts said, even if it doesn't extend far into 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 40.31 points on Friday to
8,804.84 amid mild profit taking, but for the week the index rose
2.6%.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index gained 2.3% for the week, while
the Nasdaq composite surged 4.1%, closing Friday at 1,468.74, its
highest since June 19. Nasdaq is benefiting as battered technology
stocks continue to revive from their dramatic collapse since 2000.</TE>

<HD>Cadillac Propelled by 'Slade Star Power</HD>
<DH>Escalade-driving celebrities help rekindle interest in a
luxury brand that has lost its luster in recent years</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Terril Yue Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant showed up at the mysterious party at an abandoned bank on
South Flower Street in downtown Los Angeles, as did Leonardo DiCaprio
and Rosanna and Patricia Arquette. They and a few hundred other
guests had been lured by the vaguely worded invitation from one of
L.A.'s premier celebrity-party organizers: "Jeffrey Best and Cadillac
present Club EXT."</LD>
<LD>   It sounded like the opening of a new nightclub, with a typical
guest list of trendsetters and buzz-generators. Staff were dressed
all in black. Rock music pulsated through the darkness. Partygoers
danced in cages on platforms.</LD>
<LD>   But the guest of honor at the January 2001 bash, greeting visitors
as they entered, stood still: It was a Cadillac Escalade EXT, the
pickup truck version of the $50,000 Escalade sport utility vehicle.</LD>
<TE>   The truck was being shown publicly for the first time, a day
before it was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show. The party was
part of a plan to help Cadillac, the General Motors Corp. luxury
brand popular mainly with the retired golf set, capture that elusive
hipness factor and appeal to the under-60 crowd -- and if possible
even to thirtysomethings.</TE>
<TE>   On their way out of the party, guests were given black T-shirts
bearing the Cadillac wreath and crest. Before long, people wearing
the T-shirts began showing up in trendy L.A. fitness clubs -- a home
run for GM marketers, bringing more cachet to Cadillac than any
multimillion-dollar ad campaign could.</TE>
<TE>   Thus did Cadillac break through to members of the finicky "in"
crowd who are meticulous about where they live and what they wear --
and drive -- and who can afford the gas-gulping truck that gets 12 to
15 miles per gallon.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, Jennifer Lopez was singing about her "'Slade" in
"Love Don't Cost a Thing." The Escalade also worked its way into
lyrics of songs by rappers Nelly ("Then I slide up in an Escalade,
inside it's like an Ice Capade"), South Park Mexican, Lox, E40, Tela
and 112. The hulking SUV appeared in music videos by recording
artists Ludacris and Usher. In the music video "Can't Deny It,"
featuring Fabolous and Nate Dogg, the Escalade is the star of the
clip, with slow, panning shots caressing the truck's angular panels.</TE>
<TE>   On television, the Escalade is featured on "JAG" and "The Bernie
Mac Show." Craig Bullock, who goes by the name DJ Homicide of the
group Sugar Ray, showed off four gigantic speakers in the back of his
'Slade on the MTV show "Cribs," which looks at the homes and
possessions of the rich and famous.</TE>
<TE>   On the big screen, the Escalade was one of the cars Nicholas Cage
had to steal in "Gone in 60 Seconds," and an Escalade figures
prominently in the sequel of "The Matrix."</TE>
<TE>   "You can't buy buzz, but you can create it," said Susan Docherty,
the Escalade's marketing manager. "This market is not about what
older people think, but what younger people do."</TE>
<TE>   That young people suddenly are finding a Cadillac cool is a
remarkable turn for a division that in recent years has fallen from
being the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S. to fourth place. The
truck seems to be everywhere in the pop-culture landscape, and its
popularity has taken on a life of its own that goes beyond what
Cadillac had hoped or planned for.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the car of Muhammad Ali, Elvis, kings and queens, and U.S.
presidents," said Cadillac General Manager Mark LaNeve.</TE>
<TE>   Auto industry observers say celebrities caught on because of the
Escalade's size, opulence and in-your-face look. "The Escalade has a
mystique. It ... just reeks of testosterone," said automotive analyst
Rebecca Lindland of consulting firm DRI- WEFA. "It's big and tough.
But it has all these creature comforts."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Luxury SUV</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. was first to enter the full-size luxury SUV market
with the Lincoln Navigator, essentially a variant of the Ford
Expedition that was launched in the fall of 1997. Cadillac followed
in 1998 with the first-generation Escalade, basically a gussied-up
Chevy Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of the Escalade edged out those of the Navigator last year,
31,816 to 31,759. Through the first 10 months of this year, the
Escalade has pushed even further ahead, with 40,665 sold against
24,923 Navigators. (Those are good numbers for a colossal SUV, though
still far short of the more mainstream equivalents sold by Chevrolet
and Ford, which sell well over 100,000 a year.)</TE>
<TE>   The key to the Escalade's appeal, some say, is that it combines
the 98-year-old brand's past glory with state-of-the-art power and
technology.</TE>
<TE>   "Cadillac was always what you associate with dominating the
freeways," said Harley Shaiken, a professor of social and cultural
studies at UC Berkeley who teaches a class called Automobiles and
American Society. "Look at the '59 Cadillac with all those fins. The
spirit of the '59 Cadillac breathes somewhere in the Escalade."</TE>
<TE>   For a long time, Cadillac had lost that spirit. Considered a
world-class product from the 1930s into the 1960s, Cadillac
symbolized the pinnacle of achievement for an automobile owner, a
reward for a career well done. Its cars had more power and gadgetry
than most of the world's premier coaches, from its pioneering air
conditioning to power steering. But in the 1970s, gasoline shortages,
tightening emissions standards and the rising popularity of Japanese
imports dulled Cadillac's luster.</TE>
<TE>   "By the early 1980s they had lost all the magic," said Jim Hossack
of consulting firm AutoPacific in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   High-Powered Misfires</TE>
<TE>   Among the models rolled out in the '80s that failed to catch on
were the under-powered Cimarron, a cousin of the Chevy Cavalier, and
the Allante two-seater with its Italian-built body.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, the German-built Cadillac Catera was intended to woo
younger buyers with a smaller, less expensive car. But it was
ridiculed for being a luxury lightweight and for its TV commercials
featuring an animated duck.</TE>
<TE>   Another misfire was Cadillac's move from rear-wheel drive to
front-wheel drive, while other luxury manufacturers stuck to
rear-wheel drive, generally preferred for high-end sedans.</TE>
<TE>   "These were terrible, egregious errors," Hossack said. "Meanwhile,
Mercedes and BMW were making bigger, better cars."</TE>
<TE>   Even Toyota Motor Corp., known more for reliability than prestige,
surpassed Cadillac, which was the bestselling luxury brand in the
U.S. for decades through 1997. Toyota's Lexus division has been the
nation's bestselling luxury marque since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Cadillac has fared especially poorly in California, where Lexus,
Honda Motor Co.'s Acura, DaimlerChysler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW are
the vehicles that many people aspire to. For the West Coast crowd,
"Cadillac wasn't anything they'd consider," said Chris Tucker,
general sales manager of the Casa de Cadillac dealership in Sherman
Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   But the Escalade has helped reverse the slide, selling well in
California and helping reduce the average age of Cadillac's
customers. The average buyer of the first-generation Escalade, which
came out in the fall of 1998, was 50 years old and earned about
$125,000 a year, compared with Cadillac's overall average age of 62
and annual salary of $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Escalade has brought the age of its average buyer to
about 48 with an income of $171,000, while for Cadillac overall the
average buyer now is 61 and still earns $100,000 a year, according to
GM's profiling.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all for Cadillac, Escalade's popularity is migrating from
celebrity haunts to the suburbs. Tucker said soccer moms come in for
Escalades to carry the kids around. Dads like it, too.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Woodsome, an L.A. attorney in his early 50s, compared the
Navigator, Range Rover and Toyota Land Cruiser with several GM models
and settled on the Escalade. "We felt Cadillac offered the best
combination of value and performance," he said. Woodsome has added an
aftermarket grille and fancy wheels, and his boys, ages 12 and 4,
love the truck as much as he does.</TE>
<TE>   Chief among the Escalade's attributes are its dimensions, and for
the giants of the NBA, size does matter. The Escalade counts
Shaquille O'Neal of the Lakers, Jason Richardson of the Golden State
Warriors and Tyson Chandler and Eddy Curry of the Chicago Bulls as
owners.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Extraordinary Escalades</TE>
<TE>   Chris Mills, a 6-foot, 7-inch forward for the Golden State
Warriors, is known in the NBA as the go-to guy if you want to spend
some major bucks to get your car really, really souped up. Mills is
co-owner of 310 Motoring, a West L.A. customizing shop where NBA
players such as Gary Payton of the Seattle SuperSonics, Penny
Hardaway of the Phoenix Suns and Lindsey Hunter of the Toronto
Raptors go to give their wheels a mega-makeover.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done from the standard to the extraordinary," co-owner Raul
Becerril said.</TE>
<TE>   Standard treatment includes tuning the suspension and exhaust
systems and maybe putting in a killer audio system.</TE>
<TE>   The extraordinary involves installing alligator or ostrich
interiors and supercharging the engine from the regulation 345
horsepower to as many as 600 horses. There's also lots of wood that
can be put in, and as many as six TV screens. Throw in a complete
exterior paint job to match the new interior color scheme, and you
can spend twice as much as the $50,000 the Escalade cost in the first
place.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it's not just athletes who have embraced the Escalade. Legions
of Hollywood celebs have hopped into the truck du jour as well, from
actors Ben Affleck, Martin Lawrence, Whoopi Goldberg and Adam Sandler
to recording artists Whitney Houston, Snoop Dogg and Queen Latifah --
who made headlines last week after she was pulled over in North
Hollywood in her 2003 Escalade and arrested when she flunked a
sobriety test.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Careful Marketing</TE>
<TE>   GM didn't offer any financial inducements to celebrities, who
frequently request longtime loaners or free samples of hot cars.
Instead, Cadillac put on a few events in New York and L.A., including
the downtown soiree and a GQ party in March at the Sunset Room on
Sunset Boulevard, where GM used Escalades to ferry guests around.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't need to do a ton of [events] when you think that these
are the people setting the trends, said marketing manager Docherty.
"You just need to get to them."</TE>
<TE>   Cadillac planned its marketing carefully, trying to strike the
right chord with potential customers. It has kept track of Escalade
awareness through surveys such as one in April by Zandl Group. The
New York market research firm found that the Escalade was the top
model that boys ages 13 to 17 said they wanted to own.</TE>
<TE>   The Escalade may be the hot vehicle of the moment, but most trends
peter out.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the 'Slade soon may get competition from another GM
division that has just come out with another monster vehicle: the
Hummer H2. The over-the-top truck, designed with input from Arnold
Schwarzenegger and also priced at about $50,000, went on sale this
summer. And 310 Motoring already has some H2s lined up for
customization.</TE>

<CX>   Cadillac Escalade -- A Nov. 24 Business section article on the
Cadillac Escalade reported that Laker basketball player Kobe Bryant
attended a January 2001 party hosted by Cadillac. In fact, Bryant did
not attend the party and has no marketing or endorsement relationship

<LD>A Human-Rights Issue That Politicians Must Address</LD>
<LD>   To President Bush, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Sen. Barbara Boxer, Gov.
Gray Davis, representatives, state senators and members of the state
Assembly: I challenge each of you to read Fred Dickey's disturbing
but not surprising article on prison rape ("Rape. How Funny Is It?"
Nov. 3). Then I challenge each of you to explain why "prison rape is
the most tolerated act of terrorism in the U.S."</LD>
<LD>   This is not a Republican, Democratic, conservative or liberal
issue. This is a human-rights issue located right here in our
backyards and not a call for pampering prisoners. As the cliche goes:
"You do the crime, you do the time." However, prisons were meant to
deprive convicted criminals the opportunity to perpetrate their evils
on society. Instead, we have given them freedom to hone their
criminal skills and continue their predatory ways without
consequences. As we stand guard at our shores looking for
international terrorists, our own national terrorists are gaining
strength. Wake up! Be brave! This problem can be solved.</LD>

<TE>   I found the concept of addressing the issue of prison rape
completely ridiculous. Next we will hear how sending the perpetrators
to Pelican Bay and solitary confinement for their acts would be a
violation of their civil rights. Come on now, these are criminals who
committed crimes that got them in this situation in the first place.
I have no sympathy for child molesters, rapists or other felons who
have committed an atrocious act and are now suffering the
consequences. I always thought this was one of the deterring ways to
keep someone from committing a crime in the first place.</TE>

reality that we regularly sentence people to cruel and unusual
punishment.</TE>

<TE>   Get to Know the Real Echo Park</TE>
<TE>   As a 30-year resident of Echo Park, I was insulted and taken aback
by the extremely negative and misleading article on Echo Park ("Echo
Park Tableaux," photographs by Gregg Segal, text by Vince Beiser,
Nov. 3). The descriptions and photos were more accurate when I first
moved here in 1972 than now. Amid the "down-market collage of small
dance clubs" etc., the writer and photographer neglected to mention
or photograph the thriving antique stores, galleries, coffeehouses,
clubs and restaurants that have been here more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Where were photos of stunning and safe Echo Park Lake, with its
paddle boats, fishers, joggers and walkers? Or the botanical displays
of lovely Elysian Park, filled with picnickers, car shows and soccer
games? Beiser forgot to mention how residents can walk to Dodger
Stadium and the Music Center. And he completely forgot Angelino
Heights, a crucial part of Echo Park and a famous historical center
with many restored residences from the Victorian, Craftsman and Art
Deco periods. Beiser seemed sad to admit that "many residents say the
streets have grown much safer in recent years." If Beiser or Segal
care to drive by again, I'll invite them to tea, and inform them that
they won't have to lock the car when they park in front of my home.
Sorry to disappoint.</TE>

<HD>Popular Greek Wine Is Rained Out for the Year</HD>
<DH>Grapes that produce Hercules' blood rot on the vine after
summer storms strike Nemea. Growers hope for government aid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Derek Gatopoulos</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>NEMEA, Greece</DL>
<LD>The blood of Hercules has run dry.</LD>
<LD>   Normally in the fall, the ancient vineyards in the Nemea region of
southern Greece would be making the year's vintage of the deep red
wine often called "Hercules' blood."</LD>
<LD>   This season, the grapes are rotting on the vine.</LD>
<TE>   Unusually heavy rains during the important pre-harvest period in
late August wiped out the Nemea crop. The same immense storm system
ravaged central Europe and caused billions of dollars worth of
damage.</TE>
<TE>   For this small patch in Europe's southeastern corner, the
devastation was near total. There will be no 2002 vintage of Nemea
red, one of the most popular wines in Greece.</TE>
<TE>   "It was looking like a good year, but then it rained every day and
the grapes couldn't take it," grower Giorgos Balafas said. "I have
[five acres] and nothing survived.... We had no chance."</TE>
<TE>   The typically hot and dry August weather is needed for the Nemea
grapes to properly ripen. Strong-tasting and iodine red, the wine is
often referred to as "Hercules' blood" after the mythological hero
who strangled a lion in this beautiful valley at the start of his
Twelve Labors that set him on the course for immortality.</TE>
<TE>   The 2,330-year-old Temple of Zeus -- Hercules' father -- stands in
the middle of the fabled region's vineyards, about 90 miles southwest
of Athens. Wine making in the area stretches back to antiquity when
Nemea was one of the four hosts of the ancient Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   This year, grapes hang shriveled and marked by patches of mold
across about 5,000 acres of vineyards. More than 95% of Nemea's
trademark grape -- Agiorgitiko -- was destroyed by the freak weather.</TE>
<TE>   Vintners suffered damage throughout Europe. In Italy, growers in
several key regions predict lower yields and quality for this
season's wines.</TE>
<TE>   But nowhere was the damage as severe as in Nemea, where individual
growers lost from 90% to 100% of their grapes.</TE>
<TE>   The head of Nemea's wine cooperative, Giorgos Pigadiotis, pulled
out a bunch of withered grapes and threw them on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "They are so light, there's nothing left inside them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The annual yield of Nemea grapes normally totals more than 15,000
metric tons of wine. "There won't even be enough wine this year to
fill a barrel in my cellar," Pigadiotis said.</TE>
<TE>   Many Greeks favor Nemea over other domestic reds for its stability
and price. A bottle of "Hercules blood" ranges from about $3.90 to
$7.85 at shops, and it's about $1.95 a bottle if bought straight from
the barrel.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers in the main export markets -- Germany, the Netherlands,
France and Belgium -- will also be affected, although sales there
will be cushioned some because Nemea had a bumper harvest last year.</TE>
<TE>   The rain has left Nemea farmers campaigning to get financial
assistance from the government, as promised by Agriculture Minister
Giorgos Drys, who toured the region in late September.</TE>
<TE>   "This would have been a great year ... but unfortunately, the
rains and the dampness came before the harvest," said wine chemist
Christos Peppas, who works at the cooperative. "The Agiorgitiko is a
very sensitive variety. It's a big grape and it rots easily."</TE>
<TE>   Next year?</TE>
<TE>   "If it rains that often and that hard, there's nothing farmers can
do," he said. "It's up to the sky."</TE>

<HD>Afghan Youngsters Again Among the Forgotten</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Reeka doesn't talk much. She has no shoes or socks, and her tiny toes
are like ice. At 5, she has spent much of her life in the Kabul
orphanage.</LD>
<LD>   "My father told me, 'Don't use your shoes,' " Reeka said in a
squeaky whisper, her voice muffled by a hand that hid her mouth as
she spoke. She has long since outgrown the shoes she arrived with
three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Like many of the more than 800 children at this shabby orphanage
on the western edge of Kabul, Reeka was left by her only surviving
parent, her father, who has since remarried. He occasionally comes to
see her. Others are here because their families were too poor to care
for them.</LD>
<TE>   When the Taliban collapsed last year, reports of the grim
conditions at the orphanage brought help from international and local
aid agencies. But a year later, most of the aid workers are gone and
the children remain -- their numbers rising.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while, everyone was coming and wanting to give, bringing
clothes and blankets," said Mohammed Yunus, a gray-bearded man in
charge of the dormitories. "But not anymore."</TE>
<TE>   There are new swings on the brown, treeless grounds; a few
children kick a soccer ball donated along with clothes and other
toys. In February, U.S. Marines handed out teddy bears, candy, wool
hats and gloves.</TE>
<TE>   But little else has changed.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the cement-block building, dirt still cakes the grimy,
unpainted walls. There is no heat in the dormitories, and in some
rooms, conditions are even worse than a year ago. Thin mattresses lie
on the floor to accommodate the increasing number of children, who
share dirty blankets and wrap themselves in ragged layers against the
chill.</TE>
<TE>   Meals -- provided by the World Food Program -- are regular but not
plentiful. Breakfast is green tea and bread. For lunch, the children
get a bowl of rice and beans or potatoes, and they have hot soup for
dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Each day, desperate parents or other relatives try to leave more
children outside the gates.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't say no; we just say 'Please go away and check with us
later.' But we know there is no room here. We know there won't be
room later, but we want to give them hope," Yunus said.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 20 children sleep in each room. Small metal cots line
the walls like sentries, ancient and creaky.</TE>
<TE>   Reeka shares her bed with four others. "Together with my friends,
we sleep under one sheet. Sometimes it's cold but just a little," she
said quietly.</TE>
<TE>   As winter approaches, temperatures in Kabul hover near freezing at
night.</TE>
<TE>   The staff has tried to make the orphanage more cheerful; colorful
streamers hang in the kindergarten room and pictures cut from
magazines are taped to the walls. One shows a small golden-haired
girl in prayer. During the Taliban era, such images were forbidden.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know where that came from. It's not us, but someone gave
it to us and we are polite," said Ahmed Zia, a teacher.</TE>
<TE>   There is no electricity, although the cash-strapped government
sent some workers last week to see about putting in wiring. A
generator provides about 2 1/2 hours of power a day.</TE>
<TE>   There are three water pumps, but only one works; it provides
enough water for the children to wash once a week. The water tank is
heated by a wood fire. Iran built 10 showers since last year, but
they are broken.</TE>
<TE>   Old clothes are shoved into a cardboard box; broken sandals and
running shoes are in another for the children to pick through.</TE>
<TE>   Humeira, 6, chews on her light green scarf and twirls to show off
her red floral dress, a gift from her father. Her mother is dead. Her
father remarried, and she and two younger sisters were brought here.
Her older brother stayed at home.</TE>
<TE>   Humeira's sisters, ages 3 and 4, crowd close to her. They push and
shove, then begin to kick each other. Humeira says she would like to
go home, but her family doesn't have enough money for them all.</TE>
<TE>   Adoption is uncommon in Afghanistan, even for Afghans, and there
are few resources for foreigners who might want to adopt Afghan
children.</TE>
<TE>   A kindergarten teacher who only gave her name as Maria expressed
frustration at the fleeting interest in the orphanage.</TE>
<TE>   "We were very popular for a while. People came and looked around
and asked us questions, and then asked us more questions," said
Maria, her head covered in a black scarf. "But they haven't done
anything really."</TE>

<HD>Chinese Provinces Police Salt of the Earth</HD>
<DH>Nation reinforced its monopoly in effort to mandate use of
iodized version, which helps prevent cretinism and boost IQ in
fetuses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Fackler</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>HUIANBAO, China</DL>
<LD>As soon as they saw the empty truck brake suddenly on the deserted
rural highway, the four men in dark-blue uniforms jumped into action.</LD>
<LD>   The truck likely was a scout, slowing to phone a warning to
smugglers close behind. Piling into a white van, the officers roared
down the two-lane road until they found a heavily laden truck
struggling to turn around to avoid the police trap.</LD>
<LD>   "We got him just after he got the call on his cell phone," said Li
Yanming, recounting the chase in China's northern Ningxia region. On
board, the officers found 14 tons of white powdery contraband --
salt.</LD>
<TE>   Li and his colleagues are salt police, 25,000 officers with red
epaulets and gold badges in the shape of salt crystals who enforce
one of the oldest economic policies in the world: the Chinese
government's exclusive right to produce and sell salt.</TE>
<TE>   Although China first imposed the salt monopoly 2,600 years ago,
the police force was created just eight years ago to help fulfill a
modern public health goal.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, China launched a national campaign to fortify all salt
with iodine, needed for healthy brain development in fetuses.</TE>
<TE>   The salt police were set up to enforce the monopoly, shutting down
hundreds of private producers and merchants who had appeared during
the market reforms of the 1980s. The officers also patrol remote
regions like Ningxia, where smugglers sell poor people illegal salt
that is cheaper, but not iodized.</TE>
<TE>   As is often the case under the communist regime, the tactics are
heavy-handed. But experts say they have helped China achieve one of
the biggest health successes in recent history.</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, 90% of China's 1.3 billion people were eating iodized
salt, up from 10% in the 1980s. That means that more than 18 million
of the 20 million children born annually in China have a better
chance of good brain development. By contrast, iodized salt accounts
for only 70% of consumption in the United States, which started
adding the mineral to salt in the 1920s to prevent goiter. That was
before the link with mental development was known.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as the 1980s, researchers were finding entire villages
just miles from Beijing where the average IQ was 60, well below the
norm of 100. A third of villagers suffered from cretinism, a severe
form of mental retardation that often involves stunted growth as well
as loss of speech and hearing.</TE>
<TE>   More than 80% of the 10 million mentally disabled people in China
are victims of iodine deficiency, said Wang Zhilun, a researcher on
endemic diseases at Xi'an Medical School in Shaanxi province.</TE>
<TE>   Studies in China in the 1980s and early '90s by foreign and
Chinese scientists were among the first to establish the connection
between iodine and brain development. They found that just a
teaspoonful consumed over a lifetime prevented cretinism and raised
IQs by 10 to 15 points.</TE>
<TE>   China's success with iodine is a lesson in what it takes to get
things done in this increasingly freewheeling, market-driven society.
Resistance by underfunded local governments was overcome only by a
push from the central leadership.</TE>
<TE>   After years of lobbying by health officials, the breakthrough came
at a 1993 conference in Beijing attended by then-Vice Premier Zhu
Rongji, said Glen Maberly, a researcher who was at the conference.</TE>
<TE>   Maberly, now a professor of international health at Emory
University in Atlanta, says the researchers repeatedly told Zhu that
China was losing tens of millions of IQ points a year.</TE>
<TE>   "At one point, Zhu said, 'We will solve this problem,' " recalled
Maberly. "And that's what it took."</TE>
<TE>   The following year, the government revived the salt monopoly,
which, although officially still in effect, had fallen into neglect
during the market openings of the 1980s. Salt monopolies have existed
in China off and on since the 7th century B.C., when emperors first
used salt revenues to finance strong central government.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994, China has spent more than $100 million to install
iodine-adding technology at salt mills and improve distribution by
state-owned salt companies.</TE>
<TE>   The newly created salt police are controlled by each region's
state-run salt companies -- an unusual arrangement that gives a
producer the power and incentive to go after smugglers.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Iodine deficiency was quickly eliminated in the cities
and many densely populated eastern provinces.</TE>
<TE>   "The monopoly has caused higher prices, but it was necessary to
get the salt into iodine-deficient areas quickly," said Chen Zupei, a
Ministry of Health advisor.</TE>
<TE>   The monopoly has struggled, however, in areas where natural salt
is cheap and abundant, or where local governments continue to be
indifferent.</TE>
<TE>   In Ningxia, officials estimate that only a fifth of salt is bought
from the monopoly. The rest is smuggled in from neighboring Shaanxi
and Inner Mongolia, which have vast salt lakes.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of this wind-swept region of grasslands and cattle and
goat herds welcome the smuggled salt because it costs 1 mao (13
cents) a pound -- one-ninth the salt monopoly price.</TE>
<TE>   Most smuggled salt crosses Yanchi, an eastern county that borders
Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia. Sixteen salt police officers patrol its
2,850 square miles, spending most of their time in ambush along
lonely roads, scanning every passing vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Yang Xingjun, 51, was captured near the village of Huianbao, where
the blacktop highway and crumbling remains of the Great Wall are the
only features visible on the endless plains.</TE>
<TE>   A former farmer who made less than $60 a year coaxing cabbage and
potatoes from dry earth, Yang said in an interview that he jumped at
the chance to earn $50 a night driving a salt truck in from Inner
Mongolia.</TE>
<TE>   He said he knows of iodine's benefits from state education
campaigns. But health is a luxury that Ningxia's poor can't afford.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no money," Yang said. "We can't worry about these things
like city residents can."</TE>

<HD>'Draw!' Settles an Election Tie in Nevada</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joe Cavaretta</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>GOLDFIELD, Nev.</DL>
<LD>A deadlocked election ended Old West-style, with a draw of the cards
in this virtual ghost town.</LD>
<LD>   Republican Dolores "Dee" Honeycutt and Democrat R.J. Gillum, who
tied 107-107 for an open seat on the Esmeralda County Commission,
each pulled a jack, but Gillum's spade beat Honeycutt's diamond.</LD>
<LD>   "Unbelievable," Gillum said. "Only in Goldfield."</LD>
<TE>   He hugged his wife, Rita, as Honeycutt brushed away a tear.</TE>
<TE>   The showdown in Goldfield's ornate courtroom recalled the town's
glory years a century ago, when it was a booming mining center of
20,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the entire county has about 1,000 residents, about one for
every three square miles.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 people were on hand Friday for the card draw -- nearly
half the number of voters who cast ballots Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   County Clerk-Treasurer Kelly Jo Eagan shuffled the deck, then
fanned them out dealer style.</TE>
<TE>   The rules: High card wins, but in case of a tie, spades are
highest and clubs lowest.</TE>
<TE>   In Nevada, the Legislature decides statewide or multiple-county
general elections that end in a tie. All others are determined by
luck.</TE>
<TE>   "What you've got is Nevada political poker," state archivist Guy
Louis Rocha said.</TE>
<TE>   Rocha knew of two other races decided by chance: a 1972 election
in Gabbs that ended with a coin toss, and a Eureka County Commission
primary settled by drawing cards in 1982. The Eureka County
candidates back then both drew eights, forcing a second draw because
no one had thought to specify which suit would prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Rocha had coached Dist. Atty. Patty Cafferata to decide the draw
by suit on the chance that history repeated itself.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you think are the chances of that happening again?"
Cafferata had asked rhetorically on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Gillum not only won the election, he saved some money. The Nov. 5
tally was 107-105 for Honeycutt. Gillum paid about $300 for the
recount, which turned up two more votes for him, producing the tie
and the showdown. Because the results changed, he'll get a refund.</TE>

<HD>Hawaii's Shrinking Violet May Get Federal Protection</HD>
<DH>Critical habitat designation may be given to 255 endangered
plants and two bugs. Landowners fear economic effect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rita Beamish</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>In the nation's most sweeping effort to keep species from
disappearing forever, the federal government may declare more than
one-fifth of Hawaii as "critical habitat" for 255 endangered plants
and two bugs.</LD>
<LD>   They include such little-known characters as Blackburn's sphinx
moth and the Kauai cave wolf spider, as well as the Aupaka violet --
the ultimate in shrinking violets, with only nine plants known to
survive.</LD>
<LD>   In this island state with more unique and endangered species than
any other, nature's rare organisms do get respect, but many
landowners, hunters and state officials believe that the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service is going too far this time.</LD>
<TE>   The critical habitat designation would not lock up Hawaii lands
just for conservation. But uncertainty and suspicion about how the
federal action would play out, including its trigger on additional
state regulation and its potential to inhibit state-private
conservation, is creating a fierce debate.</TE>
<TE>   Landowners across the islands are pleading their case and raising
fears with Fish and Wildlife as it evaluates the economic impacts.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we're going to be sued no matter what we do," said Paul
Henson, the agency's Hawaii field supervisor. "My goal is to build a
good scientific record so when a judge hears the case, he or she will
say, 'You did it right, and you win.' "</TE>
<TE>   The controversy stems from an Earthjustice lawsuit that led to a
1998 U.S. District Court order that directed Fish and Wildlife to
designate the habitat in accordance with the Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   Ranging from ferns to flowers, the 255 Hawaiian species -- some
with just a few plants left -- account for a quarter of the entire
U.S. endangered species list. By definition, they are not well known
or beloved species, but often small, unnoticed plants and creatures
with few or no admirers because they are seldom seen.</TE>
<TE>   Now, they've got the power of federal law as their chief defender.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of protecting the nation's national heritage, it's
precedent-setting" because of the number of species and the vast
expanses of land involved, said David Henkin, attorney for
Earthjustice, a nonprofit, public-interest law firm.</TE>
<TE>   Activity in critical habitat requires federal review only if it is
on federal land or involves federal money, officials say. But
landowners' attorneys and Hawaii's chief forester, Mike Buck, say
state law appears to require that federal critical habitat eventually
be designated as state conservation land as well. That triggers a
stricter regulatory regime that would bar any activity that harms the
protected species.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to have a huge impact," Buck said.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time any agency of the government says, 'We're going to draw
a circle around your land and don't worry about it,' I don't think
anybody that I know quite buys into that," said Dan Davidson,
executive director of the Land Use Research Foundation of Hawaii, a
landowner association that wants to confine the habitat designations
mostly to existing state conservation zones.</TE>
<TE>   The state owns nearly half of the 841,015 acres proposed for plant
habitat, much of it rugged and unusable or already zoned for
conservation. Thirty percent is in private hands, and the military
controls a portion. The state also owns most of the 103,626 acres
proposed as habitat for Blackburn's sphinx moth and the Kauai cave
wolf spider.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Wildlife will address landowners' concerns "case by case"
before settling on permanent boundaries, Henson said. The agency must
consider economic impact and is aware of mainland lawsuits alleging
insufficient attention to that issue.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, however, are wary that economic emphasis could
diminish species protection. Earthjustice would "seriously consider"
returning to court over that, Henkin said.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and Wildlife botanist Greg Koob said the importance of saving
each species goes beyond just its few remaining plants.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a unique life form that's going to disappear off the face
of the Earth if some protection is not given to it. Extinction is
forever," he said. "Biologically, everything is interconnected. Every
species is important. You lose one and there's a trickle-down
effect," with plant pollination and seeds affecting insects and
birds, on up the biological chain.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can write off one species, it's easy to write off the next
one and the next one. Eventually, you've written off too many," Koob
said.</TE>
<TE>   But landowners say there's another side to the story. On the Big
Island of Hawaii, the Liliuokalani Trust has 340 acres of proposed
habitat on the Kona coast. For 40 years, the trust has planned a
large commercial and civic development there to fund its programs for
native Hawaiian children. Now the land is deemed key to survival of a
nettle and the elusive Aupaka violet.</TE>
<TE>   "Critical habitat will cripple the trust's ability to fulfill its
sacred duty," Thomas Kaulukukui Jr., trust chairman, told a Fish and
Wildlife hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Development is not an issue for most of the targeted habitat, said
Buck, administrator of the state Division of Forestry and Wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Buck finds himself in the odd position of promoting species
protection, but worried about huge resources that the state would
need to manage an expanded habitat range, and about restricting
activities like forestry and hunting of feral animals.</TE>
<TE>   "If something is listed as federal critical habitat, there is an
expectation to do proactive things to try and recover these species,"
things like controlling animals and nonnative plants, he said. But
his endangered species budget is only about $2 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Buck is pushing to use the most pristine areas for habitat rather
than putting resources into degraded areas.</TE>
<TE>   Voluntary conservation projects may give landowners some edge.
Land can be excluded from critical habitat if the designation would
interrupt conservation programs that benefit the species, Henson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Although annoying to landowners, the habitat process itself
provides vital information on some of Hawaii's 18,000-plus known
native species, proponents say.</TE>
<TE>   "The biodiversity of Hawaii has many secrets that we have yet to
discern," said Allen Allison, vice president of science at Honolulu's
Bishop Museum. "So letting it disappear before we even discover
what's there is a tragedy."</TE>

<HD>Colorado's Real Estate Boom Flattening Out</HD>
<DH>Low mortgage rates are expected to push sales to record
levels, but more houses and condominiums are going on the market and
taking longer to sell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Tsai</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Five people were in line as backup buyers when Melody Odekirk and her
husband bought their suburban Aurora home 6 1/2 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   She figured that it would be a matter of weeks before they sold
their beloved five-bedroom, three-bath brick ranch home. Three months
later, the price has dropped $45,100, to $249,900, and the Odekirks
just found a buyer.</LD>
<LD>   "I was worried about selling it too fast and the people wanting to
move in before we were ready to get out," Odekirk said. "If somebody
came in and really loved the house, we would do whatever we [could]
to get them in."</LD>
<TE>   Although low mortgage rates are expected to push sales to record
levels in Colorado this year, there are signs that the state is
flirting with becoming a buyers' market for the first time in more
than three years.</TE>
<TE>   Home prices are expected to rise just 4% this year, compared with
at least 10% in each of the past three years, economist Lawrence Yun
of the National Assn. of Realtors said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the number of homes for sale has risen in Colorado
Springs and metropolitan Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "The housing market hasn't collapsed. It's still very hot," said
Michael Beckerman of Coldwell Banker. "But compared to Colorado's own
standard of market activity, it has cooled substantially from the
go-go days before the dot-com bubble burst, when people thought there
was no end to the money cash machine."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the West, housing markets are mixed.</TE>
<TE>   It is a sellers' market in Southern California; Los Angeles home
prices have appreciated 18% in the last year, and San Diego prices
have risen 21%, Yun said.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas keeps setting records for sales of homes, but numbers
are softer around Seattle, where unemployment was 6.8% in September,
up from 4.8% a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, home sales are expected to tie a 1999 record this
year, then calm down after more new homes hit the market next year,
especially if interest rates rise, Yun and National Assn. of Realtors
spokesman Walter Molony said.</TE>
<TE>   The market shift in Denver comes after years of population growth
and median sale prices that rose from $96,100 in 1992 to $227,700
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Denver ranks 10th nationally among cities that the association
compares for median prices. San Francisco was tops with a median
price of $540,500.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of mountain properties in Conifer and Pine Junction, often
considered as second homes, have suffered a double whammy with this
season's wildfires and a slowing economy, Beckerman said.</TE>
<TE>   In metropolitan Denver, single-family home listings in October
were up 17% from last year, according to Metrolist Inc. Condominium
listings were 24% higher, as units stayed on the market longer.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Wiesner, chief financial officer for Coldwell Banker
Residential Brokerage Colorado, said the 23,769 homes and condos on
the market in October were the most for metro Denver since at least
1987, when there were 20,026 listings.</TE>
<TE>   "The market has been hot for the last three years. You could
pretty much sell a house within a month," Wiesner said. "What you've
got now is a more balanced market. It takes you three to four months
to sell, so eventually you're going to have more inventory."</TE>
<TE>   Steve McGuire, a broker associate with Re/Max Professionals Inc.
in Littleton, said the low end of the market is brisk, but homes with
sticker prices above $350,000 have suffered. He expects uncertainty
over Iraq and the economy to discourage iffy customers from buying.</TE>
<TE>   The softening market is hitting rentals too.</TE>
<TE>   In the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Denver, Pearl Manor Apartments
is offering $100 off one month's rent for renewing a lease.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, property manager Renee Harvey has been lowering rents,
rolling over unrented properties from month to month and spending
more time on marketing in the past six months.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been doing this for nine years, and I've never had to work
so hard," Harvey said.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Pikes Peak Assn. of Realtors, meanwhile, reported a
12-year high of 4,325 homes for sale in September in the Colorado
Springs area.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial markets are also slumping. Moodys Investors Service
ranked Denver's commercial real estate market the worst of 53 markets
for investors.</TE>
<TE>   Odekirk, 41, said she went three months with none of the 15 people
who looked at her house making offers.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're paying double mortgages, it feels like a lot longer,"
she said. "Someone's going to get a good deal on this house."</TE>

<HD>Midwife Faces Charges in Home Birth</HD>
<DH>Nan Koehler brought more than 1,000 babies into the world,
but she stopped after a lawsuit. She agreed to do it one last time;
the infant was born brain-damaged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martha Mendoza</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SEBASTOPOL, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Dogs and goats and babies and grandmas converge at Rainbow's End
farm, and in the middle of it all is Nan Koehler, a bold and radical
woman whose cracked, strong hands have coaxed more than a thousand
babies into the world.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve miles away, past vineyards heavy with grapes, lies a young
boy, Trystan Condon, struggling to drag his body an inch forward on a
small blanket. It will take him 10 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   At 2 1/2 years, Trystan cannot say his name, cannot feed himself,
cannot roll over. Medical reports describe him as profoundly
brain-damaged.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors, some doctors and Trystan's parents say Koehler is to
blame. They accuse her of allowing his mother to labor dangerously
long and failing to summon help quickly enough when he was born
struggling to breathe. She faces up to 10 years in prison if
convicted of child endangerment and practicing medicine without a
license. Her preliminary hearing is scheduled for January.</TE>
<TE>   The lives of this baby and this "direct-entry" or lay midwife are
inextricably linked now by issues that go far beyond his delivery in
a Sonoma County garage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Koehler, 61, who was born in Germany and became a Quaker at 16,
considers herself first a mother, second a farmer and third an
idealist. She wrote a book about pregnancy, birth, families and
herbal healing called "Artemis Speaks," which is an essential
reference for many midwives. But her proudest moments, she once said,
were giving birth to her own five children, four at home.</TE>
<TE>   Striding around her farm, she looks like a sweet grandmother with
long blondish-gray braids that swing as she walks. Her big kitchen is
a hub of activity -- grandchildren playing, friends popping in for
mugs of organic herb tea.</TE>
<TE>   For years, she assisted women choosing home birth, backed up by
her husband, an obstetrician. (They are separated now and he was not
involved in Trystan's birth.) But Koehler was sued about 10 years ago
after a baby died. The case was settled and sealed. After that, she
began turning down requests to assist in deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   But Toni Sorenson and her husband, Mark Condon, had a friend whose
babies Koehler had helped deliver. Toni Sorenson visited Rainbow's
End farm for a mothers' gathering and watched videos of home births
with Koehler assisting.</TE>
<TE>   Koehler said she didn't do deliveries anymore, but relented after
Sorenson asked her to reconsider, with the caveat Sorenson would need
to take responsibility for her own well-being.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Many details about the birth of Trystan Condon on Feb. 28, 2000,
are in dispute. Trystan's parents and Koehler won't discuss the case
because of the criminal charges and the lawsuit that the parents have
filed against Koehler.</TE>
<TE>   But the state medical board's investigative report -- based on
interviews with doctors, nurses, Koehler and Trystan's father, Mark
Condon -- provides a version of events.</TE>
<TE>   Condon told investigators that his wife went into labor about 6
a.m. on Feb. 27, 2000. By 6 or 7 that evening, around when Koehler
arrived, Sorenson was feeling the urge to push.</TE>
<TE>   Around midnight, he said, Koehler told her to stop pushing for a
moment while she tried to reposition the baby's head. Four hours
later -- still pushing sporadically -- they moved to the garage,
where Koehler had told Condon to hang a birthing rope from the
ceiling. Sorenson pulled on the thick, knotted rope to ease the
pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Around 9 a.m., 27 hours after labor began, Koehler told them that
the umbilical cord was wrapped around the baby's neck and that the
heartbeat was slow. She started chanting -- Koehler often sings
soothing lullabies during labor -- and she told them that it was time
to get the baby out. Condon, according to his account, got behind his
wife, lifted her up, wrapped his arms under her knees and helped her
push.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Trystan was born. The cord was indeed wrapped
around his body; he was struggling to breathe and his skin was blue.</TE>
<TE>   Koehler cleared his nose with a suction bulb and began chest
compressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Her assistant brought
two bottles of oxygen from the car, but one was empty.</TE>
<TE>   When the baby was breathing, Koehler started the second bottle;
but after a few minutes, that one ran out. Koehler told Condon to get
more oxygen at a fire station.</TE>
<TE>   That is what Condon reportedly told investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Koehler's attorney says that the baby was recovering and that her
client sent Condon for oxygen simply because "she needed to find
something for him to do."</TE>
<TE>   Friends of Koehler's who were not at the birth maintain that she
suggested calling an ambulance during the birth but could have been
more persistent about it. Condon told investigators that Koehler
discouraged him from summoning help.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedic Stephen Curtis told investigators that his crew rushed
to the house after Condon showed up. They found the baby being held
by his mother. The midwife told him that she thought the baby was
improving and didn't need to go to the hospital, Curtis added.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedic Steve Bishop, also there that morning, told
investigators that Trystan was obviously in respiratory distress. He
said no one argued when they took him to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Harry Ackley, medical director of Sutter Medical Center in
Santa Rosa, admitted Trystan to intensive care. The doctor told
investigators that he spoke with Koehler the next day and that she
told him the second stage of labor -- when the mother is fully
dilated and pushing -- was "longer than normal."</TE>
<TE>   This stage, which normally takes 45 minutes, was allowed to go on
much too long, Ackley told investigators. It is considered prolonged
if it continues for more than two hours.</TE>
<TE>   There are different protocols for dealing with a prolonged second
stage of labor. If the baby is not in distress and the labor is
slowly progressing, some midwives will let the delivery continue. If
the baby is facing up, some practitioners may try turning it. At many
hospitals, a prolonged second stage of labor prompts doctors to
perform a Caesarean.</TE>
<TE>   Obstetrician Diane Sklar, who reviewed the medical board's
findings, told investigators that Koehler should have taken the
mother to the hospital after two hours of pushing.</TE>
<TE>   "By allowing the pushing to continue for at least seven to nine
hours, the baby was exposed to a prolonged lack of oxygen," Sklar
wrote. She concluded that Koehler "directly caused the brain damage
in this baby."</TE>
<TE>   Months after the birth, a medical board investigator spoke
directly with Koehler.</TE>
<TE>   "She said she wanted to talk to me about the delivery of Trystan
Condon, but was afraid I would not understand," the investigator
reported. "Koehler explained that she is 'from a different world.' "</TE>
<TE>   In her books, lectures and consultations, Koehler says that birth
is a normal biological event and that she does not agree with the
medical establishment's perspective of birth as a possible emergency.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To say that Nan Koehler has a broad support network is an
understatement. The thousands of families she has touched, either by
helping deliver their babies or by teaching the midwives that
delivered them, spread across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Since she was charged, donations for her legal defense have poured
in. Musicians have held benefit concerts. A lawyer is donating his
time. Sebastopol Mayor Sam Spooner declared Oct. 15 Nan Koehler Day.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Risse, the prosecutor, says she believes that a woman has a
right to give birth at home if she chooses, but that the state also
has an interest in protecting the health of the baby. If Koehler is
found guilty, she said, "maybe people will think twice before doing
the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Koehler's lawyer, Jamie Thistlethwaite, shudders at the thought of
her client going to prison.</TE>
<TE>   "Her heart breaks for [Trystan's] family," she said. "It will be
an absolute tragedy if this good, kind, compassionate woman goes to
jail for trying to help someone."</TE>
<TE>   According to the state medical board, Trystan's prognosis "is very
poor due to profound brain damage." One doctor suggested putting him
in an institution, but the parents have no such plans. Toni Sorenson
and Mark Condon spend their days caring for their child.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who has spent time with this boy, who has pushed his soft
hair off his forehead and stroked his cheek, who has seen him turn
his head and smile, can understand why his parents have faith. They
have faith as they drive him from appointment to appointment, day
after day, and wake up night after night to roll him over or sit him
up or pat him.</TE>
<TE>   In a few months, they will relive the frightening birth and
devastating aftermath in a courtroom, in the press, with their
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The result could be the devastation of another family -- the
friends, relatives and supporters linked by Rainbow's End farm.</TE>

<HD>Midwives Give Birth to Lawsuits, Criminal Charges</HD>
<DH>Advocates call prosecutions witch hunts meant to discourage
home-birthing. A U.S. doctors' group disagrees, saying the issue is
safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martha Mendoza</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of American women give birth at home each year aided by
unlicensed midwives whose assistance violates state laws governing
medical practice.</LD>
<LD>   In the last decade, more than 300 midwives have been disciplined
by state medical boards, sued or charged with committing crimes. Many
have been forced to give up their practices.</LD>
<LD>   About 50 have been sentenced to prison -- mostly women who charge
small fees to assist at home births.</LD>
<TE>   Most cases, court records show, begin when a baby born at home
dies or is disabled after complications during delivery. Charges
against the midwives range from practicing medicine without a license
to child endangerment. Sometimes the parents are also charged.</TE>
<TE>   Midwife advocates say the prosecutions are part of a systematic
attack on home-birthing. Most of the medical establishment opposes
the practice, and insurance companies often refuse to cover patients
and professionals who participate in it.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutions are a witch-hunt prompted by a "struggle for
control of maternity services, the key underlying issues being money,
power, sex and choice," said neonatologist Dr. Marsden Wagner, a
midwifery advocate and neonatologist who worked for the World Health
Organization for 14 years.</TE>
<TE>   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists disagrees,
saying the issue is safety. Unpredictable hazards to both mother and
child "require standards of safety which are provided in the hospital
setting and cannot be matched in the home," academy policy states.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors who handle the cases say there is no attempt to force
women to accept hospital care. They say they are merely enforcing the
law.</TE>
<TE>   "The state has an interest in making sure the mother and baby are
safe," said prosecutor Joan Risse of Sonoma County, Calif., who
brought child endangerment charges against a midwife in a pending
case involving a brain-damaged infant.</TE>
<TE>   No organization keeps track of midwife prosecutions; the
Associated Press compiled the numbers by examining court records,
news reports and data from organizations representing midwives.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy over the prosecutions raises anew fundamental
questions that policy makers, medical professionals and families have
debated for years:</TE>
<TE>   Is giving birth a natural process or medical procedure? What
rights do women have in choosing where they give birth and who
assists them? And when does a woman's choice become the government's
business?</TE>
<TE>   Some midwifery advocates say the forces arrayed against home birth
are succeeding only in driving the practice underground -- making it
more dangerous than it needs to be.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   About 1% of the 4 million babies born each year in the United
States are delivered at home, according to the National Center for
Health Statistics. But that's still 40,000 home births a year.</TE>
<TE>   Women choose home birth for many reasons: They want to avoid
anesthesia or Caesarean sections; they favor home birth for religious
reasons, or they simply view birth as a natural process best done at
home.</TE>
<TE>   "When a baby is born, the universe is opening up to let a new soul
into the world and everybody feels that new energy," said Pamela
Hunt, a Summertown, Tenn., midwife who had her six children at home.
"That energy is allowed to flow easier at home."</TE>
<TE>   Bettina Zastrow of Nyack, N.Y., had her first baby, Karl, in 1999
in a hospital and her second son, Wilhelm, slightly more than a year
ago in her bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "The big difference was that at home, it just seemed like a normal
part of life instead of a medical crisis," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all home births are attended by midwives, who come in two
varieties.</TE>
<TE>   Certified nurse midwives have medical training; all states license
them, although with varying requirements on insurance and
obstetrician backups.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 8,500 certified nurse midwives in the United
States, mostly in hospitals and clinics, according to the American
College of Nurse-Midwives in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   So-called direct-entry or lay midwives learn through
apprenticeships and non-medical training. Only 19 states issue
licenses or permits for them; nine states and the District of
Columbia forbid them to practice. In the other states, regulations
are evolving or nonexistent. There may be as many as 2,000
direct-entry midwives, according to the Lilburn, Ga.-based Midwives
Alliance of North America. The exact number is unknown because in
many states, they are practicing illegally.</TE>
<TE>   Certified nurse midwives attend only 3,000 of the country's 40,000
annual home births, according to the National Center for Health
Statistics. Nearly all the rest are attended by direct-entry
midwives, many in violation of state requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a direct-entry midwife is actually a radical and political
thing to do," said Susan Moray, a midwife and spokeswoman for the
Midwives Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   The number of home births attended by certified nurse midwives is
not only small but believed to be declining -- largely because of
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Most states require that certified nurse midwives have
obstetricians on call to back them up when complications arise.
However, few obstetricians provide this service because doing so
results in astronomical malpractice insurance premiums or
cancellation of their policies, according to officials at the
American College of Nurse Midwives.</TE>
<TE>   Even when certified nurse midwives offer home births with doctors
backing them, women's own medical insurance usually won't cover home
births. Larry Akey, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Health
Insurance Assn. of America, said insurers believe that mothers and
babies are safer in hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Akey said, lawmakers in many states have made it
impossible for midwives not under a doctor's supervision to bill for
maternity services.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the real stickler even for insurers who would like to
support this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   All of this, midwifery advocates say, leads many women who want to
give birth at home to turn to unlicensed direct-entry midwives,
making home births more risky.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Thomas Purdon, former president of the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said unlicensed midwives who assist
with home births are "unethical, immoral and, in cases where babies
die, deserve to be criminally prosecuted."</TE>
<TE>   The group considers home births so risky that it discourages them
even with a certified midwife present.</TE>
<TE>   What are the risks of home birth compared to hospital delivery?</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 studies since the mid-1980s have looked at the
question, and many concluded that home births involving a low-risk
mother, good prenatal care, a trained delivery assistant and a nearby
hospital are as safe as hospital births. Some studies, however,
contradict this.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael Speer of Baylor College of Medicine, who chairs the
American Academy of Pediatrics' perinatal section, says he doesn't
have a problem with home births as long as proper procedures are
followed, including having someone available to quickly resuscitate a
baby. However, he says, midwives should be held as accountable as
doctors and face legal consequences for mistakes in judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Home-birth advocates offer an array of views. Some would like to
see the practice unregulated. But Eric Dyson, American College of
Nurse Midwives spokesman, says medical complications and occasional
prosecutions could be largely avoided if all midwives were trained
and certified.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say the last thing they want to do is get involved in
the debate, but they must enforce laws.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year in Mansfield, Mo., unlicensed, direct-entry
midwife Victoria Kocher was charged with child endangerment after
attending the birth of Ethan Criswell, who died a week after he was
born at home seven weeks premature. The infant's parents, William and
Cheryl Criswell, were charged with involuntary manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Ethan, who weighed 3 pounds at birth, suffered
from multiple birth defects, but no one took the child to see a
doctor until the day he died.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Tyrrell, prosecutor in the pending case, said he believes
that the Criswells were criminally negligent and "failed to provide
medical care, nourishment and liquid to sustain life."</TE>
<TE>   Kocher "created a substantial risk by not advising the parents to
seek medical attention for the child," court documents charge.</TE>
<TE>   In San Luis Obispo, Abigail Odam, a direct-entry midwife, was
charged in 1997 after a baby she delivered was not breathing at birth
and was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy.</TE>
<TE>   She was convicted of six felonies, including practicing medicine
without a license and child endangerment, and spent two years in
state prison. After her release, she vowed never go back to assisting
childbirth.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't practice midwifery again in California or the United
States because we aren't in a culture of accepting responsibility,"
she said. "We're in a culture where if something goes wrong, it's
someone's fault."</TE>
<TE>   Midwife advocates argue that prosecutions are not just about
promoting responsibility and safety. Many midwives who have been
criminally charged are high-profile home-birth advocates who have
trained other midwives, said Katherine Prown, an advocate for
midwives facing legal challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "Prosecutors and state medical boards are trying to send a
message," said Prown, a Wisconsin mother of three children, all born
at home. "I think this comes down to an issue of authority. Who has
the authority to define how birth is managed?"</TE>

<HD>Some Say New Wolf-Hybrid Ban Has No Bite</HD>
<DH>Alaska's rule seeks eventual elimination of the mix, which
is illegal anyway. But only a DNA test can prove if an animal is one.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Pemberton</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>PALMER, Alaska</DL>
<LD>Werner Shuster's love affair with wolves began when he was a boy
growing up in Yonkers, N.Y., and neighbors owned a timber wolf that
became his best friend.</LD>
<LD>   His passion has grown into Wolf Country USA, where he keeps 52
wolf-dog hybrids on chains behind 8-foot stockade fencing at his
42-acre spread north of Anchorage.</LD>
<LD>   But Shuster, 72, and thousands of other hybrid owners in Alaska
are facing a new state regulation designed to phase out the hybrids
in one generation.</LD>
<TE>   Shuster vows to fight the new regulation tooth and claw,
especially if law enforcement tries to take his animals.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to have to come in here and shoot all my animals
and me," Shuster said. "They are our babies."</TE>
<TE>   State wildlife officials say that with the large number of sled
dogs in Alaska, there easily could be thousands of hybrids. However,
no one knows for sure because owners have ignored a law banning
possession of wolf-dog hybrids.</TE>
<TE>   Owners have had a good excuse to flout the law. It is nearly
impossible to prosecute without a DNA test to distinguish a dog from
a wolf.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulation allows hybrid owners to keep their pets without
fear of prosecution as long as certain requirements were met by July
1. The animals had to be implanted with a microchip for
identification, spayed or neutered, and licensed and vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   The regulation also does not allow hybrids to be transferred
except within the owner's immediate family. And it prohibits anyone
from advertising to sell wolf hybrids.</TE>
<TE>   Those wolf hybrid owners who didn't meet the deadline still face
the old law making it illegal to possess one of the animals.</TE>
<TE>   Shuster said the new regulation makes no more sense than the old
one still on the books. How, he asks, can the state regulate
something it can't prove?</TE>
<TE>   "With that new regulation, every dog in Alaska is illegal," he
said. "There is no such thing as a pure wolf. A pure dog is nothing
but an offspring of a wolf."</TE>
<TE>   Alaska State Troopers and the Department of Fish and Game say
Shuster has a point. Without a DNA test, the new regulation faces the
same problems as the old one. But, unlike the old regulation, the new
one -- by prohibiting the advertising of wolf hybrids for sale -- can
be used to crack down on sales and take the profit motive out of
owning the animals.</TE>
<TE>   Troopers are testing the new regulation on JoGenia Sexton, 47, an
Anchorage woman cited in August for placing a newspaper ad offering
"Alaska Puppies, for real Alaskans ... White Timberwolf ... Lupis
hybrid." She was selling the puppies for $600 each.</TE>
<TE>   Sexton could have faced a maximum penalty of $5,000 and a year in
jail. But Assistant Atty. Gen. Jack Schmidt, a special prosecutor for
wildlife cases, said Sexton -- who says she was unaware of the
regulation -- was cited with a noncriminal violation that carries a
$300 fine.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum penalty is more appropriate in larger operations, such
as Shuster's, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sexton said the puppies actually are part German shepherd,
malamute and Siberian husky. A friend told her that those breeds were
part wolf, so she played up the wolf angle to lure buyers.</TE>
<TE>   She said when her family moved from Brigham City, Utah, to Palmer
in 1968, they had two Siberian huskies that bred with wild wolves.</TE>
<TE>   "What is the big deal?" she said. "We didn't think anything of it
then. People all over Alaska have wolf-dogs."</TE>
<TE>   Trooper Doug Massie said that if Sexton can be successfully
prosecuted, they will be taking a look at Wolf Country USA.</TE>
<TE>   Shuster got his first hybrid his first week in Alaska in 1958. He
bought a puppy for $5, selecting one from a cardboard box placed on
an Anchorage street. He said he did nothing to comply with the new
regulation because he can't afford it. Any money generated from his
gift shop and wolf tours goes to feeding and caring for the animals,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   He advertises wolf cubs for sale on his Web site, and said he has
enough deposits to keep him busy for the next five years. But the
regulation is making buyers wary.</TE>
<TE>   Shuster says it's his right to advertise his puppies and call them
whatever he wants.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still the First Amendment and the Constitution you have
to go by," he said as he strolled through the compound, throwing out
dog bones and calling each one by name. "Diablo!" "Ninja!" "Sir
Lancelot!" "Pee Wee!" "Little Lady!"</TE>
<TE>   Shuster said he used to sell between 25 and 35 wolf cubs a year in
Alaska, but the in-state business has dried up because of the
regulation. His out-of-state customers have included people in the
Lower 48 and Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Peru,
Canada, Japan and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf-dog hybrids pose an additional problem in Alaska because of
its healthy population of between 7,000 and 10,000 wild wolves,
wildlife experts say. While possession of a wild animal or the hybrid
of a wild animal has been illegal in Alaska for years, the Board of
Game outlawed wolf-dog hybrids specifically in 1999 after determining
that they posed a genetic threat to wild wolves. However, the DNA
problem kept the regulation from being enforced.</TE>
<TE>   The concern is that wild wolves will lose their natural fear of
humans if they become interbred with hybrids and become potentially
more dangerous to humans.</TE>
<TE>   Wolves can also get every disease that domestic dogs do, including
rabies, said Rick Sinnott, Alaska Department of Fish and Game
biologist.</TE>
<TE>   "There are all kinds of problems with interbreeding," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Several large groups, including the Humane Society of the United
States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, oppose keeping and breeding hybrids.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think they are suitable pets," said Stephanie Shain,
spokeswoman for the Humane Society. "It is unfair to expect the
wildness to come out of an animal and expect them to function like a
pet."</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife advocate Karen Deatherage, who helped write the new
regulation, said hybrids are nearly impossible to train, hard to
contain and unpredictable when reaching sexual maturity.</TE>
<TE>   "When you breed a dog with a wolf, you have essentially bred the
fear out of the wolf," Deatherage said. "Wild wolves have a healthy
... fear of humans."</TE>
<TE>   Shuster said hybrids are misunderstood. Given the right owner, he
said, they make wonderful pets and are more intelligent than the
average dog.</TE>
<TE>   "Sabrina, the ballerina, give a dance," Shuster said as one of his
hybrids pranced on her hind legs, excited to see him. "Like any dog,
they need tender loving care. If you had a couple of kids, would you
desert them because people don't like them?"</TE>
<TE>   There have been instances in which hybrids were threatening. In
1995, two wolves attacked a dog in Anchorage and nearly killed it. In
1998, police shot a hybrid that had been terrorizing a neighborhood
north of Anchorage for five days, killing dogs and chasing a child.
Last year, a Fairbanks girl was bitten by the family dog, a
husky-wolf hybrid.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, however, a Rottweiler-wolf hybrid was credited
with saving a family when fire broke out in their Fairbanks home.</TE>
<TE>   Massie said it appears that hybrid owners are treating the new
regulation much like the old one. "I don't think there is much
compliance out there yet."</TE>

<HD>Crew Will Scrub Ship Top to Bottom in Hopes of Killing
Virus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Thomas</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A cruise ship longer than two football fields is getting a scrubbing
from hundreds of workers who are wiping down Bibles, washing linens,
steam-cleaning cushions and chairs, and disinfecting light switches,
doorknobs and handrails.</LD>
<LD>   The Holland America cruise line hopes to kill a virus that has
been sickening cruise ship passengers by the hundreds in recent
weeks.</LD>
<LD>   More than 500 people aboard the Amsterdam have contracted a
contagious stomach virus on four successive voyages over the last
month despite repeated attempts to disinfect the ship. At least two
other U.S.-based cruise ships -- one of them operated by Disney --
have reported similar outbreaks that sickened nearly 500 others in
recent months.</LD>
<TE>   Such cases are rare in an industry that will serve an estimated
7.4 million passengers in 2002. The Amsterdam is the second
U.S.-based cruise ship to be pulled from service this year, and two
others have been taken out in the last four years, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, a cruise, where hundreds of passengers and crew
mingle in close quarters for days or weeks, can provide ideal
conditions for the Norwalk-like virus to spread. The virus is spread
through food and water and close contact with infected people or
things they have touched. It can cause diarrhea, stomach pain and
vomiting for up to two days.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a perfect environment for spreading a virus that is so
infectious as the Norwalk virus is," said David Forney, chief of the
CDC vessel sanitation program.</TE>
<TE>   The outbreaks are not expected to pose a threat to the cruise
lines, which have largely rebounded since the terrorist attacks, said
industry analyst Joe Hovorka of Raymond James &amp; Associates in St.
Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly if they see a deficiency somewhere they're going to fix
it," he said. "They understand that this is not good PR."</TE>
<TE>   The 780-foot Amsterdam returned to Port Everglades, near Fort
Lauderdale, on Thursday and will be out of service until Dec. 1.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the last passenger disembarked, nearly 600 workers --
including porters, casino workers and dancers -- donned plastic
gloves, toted water buckets and began to scour every surface within
reach. They face a daunting task of cleaning a ship with 10 passenger
decks, 690 staterooms and 747 seats in the La Fontaine dining room.</TE>
<TE>   Workers will also wash linens and sheets, throw out pens and
pencils, clean thousands of plastic poker chips in dishwashers, and
wipe down nearly 800 Bibles, TV remote controls and clock radios with
a chlorine cleanser.</TE>
<TE>   Forney said fabrics will be steam-cleaned to temperatures of 170
degrees to kill the bug.</TE>
<TE>   Holland America said 76 people developed symptoms associated with
the Norwalk-like virus during the Amsterdam's 10-day voyage that
ended Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   As a precaution during the cruise, salt and pepper shakers were
removed from dinner tables. Passengers rubbed elbows instead of
shaking hands. Jacuzzis were turned off. Passengers were not allowed
to help themselves at the buffet or salad bar; crew members in
plastic gloves served them.</TE>
<TE>   Shelly Drucker, 67, of Boynton Beach, has sailed five times with
Holland America and remained healthy during the Amsterdam's latest
cruise. He said he plans to return, even though this time wasn't as
much fun.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a pain in the neck," he said. "But they tried. What else
could they do?"</TE>
<TE>   Holland America pulled another ship, the Ryndam, from service for
a week in July to disinfect it. The vessel had 388 reported cases of
a Norwalk-like virus. A lawsuit seeking class-action status was filed
in Canada in August on behalf of Ryndam passengers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, at least 175 passengers and 12 crew members on a
Disney cruise ship have become infected with a contagious stomach
virus, the CDC said. Disney officials ordered the ship cleaned and
disinfected at sea.</TE>

<HD>Doggy Blood Donors Roll Up Their Paws</HD>
<DH>Vet school runs bloodmobile serving four Eastern states. It
is believed to be the only one in U.S. Canines are rewarded with a
treat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tina Moore</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>QUAKERTOWN, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Sport, an energetic English springer spaniel, bounced onto the canine
bloodmobile, his ears flopping.</LD>
<LD>   Like Pavlov's dogs, experience had taught him to expect a treat
and he was already looking for it.</LD>
<LD>   "I swear he knows," said Elaine Gorman, who brought Sport to the
blood drive at a school in Bucks County, about 40 miles from
Philadelphia. "He sees the bus and he knows he's going to get a
treat."</LD>
<TE>   The dog-only bloodmobile owned by the University of Pennsylvania
is believed to be the only one of its kind in the country, officials
at Penn's School of Veterinary Medicine say. The white bus travels to
blood drives organized by breeders, dog clubs, veterinarians and
others in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland to collect
blood for its well-known veterinary hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't ask the dog for the donation, but we most certainly will
not force any dog to donate blood," said Urs Giger, head of the
veterinary school's transfusion medical program. "In other words,
these dogs are good-tempered dogs that are not stressed by the
procedure."</TE>
<TE>   Sport, who recently made his ninth visit to the Penn Animal
Bloodmobile, didn't seem stressed as he lay on a metal table so that
a veterinary technician could shave a patch of his silky fur and draw
a pint of blood from a vein.</TE>
<TE>   The number of pets donating blood has increased, but transfusions
also are on the rise, partly because more people are opting to have
their dogs undergo life-saving surgery, said Wendy Hatchett, a
veterinary technician.</TE>
<TE>   "For the last 1 1/2 years, we haven't had enough because more
people are using" the doggy blood bank, said Hatchett, who spoke
sweetly to Sport as she slid a needle into his neck. "Now, [blood
transfusions] are becoming more and more common all around the
country."</TE>
<TE>   Dogs are tested the first time they donate and those with blood
that cannot be universally transfused are turned away. The
bloodmobile doesn't allow cats because they need to be anesthetized
to draw blood.</TE>
<TE>   The blood -- taken from a jugular because it is a large vein and
can withstand the pressure of a suction pump -- will be deposited
into the Penn Animal Blood Bank, which has about 1,000 active donors
and is the largest voluntary canine blood donor program in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   The blood is used primarily at the University of Pennsylvania,
which does about 10 transfusions each day. In some cases, the blood
is separated into products that treat diseases and disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Tuscany, a powerful Doberman pinscher who strutted onto the
bloodmobile for his 20th donation, has a reputation for squirming on
the table.</TE>
<TE>   "This is for dogs that are sick," Vera Belsky said as she held
Tuscany's head still. "If one of my dogs was sick and needed surgery
at Penn, there's blood there."</TE>
<TE>   One of the bonuses for owners who bring a dog to the bloodmobile
is the promise of free blood from the blood bank. The blood usually
costs about $100 a pint, Hatchett said.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Watts talked directly to her boxer about the other animals
that she might be saving.</TE>
<TE>   "Just relax. Just key down," she told Penny, a black-and-tan
3-year-old who panted heavily as blood flowed from her neck. "You're
going to help so many other dogs."</TE>
<TE>   Christine Shister talked to Gus, her German shepherd, a little
more bluntly about his duty.</TE>
<TE>   "Other dogs need this. And if you ever need surgery, we'll need
it," she told him as he lay on his right side, fidgeting. Three
people held him down as Hatchett drew his blood.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Greiser, a student at Upper Bucks County Vo-Tech School,
held Gus down as the pump's generator hummed in the background.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are more scared about being held down than by having
their blood taken," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After about five minutes, the needle was out and Gus was getting
his treat: a bowl of food.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the orange juice and doughnuts," Hatchett said.</TE>

<HD>Officials Monitor Grizzly Shot in Head</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DEPUYER, Mont.</DL>
<LD>Wildlife officials are keeping close tabs on a sow grizzly bear that
was shot in the head at point-blank range by a hunter last Tuesday,
but somehow survived and continues to nurse her three cubs.</LD>
<LD>   The bear is only semiconscious and apparently cannot leave the
area where she was shot, said Ron Aasheim, a spokesman for the state
Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.</LD>
<LD>   He said officials have not been able to determine the extent of
her injuries, but ruled out attempting to treat the 500-pound bear or
to euthanize her.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to give her a chance, to see if she recovers on her own,
especially because she has three cubs," he said Friday.
"Unfortunately, this is part of what bears in Montana deal with. This
is their environment."</TE>
<TE>   Aasheim said a hunter surprised the bear and her cubs west of
Depuyer on the Rocky Mountain Front. The hunter shot the sow from
about 10 feet away when he believed that his life was threatened.
Grizzly bears are protected as a threatened species under federal
law, but can be shot in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Aasheim said the hunter alerted authorities immediately. The
shooting remains under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "He's cooperated fully," Aasheim said of the hunter. "He feels
horrible it came to this."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Madel, a grizzly bear biologist with the state wildlife
agency, said the bear, believed to be 16 1/2 years old, was shot in
the left side of the head with a high-powered .270-caliber rifle. It
didn't appear that the bullet had entered the brain, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know from experience that bears can take some horrific wounds
and heal up and survive," he said. "Our hope is she might be able to
pull through."</TE>
<TE>   Aasheim said if she does not, the cubs' fate is uncertain. They
would have a better chance if they can spend the winter in a den with
their mother, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aasheim said biologists will continue to monitor the sow; they
have closed the surrounding area west of Depuyer to hunting as a
precaution. One of the cubs also was collared with a radio
transmitter so that the bears can be tracked if they do move.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Launches Belated Hunt for Missing Fliers</HD>
<DH>Soldiers of fortune were ferrying supplies to the French in
Laos when they were shot down in 1954. Their employer was,
indirectly, the CIA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Pyle</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He was the classic soldier of fortune -- an ex-World War II fighter
ace with nine enemy aircraft to his credit, a hard-living, 260-pound
bon vivant known in Asia's bars and byways as "Earthquake McGoon,"
after a character in a comic strip.</LD>
<LD>   Now, 48 years after his cargo plane was shot down on a desperate,
last-ditch supply mission over Dien Bien Phu, a U.S. military team is
seeking to recover the bodies of James B. McGovern, alias "McGoon,"
and his co-pilot, Wallace A. Buford.</LD>
<LD>   "Looks like this is it, son," was McGovern's last radio message as
his crippled C-119 Flying Boxcar cartwheeled into a Laos hillside on
May 6, 1954. The crash killed McGovern, 32; Buford, 28, and a French
crewman. Two cargo handlers -- a Frenchman and a Thai -- were thrown
clear and survived.</LD>
<TE>   The next day, Ho Chi Minh's Viet-Minh revolutionary forces overran
the last French strongholds at Dien Bien Phu, ending a siege that had
captured world headlines for nearly three months.</TE>
<TE>   McGovern, Buford and Life magazine photographer Robert Capa --
killed later that month -- were the only Americans to die in the
conflict that doomed French colonialism in Indochina and set the
stage for Vietnam's "American war" a decade later.</TE>
<TE>   The death of swashbuckling "Earthquake McGoon" was big news in
1954, his grinning face splashed across newspapers and magazines. But
most details remained shrouded for decades in Cold War secrecy --
especially the fact that the pilots' airline, Civil Air Transport, or
CAT, was owned by the Central Intelligence Agency.</TE>
<TE>   But this month, after numerous delays, a 10-member team from the
Hawaii-based Joint Task Force-Full Accounting, assisted by Laotian
officials and hired workers, began excavating the site of three
suspected graves near the Laotian village of Ban Sot.</TE>

<TE>   Any remains found will go to the Army's Central Identification
Laboratory Hawaii (CILHI) for forensic study and identification -- a
process that could take months. The lab directs JTF-FA search
operations, providing experts to its field teams.</TE>
<TE>   Slowed by intermittent bad weather, the Laos search so far has
yielded only bits of wreckage and flight-suit remnants, U.S.
officials said. The dig is expected to end Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Pho Sai, a Laotian Foreign Ministry official for U.S. affairs,
said the chances of finding human remains appears slim after so many
years.</TE>
<TE>   "We are praying for them and helping them find the bones," Pho Sai
said in a telephone interview from Bangkok. "As Buddhists, we believe
that if they find the bones or any part of the body and take them
home, it would help the victim's loved ones feel at peace."</TE>
<TE>   The Americans' supporting role at Dien Bien Phu was "never a
security issue," even before the widely publicized crash, says Felix
Smith, a retired CAT pilot and friend of McGovern. "The only factor
that was secret was that the CIA owned CAT -- lock, stock and
barrel."</TE>
<TE>   A French officer learned from Ban Sot villagers in 1959 about
three graves in the area, but CIA officials stifled his report.</TE>
<TE>   "They indicated in a vague way that they feared a lawsuit if they
gave the relatives false information ... therefore, no one notified
McGovern's or Buford's relatives," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the French report was discovered by a private
historian years later, some family members had died or moved.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. State Department and the Vietnamese government declined
comment. A CIA spokesman said he could not immediately comment.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomatic agreements in 1992 enabled the United States to finally
begin searching in earnest for some 2,000 Americans still missing in
Indochina. By that time, the CIA had begun declassifying some files
from the 1950s era, including material on its role in French
Indochina.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1999 interview, McGovern's brother, John, of Hawley, Pa.,
called it "ridiculous ... a joke" that secrecy had been maintained
for so many years.</TE>
<TE>   The "McGoon" case came to light again in October 1997 when a
JTF-FA team investigating an unrelated crash near Ban Sot saw an old
C-119 propeller in the village. It was assumed to be French until
William Forsyth, the agency's top researcher, heard about McGovern
from a former pilot and dug out old news clippings about the Dien
Bien Phu crash.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, Forsyth -- whose specialty is aerial photo analysis
-- spotted three "probable graves" in a 1961 photo of the Ban Sot
area. But with Vietnam War MIAs taking precedence, CILHI and JTF-FA
officials moved Case 3036 to the back burner with other "Cold War
losses."</TE>
<TE>   There it stayed until a group of ex-CAT pilots, led by Smith,
launched a letter-writing campaign and lobbied Congress and former
intelligence officials to have the case upgraded for immediate
action. Retired spy Dudley Foster, who once served in a liaison role
with CAT, persuaded CIA Director George Tenet to back the effort.</TE>
<TE>   With Case 3036 given new priority, JTF-FA investigators revisited
Ban Sot, where in July they interviewed four witnesses who had seen
the 1954 crash and three who pointed out burial sites.</TE>
<TE>   Phimpha, a 65-year-old farmer, recalled that he was fishing in a
river when the plane came down and later saw three bodies, among them
a "very large Caucasian with a round face, still strapped in the
pilot's seat."</TE>
<TE>   Days later, he noticed fresh grave mounds near a road, Phimpha
said. His wife, Thok, 67, recalled that as a girl, she "always ran
past that location because of the ghosts thought to be there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John McGovern, a sportswriter and publicist who died last
December, said in the 1999 interview that his older brother had
become hooked on aviation as a boy in Elizabeth, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know what I wanted to be, but all he ever talked about
was becoming a pilot," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving in China in 1944, James McGovern joined the 14th Air
Force's "Tiger Shark" squadron, descended from the famous Flying
Tigers volunteer group. He was credited with shooting down four
Japanese Zero fighters and destroying five on the ground, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   At war's end in 1945, Maj. Gen. Claire Chennault, founder of both
Flying Tigers and the 14th Air Force, recruited McGovern and other
ex-pilots for his next enterprise, a commercial airline called Civil
Air Transport.</TE>
<TE>   Under contract to Chiang Kai-Shek's Nationalist regime, CAT flew
civilian and military missions during China's civil war and evacuated
thousands of refugees to Taiwan before the communist victory in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   At 260 pounds, the ex-fighter pilot liked the roomier cockpits of
CAT's war-surplus C-46 transports, but still sometimes used a wicker
chair instead of the standard pilot's seat.</TE>
<TE>   A saloon owner in China dubbed him "Earthquake McGoon," the name
of a hulking hillbilly character in the popular "Li'l Abner" comic
strip.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't bother him. He was a character himself, and I think he
thrived on it," John McGovern said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who once shared a house with James McGovern, said he was "a
real big-hearted guy," but not the "wild man" some reports implied.
"He was a bon vivant, happy-go-lucky. He loved kids, and he was the
guy who in a tense situation would come out with some joke."</TE>
<TE>   The McGoon legend was assured by an episode in which he ran out of
fuel, made an emergency night landing in a riverbed and was captured
by Chinese communist troops.</TE>
<TE>   When McGovern turned up safe six months later, other pilots joked
that his captors "got tired of feeding him."</TE>
<TE>   But Smith said McGovern had argued his way out. "He told them,
'You keep saying you're going to release me but you haven't, so I
don't believe anything you say. You're liars.' Then they let him go."</TE>
<TE>   Civil Air Transport moved to Taiwan in 1949 and a year later was
secretly acquired by the CIA, which continued its commercial service
as a cover for clandestine activities in east Asia.</TE>
<TE>   In 1953, France asked the Eisenhower administration for U.S. help
in fighting a communist rebellion in colonial Indochina. Soon, CAT
was there, flying supply missions with French insignia painted over
the company logo.</TE>
<TE>   Wally Buford, who had flown B-24 bombers during World War II and
C-119s in Korea, was studying for an engineering degree in 1953 when
he saw a notice that the government was seeking experienced C-119
pilots, and signed up.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to fly," recalled his brother, Roger Buford, a retired
engineer in Kansas City, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, McGovern and Buford were among two dozen Americans
who earned up to $3,000 a month -- big money in those days --
air-dropping supplies to the besieged French garrison at Dien Bien
Phu.</TE>
<TE>   On May 6, 1954, their Flying Boxcar, carrying a parachute-rigged
artillery piece, was riddled by anti-aircraft fire as it neared the
tiny drop zone.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a direct hit," other pilots heard McGovern say.</TE>
<TE>   With one engine afire, he nursed the aircraft another 75 miles
southward, into Laos. Approaching 4,000-foot mountains, he radioed
fellow C-119 pilot Steve Kusak for help in finding level ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Turn right," said Kusak, who then heard McGovern's last
transmission, moments before the crash.</TE>
<TE>   The Geneva Accords later that year divided Vietnam into north and
south. Civil Air Transport eventually became Air America, the CIA
airline that flew in Laos and Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   At latest count, 1,903 Americans are still unaccounted for in
Indochina, according to JTF-FA and CILHI. McGovern and Buford are
among 36 civilians on the list.</TE>
<TE>   Although both pilots are Air Force veterans eligible for military
burials, Roger Buford plans to bury his brother's remains in the
family plot in Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been fighting this thing for about five years," he said.
"We want him back."</TE>
<TE>   The McGovern family and Smith's group hope to have "Earthquake"
interred at Arlington National Cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   John McGovern's son, James, of Perth Amboy, N.J., said his father,
as a World War II recipient of the Purple Heart, was also eligible
for Arlington but didn't wish to be buried there.</TE>
<TE>   "He never said it, but I feel he was concerned that if he was
buried at Arlington, it might take a space away from his brother,"
the son said.</TE>

<HD>Harlan County Coal Mine Seeks Mother Lode of Tourism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Alford</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>LYNCH, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Years ago, Bob Lunsford toiled in the depths of a dark and grimy
Appalachian coal mine, hardly the kind of place people would pay
money to see.</LD>
<LD>   Now he's a guide for thousands of tourists from around the world
who come to Harlan County to peer into the abandoned mine that once
was the economic lifeblood for this coal company town.</LD>
<LD>   And next year, tourists -- if they dare -- will be able to travel
inside Portal 31 to see exhibits showing the transformation of the
industry from the picks, shovels and ponies of the early 1900s to the
powerful digging machinery used today.</LD>
<TE>   "People have heard so much about coal mining that they want to go
in and see it for themselves," said Lunsford, who worked 42 years in
and around the mine in the eastern Kentucky town of Lynch. "It was
very hard, very nasty work. You would have roof falls. A lot of
people got killed in these mines. It was dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   When the last miner left the played-out mine a decade ago, the
Appalachian coal town's fate seemed sealed. The economy hit rock
bottom and has yet to rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Local leaders searching for a solution looked again to the mine, a
seam that runs under tons of rock from a mountain above. Tourists
would walk about 1,200 feet into the mine.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Ayers, president of Southeast Community College in nearby
Cumberland and head of a committee that oversees the Portal 31
project, said he believes tourists will indeed flock to Lynch and
other Harlan County communities to experience life in a historic coal
town.</TE>
<TE>   Coal mines, copper mines, even salt mines have been opened to
tourists in other areas, but few of them in a place as romanticized
as Harlan County, where the crushing burdens on coal miners were
depicted in the 1976 Oscar-winning documentary "Harlan County, USA,"
an account of a violent 1974 strike.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the houses, stores, schools and churches built by coal
companies are still standing. And many retirees are happy to tell
visitors what life was like under company rule.</TE>
<TE>   Lunsford tells visitors how, in 1917, the U.S. Steel Coal &amp; Coke
Co. bought 40,000 acres and formed Lynch, which was named after the
company's first president, Thomas Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   He tells them that over a 40-year span, more than 1 million tons
of coal per year passed through Portal 31, and that Lynch's tipple --
where coal is loaded onto rail cars -- was the largest in the world
when it was built in the early 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch was a bustling town in its heyday, with about 10,000 people
from 30 countries living here. Now, the population is little more
than 1,000. Nearby Benham, hit just as hard as Lynch by mine
closings, has turned an old company school into an inn, and a former
store into a coal-mining museum to try to capitalize on tourism.</TE>
<TE>   The effort is beginning to pay off. About 30,000 people visited
the museum this year, and Lunsford expects just as many to pay $5
each for the half-hour tour of the coal mine when it opens, perhaps
as early as June.</TE>
<TE>   Southeast Community College has spent $750,000 to strengthen the
mine walls. An additional $1.2 million in federal and state money has
been set aside to create underground exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   Lexington mining engineer Steven Gardner was responsible for
ensuring that the mine poses no risk to tourists.</TE>
<TE>   That meant limiting tours to the sturdiest half-mile section of
the mine, installing a super-strength wire mesh across the ceilings
to keep rocks from falling, and drilling double the number of 4-foot
bolts into the overhead rock to hold it in place.</TE>
<TE>   Also, tunnel walls have been covered with a sealant to permanently
bind the coal and rock in place.</TE>
<TE>   And contractors sealed off unused mine tunnels to keep out methane
gas.</TE>
<TE>   The final safety measure will be an enclosed rail car that will
take tourists through the mine. Its reinforced top will be strong
enough to withstand any rock falls.</TE>

<HD>The Blaze 'Speaks,' Investigator Listens</HD>
<DH>The preliminary report on John Veysey III's house fire
points to the Christmas tree as the likely cause. But Jack Malooly is
doubtful.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sharon Cohen</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>CARY, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Every fire scene has something to say, and Jack Malooly does his best
to hear it.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks after the house on High Road was swept by fire, he
arrived at the blackened shell as part of a new federal team called
in to help local investigators. A stocky, ruddy-faced ex-cop with a
walrus mustache and a gold ring bearing the initials of an elite task
force, the National Response Team, Malooly had prowled the scenes of
hundreds of disasters, from Oklahoma to Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   Two decades with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
had made him a master of an often fiendishly tricky science:
ferreting out the origins of fires.</LD>
<TE>   Once, after a blaze in a U.S. Army building in South Korea, he
gathered the melted clocks to see when each had stopped. That created
a trail to the source.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be patient and methodical and curious," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now he was investigating John T. Veysey III -- and the fire that
had almost killed Veysey's wife, Deserie, and his son, Little John.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, Cary police Det. Ron Delelio had suspected that
the fire was no accident, and he had dug into Veysey's past --
gathering records, conducting interviews, trying to piece together a
puzzle. But he could only go so far. He was no fire expert.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Jack Malooly.</TE>
<TE>   Following his own special style, Malooly starts outside, circles
the ruins, examining scorch marks where flames have escaped, then
works his way inside, moving painstakingly from least damage to most,
sizing up a fire in a language all his own. Anything combustible is a
"fuel package." A quick-hit arson is a "splash and dash."</TE>
<TE>   When he arrived in Cary, the preliminary fire marshal's report
pointed to the Christmas tree as the likely cause -- possibly the
string of lights.</TE>
<TE>   Right away, Malooly doubted that. Christmas trees don't burn as
easily or as long as people think.</TE>
<TE>   There were other clues in the living room. The fire had reached
flashover, the instant when hot gases turn a room into a raging
furnace. If the fire had started in the tree, Malooly figured, that
would not have happened because the tree was next to windows, which
would have shattered quickly, allowing hot gases to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Something else was to blame, he thought.</TE>
<TE>   "What do we have here in this corner?" Malooly asked another
agent.</TE>
<TE>   An overstuffed chair had been there. All that remained were pieces
of charred frame, stacked outside.</TE>
<TE>   Could it be that?</TE>
<TE>   Malooly bought three of the same chairs. He shipped them to the
National Institute of Standards and Technology outside Washington,
where lab workers touched them off under a steel hood fitted with
equipment to measure the intensity of the fire. Each went up like a
torch.</TE>
<TE>   For Malooly, that clinched it. The fire had started in the chair
-- he'd swear to it.</TE>
<TE>   As he worked, other investigators were busy too, retracing
Veysey's footsteps, interviewing former co-workers and
ex-girlfriends, plowing through yellowing financial records.</TE>
<TE>   One afternoon, Delelio, still working the case, was thumbing
through Veysey's credit card receipts when he came upon one with a
name that sounded like a chemical company in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   He grabbed the phone. A Florida police officer soon confirmed that
a garage at the address had been raided and someone was selling GHB
-- the so-called date-rape drug -- over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The hairs on Delelio's neck stood up.</TE>
<TE>   Bodybuilders sometimes take GHB, and Veysey lifted weights. But it
also was a knockout drug that can cause amnesia. Delelio had
interviewed women who had dated Veysey and said they had passed out
or had dizzy spells after he gave them drinks.</TE>
<TE>   It was too late to know, but he wondered: Had GHB been in the
water Veysey handed Deserie -- her last memory before the fire?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another unanswered question, at least as troubling, nagged the
investigators: How had Veysey's first wife really died, three years
earlier?</TE>
<TE>   Like Deserie, Patricia DeBruyne Kemp Veysey, divorced with two
children, met her future husband through a newspaper personals ad.</TE>
<TE>   They settled in Twin Lakes, Wis., where disaster struck in
September 1993, three months after the wedding. A gas explosion blew
their house to bits; no one was home at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The blast came four days after Veysey increased his insurance. He
collected $363,587. (Just two years earlier, Veysey had had a serious
fire at the same house. He had collected $198,000 in insurance and
rebuilt it.)</TE>
<TE>   By the summer of 1994, when John IV, Little John, was born, most
of that insurance money was gone, mainly spent on cars, furniture and
a home in the scenic Mississippi River town of Galena, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   The following spring, Veysey was unemployed, having just left a
job as a real estate agent. He had five mouths to feed, including
Patricia's two children from her first marriage. His bank balance was
down to $2,761.64.</TE>
<TE>   On May 15, 1995, he drove the children home from school. There,
they found Patricia dead on the dining room floor. She was only 34,
but a pathologist ruled it cardiac arrhythmia due to a congenital
heart problem. It seemed possible. At 5-foot-6, she weighed 260
pounds.</TE>
<TE>   But as they reviewed Veysey's past after the Cary fire, federal
prosecutors Pat Layng and Lori Lightfoot were suspicious and reopened
the case of Patricia's death. They had noted a pattern: Veysey would
be low on cash, there would be a disaster, then a large insurance
payment and a spending spree.</TE>
<TE>   After Patricia's death, he had collected $200,000 from her life
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   There was something else bothering prosecutors: In autopsy photos,
they noticed a large bruise over Patricia's left eye. The pathologist
said she got it when she collapsed. That didn't make sense. She
hadn't fallen on her face. She'd been found lying on her back.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to that, prosecutors had a startling piece of evidence from
an ATF investigator's interview with a real estate agent who had
worked with Veysey.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how to kill somebody and it's totally untraceable ...,"
Veysey had said about three months before Patricia's death, according
to Lavonne Deininger, the former co-worker. "I can just inject their
vein with something and if there is an autopsy ... it appears as
though they had a heart attack."</TE>
<TE>   A single vial of Patricia's blood had sat for years in the
refrigerator in the Jo Daviess County sheriff's office, alongside
deputies' brown-bag lunches. Layng contacted a testing lab in
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a guy killed somebody and poisoned her," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of poison?" the toxicologist asked.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I'm asking you," Layng replied.</TE>
<TE>   There was no single test to detect all poisons. So, Layng and
Lightfoot studied Veysey's books, got expert advice and suggested
tests.</TE>
<TE>   Cyanide came back negative. So did antifreeze. About 15 tests were
done before the last drop of blood was exhausted. No poisons were
found.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors were sure they knew the motive -- insurance -- even if
they didn't know the means.</TE>
<TE>   For more answers, they turned to Patricia's daughter, Cassie. One
July afternoon, Layng and Lightfoot sat at a table on a sunlit deck
at Cassie's grandmother's house, talking with the high school
sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Cassie told them that when she left home the morning her mother
died, the windows were open and the door unlocked. That terrible
afternoon, though, the shades were drawn, the door bolted.</TE>
<TE>   And Patricia's hands were almost clasped, peacefully -- a
seemingly impossible position if she had collapsed. A glass of water
was also standing near her feet.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors took Cassie further back -- to the 1993 Twin Lakes,
Wis., explosion at the family's home.</TE>
<TE>   She told them that before leaving for a getaway weekend, John and
Patricia had loaded the car with prized possessions and pets, even
the fish. Veysey's explanation: They were flea-bombing the house.</TE>
<TE>   Days before the blast, she recalled, Veysey had grumbled about
something being wrong with the clothes dryer and called a repairman.</TE>
<TE>   The day before the family left, Cassie went to the basement for
some clothes. The washer and dryer were pulled out from the wall and
Veysey, she said, was behind them.</TE>
<TE>   He was working on some pipes -- one was fat and spongy, the other
hose-like.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly he spotted her, and his command was sharp:</TE>
<TE>   "Get out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Twin Lakes explosion had been ruled an accident and nothing
remained of the house, but half a year after the interview with
Cassie, Jack Malooly was asked to take another look.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had turned up hundreds of photos taken by
investigators hired by the insurance company.</TE>
<TE>   Malooly focused on a flex line -- a stainless steel, hollow-ridged
tube -- that linked the dryer to the gas supply line.</TE>
<TE>   Photos he enlarged showed that the tube was cracked -- not just on
one side, but both. A metallurgist that Malooly consulted blamed a
high-stress, low-cycle fracture. Someone had bent the tube back and
forth until it cracked.</TE>
<TE>   Malooly bought several flex lines and took them to his basement
workshop. He placed one in a vise and bent it back and forth until it
cracked, exactly the way the one on Veysey's dryer had. He tried
other flex lines. Each cracked exactly the same way.</TE>
<TE>   A cracked flex line would let gas leak until something -- maybe an
appliance motor or a thermostat -- triggered an explosion.</TE>
<TE>   The ATF agent also looked into Veysey's house fire in Galena,
Ill., in 1996 -- more than three years after Twin Lakes. A cord
extending over the top of a furnace had seemed the likely cause to
local investigators -- but Malooly concluded that the fire had
started in a futon in the next room.</TE>
<TE>   In each disaster, Malooly now believed, Veysey had left a false
clue that investigators could grab onto as they searched for a cause.
The cord in Galena. A problem dryer in Twin Lakes. A Christmas tree
on High Road in Cary.</TE>
<TE>   Each case had been ruled accidental. But to Malooly, each one was
arson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More than a year had passed since the High Road fire, and federal
investigators were edging closer to proving Delelio's suspicions.
Veysey's methods of operation were becoming clear.</TE>
<TE>   And that's why a new discovery alarmed investigators.</TE>
<TE>   In the late spring of 1999, as they studied Veysey's subpoenaed
phone and bank records, a name leaped out: Kathleen "Callie" Hilkin.</TE>
<TE>   Veysey was now divorced from Deserie, and Callie was the new woman
in his life. She and Veysey, records showed, were getting a home
equity loan, which required homeowner's insurance.</TE>
<TE>   An ATF agent, Tina Sherrow, called the insurance company listed on
the loan application.</TE>
<TE>   "Good lord," she said after she got off the phone, "look what
we've found."</TE>
<TE>   Veysey and Callie also had an appointment to take out life
insurance policies.</TE>
<TE>   Callie's life was in danger, Layng said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to stop him."</TE>

<TE>   Next week: Police make their move.</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>   THE STORY SO FAR</TE>
<TE>   Deserie Veysey, overcome by smoke during a fire at the home she
shared with her husband John and two children, finally emerged from
unconsciousness; 3-year-old Little John also survived. Confronted by
detectives' suspicions of her husband, Deserie agreed to cooperate.
As the probe widened, local investigators called in federal help.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How This Series Was Reported</TE>
<TE>   The story of the investigation into John T. Veysey III is based on
interviews with numerous officials, including Pat Layng and Lori
Lightfoot of the U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago; members of the
Cary, Ill., police, including Det. Ron Delelio, Deputy Chief Ed
Fetzer and former Det. Denise Bradstreet; Cary firefighters Brad
Dellatore, Andy Veath, Scott Mohr and Robert Deau; U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Agents Jack Malooly, Tina Sherrow, Jane
Balkema and Jim Allison; Deserie Beetle and her mother, Irene Beetle;
Betty and Gerald DeBruyne; and Kathleen Hilkin. It also draws on
thousands of pages of court testimony, as well as a transcript of an
interview conducted by Sherrow and John Korth, a sheriff's deputy in
Jo Daviess County, Ill. Through his attorney, Veysey declined to be
interviewed.</TE>

<HD>3 Girls Defy 'Lie or Die' Note, Help Put Shooter Away</HD>
<DH>Teens decide to ignore the threat and testify after another
witness is slain. All saw their friend shot to death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry McShane</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The message was five words long, as chilling as it was concise: "It's
either lie or die."</LD>
<LD>   The sender was known on Brooklyn's streets as Turf, an alleged
member of the notoriously violent Bloods street gang. The recipient
was named Naia, 18, whose childhood even in this hard neighborhood
had not prepared her for such terror.</LD>
<LD>   The same message was delivered to her two closest friends. The
three had become inseparable while growing up in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Now they had something to share besides birthdays and parties and
chitchat: A death threat.</LD>
<TE>   The gangster's message came last June, but it referred to an
incident nine months earlier. As usual, the three girls had been
together that night, and they watched helplessly as a friend was
slain in a park in a case of mistaken identity.</TE>
<TE>   The girls all identified the shooter to police. But now, the
messenger -- allegedly, the shooter's half-brother -- ordered them to
implicate another man.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't want to lie. But they didn't want to die, either.</TE>
<TE>   By the time trial opened this summer, all three had recanted their
identification of defendant Wesley Sykes, leaving the prosecution
with a single witness, Bobby Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   And then there were none.</TE>
<TE>   Two days into the trial, Gibson was gunned down on the steps
outside his home -- a gang hit, said stunned veteran law enforcers,
who could not recall the execution of a witness.</TE>
<TE>   The girls knew the truth -- and they were now the prosecutors'
best potential witnesses. They faced a terrifying decision.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was 8 p.m. on Sept. 4, 2001. Naia and her friends, Shaquanna
and Leticia, sat on benches at the Willoughby Playground, a tiny park
wedged between a grammar school and a Roman Catholic church. (The
Associated Press agreed not to use the girls' last names to help
protect their safety.)</TE>
<TE>   On this night, Naia's boyfriend joined her in the park, along with
friend Bobby Gibson and two brothers, Corey and Dennis "Dough Boy"
Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Then Wesley Sykes entered the playground on his bicycle.</TE>
<TE>   A week earlier, there had been a dispute near the same spot. Corey
Brown had slapped two women. And Sykes, a reputed member of the
Bloods, was here to make him atone for that disrespect.</TE>
<TE>   A feeling of unease passed among the teens. One tried to defuse
the tension, calling out, "Yo, what's up? Show some love."</TE>
<TE>   But there was no love on this night. According to witnesses,
Sykes, 22, stepped off his bike and walked toward the group,
brandishing a black semiautomatic pistol.</TE>
<TE>   "You disrespected my family," Sykes announced -- and then, the
witnesses said, he shot "Dough Boy" Brown, mistaking him for Corey.
The girls ran for their lives as Sykes squeezed off another shot at
them.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-three days later, Dough Boy died.</TE>
<TE>   The case against Sykes came together quickly. Witnesses, including
Naia, Shaquanna and Leticia, picked him out of a lineup. Bobby Gibson
went further, giving police a statement that implicated a shooter
with a "messed-up eye."</TE>
<TE>   Sykes had a glass left eye and a droopy eyelid.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed like a slam-dunk for prosecutors. Sykes was arrested and
a trial date was set for June 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Early that month, Naia and her friends were approached by a
middleman claiming to represent Sykes' half-brother, DuPree "Turf"
Harris. Later, in court, Naia explained what she knew about Harris:</TE>
<TE>   "He is known for hurting people, for killing people.... He kill
all his witnesses and all of that."</TE>
<TE>   After Harris' henchman allegedly brought the frightening "lie or
die" message, Naia went into hiding for 10 days. Harris handled the
follow-up personally, approaching all three girls, bringing each one
to Sykes' attorney, sitting at their side while they lied to the
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to go with a lie because I was thinking, was I going to
make it back safely?" Naia said later.</TE>
<TE>   As they left the law office, Naia remembered, Harris wrapped his
arm around her shoulder and announced, "You did good." To seal their
silence, Harris paid the three a total of $2,000, the girls said.</TE>
<TE>   The girls hoped that the case would go away, that Sykes might just
plead guilty and their testimony would be unnecessary. There was
still the testimony of Bobby Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At 5 a.m. on Saturday, June 29, prosecutor Stephen Murphy heard
his beeper go off. Word of a witness' slaying was spreading fast. No
one in the D.A.'s office, going back a quarter of a century, could
recall such a thing.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy had completed jury selection in the Sykes case 36 hours
earlier, when he had also turned over the prosecution's witness list
to the defense.</TE>
<TE>   And now, a still drowsy Murphy was hearing that Bobby Gibson was
dead.</TE>
<TE>   By 10 a.m., the phone was ringing in his office. The three girls
had heard about Gibson's death; the shooting had occurred close
enough for them to hear the gunshots. Could the group come in?</TE>
<TE>   Murphy didn't know what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   But once in his office, Naia and her friends said they'd made a
tough decision: They'd tell what they knew, face Sykes in the
courtroom and risk their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided to testify because my friend was murdered," Leticia
said.</TE>
<TE>   They began by telling their tale of the message from Turf. Murphy
believed them.</TE>
<TE>   "When they looked you in the eyes ... you knew it was true," the
veteran prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Naia, Leticia and Shaquanna made brief stops at home.
Then they were moved out by authorities to safe locations -- to
ensure that no other witnesses died.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the trial resumed, Murphy told the jurors about Gibson's
death and the threats against the three girls. As he spoke, one juror
grimaced; another's jaw dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Barely a week after the Gibson slaying, Leticia, Shaquanna and
Naia separately told their stories to those jurors.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy described the scene when Naia took the stand.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, she was "terrified ... nervous." Sykes glared at her
from the defense table, his eyelid drooping. Naia spoke about the
shooting in the park, then about the "lie or die" message.</TE>
<TE>   As defense attorney Michael Warren began grilling the teen, Murphy
noticed a change in Naia. Despite the pointed questions, she grew
more confident, more sure of her story.</TE>
<TE>   Warren asked about her statement in his office.</TE>
<TE>   "I was forced to say that," Naia replied.</TE>
<TE>   "You were forced to say all of that?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, before I went to your office,"</TE>
<TE>   "You were forced to say a lot of things?"</TE>
<TE>   "I sure was," Naia said. "I had no choice."</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, the jury convicted Sykes of second-degree murder
and reckless endangerment. Sykes, sentenced to 25 years to life, let
out a loud moan.</TE>
<TE>   Naia wasn't there for the verdict. Pregnant again, she was living
in her new, secret home, awaiting the birth of her child.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's fall in Brooklyn now. At the Willoughby Playground on a cool
afternoon, three men sit quietly on a bench.</TE>
<TE>   The park's cast of characters has changed.</TE>
<TE>   "Dough Boy" Brown and Bobby Gibson are dead. Joining Sykes behind
bars was Trevis Ragsdale, 19, awaiting trial for the Gibson slaying.
If convicted, Ragsdale could face the death penalty. Turf Harris
remains at large and has not been charged.</TE>
<TE>   Naia, Shaquanna and Leticia are no longer seen at the park. They
remain in "undisclosed locations," well out of their old
neighborhood, Murphy said. Their days of hanging out ended when they
decided to become witnesses, to tell the frightening truth.</TE>
<TE>   "My understanding is that they still talk," Murphy said. "But
there's no more walking around the block like they used to."</TE>

<DH>Supreme Command: Soldiers, Statesmen, and Leadership in

From Korea to Kosovo, Jeffrey Record, aval Institute Press: 202 pp.,

<AU>Warren I. Cohen</AU>
<BD>Warren I. Cohen, once a line officer in the U.S.
Pacific Fleet, is now distinguished university professor of history
at University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and senior scholar in
the Asia program of the Woodrow Wilson Center.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George W. Bush, his aides tell us, has been reading Eliot A. Cohen's
"Supreme Command." He would be well advised to read Jeffrey Record's
"Making War, Thinking History" as well before he takes the country
into war with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen's and Record's books are two superb studies of past
civilian-military relationships in time of war and of the lessons
that might be drawn. Cohen uses Abraham Lincoln, Georges Clemenceau,
Winston Churchill and David Ben-Gurion to illustrate how statesmen
should perform in time of war. Record is concerned specifically with
how recent American leaders have shaped their approach to war based
on appeasement (Munich) and entrenchment (Vietnam). He focuses on
presidents from Harry S. Truman to Bush and finds them lacking
sophistication, both tactically and diplomatically. He is especially
harsh on those who, beginning with the Reagan administration,
determined policy on the basis of what he perceives as flawed
conclusions drawn from the war in Vietnam.</LD>
<TE>   One comes away from these books troubled by the prospect of our
current president, as someone who prides himself in being disengaged
from the details of policy, presiding over America's next war. Can
the country risk another war when led by a president who seems
ignorant of the incompetence of the men to whom he has turned over
direction of his "war on terrorism," and who is unable to fire any of
those who have failed him? Moreover, in Dick Cheney and Colin L.
Powell, he relies on two of the men responsible for the decisions
that precluded consummation of victory in his father's war against
Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   In "Supreme Command," Cohen immediately confesses that he's guilty
of hero worship. He proclaims Winston Churchill to be the greatest
statesman of the 20th century. As a professor who served in the
office of the secretary of Defense and is currently a member of
Richard Perle's Defense Policy Board, Cohen is eager to distinguish
himself from those "donnish" academics who have been critical of
Churchill and from those authors who, writing in the comfort of their
studies, cannot imagine the pressure under which a wartime leader
functions. The basis of his admiration of Churchill and of the other
wartime leaders is their willingness to challenge the generals, to
participate actively and abrasively in the conduct of the war.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen is persuasive in his argument that his central subjects
played essential roles in the conduct of the wars they led. Lincoln
goaded his generals, fired those who failed to fight as he deemed
necessary and spied on Ulysses S. Grant, his most successful general.
It is not a recipe for leadership that will sit well with military
leaders anywhere, but Lincoln's direction of the war saved the Union.
Similarly, Clemenceau's management of his generals kept the French
army in place until the blundering Americans were in France in
sufficient numbers to win the war for the European nations, and
Ben-Gurion built an army out of competing guerrilla and terrorist
groups and veterans to save his infant country from destruction by
its invading Arab neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   But what happens when mere mortals lead the nation? Sensibly,
Cohen follows his sketches of great statesmen with a chapter on
"Leadership Without Genius" in which he examines the efforts of men
like Lyndon B. Johnson, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. These
pages provide little comfort, for today's leaders will never be
ranked with Lincoln and Churchill. Cohen can tell us what mistakes
were made by lesser men, but he cannot tell us how to win a war after
we've elected them.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen dismisses the military's contention that the war in Vietnam
was lost because of restraints imposed on the generals by civilian
leaders. He rejects the argument that Lyndon Johnson and Robert
McNamara micromanaged the war, and he can find no evidence that
military leaders had any better ideas as to how to fight it. On the
contrary, he is sharply critical of the military's efforts to limit
the choices available to its civilian leadership. He suggests that
the Joint Chiefs of Staff chose irrelevance rather than accept
necessary political restraints. Cohen concludes that the fault in
Vietnam was a combination of inept strategy and weak civilian
control. In addition, there was no Clemenceau, no Ben-Gurion to
redirect the Joint Chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, he is appalled by the elder George Bush's abdication of
responsibility to his generals during the Gulf War. Bush wanted to
terminate the rule of Saddam Hussein and to destroy Iraq's programs
to develop weapons of mass destruction. Powell allowed Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf to decide when to halt the advance of his forces and how
to arrange the armistice -- and Schwarzkopf erred in both decisions,
enabling Hussein to survive to torment us another day.</TE>
<TE>   Record, who served as assistant province advisor in the Mekong
Delta during the Vietnam War and now teaches strategy at the Air
Force's Air War College, stresses the fact that presidents use the
"lessons" of the past, historical analogies, when deciding to use
force. He is merciless in his contempt for Vietnam revisionists, for
those who argue that the war could have been won had its direction
been turned over to the military. He savages Caspar W. Weinberger's
rules for going to war and the Powell Doctrine that restated them,
policies that allowed for troops to be sent into combat only when a
vital interest was threatened, only when overwhelming force --
unrestrained by politics -- could be used and only when an exit
strategy was clearly in place. Perhaps most surprisingly, after
condemning the Truman administration for sending troops across the
38th parallel in Korea, the "mission creep" of 1950, he too
criticizes the elder Bush for terminating the Gulf War too soon. He
contends that Desert Storm, by merely driving the Iraqis out of
Kuwait, dealt with the symptom of Iraqi aggression but did not
eliminate the source.</TE>
<TE>   Neither author has a kind word for the Clinton administration. The
president, despite graduating from the Georgetown University School
of Foreign Service, showed little interest in foreign policy. Having
avoided military service during the Vietnam War, he was reluctant to
send troops into battle. Once bruised in his battle with military
leaders over his policy toward gays in the military, he was reluctant
to take them on again. His resistance to risking the lives of
American servicemen in Bosnia, Rwanda and Kosovo cost hundreds of
thousands of civilian lives in those territories. Record notes the
persistent fear of another Vietnam -- and obviously of another
Somalia -- hindering the responses of American leaders to evidence of
genocide.</TE>
<TE>   Record is troubled by what he perceives to be the professional
military's increased influence on the use of force. Most provocative
is his charge that contemporary American leaders are searching for
"riskless wars." He sees Weinberger's rules and Powell's doctrine
leading to "force protection fetishism," wherein the military's
mission is subordinated to the goal of avoiding casualties. The
result, he demonstrates, has led to military timidity. A case in
point would be the recent battle of Tora Bora in Afghanistan, where
the unwillingness to risk American casualties squandered an
opportunity to capture Al Qaeda principals, perhaps even Osama bin
Laden. Certainly, we want our fighting men and women to take no
unnecessary risks, but unlike video games, real war is about death,
about killing and being killed.</TE>
<TE>   Record makes four points that would serve well as a prescription
for our current leaders. All are consistent with the arguments put
forth by Cohen. First, read about and understand the past, but don't
expect it to repeat itself. Second, forget the teachings of
Weinberger and Powell, except for their insistence on clarity of
purpose. Third, be willing to use force, including ground troops, to
accomplish the nation's mission. Be prepared to accept casualties
(polls suggest the American people understand the need). And finally,
never forget the law of unintended consequences. Watch carefully as
the battle proceeds, question everyone and everything, and be forever
ready to change course.</TE>
<TE>   Statesmen, Cohen insists, must play a role in deciding how war
will be fought. They must not defer to military professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Together, Cohen and Record raise important questions about the
current state of military-civilian relations in the United States and
about the deep and pernicious shadow of Vietnam. Cohen addresses
indirectly issues of coalition management in his chapters on
Clemenceau and Churchill, but neither of these brilliant students of
military history and strategy offer any insight into how a nation can
justify a preemptive war without evidence of what Oliver Wendell
Holmes would have called a "clear and present danger." Perhaps the
current administration's road to war with Iraq is simply too
unimaginable to them.</TE>

<LD>Hazmat, J.D. McClatchy, Alfred A. Knopf: 96 pp., $23</LD>
<LD>   "HAZMAT" is one of those contemporary neologisms born of
abbreviating and combining two other words -- "hazardous" and
"material" are amputated and wed here in the title of J.D.
McClatchy's new collection of poems. The poems turn on this pivot and
return again and again to this notion of dangerous substance -- most
dramatically and unforgettably in isolating the perilous encounter of
each human consciousness with individual human corporeality: The
"hazmat" for each one of us is the body itself.</LD>
<LD>   Across the room, facedown on his own cot,</LD>
<TE>   Stripped to the waist,</TE>
<TE>   Felix wants Jesus Christ</TE>
<TE>   Crucified on his shoulder blade ...</TE>
<TE>   He wants light streaming from the wounds, a face</TE>
<TE>   Staring right back at those who've betrayed him.</TE>
<TE>   McClatchy's unflinching, bold, sure-voiced style and his ferocious
alertness give these poems intimidating power, as if Auden and
Baudelaire were partnered here. It's hard to imagine another poet
capable of being wry and tender, unpredictable and measured, original
and traditional -- within the body of a single poem. McClatchy has a
bracing impatience that I have always loved. His thoroughly civilized
voice has a black edge, a restrained fury to it. He seems at first to
shrug off social consciousness -- till we recognize an underlying
moral implacability. If he despairs, he also hungers for justice, for
balance -- and uncovers for the reader a pathway back to the time
bomb, to that ticking sense of our own flesh, that sense of how we
die daily, and how we deny it daily, refusing to see how, breath by
breath, we are toxic to ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mechanical Cluster, Patty Seyburn, Ohio State: 106 pp., $21.95
paper</TE>
<TE>   "Mechanical Cluster" is Patty Seyburn's second book and, like her
first, it is brainy and provocative and engemmed with sparkling
insights. This young poet is fearlessly speculative, willing to take
on the big questions in a hosanna of detail:</TE>
<TE>   like the stone struck by Moses' staff,</TE>
<TE>   giving forth more water than the Hebrews could imbibe.</TE>
<TE>   Too much or not enough:</TE>
<TE>   water, manna, quail. Love, money, time.</TE>
<TE>   Six days of work, one of rest;</TE>
<TE>   six of toil, one of singing --</TE>
<TE>   to keep the excess dammed? At bay?</TE>
<TE>   To separate, on our minor scale, light from dark.</TE>
<TE>   The collection's title, taken from a Ford Motor Co. manual's
attempt to describe an automobile's instrument panel ("Your vehicle
has a mechanical cluster") points up her sense of the movement of
consciousness, associative in all its artifices, through time and
space. If the book is just a little crammed, overstuffed with
exclamatory diversion, it also manages to be absolutely sure of
itself: a customized vehicle of thought and fancy, running smooth,
gleaming and road-worthy, with a "natural" in the driver's seat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dumb Luck, Sam Hamill, Boa Editions: 102 pp., $13.95</TE>
<TE>   The same clear and stubborn lucidity that chimes through earlier
poems and translations by Sam Hamill resound here in "Dumb Luck."
This book has the gravity and substance of his characteristic Zen
meditations but also the longing of the meditative for absolute
transparency and weightlessness. The "dumb" here seems less a
reference to intelligence and more a nod to silence, the dumbness of
awe. And "luck" connects to chance, as always -- since all luck
defies knowledge or control. From a poem reflecting on the tragedy of
Sept. 11:</TE>
<TE>   We walk on the faces of the dead.</TE>
<TE>   The dark fall sky grows blue.</TE>
<TE>   Alone among ash and bones and ruins,</TE>
<TE>   Tu Fu and Basho write the poem.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep things simple in my hands and heart," Hamill says, and he
honors a Buddhist "retreat" as an entry into the real world. These
are jagged, elegiac, dumb and lucky poems that bow to the earth and
sky -- and to the poet's own devout and compassionate heart.</TE>

<DH>The Eagle's Shadow: Why America Fascinates and Infuriates
the World, Mark Hertsgaard, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 192 pp., $23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Engelhardt</AU>
<BD>Tom Engelhardt, author of "The End of Victory Culture,"
is consulting editor for Metropolitan Books and a fellow of the
Nation Institute. His novel, "The Last Days of Publishing," will
appear next year.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Sept. 11, befuddled Americans have asked a single question of
the world: Why do they hate us so? However reasonable such a question
might seem in the wake of the attacks, it signals something far less
reasonable: We've become a thoroughly solipsistic nation. In the last
year, America has refashioned itself as the world's primary victim,
survivor and dominator. We've taken possession of all available roles
except, of course, that of villain, and the rest of the planet has
been relegated to the sidelines. It's like that old joke in which a
man talks endlessly about himself and then says, "Enough about me,
how about you? What do you think of me?"</LD>
<TE>   For years, Mark Hertsgaard has been asking what others think of us
but with a less self-centered purpose. He's had an urge to help us,
even force us, to break through that self-involvement and look at
ourselves as others see us. He wants us to understand that there are
other lives out there in the wider world. He is among the small
number of Americans who are aware that ours was not even the first
Sept. 11 tragedy. As he points out, that date was the anniversary of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet's coup, a "U.S.-sponsored assault on democratic
government in Chile," whose long-term death toll more than equaled
ours of last year. "It's no secret to Chileans," he adds, "that the
United States helped bring to power the dictatorship that ruled them
for seventeen years." But as with so many aspects of the world -- and
our role in it -- this has not been on most American radar screens.
We are, he assures us, an "oblivious empire."</TE>
<TE>   "The Eagle's Shadow" is Hertsgaard's attempt to explain what might
be called a global disparity in comprehension. As a young, white
South African restaurant manager told him, "Any stupid thing that
happens in the States is news all over the world: O.J. Simpson, the
Florida election recount ....Actually, I think we have an advantage
over you, because we know everything about you and you know nothing
about us."</TE>
<TE>   Hertsgaard, a fine reporter who produced a classic account of the
subservience of the press during the Reagan era, was on the road --
and not the American road either -- when the World Trade Center
towers crumbled. He was in the middle of the second of two global
meanderings that, since 1991, have taken him to more than 30
countries on an American-saturated planet.</TE>
<TE>   From polluted Chinese cityscapes to South African slums, he has
pursued the complex ways that the rest of the world comes to grips
with an ever more in-your-face American presence. In fact, nothing is
more striking in his account than the fact that you can land
anywhere, ask anyone what he or she thinks of us and get a generally
intelligent, even nuanced response. Yes, some out there do hate us
with a passion, and others are riveted to simple-minded images of
American wealth and glamour from our TV shows and movies that circle
the world at nearly the speed of money. But most of Hertsgaard's
interviewees, to the extent that we glimpse them, seem to have come
to more complex conclusions about who we are. Their views of us, he
claims, are light-years more sophisticated than ours of them. Perhaps
the disparity between what they know about us and what most of us
don't know about them isn't that surprising. After all, they live in
our growing imperial "shadow," while, until recently, most Americans
haven't cared to notice the shadow we cast, nor have our media (a
point Hertsgaard dwells on) made it their business to offer us much
help with the task.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Hertsgaard's book is something of a rant --
invigorating at moments, but more often one-dimensional and
unexpectedly expectable -- and in the end it is not so much about
what foreigners think of us as what Hertsgaard thinks of us.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone senses that we've reached a defining moment in our
history, but how to define that moment? In the best of the critical
pieces now being written about America in the world -- and they're
articles, not books -- you can sense writers reaching almost
desperately for historical analogies that might orient us: the Roman
Empire, the British Empire, prewar Hitlerian Germany, the
Spanish-American War, World War I. Hertsgaard senses this too. You
can feel his palpable disappointment that the terrorist attacks last
year did not open his country up to the world in a new way or to a
more honest assessment of our acts in it. Our assurance that we know
what's best for a planet of which we're largely ignorant, and the
media coverage that nurtures such ignorance, clearly drive him to
distraction.</TE>
<TE>   But facing a new age, he's fallen back on a tired set of plaints
about American faults, a familiar critical litany in an exceedingly
unfamiliar moment. Hertsgaard has organized his book into "a sort of
dialogue ... between how foreigners and Americans perceive the United
States." He lists 10 conflicting perceptions that foreigners have
about us ("America is parochial and self-centered, America is rich
and exciting ... Americans are philistines ... ") around which he
structures his book. And he's capable of using striking details from
his travels to illustrate his categories -- like the two South
African gangs named the Young Americans and the Ugly Americans. (When
he asks the difference, the answer is: "The Young Americans dress
like Americans. The Ugly Americans shoot like Americans.") But for
all his traveling, the foreigners he introduces us to seem
unidimensional and oddly lifeless.</TE>
<TE>   There is an honored place in life for a rant. It can clear the
head and provoke the brain to think again. Sometimes Hertsgaard's
riffs do just that. For instance, his take on that "stenographer to
power," the media -- "The biggest political joke in America is that
we have a liberal press" -- is fierce, bracing and to the point. But
too often he does what he praises most of his interviewees for not
doing: taking all America in with a single gulp of generalization.
(Are we really "friendly but boorish, clever but shallow, prosperous
but lonely"? Are we truly "suckers for a happy ending"?)</TE>
<TE>   The attacks of Sept. 11 seem to have flattened his book and thrown
it into some disarray. It may, in fact, be less a book than a
collection of angry memos to us, to foreigners about us, and to
himself. It could be worse. The limits of mainstream criticism have
recently proved so confining that there's relief simply in
encountering Hertsgaard's anger and in picking up one major point.
Until the next set of terrorists appear, we live in an ever more
gated and self-involved nation on an all-American planet. You only
have to try to imagine a Chinese or Afghan Hertsgaard traveling the
vast provincial empire of America, asking, "Why do you hate us? What
do you think of us?" The result would undoubtedly be a short book
indeed.</TE>
<TE>   What a shame that "The Eagle's Shadow" feels stale and airless. We
needed a jolt from a book like this. Soon enough, those years when
Hertsgaard was traveling the planet may look like an era of benign
neglect now that the emboldened leaders of our "oblivious empire" are
readying us for a trip between Iraq and ruin. They seem intent on
ensuring that no one out there will forget us for a long time to
come.</TE>

<DH>Dead Cities, A Natural History, Mike Davis, The New Press:
432 pp., $27.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Siegel</AU>
<BD>Fred Siegel is the author of "The Future Once Happened
Here: New York, D.C., L. A., and the Fate of America's Big Cities."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York and urban America may never recover from Sept. 11, and
that's a very good thing if you believe Mike Davis. For Davis, who
first won attention with two books on Los Angeles, "City of Quartz"
and "Ecology of Fear," America's cities are a toxic expression of
imperial hubris and greed, and 9/11 was punishment for New York's
sins against socialism, squeegee men and dark-skinned Muslims, just
as fires and earthquakes are L.A.'s punishment for its sins against
nature.</LD>
<LD>   "Dead Cities" is a collection of previously published articles
from the last decade. What's new in this collection is the opening
essay on 9/11 titled "The Flames of New York." The essay's title is
borrowed from an image conjured by science fiction writer H.G. Wells
in his 1908 book, "War in the Air," in which the city is destroyed in
a surprise attack from Kaiser Wilhelm's zeppelins. "Lower Manhattan
was soon a furnace of crimson flames," writes Wells; it is a conceit
that brings equal pleasure to Wells, who despised New York and,
apparently, to Davis, who characterizes the Wells' story: "In a
single day, haughty Manhattanites are demoted to slaughtered
natives."</LD>
<TE>   Wells' pestilential view of man runs through "The Flames of New
York," as does Davis' own penchant for ideologically induced
assertions. Later in the essay, he takes up the case of the Egyptian
Muslim fanatic Sayyid Qutb, who was, according to the New York Times,
Osama bin Laden's intellectual inspiration. Qutb visited the United
States in the late 1940s and developed a thoroughgoing hatred of New
York and America. Among the sources of his anger, writes Davis, was
"no doubt" that the dark-skinned Qutb had "wounding encounters with
Jim Crow." But Qutb, who thought of himself as a man of high European
and Islamic culture, wrote of "jazz" as "a type of music invented by
Blacks to please their primitive tendencies and desire for noise." He
was horrified by the American concept of "fun" and thought of the
United States as a sinkhole of sexual license.</TE>
<TE>   Davis concludes "The Flames of New York" with the claim that
America has begun a reign of terror against Muslims. In the "the good
ole boy equivalent of Kristallnacht," he writes that "there were at
least six murders and a thousand serious assaults committed against
people perceived as 'Arab' or 'Moslem' " in the six weeks after Sept.
11. His sources for this assertion are the Oct. 26 Washington Post,
which has no record of such a tally, and the Council on
American-Islamic Relations. But, according to an article in the Wall
Street Journal published last month, the council lists only 289
claims of attacks on persons or property in the five months after the
World Trade Center collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Similar skepticism is in order when Davis argues, on the basis of
a dubious and unconvincing article in the Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, that Winston Churchill tried to develop an anthrax
super-bomb to destroy Germany's cities. In a similar vein, writing
about New York, Davis claims that "more than 20,000 housing units per
year were still being abandoned in New York City as late as 1996,"
when, in fact, the city was booming. His source is a national survey
in which, as he concedes in a footnote, New York refused to
cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is devoted to the specter of catastrophe. In the chapter
"Dead Cities: A Natural History," he quotes the German "eco-fascist"
Max Karl Schwarz, who shares his sense of the "toxicity" of cities,
as arguing that after the bombings of Hamburg, Cologne and Kassel,
the landscapes might be revitalized by leveling the debris and
planting trees. In "Dead Cities," Davis holds out similar hopes for
asteroids, meteors, earthquakes, tidal waves and global warming.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Starr once said of Davis that "if he doesn't watch it, he'll
become a crank." That day has arrived.</TE>

<DH>Bow's Boy, A Novel, Richard Babcock, Scribner: 330 pp., $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Harris</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1966, Charlie Stuart, the narrator of Richard Babcock's complex
and satisfying new novel, is 36 years old, but residents of his
hometown, Laroque, Wis., know him as "Bow's Boy" because he is the
surrogate son of G. Bowman Epps, a rich lawyer. Charlie leads a
double life: as Bow's chief investigator and chauffeur and as an
alcoholic bachelor fishing guide who prowls Laroque's riverfront
saloons.</LD>
<LD>   Charlie's real father, extravagant and unstable, ran Laroque's
opera house during a long-ago lumber boom. Bow considers Charlie an
"archivist" of local history, and Charlie views himself as the only
person who properly appreciates Bow -- an ungainly man lamed by
childhood polio and hideously burned over half his face, yet one of
Wisconsin's most distinguished appellate attorneys.</LD>
<LD>   Bow's offices are above a bank that his family owned. He inherited
a tract of forest and lakes where he and Charlie camp and fish. He
doesn't have to work, but he does, devoting his lonely life to
unpopular efforts to free convicts who, more often than not, are
guilty. He is a mass of contradictions: a Republican and hawk on the
Vietnam War who's also a dedicated civil libertarian; a man of deep,
if hidden, feelings who is still an advocate of rigorous logic.</LD>
<TE>   Charlie has Bow to himself until a new "boy" comes along,
17-year-old Ginger Piper, whom they first notice when he sinks a
half-court shot to win a high school basketball game. Among the other
small-town boys, Ginger stands out. He's handsome, intelligent and
mature beyond his years, and he has "a kind of glow, as bright as a
new dime, so full of interest and candor." Bow recognizes something
special in him and offers him a job, sharing Charlie's duties. Ginger
does so well that Bow envisions him going to law school and, in time,
taking over the practice.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie resents the kid, naturally, and he's also a skeptic by
nature. Observing, for instance, that most convicts "didn't show any
reaction to Bow's elaborate scar," he says: "Bow insisted that was
because the convict population was more accepting of freaks. I always
suspected that criminals simply didn't care enough about other people
to register a response."</TE>
<TE>   Ginger's father is a bitter man with a criminal past, and from
time to time, Charlie sees Ginger seeming to cross ethical lines. He
takes a steak from a grocery store without paying for it -- although
under the circumstances, it may be a simple oversight. He twice
injects antiwar messages into eulogies for classmates slain in
Vietnam. Listeners are divided: Is this sincerity or showboating? He
takes an excessive interest in one of Bow's clients, Gary Fontenot.
Bow knows Fontenot is guilty of burglary but argues that police
illegally searched his car. Ginger sees Fontenot as an innocent
victim of The System.</TE>
<TE>   Babcock ("Martha Calhoun") has a background in law and journalism,
and this benefits "Bow's Boy," which is rich in detail about
everything from interpreting the 4th Amendment to fishing for walleye
and muskie. Like Nick Carraway in "The Great Gatsby," Charlie is an
ideal narrator: wry and lucid and detached, yet a man who must
acknowledge, in the end, how much of a personal stake he has in the
story he tells.</TE>
<TE>   If Ginger displaces him, Charlie fears, he will lose his freedom
to avoid growing up, avoid marrying his girlfriend, Lucy, who works
at the bank, and avoid having to choose between his professional and
drinking lives. But as the issue of Vietnam splits the nation,
painful choices become impossible to duck, even in Laroque. When
Fontenot escapes from prison with the aid of a knife that Ginger may
have smuggled in to him, Bow must choose between logic and loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie, looking back three decades, blames the war for subjecting
the relationship between Bow and Ginger to unbearable pressure. It
was a time of shrill voices and clashing absolutes -- not a time for
Bow, who grumbles: "I don't like absolutes. They're for people who
aren't smart enough to see the whole picture." Babcock lets us see
the big picture; he makes us, along with Charlie, mourn these
characters, gifted and flawed, who "each saw in the other a grace, a
sort of beckoning of possibilities."</TE>

<HD>Words that reach what is wounded</HD>
<DH>Talking Cures: New Poems, Richard Howard, Turtle Point
Press: 116 pp., $16.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edward Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Edward Hirsch is the author of the forthcoming "Lay
Back the Darkness: Poems," to be published this spring. He is
president-elect of the Guggenheim Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Talking Cures" is the old name for psychoanalysis in its younger,
more halcyon days, and Richard Howard employs it to wonderful effect
as the title of his verbally adept, speech-driven and highly
performative 12th book of poems. Howard's winding syntax, his
Jamesian way of talking in poetry, of speaking across strictly
charted symmetrical stanzas, has always been a difficult pleasure.
But now, in the poet's early 70s, it takes on another, curative,
dimension. It is an emphatic staying action -- sometimes tragic,
sometimes comical (sometimes tragicomic!) -- against death.</LD>
<LD>   One of the premises of this highly theatrical collection is that
speaking becomes a form of necessary action, a process of making, of
constructing and reconstructing a self in the face of dissolution.
Voicing the unconscious in controlled circumstances is therapeutic,
especially when it has been enabled (and chastened) by the artifice
of poetic form. We are strangers to ourselves. Talking, which gives
insight to experience, sounds the depths of our solitude. It also
reaches out to an unseen listener. Wit redresses what is wounded in
us. Poetry heals.</LD>
<TE>   Howard is the most unabashedly literary -- the most Wildean -- of
contemporary American poets. His massive learning, a full cultural
arsenal, has often made him seem suspect to poetry readers who
distrust great fanciness and mistakenly equate a plain style and a
supposedly unmediated personal voice with "sincerity," which is a
little like saying that vanilla ice cream is more "sincere" than
peach gelato. But if it's true, as Ezra Pound said, that technique is
the test of a poet's sincerity, then Howard certainly qualifies as
one of our sincerest makers, since he has been elaborating his
structures -- deliberately making something of himself -- for more
than 40 years now. This most multitudinous of poets keeps giving
himself away, and "Talking Cures" is the latest installment in his
book of psychological portraits, dramatic intimacies.</TE>
<TE>   The collection begins characteristically enough with a monologue
from the point of view of a fugitive who, the wily traveler tells us,
always preferred his Latin name (Ulysses) to his Greek one
(Odysseus), at least until a notorious Irish novel "blew" his cover.
Now he no longer knows what to call himself, since his story has been
so often repeated. He complains against being named and summarized,
fastened down, perfected.</TE>
<TE>   ... Everyone knows my history,</TE>
<TE>   complete with goddesses, islands, all those hoary lies!</TE>
<TE>   I have no tales to tell, I have only</TE>
<TE>   echoes. The real Ulysses puts in his appearance</TE>
<TE>   between other men's lines, the true Odysseus</TE>
<TE>   shows up in unspeakable pauses, the gaps and blanks</TE>
<TE>   where life hasn't already been turned into</TE>
<TE>   "my" wanderings, "my" homecoming, even "my" dog!</TE>
<TE>   Thus does the Greek hero become a type of belated or postmodern
Emersonian figure -- a representative stand-in for the American poet
-- struggling to liberate himself from "ballads, bards, and banned
books," determined to remain in transit, in process, still emergent.</TE>
<TE>   ... To hell</TE>
<TE>   with a crown, a conjugal bed, and recognition</TE>
<TE>   by a nurse with Alzheimer's! All I want</TE>
<TE>   is to be what I was: mortal, muddled, and myself.</TE>
<TE>   Emerson felt that power "resides in the moment of transition from
a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to
an aim," a sentiment Howard endorsed in "Alone With America," an
indispensable critical book in which he examined the work of 51
contemporaries, most of whom comprise the third wave of 20th century
American poets. It turns out that he was also talking about himself
when he concluded about the poets of his own generation: "These then
are the children of Midas, who address themselves to the current, to
the flux, to the process of experience rather than to its precepts."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as he puts it in "The Apotropaist" (the word refers to one who
wards off evil), a poem in homage to the "unscrupulously prolific"
German painter Gerhard Richter, who has gone through so many
different styles:</TE>
<TE>   Does it take the pain out of painting,</TE>
<TE>   all of this unscrupulously prolific</TE>
<TE>   production of his?</TE>
<TE>   Repudiating the said in favor of saying</TE>
<TE>   is all that makes it human,</TE>
<TE>   this uncertain life of warding off,</TE>
<TE>   of refusing, this life that is not the picture</TE>
<TE>   but the depicting.</TE>
<TE>   Howard's characteristic modes and obsessions are very much in
evidence in "Talking Cures," in which he repeatedly repudiates the
"said" -- the monumental -- in favor of a radical form of "saying."
He likes to propose shocks, to confront the new and despoil the mere
proprieties of self. These ironic impulses are very much in evidence
in the group of nine poems he calls "Phallacies," each of which
involves a witty, quasi-scandalous anecdote -- a fallacy -- about the
male member. (Madame DeGaulle mistakenly says "A penis" when she
means to say "Hap-pi-ness"; a female curator opens a trunk labeled
"Antiquities. Members Only" and discovers many trays of penises that
have been knocked off statues etc.)</TE>
<TE>   The comic, demystifying impulse in Howard's work is apparent in a
group of poems about our various relations with dogs, as well as in a
sequence he titles "The Masters on the Movies" (Henry James views
"Now, Voyager" in the year he serially publishes "The Bostonians,"
Rudyard Kipling watches "King Kong" during the same year he publishes
"The Jungle Book" and so forth). The atmosphere of these poems tends
to be relaxed and humorous, though a sense of loss and vulnerability,
of extreme exposure, deepens and perhaps even undermines the comedy.
The subject is change, which devours and transforms everything, and
one can't help noticing that the poet's deliciously baroque wit keeps
returning to traumas of male sexuality and anxieties about aging.</TE>
<TE>   Howard reaches the pinnacle of his art in the three threshold
poems that close the book. In "Infirmities," a dying Walt Whitman
addresses his literary executor Horace Traubel ("No use having an
executor," he says, "unless I can show you what to execute") and
greets Bram Stoker, author of "Dracula." In "Knowing When to Stop," a
dying Freud confronts the harsh truth that his two beloved chows are
avoiding him after multiple operations and secondary infections have
eaten a hole in his cheek and caused a dastardly smell. And in
"Elementary Principles at Seventy-Two," the poet meditates in his own
voice on the power of the four elements that surround us. He
concludes, as we all will, with the earth that accepts us.</TE>
<TE>   In these final poems, these lyrics of finality, Howard returns to
elementary principles, to the basics of his imagination in
confrontation with change. He demonstrates that his cunning art of
conversation, of art as conversation, has evolved into an elegant
talking cure, a poetry of deep mortality and humane grace.</TE>
<TE>   "Elementary Principles at Seventy-Two"</TE>
<TE>   When we consider the stars</TE>
<TE>   (what else can we do with them?) and even</TE>
<TE>   recognize among them sidereal</TE>
<TE>   father-figures (it was our</TE>
<TE>   consideration that arranged them so),</TE>
<TE>   they will always outshine us, for we change.</TE>
<TE>   When we behold the water</TE>
<TE>   (which cannot be held, for it keeps turning</TE>
<TE>   into itself), that is how we would move --</TE>
<TE>   but water overruns us.</TE>
<TE>   And when we aspire to be clad in fire</TE>
<TE>   (for who would not put on such apparel?)</TE>
<TE>   the flames only pass us by --</TE>
<TE>   it is a way they have of passing through.</TE>
<TE>   But earth is another matter. Ask earth</TE>
<TE>   to take us, the last mother --</TE>
<TE>   one womb we may reassume. Yes indeed,</TE>
<TE>   we can have the earth. Earth will have us.</TE>

<HD>The natural</HD>
<DH>Charles Darwin: The Power of Place, Janet Browne, Alfred A.
Knopf: 594 pp., $37.50</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Lee Hotz</AU>
<BD>Robert Lee Hotz is a science writer for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 25 well-bred naturalists of London's Linnean Society had no
reason to expect anything unusual when they gathered on a Thursday
evening in 1858 for their regular July meeting. Nor is there any
indication that, when the night was done, they understood that God
had been deposed and the world turned upside-down. These amateur
scientists, however, had witnessed arguably the most important moment
in the history of science and modern thought. It was to them that
Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection was first presented --
an idea that would revolutionize biology and, ultimately, Victorian
society itself by showing that a struggle for survival, not a divine
will, shaped life on Earth.</LD>
<LD>   For Darwin, it was a turning point. He had mailed the research
manuscript a day after his infant son died of scarlet fever. His
brainchild now faced its own mortal test. His claim to be father of
this theory also was at risk: Working independently, a naturalist
named Alfred Wallace had deduced some of the same insights into
evolution and sought Darwin's help in making them public.</LD>
<TE>   Typically, Darwin did not attend that meeting, for no one was more
agitated about the ramifications of his scientific ideas than Darwin
himself, or more uncomfortable with debating them in public. So
unseemly did Darwin consider his convictions about natural selection
that he kept them secret for 20 years. To discuss them publicly at
long last was "like confessing a murder," Darwin confided to a
friend. So on this important evening, Darwin left it for two
influential colleagues -- botanist Joseph Hooker and geologist
Charles Lyell -- to debut his heretical views in public, making sure
his work was presented in conjunction with Wallace's first paper. On
Darwin's behalf, they ignited a controversy that burns no less
fiercely today than 144 years ago, even though science has confirmed
virtually every aspect of its postulates.</TE>
<TE>   English science historian Janet Browne opens the concluding second
volume of her brilliant, landmark biography, "Charles Darwin: The
Power of Place," with this agonizing and yet liberating moment of
public disclosure. Freed for the first time from self-doubt, Darwin
finished his most influential work, "The Origin of Species," in less
than a year. The second half of Darwin's life was dominated by its
publication in 1859 and his surprisingly ruthless efforts to promote
the ideas it articulated.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Power of Place," Browne has chronicled the public birthing
of an idea, long incubated in the womb of Darwin's mind. The paradox
of Darwin's personality is the crux of the story. Darwin was both a
recluse and the most influential public intellect of his century;
jealous and generous; an ocean voyager who hated to travel; a
scientist prone to quackery; an unfettered thinker who chained
himself to rigid domestic routine; the privileged son of the
well-to-do elite, trained for the clergy, whose ideas struck at the
heart of Anglican doctrine, the secularist whose life's work sapped
the power of the established church and yet who was buried with honor
in the nave of Westminster Abbey. What emerges from Browne's book is
the most insightful portrait in a generation of this puzzling and
provocative mind.</TE>
<TE>   In Browne's view, this shy yet well-connected squire's son
conducted his most important work not as a globe-trotting field
biologist aboard the HMS Beagle but in self-imposed exile in the
rural backwater of Downe, a village of barely 500 people in Kent.
There he worked secluded from the distractions of London by country
custom and forbidding parish hedgerows. "These home-based researches
were the hidden triumph of his theory of evolution," Browne writes.
"His family setting, his house, his garden, the surrounding Kent
countryside, and his own sense of himself ... and the property he
owned provided the finely crafted examples of adaptation in action
that lifted his work far out of the ordinary."</TE>
<TE>   In the service of his science, Darwin submitted himself totally to
the discipline of his curiosity, obsessively analyzing the intricate
mechanisms of natural selection and ruthlessly arranging his domestic
routine to accommodate his work. In this vein, Browne demonstrates
how completely Darwin was schooled by his exhaustive investigation of
living things in the fields and gardens of Kent, where little escaped
his sustained attention. He bred pigeons, observed the local bees,
tracked the wriggles of local worms, counted blades of grass, even
monitored the leafy flutter of the twisting creepers that festooned
his garden walls.</TE>
<TE>   What elevates Browne's account of Darwin's life is her insight
into the liberating power of domesticity for a contemplative mind.
She also well understands how, as an invalid, Darwin used his
migraines and digestive disorders to control those around him. She is
on equally intimate terms with Darwin's inner family circle and the
imperial scientific world in which he flourished.</TE>
<TE>   Darwin shrewdly capitalized on the rising fortunes of modern
publishing, the beginnings of mass media and the appetite for ideas
among the burgeoning Victorian middle class. His theory of evolution
was, in a sense, made possible by the British postal system. Spending
more on stamps and stationery in a month than the average workman
made in a year, Darwin orchestrated acceptance of his ideas by mail,
wheedling, cajoling and rallying adherents on two continents from the
seclusion of his study. He deftly deployed dozens of surrogates, who
controlled much of the scientific media of the day, across the
chessboard of public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Darwin left behind 14,000 letters, perhaps half of his
lifetime correspondence, and kept meticulous journals that documented
the daily misgivings and eureka moments of his researches. More is
known about the moment-to-moment development of Darwin's theory of
evolution than any other scientific idea in history. Browne brings to
life this vast archive to show how this radical theory became
conventional wisdom and how, in the process, science supplanted
established religion as the final authority on the origins of life
and the natural order.</TE>
<TE>   Darwin's gift to biology was to give evolution its animating
principle -- the adaptive struggle for survival -- and deduce the
mechanism that drives it -- natural selection. He buttressed this
theory with closely observed evidence published in a series of
volumes that consumed his mature years. As no one before him, Darwin
saw in the minutiae of ordinary living things -- orchids, finches,
tortoises, seeds, barnacles, sundews, vines, insect-eating plants --
the grand sweep of natural selection.</TE>
<TE>   All nature is at war with itself, Darwin declared. God's harmony
was an illusion. There was no hidden hand of divine grace or
intelligent design at work, no progressive ascent to perfection, only
a momentary advantage in an endless struggle to survive and
reproduce. Species were fluid. Organisms shifted randomly.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the elaborate peer review of modern scientific
publishing, Darwin presented his theory as simply as possible to the
general reading public. "The Origin of Species" was published in
straightforward prose as a 502-page volume, priced at 12 shillings a
copy. Anyone could absorb its thesis, and tens of thousands of
attentive readers did. Most of the weaknesses in his arguments --
that contemporary creationists marshal today to contest evolution --
were addressed by Darwin, who didn't hesitate to confront them in
print. He clearly understood that there was no avoiding the religious
and social conflicts arising from his work. If the Bible could not be
trusted in matters of geology and biology, how could it serve as the
authority on morality and salvation?</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot persuade myself," Darwin wrote to his friend Asa Gray,
then America's leading botanist and a man who hoped for evidence of a
deity's guiding influence in nature, "that a beneficent &amp; omnipotent
God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae [wasp] with the
express intention of their feeding within living bodies of
caterpillars or that a cat should play with mice. I am inclined to
look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details
... left to the working out of what we may call chance."</TE>
<TE>   But the Victorian view of biology mirrored that of an established
social order, each individual and species in its fixed place, as
ordained by a divine creation. Social barriers were just as rigid.
Evolution, as espoused by Darwin, was immediately attacked by
creationist clerics of the day as immoral and indecent. Darwin and
his opponents were "perceived as fighting over the right to explain
origins -- a dispute over the boundary between science and the church
that seemed as physically real to the participants and to the
audience as any territorial or geographical warfare," Browne writes.</TE>
<TE>   Convinced of his rectitude, he was the most celebrated thinker of
his day, yet a reluctant celebrity who sought to evade the claims on
his time that honors demanded. He pursued ingenious home-based
experiments secure in his domestic circle of Downe.</TE>
<TE>   Darwin remains so compelling today, in part, because his work
embodies science in its primal essence. His was the uncompromising
effort of a disciplined intelligence in a time before research
harnessed itself so completely to the technology of tools. He needed
no electron microscopes or gene sequencers, no cyclotrons, satellite
sensors or supercomputers to understand life. On occasion, Darwin
borrowed a flower pot to cultivate for his observation the worms that
plowed his garden. Browne's biography deftly captures his
extraordinary accomplishment, explaining why no one, as the Times of
London announced upon Darwin's death at 73 on April 19, 1882,
"wielded a power over men and their intelligence more complete than
that which for the last 23 years has emanated from a simple country
house in Kent."</TE>

<BD>John Lukacs is the author of numerous books, including

and "The Hitler of History."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The military turning point of World War II came in November 1942, 60
years ago, at three different places on the globe. At El Alamein in
Egypt, the British 8th Army won a battle against the German-Italian
African army and began its march westward. A week later, American and
British forces landed in Morocco and Algeria, establishing a second
front, eventually clearing all of Africa of German and Italian
troops. Twelve days later, Russian armies, west of Stalingrad,
encircled the German 6th Army, turning hopeful attackers into
hopeless defenders.</LD>
<LD>   Something similar was developing in the vast reaches of the
Pacific too: By the end of November, the Japanese at Guadalcanal were
no longer advancing but retreating (for the first time in the Pacific
war), though this was not as sudden or dramatic. On Nov. 15, for the
first time since 1940, church bells rang all over Britain. They had
been silent for two years, ordered previously to be rung only in the
event of a German landing in England.</LD>
<TE>   But Churchill warned his people: "Now this is not the end, it is
not even the beginning of the end. But it is perhaps the end of the
beginning." Yes, November 1942 was only the end of the beginning. The
Germans fought on for 2 1/2 years, until the bitter end. Their
fighting ability inspires the interest of people in World War II --
ask publishers, booksellers, filmmakers: That interest goes on and
on. Nothing like this happened in World War I. The reputation of no
German general in World War I comes even close to Erwin Rommel's in
the second.</TE>
<TE>   The battle of El Alamein is the subject of three books, published,
whether by coincidence or not, around this 60th anniversary. They are
different books, but very good ones. Jon Latimer's "Alamein" is the
work of a former British Army officer, a meticulous military history
inclusive of accurate and often hitherto unknown details. It is a
classic, near-encyclopedic reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   So is "The Battle of Alamein" by John Bierman and Colin Smith,
both journalists, whose research too is faultless. It is slightly
longer than Latimer's "Alamein" and includes interesting marginal
matters (for example, the reconstruction of the doings of Laszlo
Almasy, the protagonist of Michael Ondaatje's novel "The English
Patient"). Stephen Bungay's "Alamein" is the work of an amateur
military historian, the shortest book of the three: terse and
brilliantly written by a thorough master of his subject, with perhaps
more emphasis on the political background than in the others.</TE>
<TE>   I read the three books in succession, without a sense of weariness
or repetition, even when turning the pages describing the same
episodes, the same phases of the 10-day battle and the same
personages. It occurred to me that few, if any, professional
historians may be able to attain the quality of these books.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, every historian of World War II may learn a few of
these, chosen at random: The Italian soldiery fought better at El
Alamein than has been customarily assumed. As late as seven days
after Gen. Bernard Law Montgomery launched the battle, the outcome
was still uncertain -- a draw was still possible. German armor was
certainly better than Allied armor, even including the newly arrived
American Sherman tanks. Air superiority was less decisive at El
Alamein than over the Mediterranean, where British air (often
assisted by precious information from "Ultra") was able to destroy
most of the vessels that were shipping precious fuel to Rommel's
overextended supply lines. Desertions were few. Contrary to many of
his critics, Montgomery deserves full credit for El Alamein, where
British superiority in manpower and armor was 2 to 1, not the
threefold or even greater advantage often attributed to Montgomery.
(Hemingway called -- loudly -- his 15-to-1 gin-laden martini a
"Montgomery.")</TE>
<TE>   Five days after Montgomery's 8th Army finally broke through at El
Alamein, American (and smaller British) forces landed in French North
Africa, in Morocco and Algeria. "An Army at Dawn: The War in North
Africa, 1942-1943," the first volume of a planned trilogy by
journalist Rick Atkinson, is precise, on occasion sparkling;
Atkinson's research is extensive; his conclusions are
unexceptionable.</TE>
<TE>   "An Army at Dawn" also includes new and fascinating material. The
French did more damage to the American landings between Nov. 7 and 11
than has been generally accepted. American generals, including
Eisenhower, were almost without exception wanting in dispatch and
energy. Rommel's counterattacks and his defense against overwhelming
American and British power may have been even more stunning than his
last-ditch holding efforts during Alamein. Yet this is not the work
of a debunker but of a thoughtful and deeply interested historian,
with a theme that rises and then resounds at the end: The North
African campaign in the winter and spring of 1942-43 was necessary,
for it was then and there that an insufficiently trained and
inexperienced American soldiery learned the grim experiences of
battle and turned out to be a good and reliable fighting force.</TE>
<TE>   There is a moral in these books, to be considered by all
historians of World War II: The North African campaigns, debouching
into Sicily and Italy -- Churchill's favorite Mediterranean strategy
-- were not mistaken. For many years, military, political, academic
and amateur historians (beginning with J.F.C. Fuller -- a bitter
opponent of Churchill -- and recently by Corelli Barnett) have
argued, at times convincingly, that instead of landing in French
North Africa, the Allies should have invaded France in 1943 and made
straight for Berlin. That was the original American plan, but almost
everything we know now about the Germans' strength and disposition
suggests that this could have been a disaster. The military and
material strength of the Third Reich in 1943 was still sufficient to
defeat an Anglo-American invasion -- or, more likely, to force the
Western Allied armies to halt and dig in somewhere in western France,
which is what Churchill had feared.</TE>
<TE>   As it happened, the Germans lost almost 200,000 men in North
Africa, Sicily and southern Italy, much armor and a portion of their
air forces, and at least a large part of Italy was knocked out of the
war. The dispersion of German power to the Mediterranean cost them as
much as the dispersion of the Anglo-American effort in the
Mediterranean cost the overall Anglo-American thrust toward Germany.
There is more to this than "counterfactual" history of mere
speculation. It is something that we may recognize only after a long
and weary retrospect. It is that in human affairs things turn out in
the way they had to turn out, ever so often. Perhaps even always.</TE>

<HD>Inside the outsider art of African Americans</HD>
<DH>Souls Grown Deep: African American Vernacular Art, Edited

$100; Volume II: 600 pp., $100</DH>

of Black Literature" and "High Cotton."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What the father-and-son team of John and Alan Lomax -- white guys --
did for American music in the 1930s when the two went around the
backwoods of the South recording black musicians and authentic blues,
another father-and-son team of white guys, William and Paul Arnett,
has done for contemporary American art, identifying and collecting
since the 1970s vernacular art made by black artists in the South.
Vernacular art is sometimes called folk or outsider art, because it
is the work of people who have no formal training and, until 20 years
or so ago, was not usually a part of gallery or museum culture. It
was art made and exhibited in backyards, alleys, sheds and in modest
homes, sometimes the houses themselves being objects of decoration.
Its styles suggest that Zora Neale Hurston was not entirely wrong
when she claimed that "the will to adorn" was an important feature of
the visual culture of many black people in the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   On her folklore-collecting expeditions of the 1930s, Hurston sent
back to friends in New York descriptions of the art and artists --
sharecroppers, the formerly enslaved -- that she'd come across, but
she hadn't the time or the means to follow up on her discoveries.
They came and went, these creative souls, presumably known to their
neighbors and sometimes to whites from the other side of town, as in
the case of the elderly artist of tense two-dimensional figures, Bill
Traylor, who became friends with and was encouraged by the young
white artist Charles Shannon in Alabama in the late 1930s. The social
milieu, the racially segregated South, in which vernacular artists
lived and worked was much studied and photographed in the politically
radical '30s, but visual art itself seldom came into the frame, so to
speak.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe this had something to do with the focus on the oral and the
aural as black culture's real achievement, along with the assumption
that poor artists should express themselves through socialist
realism. Maybe it also had to do with the Works Progress
Administration notion that folk art was educational, not commercial;
the idea that folk art's themes could be religious, but not
progressive; and the difficulty that formally trained black artists
had in getting recognition in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, vernacular art endured, and its practitioners
proliferated and found new purposes in the postwar civil rights
atmosphere. Black people asserted to the nation at large the worth of
their true history, what they had been through, what they stood for.
Blacks expressed themselves in visual media even in slavery, but the
majority of such artifacts, from decorated jugs to quilts, were not
preserved. The political movements of the 1950s and 1960s
strengthened a sense of heritage and history. As black people became
more conscious of their traditions from the New World and Africa, the
authority of mainstream critical values was being eroded and people
were finding more intelligence, aesthetic choice and deliberation in
what had often been dismissed or patronized as naive, primitive,
intuitive.</TE>
<TE>   The first major exhibition of vernacular art was "Black Folk Art
in America, 1930-1980," held at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington,
D.C., in 1982. Since then the art of Purvis Young, Jesse Aaron and
Archie Byron, for example, has become more widely known. Thornton
Dial Sr. had major exhibitions at two New York museums in 1993. The
Kunstmuseum in Bern, Switzerland, and the Museum Ludwig in Cologne,
Germany, gave an exhibition of Traylor's work, "Deep Blues," in 1999.
But then Traylor (1854-1949), like the sculptor William Edmondson
(1870-1951) and the painter Horace Pippin (1888-1946), had long been
recognized in art circles, if under the category "self-taught," as in
Romare Bearden and Harry Henderson's "A History of African-American
Artists: From 1792 to the Present" (1993). What the Arnetts stress in
"Souls Grown Deep: African American Vernacular Art" is that the genre
continues to thrive and find new exponents, even among those who were
born after the era of struggle against legal segregation in the
South.</TE>
<TE>   After an odyssey of discovery spanning three decades, William and
Paul Arnett have produced two enormous volumes (with nearly 1,800
full-color reproductions) about this indigenous art, with a promise
of more. In his introduction, Paul Arnett allows that "Souls Grown
Deep" is "the first comprehensive overview of the recent history" of
vernacular art. The catalog is a history, though it is not organized
chronologically. "We have chosen as our guide and narrator the
materials of the work: stone, concrete, earth, wood, paint and paper,
then iron and steel, found-object assemblage, and other forms of
bricolage epitomized by the African American 'yard show.' "</TE>
<TE>   These volumes developed from an exhibition of the same title of 26
artists in Atlanta in 1996. Although dealers have been setting up
their tents at large venues in New York for a while, Atlanta has long
been the hub for dealing in outsider art because, as several of the
more than 100 biographical and cultural essays in these volumes on
the work of some 70 artists point out, vernacular art is mostly a
Southern thing.</TE>
<TE>   Up until the 1950s, the majority of black people in the U.S. lived
in the Southern states, the land of those who knew how to "make a way
out of no way," writes historian Vincent Harding in an essay included
here, quoting Martin Luther King Jr. And so there is much emphasis
here on strategies of expression, on either the use or the
transcendence of codes, particularly among women, and on traditions
since the 1970s. Amiri Baraka, who offers a rambunctious essay, set
the terms of the study of vernacular culture as social history in his
unsurpassed 1963 book on black music, "Blues People."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the essay included here on painter Mose Tolliver, whose
work is abundantly represented in the Arnett collection, uses a
musical vocabulary -- percussiveness, chromatic harmony and
syncopation -- to describe the blues elements of his paintings. But
for all the theoretical flight and challenge of some of the essays,
the real interest of these volumes is in the full-color photographs
and the biographies of the artists.</TE>
<TE>   The art reproduced in "Souls Grown Deep" is drawn mostly from the
Arnett collection, work done primarily in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.
We get Ralph Griffin's root and wood sculptures; James "Son" Thomas'
eerie portrait heads done in unfired clay, often finished off with
artificial hair, glasses and human teeth; Jimmy Lee Sudduth's
renderings of dogwood trees in mud and paint on wood; and Alyne
Harris' gentle landscapes in acrylic. There are moving stories, like
that of Nellie Mae Rowe, who could fashion pieces from chewing gum,
costume jewelry, ribbon and ceramic tile. She recalled the sound of
the rats gnawing to get to the flour paste that mounted her drawings
to the walls of the cabin where she grew up. When she heard them, she
jammed hatpins into the walls and left the rats speared until
morning.</TE>
<TE>   She came to the artist's life late, as did Gertrude Morgan, who
transformed her house into a showcase for Scripture. Bessie Harvey
saw herself as a mere vessel. Her sculpture, inspired by what she saw
in nature, had magic only because it came from God, she said.
Religion is a frequent subject in this work, but these artists can
also take their inspiration from popular culture, as Royal
Robertson's flying saucers in ballpoint and marker show.</TE>
<TE>   It may be hard not to think someone like the reclusive Juanita
Rogers, who communed with the spirits in her Alabama mud pieces,
sculpture done in clay, bones and Spanish moss, a little mad. But the
essay that accompanies illustrations of John B. Murray's work in
paint and marker on paper or Formica encourages us to compare his
allegorical world and isolation to that of the obsessed people, cut
off from the mainstream, who produced the work exhibited in, say, the
Musee de l'Art Brut in Lausanne, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Art rescued some of the people who tell their stories in "Souls
Grown Deep." For instance, Lonnie Holley, who makes extraordinary
assemblages, was sold for whiskey as an infant. His mother had had 27
children by the time he found her. In the meantime, he experienced
much brutality in foster homes, juvenile detention and as a migrant
laborer. "The freedom came when Mr. Arnett came," he said. Holley
realized in his late 20s he could turn his life around through art,
though his determination cost him his marriage. Elsewhere in these
volumes, we find the stories and art of elderly couples, people who
worked, retired and then pursued life their way, their creative
endeavors becoming a kind of testimony of their own lives and times
as well as a form of remembering and reclaiming the past.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes vernacular art is a family passion. Thornton Dial Sr.,
born in 1928, cannot read or write and makes intricate sculpture and
assemblages of wood or steel. Thornton Dial Jr., born in 1953,
(Thornton Dial III is also an artist) shares some of his father's
themes, but he can be more overt. His brother, Richard, makes chair
sculptures. Thornton Dial Sr.'s brother, Arthur, makes collages,
executed in some cases in burlap, industrial sealing compound,
enamel, cardboard, Bondo and plastic window blinds on wood. A cousin
who died young, Ronald Lockett, was said to have found his "voice" in
tin, with its properties of rust and oxidation, as he began to
despair of the world at large.</TE>
<TE>   Yard shows, a kind of site-specific art that evolved from the
necessity of blacks' having to make do with castoffs, matter here.
Art historian Robert Farris Thompson likens the tires, plastic
figures and objects in trees, features common to many yard
constructions, to the charms, or nkisi, of the Kongo people in
central Africa. One person's junk is another's symbolic reading of
the cosmos. "Souls Grown Deep" features several yard shows, among
them Tallahassee resident Mary Proctor's automobile, decorated with
buttons, watches, jewelry, anything she could find, and Charlie
Lucas' animals fashioned from welded metal strips in his yard in Pink
Lily, Ala. Joe Minter's Birmingham, Ala., yard is a memorial to
African American historical figures. Joe Light's Memphis house and
yard are given over to religious exhortation.</TE>
<TE>   To work with the castoff materials of society may be a tradition
among blacks, just as the decorated interior may have come from the
days when the poor in the South insulated their homes with newspapers
and other materials at hand. But other traditions are more immediate
and personal. Some of the artists represented in the Arnett
collection use skills learned from parents and grandparents. Other
skills have been picked up in kitchens or penitentiaries and from
occupations such as welder, concrete mixer or carpenter. But for all
the shared cultures and experiences, it is remarkable how individual
the stories and works are. Each artist stands out, somehow. And as
various are the interpretations of vernacular art, its sources and
meanings, "Souls Grown Deep" serves to remind the anxious, hyped glut
of the current cultural scene that art has no real reward outside of
itself.</TE>

<LD>Ah, Mikhail, O Fidel!, N.D. Williams, Xlibris: 550 pp., 23.95</LD>
<LD>   Sailing out of the blue, "Ah, Mikhail, O Fidel!" is a novel that
takes on the sometimes fragile but powerful threads that bind
personal lives to the politics of the world. N.D. Williams was born
in Guyana and went to school in Jamaica. He has written several
novels and short stories and won literary prizes, such as the 1976
Casa de Las Americas prize for fiction. His books are not
experimental in terms of language. They are not raving manifestos.
They do not include eye-popping sex and violence. And yet they are
considered outsider fiction. This happens, and when it does, the
authors are forced to self-publish their manuscripts, as Williams has
done in this case.</LD>
<TE>   Radix, the central character in "Ah, Mikhail, O Fidel!," came to
the United States when he was 26. He helped his mother clean houses,
got himself educated and became a high school teacher in the Bronx,
the perfect setting for a novel about dysfunctional urban life. "Look
at it," his friend Mahmood says. "Have you ever stopped to look at
it? It's like a warehouse. One huge warehouse. And we clock in every
morning and the kids report every day .... Public education, right?
Taking attendance is like taking inventory.... [O]ur job is really to
keep them off the streets for six hours so they won't get into
trouble and get thrown into that other warehouse ... on Riker's
Island."</TE>
<TE>   When the Soviet Union falls, Radix becomes nervous because, as his
friend Mahmood says, "No balance to the world. No alternative. Except
our friend in Havana, Fidel." Radix's anxiety grows all the more keen
as he threads his way between an honest life and a darker side: the
carjackings and break-ins and the police who don't like you for one
reason or another (in Radix's case, it's skin color). He admires his
friend, the handyman Blackwelder: "Here was a man free of nostalgia
and orthodoxy. No regrets, no hankering for old island pursuits....
Blackwelder was in pursuit of no dream."</TE>
<TE>   Radix, however, needs a dream, and in his life as an immigrant, he
has fallen between the cracks of island love (a kind of tribal love),
democracy and communism. When a student in the high school is shot by
the police for "resisting arrest," he finds his lack of a dream all
the more painful. Life, at least urban life, stops making sense. "The
old systems crumbling, dogmas unmasked; gratuitous acts of
hopelessness corroding the stations of city life here in this
nineteen ninety two world; trees crashing in the forests....How could
he explain the sequence of events set in motion by Xavier's death?"</TE>
<TE>   Books like Williams' have to remain outsider fiction because they
are not about or sprung from people who change the system from
within. They were never let in. They nibble away at the margins.</TE>

<TE>   Some of Her Friends That Year: New and Selected Stories, Maxine
Chernoff, Coffee House Press: 312 pp., $16.95</TE>
<TE>   Maxine Chernoff is a quiet writer who packs a powerful punch when
she chooses her battles. Her novel, "A Boy in Winter," about a young
boy who kills his friend with a crossbow by accident, is one example.
"Some of her Friends That Year" is no exception. Her characters are
plain-spoken but existentially confused. "November afternoons while
Amy worked alone in the studio, words spoken to her came back,
unencumbered by feeling, trees in a forest falling and only Amy to
hear them." These stories, like her novels, are not about
certainties. They tend to be about all the things we don't know,
vague floating feelings. "Maybe there would be new words soon to
describe these feelings," says a mother in the story, "Coming Apart
and Together" (which begins with the wonderful line, "All the
Buddhists were getting divorced that spring."). Often her characters
know each other well and tell each other everything, but their minds
are still full of the questions: Did I do the right thing? Did I say
the wrong thing? There are few chances for redemption or correction;
these are not the kind of people who go back and retrace steps.
That's for the movies. "We are lucky," says one character in true
Chernoff style, "to have whatever we are given."</TE>

<HD>American history's bloodiest day</HD>
<DH>Crossroads of Freedom: Antietam, James M. McPherson Oxford
University Press: 208 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Rhodehamel</AU>
<BD>John Rhodehamel is Norris Foundation curator of
American history at the Huntington Library. He is organizing a new
exhibition, "Forever Free: Lincoln's Journey to Emancipation."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James M. McPherson is America's preeminent Civil War historian. His
new book tells the story of one violent day when the whole American
future was up for grabs. Had that day ended differently, had the
Confederate Army prevailed at the Battle of Antietam, the history
that we know would never have come to be. Another future, one we can
only imagine, would have followed.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine this: The Confederacy would have probably won independence
-- a new nation dedicated to the proposition that some people are
created slaves -- and America's revolutionary experiment to determine
whether ordinary people can govern themselves would have been fatally
discredited. There would have been two antagonistic nation states
between Canada and Mexico. Other wars between the North and the South
would have been inevitable. The rivalry would have precluded the rise
of a continental American republic as a great world power, eventually
the great world power. What then would have been the prospects of
defeating the murderous totalitarian regimes of the 20th century? In
McPherson's hands, the Battle of Antietam gains an urgent immediacy,
because his brief narrative is driven by an awareness of the element
of contingency, the "what if" of history. By showing how Antietam
changed the course of the Civil War, "Crossroads of Freedom" suggests
how the outcome may have shaped world history.</LD>
<TE>   McPherson describes the fighting itself in no more than 20 pages,
but few who read those pages are likely to forget them. The most
harrowing passages force us to confront the physical reality of war.
Antietam furnished scenes of such horror that veteran officers were
reduced to mute, incontinent children. Storms of projectiles left men
holed and punctured, shattered into fragments, beheaded and
disemboweled. Those left standing spoke of "hundreds of dead bodies
lying in rows and in piles." There were mires of congealed blood,
heaps of "vomit and excrement," an "insupportable" stink of rotting
flesh and the abominable sight of hogs and maggots feasting on
soldiers' corpses. A year later, the fields were still strewn with
bones. For years to come there would remain the hobbling, crippled
survivors, and enduring desolation in thousands of hearts. About
6,500 American soldiers died at Antietam. An additional 15,000 were
wounded. Sept. 17, 1862, remains the bloodiest single day in the
nation's history. Those killed at Antietam outnumber the dead of
Pearl Harbor and D-day combined.</TE>
<TE>   All the bloodshed at Antietam would have been little more than a
ghastly exhibition of human ferocity had not the American Civil War
been imbued with a higher purpose: the emancipation of 4 million
slaves. "Without slavery the rebellion could never have existed;
without slavery it could not continue," Abraham Lincoln said. No one
doubted that in the 1860s, though many have tried to deny it since.
The irony is that, during the first year of the war, both the North
and South fought to preserve slavery. While it is clear that the
Confederacy fought for national independence as a new slave empire,
it is sometimes forgotten that in 1862 the North's war aims still did
not include a policy as radical as the abolition of slavery. For the
first year and a half of the Civil War, the North fought merely to
restore the "Union as it was," the union of free and slave states
that had existed since the founding. No one then knew that in July
1862, President Lincoln had already decided to free all the enslaved
people in the rebelling states if the Confederates did not lay down
their arms before the end of the year. "We must free the slaves or be
ourselves subdued," he told his Cabinet. But his advisors persuaded
him that the stroke against slavery must not fall when Northern
armies were on the run. Emancipation at such a time would come as an
admission of desperation. It would seem, said Secretary of State
William H. Seward, like "the last measure of an exhausted government,
a cry for help ... our last shriek, on the retreat." And so,
McPherson writes, Lincoln "put the proclamation away to wait for
military victory. It would prove to be a long, dismal wait."</TE>
<TE>   But by September 1862, the Union's survival was very much in
doubt. Never had Confederate prospects looked brighter. An aura of
invincibility kept company with Gen. Robert E. Lee's hard-bitten
soldiers as they waded across the Potomac River into Maryland in the
first Confederate invasion of the North. For the last three months,
the rebels had whipped the Yankees time after time. They were sure
they could do it again -- this time on Union soil -- and their
confidence was bolstered by the knowledge that one more Southern
victory would almost surely make it impossible for Lincoln to win, or
even to continue, his war to save the Union.</TE>
<TE>   The South was hoping for diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy
by Britain and France, which would not only bring European aid into
their coffers but also provoke hostilities between the United States
and Britain. A Southern victory would also provide the already robust
antiwar and pro-Confederate faction in the North a significant boost.
McPherson quotes Confederate Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin's
prediction that "our recognition would be the signal for the
immediate organization of a large and influential party in the
Northern States favorable to putting an end to the war." Benjamin was
wrong only if he supposed that such a party was not already
flourishing. There were many in the free states who had opposed the
war from the start. Each fresh defeat swelled their strength. It
looked like the Democrats would seize control of Congress in the
midterm elections and compel the president to begin peace talks with
the Confederates. That would mean Southern independence.</TE>
<TE>   Lee crossed into Maryland, just days after giving the North
another humiliating beating at the Battle of Second Manassas. The
demoralized Union army had no choice but to face its formidable foes
again. Commanding for the Union was Gen. George B. McClellan, surely
one the most exasperating figures in all American history. McClellan
was a military genius crippled by a curious mixture of megalomaniacal
self-confidence and native cowardice. Lincoln had decided that
McClellan "has the slows." Almost as succinctly, McPherson presents
"McClellan in a nutshell -- he would take no initiative without
'absolute assurance of success' -- which rarely if ever exists in any
human endeavor, much less in war." Through an extraordinary stroke of
luck, a Union soldier stumbled on a copy of Lee's secret plans for
the Maryland campaign. McClellan learned that the Confederate Army
was divided and vulnerable to attack in detail. A bolder commander
would have used the intelligence to destroy Lee's army. But
McClellan, true to character, vacillated and threw away a shot at
ending the war. Lee was able to bring his forces together before the
headlong collision of the two armies.</TE>
<TE>   Antietam was, nonetheless, a strategic victory for the North. The
war would drag on for another 2 1/2 years, but the last best hope for
Confederate independence had vanished with the gun smoke. The North's
victory was all the more commanding because it was so unexpected. The
Army of the Potomac had stopped the Army of Northern Virginia cold
and sent it reeling back to Virginia, nearly one-third of its troops
dead, wounded or prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   McPherson's book represents a trend that many readers are sure to
welcome: Some of our finest historians have taken to writing very
short books. Gordon Wood has traced the entire era of the American
Revolution, 1763 to 1789, in a half-inch-thick volume with just 160
pages of text. Edmund Morgan has captured Benjamin Franklin in a
300-page biography. Now, McPherson has demonstrated that he needs
only 150 pages of narrative to describe the war's most critical
turning point and, in so doing, to illuminate the true meaning of the
vast struggle between freedom and slavery.</TE>
<TE>   "Crossroads of Freedom: Antietam" is the latest installment in the
new Oxford University Press series "Pivotal Moments in American
History." The purpose of the series is to invite us to ask how
history might have diverged from its familiar path. "The victory at
Antietam could have been more decisive," McPherson writes. "But Union
armies had stymied the supreme Confederate efforts.... Foreign powers
backed away from intervention.... Lincoln issued his Emancipation
Proclamation. Northern voters chastised but did not overthrow the
Republican party, which forged ahead with its program to preserve the
Union and give it a new birth of freedom. ... Here indeed was a
pivotal moment."</TE>

<LD>Twelve Bar Blues, Patrick Neate, Grove Press: 402 pp., $24</LD>
<LD>   English novelist Patrick Neate makes his American debut with this
multigenerational, multicultural odyssey of a novel that won the
prestigious Whitbread Award when it was published in Britain last
year. Centering on the birth of "hot jazz" in New Orleans, "Twelve
Bar Blues" blows with all its might over 400 pages, shifting between
continents like an old pro stampeding through key changes and
tackling 200 years of intermingling African, American and British
history along the way.</LD>
<LD>   Of the book's several players, its standout is Lick Holden, a
gifted black cornetist who grew up during the teens and '20s in a
rough-and-tumble "Cooltown" on the outskirts of New Orleans.
Surrounded by an inchoate household of prostitutes and riffraff, the
good-hearted Lick survives a brutal correctional school, masters the
steamy new music, rubs shoulders with Louis Armstrong and Kid Ory and
pines for his high-yellow stepsister, Sylvie, a prostitute and
sometime singer who attempts to pass in white society.</LD>
<TE>   If Lick's story of jazz, assimilation and heartbreak forms the
basic progression of "Twelve Bar Blues," it's the stories of Lick's
ancestors and descendants that provide the blue notes: In particular,
there's Sylvia Di Napoli, a beautiful, aging London prostitute (and
sometime singer) whose Italian surname can't explain her obvious
African heritage (we recognize her as Lick's granddaughter). On her
hilarious journey to New York, Chicago and New Orleans to untangle
her American roots, she's joined by two suitors who echo her
intertwined identity: Jim Tulloh, a well-meaning English boozehound,
and Musa, a reefer-smoking witchdoctor who mysteriously shows up from
the African village where Sylvia's (and Lick's) people originally
came from.</TE>
<TE>   If it all sounds rather cosmic, it is. "Twelve Bar Blues" is an
anything-goes melting-pot hybrid of "Ragtime" and "White Teeth." And
Neate clearly loves the bandstand, tossing off neat -- sometimes too
neat -- riffs: "[F]ate is a perverse trickster with no sense of
timing"; "there ain't nothin' so damn complicated as a story"; "in
jazz music the future, the past and the present are all happenin'
right now."</TE>
<TE>   Although Neate hits the occasional clam (the Empire State Building
and the TriBeCa neighborhood didn't exist in 1926) and his sense of
drama can't possibly match that of an Armstrong solo, "Twelve Bar
Blues" is an entertaining reminder that "fate can improvise like the
most nimble-fingered pianist."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Edinburgh, Alexander Chee, Picador USA: 212 pp., $13 paper</TE>
<TE>   Two-thirds of the way through "Edinburgh," Alexander Chee's
impressive first novel, Aphias Zhe, known as Fee, offers another of
his typically startling admissions: "I no longer spent all my time
wanting to die, but I was fairly apprehensive about being alive."
Fee, who grows up in Maine with Korean and English heritage, is a
seductive storyteller, as hardheaded as he is equivocal: He's a
survivor who flirts with suicide ideation; an earnest kid who
occasionally finds himself freebasing coke or tripping his brains
out; a victim of a pedophile who grows up to be a fairly
well-adjusted gay adult, albeit one with some understandable issues.</TE>
<TE>   When we first meet Fee, he's trying out for the Pine State Boys
Chorus and developing an obsession with Peter, a towheaded choir mate
who becomes his best friend. While their pedophile choir master, Big
Eric, works his way through the soprano section, Fee and Peter find
their child world colliding with encroaching teenhood: The '80s are
upon us, and the duo take a liking to hard-core shows, Marlboros and
patch-elbow sweaters from Goodwill.</TE>
<TE>   "Edinburgh" has delightful period touches, but it's hardly
sentimental: Big Eric is busted for his odious crimes; Peter later
commits suicide, leaving Fee forever heavy-hearted; and Fee's
erstwhile adolescent lover does himself in too. In fact, there's so
much suicide and impropriety in "Edinburgh" that it begins to seem
improbable. But Fee and his world remain stubbornly real, even as
they aspire to poetry: "[M]y voice felt to me like a leak sprung from
a small and secret star hidden somewhere in my chest," Fee tells us
of his choir days. In "Edinburgh," Chee's voice is every bit as
celestial.</TE>

<HD>UC Irvine theater for its fairest lady</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ANN CONWAY</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling his stepmother, Claire Trevor, "my fair lady," billionaire
real estate developer Donald Bren presented UC Irvine with the late
actress' 1948 Oscar (for "Key Largo") and 1957 Emmy (for a production
of "Dodsworth") at the dedication of the university's Claire Trevor
Theatre. "It was almost three years ago that she made her last
appearance at this theater," Bren said as he stood onstage before a
black-tie crowd that included UCI Chancellor Ralph Cicerone and
former state Sen. Marian Bergeson. "A group of students brought tears
to her eyes as they sang show tunes in her honor." That night,
students asked about her 80 years as a performer and about co-stars
John Wayne, Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart and Spencer Tracy, Bren
said. "As always, she was quick, candid, opinionated and funny. She
stole the show and the kids stole her heart."</LD>
<TE>   Trevor went on to make a major gift for the completion of the
theater and later made another major gift to the university's school
of the arts; she died in 2000 at age 91. During the gala dedication
Nov. 16, UCI performing arts students -- graduates and undergraduates
alike -- performed the star's favorite musical, Lerner &amp; Loewe's "My
Fair Lady." "It is such a beautiful play about language, which Claire
Trevor was exquisite at," said director Robert Cohen, the
university's Claire Trevor Professor of Drama. "And it is about
style, culture and the elimination of class difference, which, of
course, as a working actor all her life, Claire knew about -- she was
a woman who knew about the travails of labor and wealth. She was very
interested in the issues of this play."</TE>

<DH>Rebecca Miller looks to chart frustration, ambition and
transcendence via her stories about three women in 'Personal
Velocity.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Clark</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's hard not to resent Rebecca Miller. After all, she's tall and
thin, with legs up to there and ringlets framing a lovely face. She's
also Arthur Miller's daughter and Daniel Day-Lewis' wife (they have
two young children), and she's made a name for herself by writing and
directing last year's Grand Jury Prize winner at the Sundance Film
Festival, "Personal Velocity," which opens Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   What's even more envy-inducing is that the film, based on a
collection of her short stories, exhibits sympathy for women who are
a lot less fortunate than Miller is. The first segment (the movie is
a triptych) stars Kyra Sedgwick as Delia, a promiscuous high school
girl who marries young, bears three children and then runs from her
abusive husband straight into a dead-end job waiting tables. In the
second story, Parker Posey plays Greta, a cookbook editor whose work
with a literary star unleashes her suppressed ambitions, driving her
back toward her estranged father and away from her loving husband. In
the final piece, Fairuza Balk is Paula, a disaffected young woman
whose kindness to a hitchhiker puts her unwanted pregnancy in a new
perspective.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, 39, says that there's a little bit of her in these women,
but not in the proportions people might think.</LD>
<TE>   "Many think I'm Greta," Miller says, alluding to that character's
privileged upbringing, but she believes that would be incorrect.
"It's Delia. I think there is a part of me that says in my head some
of the things that she says [out loud]. I think we all do. But I
think there's more to it than that. I think that for me and many
women -- and again, it's a matter of degree; she's an extreme form of
it, because she's the school slut, and I definitely was not the
school slut -- the whole identification with sexuality, where does
that leave you later in life? Who is that woman when her identity has
been formed by sexuality so completely?"</TE>
<TE>   That identification with your sexuality is especially true, notes
Sedgwick, "if you're attractive or you've gotten positive
reinforcement for your body or your accouterments." The actress feels
compelled to add at this point that the "spectacular-looking" Miller
was a commanding physical presence on the set.</TE>
<TE>   Despite her intellectual, physical and genetic gifts, Miller's
personal velocity has not had a steady upward trajectory. She is the
daughter of Miller's third wife, Inge Morath, and was reared and
educated in Connecticut, majoring in English literature and painting
at Yale. She went to Germany on a fellowship, and there she first
considered filmmaking as a career, though it was an outgrowth of her
interest in painting and therefore arty, experimental, devoted to
dreams.</TE>
<TE>   She returned to the U.S., where she showed her paintings and began
acting. She appeared in such films as "Regarding Henry" (which helped
her finance a short, "Florence"), "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious
Circle" and "Consenting Adults." All the while she was writing
screenplays.</TE>
<TE>   She says of acting: "I was trying to do it as well as I could, but
I always knew that it was not going to be my life. It was great
because I could support myself and I also learned about the process
of filmmaking and directing. I gained this great respect for actors,
which I didn't have before. I had seen it more from the filmmaker's
perspective, the visual aspect of it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Miller directed her first feature, "Angela," about a
young girl who believes that if she purifies herself, she can cure
her mentally ill mother. It won the filmmakers' trophy and
cinematography awards at Sundance. But it was followed by years of
development hell (though it was during this period that she married
Day-Lewis, who starred in an on-screen version of her father's play
"The Crucible"). It was when two projects fell through, one of them
in pre-production, that she decided to get off the development
merry-go-round. At the time she was living in Italy with her
firstborn while her husband was shooting "Gangs of New York."</TE>
<TE>   "I just sat down and thought I don't want to live this way
anymore," she says. "I have a compulsion to tell stories. I write
every day, all day. I write screenplays, which nobody will give me
money to make. Why don't I just try writing fiction? At that point I
wasn't thinking so much about publishing as mental health, really. I
was living in Europe. I was kind of out of touch with everybody.
Nobody was expecting anything of me."</TE>
<TE>   A friend put her in touch with an agent, who sent her stories out.
To her surprise, publishers were interested. At around the same time,
Gary Winick of InDigEnt, which produces dirt-cheap feature films on
digital video, called to ask if she had any scripts that could be
made that way. She said no but that she had some stories that might
work, so she sent him "Delia" and "Greta" because she thought they
were the least "interior." Instead of picking one of them, he picked
them both and suggested that she add a third, creating a triptych.
Her short story collection also needed an addition, so she wrote
"Paula" to satisfy both film and fiction.</TE>
<TE>   This mingling of mediums -- Miller just signed on to do a rewrite
of the Pulitzer- and Tony-winning play "Proof" for a Miramax screen
adaptation -- in part explains "Personal Velocity's" literary
qualities. There's a voice-over, by John Ventimiglia, that describes,
often word for word from the book, what's going on in the characters'
heads and recounts their back stories as flashbacks. Part of this
strategy was also financial; the film was shot for "way under a
million dollars" in 16 days, according to Miller. When some scenes
proved too costly or time-consuming to shoot, they'd freeze a frame
of, say, Delia having her head smashed into a table by her husband,
and then the narrator would describe how she got to that point. They
made a virtue out of necessity.</TE>
<TE>   'I carved out a little niche'</TE>
<TE>   Miller has also made a virtue out of the necessity of emerging
from her father's enormous shadow. It can't be easy being the
daughter of one of America's foremost playwrights, especially if you
choose, as she did, to become an artist.</TE>
<TE>   "I think early on I felt sad that he was always mentioned," she
says. "It would just make me mad because I felt like I could never
start clean. Everybody else got to be who they were. I made my peace
with that quite a while ago. The choice is paralysis or anger or
ignoring it. And I've chosen ignoring it. Not ignoring my father,
whom I adore and who's my really close friend. "I think what I did
was I carved out a little niche for myself that's small, that's
mine."</TE>
<TE>   This attitude has also come in handy with her husband, one of the
world's most celebrated actors. The family currently lives in
Ireland. "It couldn't have been better training," she says of her
upbringing with a famous man. "It's kind of like people with five
kids. If they have another, they don't really notice."</TE>

<HD>Advice from a first kid</HD>
<DH>As the Bush twins turn 21, a former presidential daughter
shares some tips on facing the spotlight's intense glare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patti Davis</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OnMonday, Barbara and Jenna Bush will turn 21. And on that day, one
thing is certain: They will no longer be afforded any mercy or
consideration for their age by the press. They will become fair game
to the country's preoccupation with the private lives of public
people.</LD>
<LD>   I had already passed the marker of my 21st birthday when my father
was elected president, so I was afforded no honeymoon period. I
probably wouldn't have benefited from it anyway. It was in my nature
at that time to be my own version of Attila the Hun; I should have
worn a T-shirt that said, "Make War, Not Peace," but that would have
required a sense of humor, which I hadn't yet discovered in myself.</LD>
<LD>   There aren't that many of us who have lived under the glare of
first family fame, who have tried in vain to squint past it. So maybe
amid all the voices giving advice on this momentous birthday, mine
will be worth adding.</LD>
<TE>   While it's certainly true that I could have had an easier time of
it if I had been quieter, less public, less opinionated, less
controversial, it's also true that the media and the public would
have clawed their way in no matter what I did. You're a sitting
target. There is no dimmer switch on the spotlight that blazes around
you until another president is elected.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a you that the spotlight can't get to, that is out of
reach of the public's greedy hands. I didn't realize that then, but I
do now.</TE>
<TE>   Of all my regrets, this is the biggest one: I wish I had listened
more -- not to others, but to the quiet voice inside me. The thing
about being a first daughter or a first son is that it's so noisy.
Everyone everywhere has an opinion about what you should do, what you
should think, who you should be. It's hard to hear that inside voice,
the one that is authentically, resolutely you -- it just gets drowned
out.</TE>
<TE>   I think some of that chatter fades into background noise when you
remember a few important truisms about human nature. No matter what
people say, there isn't anyone alive who really believes he or she
could live under the first family spotlight and not blow it
sometimes. The reporters who indict you in print, the letter writers
who scold you, the clusters of people who gather in coffee shops and
living rooms and dissect you -- they are all secretly relieved that
their fathers never decided to run for president.</TE>
<TE>   If they think about it -- and they do at times -- they cherish the
moments when no one knows who they are and no one pays attention to
what they're doing. They don't know how they would handle it if
people were always spying on their lives; they don't know how you do.</TE>
<TE>   We all, at times, stare into the mirror and wonder who we are.
Sometimes we try to find ourselves in the mirror of other people's
eyes, compose ourselves like paint-by-number drawings according to
someone else's vision. The risky thing when you're in the first
family is that there are so many people holding up mirrors and
telling you to fit into theirs, that you can end up splintered beyond
recognition.</TE>
<TE>   You end up living your life from the outside in, and it might work
for a while, but, eventually, it won't. Because when something big
and cumbersome and painful happens -- a loss, a death, an illness, an
avalanche of grief -- the inside is all that's going to pull you
through.</TE>
<TE>   Works in progress</TE>
<TE>   When anyone turns 21, there are the obligatory words and phrases
that come with the territory: "responsibility," "appropriate
behavior," "maturity." When you're a member of the first family, the
words are said by a greater number of people and hurled at you with
more velocity. I don't really think anyone knows what those words
mean; it's just a habit that's been around for a long time.</TE>
<TE>   This is my birthday message: Remember that anyone who tries to
draw you is merely a sketch artist -- the real painter is you.
Remember that there are no rules, no codes, for being a member of the
first family -- even the founding fathers didn't tackle that one.
Remember, everyone is a work in progress.</TE>
<TE>   And remember what Elie Wiesel said: "When you die and go to
heaven, our maker is not going to ask, 'Why didn't you discover the
cure for such and such? Why didn't you become the messiah?' The only
question we will be asked in that precious moment is, 'Why didn't you
become you?' "</TE>
<TE>   I have only one other piece of advice, a specific one: Don't do
any interviews. You don't have to explain yourself to the public. And
if I ever come knocking for an interview myself, politely decline and
remind me that I told you to.</TE>

<LD>Chevrolet Caprice -- An article in last Sunday's Calendar about Ford
Motor Co. design director J Mays included a quote from Mays referring
to a 1963 Caprice owned by his family when he was a child. In fact,
Chevrolet, the manufacturer of the Caprice, did not produce that car
until 1965. Mays misspoke -- his family's car at the time was a
Chevrolet Impala.</LD>

<HD>The art of the ordeal</HD>
<DH>A TV movie on the rescued Pennsylvania miners shows a
network's dizzying pursuit of 'reality.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Somerset, Pa.</DL>
<LD>The September air in the Rhoads Farm cornfield was cold, and as
midnight approached freezing rain started to spit down. That brought
a close to the evening's shooting on ABC's "The Pennsylvania Miners'
Story," which recounts the ordeal and rescue of nine trapped miners,
a news story that mesmerized the nation for three days in July.</LD>
<LD>   Before the weather sent everyone home, it was hard to tell the
actors from the locals among the dozens of hard-hatted, big-muscled,
somber-faced men swarming around. Bob Long was there. The civil
engineer was warily watching a man, wearing Long's own gold chain,
reenact a tense scene from the real rescue, when Long used GPS
technology to pinpoint the location where a drill would dig toward
the nine miners trapped 240 feet below ground. Long's real-life
colleague from that night was there too, but he was getting ready for
his role as an extra helping on the rescue.</LD>
<LD>   The melding of reality and fiction in Somerset was dizzying.</LD>
<TE>   Long couldn't lend the shirt he wore the night of the real rescue:
It had already been snatched up by the Windber Coal Heritage Center,
which had its own filmmaker on the movie set, making a documentary
about the making of the movie. That project will become part of the
museum's exhibit on the rescue, as integral to the story as the
rescue itself.</TE>
<TE>   Getting the details right was important to the Walt Disney Co.,
ABC's parent and the movie's producer, which spent an unusually high
$8.5 million to shoot the TV film, in part, at the real Quecreek mine
entrance; at the real clapboard Sipesville volunteer fire hall where
family members sat on folding chairs and waited days for news; and at
Somerset General Hospital, where the miners were treated. The real
30-inch drill even roared to life to re-create parts of the rescue.
Doug Custer, one of the so-called Forgotten 9 who escaped the mine
before it flooded -- trapping nine others inside -- has a speaking
part in the movie. If real players from the drama weren't on set as
extras, their children or relatives were; the actors wore their real
counterparts' T-shirts, as well as their jewelry, and got their hair
cut by their real counterpart's barber. "The Pennsylvania Miners'
Story" airs tonight at 9 on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   As for the actors, the producers chose mostly unknown faces --
with the exception of "Cheers" alum John Ratzenberger -- to add to
the project's verisimilitude.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the closest blurring of fact and movie I've ever seen," says
executive producer Larry Sanitsky, whose credits include such TV
movies as "The Last Don" and "Tommyknockers," as well as fact-based
TV films about the Titanic and Aristotle Onassis.</TE>
<TE>   Disney, which paid a record $1.5 million to the miners and Long
for the rights to the story (up from a usual $25,000), went to great
lengths to protect its property by shutting out fact-based accounts
of the ordeal in the news media.</TE>
<TE>   On July 28, as the nation followed closely on TV news, the miners
were pulled up one-by-one in a yellow steel hoist. Disney and ABC
quickly went into high gear. By Aug. 1, the deal had been struck for
the movie and a book recounting the experience, with exclusivity on
the story written into the contract. (The book, "Our Story" by the
Quecreek miners, as told to Jeff Goodell, was just released.)</TE>
<TE>   Before the deal was made, only a very few national media outlets
got their questions in: One miner appeared on ABC's "Good Morning
America," on July 29; all nine sat for a July 30 talk with NBC's
"Dateline." Miner Blaine Mayhugh appeared on CBS' "Late Show With
David Letterman." People magazine did a news story, but there was no
"Oprah," at least not then.</TE>
<TE>   "When we bought the rights ... we did put a small fence around
them," says Quinn Taylor, ABC's executive overseeing movies. "We
wanted to limit for the immediate future, until we got the right
script and could get going, who they talked to and what they talked
about."</TE>
<TE>   Made-for-TV movies have already been in decline at the networks,
which have greatly cut back on them in favor of more easily promoted
series that also have a better financial afterlife. The problem with
true-story movies in particular, Taylor says, is the proliferation of
prime-time newsmagazines, one or more nearly every night of the week,
and the " 'Extras,' 'ETs,' 'Accesses' and all that. By the time the
movie hits the air, there's nothing new, and why invest millions when
you can't introduce something new?"</TE>
<TE>   Reality: a hot commodity</TE>
<TE>   The isolation strategy worked. "They were pretty virgin," the
movie's writer Elwood Reid says of the miners. When Reid, Sanitsky
and Goodell sat down just weeks later to debrief their subjects, many
were telling intimate details of their 77 hours underground for the
first time. "No one knew what happened down there," says Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Reality, or something that passes for it, is a hot commodity in
today's TV world, as viewers flock to shows about real people
scheming to win millions or a husband or a chance at stardom. But
increasingly, feeding that demand has meant a blurring of the lines
between fiction and non-fiction. "With the entertainment division
doing reality programming, it does start to blur those distinctions
even more," says Sanitsky.</TE>
<TE>   "The appetite for real people and real events has [network
executives] looking to take news and goose it up, to give it some
good narrative structure," says Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse
University's Center for the Study of Popular Television. Conversely,
he says, with viewers used to grazing over to the news channels for
big stories such as the Washington sniper or the miners,
"expectations in entertainment have risen dramatically. I really
believe the reason 'CSI' has so much realistic blood and guts has a
lot to do with CNN. It used to be to make something look gritty and
realistic, all it took was shaking cameras, but now people have seen
so much news coverage, entertainment is responding."</TE>
<TE>   At Disney and ABC, it has sometimes been hard to tell where one
genre stops and another begins. This summer, ABC News developed a
four-part documentary show about life at an Arkansas children's
hospital, but it played second fiddle to a similar six-part series
about life inside a Houston hospital that was developed by ABC's
entertainment division. For fall, ABC News' "20/20" was planning a
guaranteed ratings-grabber program on paralyzed actor Christopher
Reeve regaining movement in his limbs, until the news program was
told to abandon the project because ABC Entertainment was buying a
film on the same subject by Reeve's son, at substantially greater
cost. Even some of the network's programming on the anniversary of
the Sept. 11 terror attacks was produced by the entertainment
division, not ABC News, which has a different set of standards.</TE>
<TE>   The distancing of the real players in the mine story from the news
media didn't start with Disney, however. During the actual event,
reporters were kept at a Giant Eagle supermarket to afford privacy
for family members several miles away in the firehouse. The actual
rescue was televised only because the wives, who were barred from the
site, voted to allow it so they could see their loved ones emerge.</TE>
<TE>   The miners have recently done more interviews, most, like a joint
appearance on "Oprah" on Nov. 12, to promote the movie and book.
Taylor says the miners "were very happy, frankly," to not have to
deal with the overwhelming number of media requests for interviews at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, over a spaghetti lunch at a local cafe, Mayhugh and his
wife, Leslie, recall the crush of calls: local radio talk shows, 10
newsmagazines, book writers, actors, producers. Their caller ID box,
which stores 80 numbers, maxed out numerous times. Relatives came in
to answer the phone. Once, Leslie says, they turned the phone off to
get some relief and when they turned it back on to make a call,
someone was already on the line.</TE>
<TE>   Average people who had watched the rescue on TV called too, many
to talk about faith in God. "They think I'm part of a miracle,"
Blaine Mayhugh says, adding, "You didn't mind talking to people like
that."</TE>
<TE>   Mayhugh jokes about how he wanted Disney to hire wrestling star
the Rock to play him in the movie, but he and his wife are much more
circumspect about the rest of the onslaught of attention. The Disney
clampdown didn't stop other journalists from hounding townspeople.
British journalist Andrew Morton, best known for his celebrity
biography of Princess Diana, pestered Leslie's friends for tidbits
for his own just-published "Nine for Nine: The Pennsylvania Mine
Rescue Miracle," she says. Neighbors gossiped about the $150,000 the
Mayhughs got for the movie. "People inside the community talk about
you," Blaine Mayhugh says. "Nothing for nothing," he repeats several
times, referring to the quid pro quo of celebrity. "It's good, but it
isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Faithful to the true events</TE>
<TE>   ALL reality is colored by an element of perception. After it
bought the rights, Disney brought in several producers to pitch the
job over lunch with the miners; some miners said later that they
chose Sanitsky, a former senior CBS executive and veteran producer
married to a top ICM agent, because of his regular-guy jeans and
T-shirt. "What they don't know is that it was all by Gucci," Taylor
jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, with the miners stressing their desire for the movie
to be accurate, Taylor, Sanitsky and the rest of those involved went
to great pains to reward that essentially blind trust by remaining
faithful to the story.</TE>
<TE>   Most ripped-from-the-headlines TV movies are eventually accused of
bending facts to serve fiction. This time, those involved say, there
was little need because the story was so powerful. "It's a movie
about men confronting death and women confronting loss," says
director David Frankel, who'd previously directed installments of
HBO's "From the Earth to the Moon" and "Band of Brothers," among
others.</TE>
<TE>   Writer Reid, sitting on the set in his favorite oversized
bear-hunting shirt with its spectacular camouflage pattern of leaves
and tree branches, says his job was made easier because the miners,
rehashing the ordeal on nearly 70 hours of tape, "saw life in a story
arc," complete with foreshadowing and parallels and other dramatic
elements viewers expect from entertainment. One wife talked about the
soccer ball that had become impossibly stuck in a culvert before the
accident and its coming free during the ordeal as a sign that the
miners would be saved. The details, he says, "were oddly poetic."</TE>
<TE>   "If you veer from the reality of it, it lessens the movie," says
Sanitsky. And, he adds, the miners and their families have been "so
decent, you really want to get it right." But he adds, "This is still
a movie."</TE>
<TE>   The movie's plot is straightforward, following the nine miners
from the night before the accident through the accident itself and
their ordeal underground, interspersed with reaction of the family
members above as they follow the rescue efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The focus on the nine who were trapped has rankled some. At the
Brandywine Restaurant 15 miles away, a sign out front proclaims "We
remember the Forgotten 9." The rescuers working aboveground "are the
guys that really made it happen," says Chris Barkley, director of the
Windber museum, as he stands watching the late-night shooting scene,
picturesque silos lighted up in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to shoot much of the movie in Somerset came from
wanting to give something back, Taylor says. (The interior of the
flooded mine was re-created on a set in Valencia.) Somerset is just
13 miles from where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in a field as
terrorists tried to use it to attack Washington on Sept. 11, 2001;
the miners' tale, some 10 months later, was a story with an opposite,
happy ending.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor says that, although it may sound pretentious, "These people
never lost faith in each other, in God, in themselves and they
survived, and in that spirit it made sense for Disney, the family
company, to attempt to do right." And, he adds, when the budget for
on-site shooting came in, "Executives could just have easily said,
'Send a bunch of cookies, we're shooting in Toronto.' "</TE>
<TE>   Syracuse University's Thompson thinks more true-story made-for-TV
movies will have to adopt a similar approach of exact re-creation.
Today's viewers have already watched the real version, on CNN, Fox or
MSNBC, "so they know the texture, and the made-for-TV movie has got
to live up to it stylistically. That's a major shift."</TE>
<TE>   "When I watched for the first time, I was overwhelmed with the
authenticity," Taylor says. "Will the average viewer see it? Maybe,"
he says, but more important, "you just get it."</TE>
<TE>   How the miners feel won't be known until they see it; they weren't
scheduled to until this past Friday. In September, Leslie Mayhugh
wasn't sure she would be watching tonight. Reading Goodell's book
made her cry. The event? "It still doesn't seem real."</TE>

<TE>   Drawn to true grit</TE>
<TE>   It's an enduring love affair: movies and TV are fascinated by
miners. The intimate spaces, hard struggles and gritty faces combine
to draw filmmakers of all stripes and approaches.</TE>
<TE>   "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937) Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to
work they go in the mines.</TE>
<TE>   "How Green Was My Valley" (1941) John Ford's best picture Oscar
winner, set in a Welsh coal-mining village, is the template for all
mining movies. Remade as a 1975 TV miniseries.</TE>

1876 Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   "Coal Miner's Daughter" (1980)  Sissy Spacek won an Oscar playing
Loretta Lynn, opposite Levon Helm as her daddy.</TE>
<TE>   "Matewan" (1987) John Sayles took a less pastoral view in this
gritty coal-mining tale set in West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "October Sky" (1999) Jake Gyllenhaal played rocket scientist Homer

<LD>I can understand MGM/UA touting the release of their 20th Bond film

listing only 19 films and joining in this inaccurate enterprise? Your
brief reference to two non-MGM/UA films only served to underscore the
list's incompleteness.</LD>
<LD>   Connery starred in "Never Say Never Again," so how can this movie
be excluded in a story on the actors who played Bond? Even the
farcical "Casino Royale" should have been listed. Let's call the new

<LD>I would like to thank Calendar for coupling Richard Cromelin's
interview of Bright Eyes' Conor Oberst ("The Spotlight Finds a
Searching Soul", Nov. 10) with positive reviews of other recent Omaha
releases. As a label manager and fellow musician, I have firsthand
experience that quite often the level of talent on a roster (or a
release) matters less than the "luck of exposure." Dean Kuipers and
Kevin Bronson's objective critiques shine a light on material
otherwise "underexposed" and show that there is depth to the Omaha
indie scene. It shows that Midwestern rock stars don't need to
abandon their own scenes to "make it" on the coasts.</LD>
<LD>   While the local debate may rage as to whether Oberst is indeed a
genius, what stands out is the leadership he and others (Saddle
Creek's Rob Nansel and Redemption's Ryan Kuper) provide local
aspiring musicians and managers. They have succeeded while staying in
Nebraska, and in turn enhanced the quality of live music in the area.</LD>

<LD>I'm glad someone finally addressed the newest scam theater owners
have been forcing on their patrons: on-screen advertising ("Attack of
the 40-foot ads," Nov. 17). Last week my wife and I went to see the
new Harry Potter movie.</LD>
<LD>   We arrived at the theater 15 minutes early. We were subjected to
the annoying slide show of local merchant ads mixed in with "trivia"
questions. Then the theater delayed dimming the lights at the
appointed show time and we had to sit through another 10 minutes of
the ads.</LD>
<LD>   When the lights finally dimmed, all of us in the theater thought
the upcoming trailers would start then. Wrong! Another 10 minutes of
full-blown 30- and 60-second commercials followed on the giant screen
before the actual trailers began. That's 35 minutes of ads and
commercials we had to sit through in order to have that "special
theater experience".</LD>
<TE>   Next time my wife and I will have that "special theater
experience" in our living room with a DVD player, and we'll be saving
time and money too!</TE>

<LD>Lynn Smith declares "Hollywood has been flirting with different types
of male kisses for more than three decades" ("More than just a kiss,"
Nov. 10). She then describes a kiss between actors Peter Finch and
Murray Head during a scene in the film "Sunday Bloody Sunday." She
then states flatly: "The movie tanked."</LD>
<LD>   I assume she is referring to the fact that the film performed
poorly at the box office here in the U.S., where it was not produced.
For this was not a Hollywood film, as she falsely infers, but a
British film, made in England under a small production company,
Vectia Films Ltd., then released through United Artists in Britain,
where it performed quite well at the box office. It garnered four
Oscar nominations -- including best actress, best actor and best
director -- and won a Golden Globe for best English-language foreign
film.</LD>
<LD>   I do wish that your writers would refrain from using such grossly
misleading revisionist rhetoric, as if box-office receipts here in
the States are the only measure of a film's worth -- particularly
when considering the touchy subject that is male homosexuality in
popular or "mainstream" cinema.</LD>

<LD>Is it conceivable that Jason Alexander could be a mighty benefactor
for established and professional Los Angeles acting coaches who are
dedicated to helping beginning actors to hone their technique and to
sharpen the skills of trained actors ("Professor Alexander," Nov.
17)?</LD>
<LD>   Most acting coaches in Los Angeles do not enjoy a good standard of
living income because it is difficult to compete with the alluring
and splashy ads of pay-to-audition individuals that indisputably lure
actors, many who are naive regarding the ultimate reward.</LD>
<LD>   Recently, Alexander appeared on ABC's "20/20" and said that paying
industry miscreants for a connection results in nothing but "...a
chance in hell of getting a job this way."</LD>
<TE>   One can only hope that state officials will be able to end the
long era of paid auditions.</TE>

<LD>Congratulations on bringing this pro-civil rights, anti-death
penalty, anti-three strikes black liberal to a seething state of
outrage with your feature on incarcerated rap "artist" Anerae
Veshaughn Brown -- a.k.a. X-Raided ("Tied by music and murder," Nov.
17).</LD>
<LD>   A positive story on an established superstar (Debbie Allen)
working to give back to the community by improving children's lives
through dance doesn't make the cover of the Calendar section, but you
have time and space to devote 90 column inches to promoting the
career and inane ravings of some two-bit homicidal, remorseless thug.</LD>
<LD>   Because of this individual (I cannot bring myself to refer to him
as a brother or a man), Patricia Harris -- a sister, wife, mother and
grandmother -- lost her life to senseless gangland violence. Before I
cancel my subscription I'd like to see The Times print two more
stories on Anerae Veshaughn Brown:</LD>
<TE>   A feature on his transfer to Pelican Bay (where he can't make any
more "music").</TE>

<KH>BRIEF ENCOUNTER</KH>
<HD>Rx for morality</HD>
<DH>It's OK for author Ethan Canin to prescribe ethical
behavior. He's a doctor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Dutka</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ethan Canin is a physician-turned-writer whose award-winning fiction
focuses on the personal: characters forced to confront themselves as
they make moral choices under duress. That theme is strong in "The
Emperor's Club," a new movie based on the title novella in his story
collection "The Palace Thief," in which a classics professor tangles
with an unscrupulous, overprivileged student.</LD>
<LD>   You wrote "The Palace Thief" eight years ago, but the ethical
questions -- issues of lying, cheating, backbiting -- seem
particularly apt today. Not just on the political front, your initial
thrust, but on Wall Street as well.</LD>
<LD>   True. This is a movie about integrity -- not just honesty but
being true to yourself. Once you start lying you can't stop and, at
the top, they lie all the time. You don't have to be a close reader
of the paper to realize that we have a major problem. Companies such
as Enron, Tyco, Merrill Lynch -- I could name 10 more -- are so
immersed in ambition that they're searching for the unattainable. An
executive is unhappy earning, say, $120 million because the guy at
AT&amp;T makes $140 million. Money and power are like cocaine -- you can
never have enough.</LD>
<TE>   Your character Prof. Hundert says his classroom is a "tribute to
the lofty ideals of man." Are you, like he, one of the dwindling
number of idealists?</TE>
<TE>   I'm a Jew -- and, since we endured such a calamitous event 60
years ago, it's hard to think idealistic thoughts. The world, in the
end, is a mean place, and I'm less morally sure than Hundert. Like
him, however, I'm unable to be a judge or a cop. As a doctor, I
didn't turn in people wanted by the police. Nor could I hand out a
speeding ticket. Fortunately, there are people who can, or it would
be chaos out there.</TE>
<TE>   Corruption, you maintain, is inherent in any elite -- including
the medical world.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard Medical School is the pinnacle of medical education, full
of people so taken with the trappings of prestige and power that they
do what it takes to get in -- and stay in. My class was rife with
secret despair. If you're happy with yourself, you don't have to be
head of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Still, I do renew
my license each year. Writing and medicine tap different parts of me
-- the dreamy and the analytical.</TE>
<TE>   Was leaving medicine a moral test, of sorts?</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the most stable profession for the least stable was a huge
risk, but I knew my writing career would be over if I stayed. My
ambition was to move people, to finish a book, and I wouldn't do that
unless I needed money. I still don't have the confidence that I can
make a living writing fiction. Depression, not overconfidence, is my
problem. As it says in the film, "the end depends upon the
beginning." You can learn how to head off problematic areas of
character, but people, essentially, don't change.</TE>
<TE>   You once said that there's a bit of evil in every man. Still think
so?</TE>
<TE>   I don't know what "evil" means. The term is too simplistic. As
[President] Bush defines it, it's "someone else's self-interest
instead of our own." That said, I'm an animal like anyone else. And,
as Goethe said, "I've never heard of a crime I couldn't imagine
committing myself."</TE>

<HD>A writer at life's banquet</HD>
<DH>Novelist and essayist Jim Harrison expresses his appetite
for existence in a love of food, an admiration of women and, now, a
memoir.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Salter Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Seattle</DL>
<LD>"Here's the thing about France," Jim Harrison says. "I'm in Paris and
I go to visit the graves of Sartre and De Beauvoir. I sit down on a
bench and who is sitting next to me but the old man who buried them.
We go off and share a bottle of wine."</LD>
<LD>   Harrison knows of at least 25 young women in France, where his
books sell even better than they do in the U.S. or any of the other
23 countries that love his work, who are named Dalva, after his most
famous character in the novel of the same name. "I go over there,
they sit in my lap and have their pictures taken."</LD>
<LD>   No doubt followed by foie gras and a 1961 Margaux.</LD>
<TE>   Because, for Harrison, memories and food are so intertwined as to
be one. Which is why his new book, "Off to the Side," is part memoir
and part menu from a 64-year-old writer who is part man and part
beast. Well, beast might not be right (although more than one
feminist has used the word to describe him). Certainly creature;
bear, quail, ox, octopus, pig ... cooked, raw, he's eaten them all.
Every time he eats bear, he says, he dreams about one. This has
caused him to cut back on bear meat, for he is also -- though he
might not admit it in public -- a deeply spiritual, reverent and
grateful man.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 22 hours here in Harrison's presence, 17 were spent eating
and talking; one regrets needing to take five hours for sleep, for
surely one has missed something. Known for his legendary vitality and
appetite, Harrison has written 11 novels, nine books of poetry, two
collections of essays, one children's book and more screenplays than
he cares to remember. His book of essays on food, "The Raw and the
Cooked: Adventures of a Roving Gourmand" (2001), has just been
reissued in paperback. He's working on a novel that begins on
Michigan's Upper Peninsula -- where he grew up and returns frequently
to regain his sanity -- and ends in Veracruz, Mexico, a story that
"combines greed, sex and religion in a tight little knot."</TE>
<TE>   The child of two Swedes, Harrison is ruddy and wild-eyed, courtesy
of a little girl who stuck a broken bottle in his left eye and
blinded it when he was 7. He is round and he has gout. When he
reaches any kind of mental impasse, he rubs his head vigorously,
leaving his hair standing up at all angles. Women, all ages, shapes
and sizes, are drawn to him as if he could cure them and all the men
in the world of lifelessness and cruelty.</TE>
<TE>   When he talks to a woman, he often idly rubs his fingers across
her hands, or puts an arm around her or touches her cheek. Rumor has
it that he once thanked a woman in a restaurant for her beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Lewis, Harrison's friend of 25 years and the owner of one of
Seattle's most elegant and friendly four-star restaurants, Campagna,
says that for Harrison, "it's all an adventure in consciousness."
This adventure has, at times, been a frightening journey for the
writer, who tells of a lifetime battling an irrepressible depression
that can only be beaten back by time spent incommunicado in the wild.
Sometimes, even that doesn't work.</TE>
<TE>   When he was 22 his beloved father, who was 53, and sister Judith,
who was 19, were killed by a drunk driver in a head-on collision,
leaving Jim, his older brother, John, his mother, little brother
David, who was 11, and sister Mary, who was 12. "We never missed
kissing each other good night," Harrison writes, "and now two of us
were forever missing." David, Jim says, did not speak for a year.
Jim, says David, was also forever altered.</TE>
<TE>   David and his wife, Cindy, and a nephew have come over from
Bainbridge Island to attend Harrison's reading at Elliott Bay
Bookstore. David looks a lot like his brother but softer and less
dark. Harrison writes in the memoir that David was reading at a
graduate school level by the time he was in kindergarten. David is
equally proud of Jim -- he shows off a photo of the writer at 18 and
says, "he was the one who was going to do it, he was going to be a
writer. Bighearted man," he says, and kicks at the floor.</TE>
<TE>   About 300 people are crammed into the store to hear Harrison read.
The writer knows a lot of people in the crowd and almost all of them
stand in line for well over an hour to say hello and have him sign
their copies of the memoir. Rick Simonson, the manager for 25 years
and architect of a reading series that features one, sometimes two,
authors a day, briefly introduces Harrison, who has promised not to
read for more than 22 minutes, after which, he feels, most readings
lose their edge.</TE>
<TE>   'An excess of life'</TE>
<TE>   Harrison started with poetry, "felt cramped," and moved into
fiction. "I'm not a kiss-and-tell sort of person," Harrison tells a
guest, by way of explaining the memoir, which covers his childhood,
his life as a starving writer, shared with wife Linda, whom he has
been married to now for 40 years ("I fell in love with her when I was
14 and I saw her walking up some steps in riding pants"), and their
two daughters, Jamie and Anna, and his life in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've known a lot of actresses and models," he says to
several male heads nodding in gray-bearded agreement, "you return to
waitresses because at least they smell like food." Harrison has a way
of neutralizing feminist impulses with his sheer, outrageous love for
womankind. Just when you think you've got him for his love of
strippers, he will describe one of them like he's painting a
landscape. It's unsettling.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison spent 20 years in Hollywood, he says, because it was
either that or teach, "and I am temperamentally unsuited for teaching
in a really big way." While "Dalva" and his "Legends of the Fall"
were made into movies Harrison likes, his tenure in Hollywood ended
when Mike Nichols directed the film based on his novel "Wolf." "I
wanted Dionysian, but he wanted Apollonian. He took my wolf and made
it into a Chihuahua. I cracked up for 10 minutes and then went out
into the country and stood in front of a wolf den and apologized
while my dog hid under the truck." That was eight years ago and he
hasn't gone back.</TE>
<TE>   And though he loves New York, the city he has visited and lived in
since he was an art-struck 19-year-old, its literary society doesn't
thrill him much more than Hollywood. "They argue about who's better,
John Updike or Phillip Roth and, meanwhile, Gabriel Garcia Marquez
looms quietly over them all."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry," the author says, as his party heads for its third
meal in 10 hours. "You don't need an appetite to eat." So far, he has
eaten pork cheek ravioli, fingerling potatoes stuffed with giblets
and innards, frog legs, quail hearts and fava beans with a Chateau du
Trignon Rasteau at Campagna. Next up is Salumi, a small, casual
restaurant with a large table in the back that serves lunch four days
a week and dinner once a week. Dinner reservations must be made three
years in advance.</TE>
<TE>   The talk turns seriously and not so seriously to food: Harrison's
recipe for two-skinned pheasant (wrapped in prosciutto); that dinner
with writer Bill Buford when Buford made prime rib from Kobe beef
with truffles; wild turkeys raised in Michigan and their superiority
to those raised in Florida (more variety in the diet); the pigs' feet
stuffed with sweetbreads and the salad of lamb tongue that Harrison
cooked in 1995; the 19-course meal Mario Batali cooked in Boston (the
best Harrison's ever had); the 7-pound suckling pig at a restaurant
in France; legendary bottles of Barolo the size of 6-year-olds that
are all remembered fondly, like love affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Restaurateur Armandino Batali (Mario's father) brings out a plate
of the sausage and prosciutto he is famous for, spiced with fennel
and cumin or mace and garlic, side by side with slender strips of
tongue. Regulars come and go. "It's the closest thing to Italy," one
customer says, kissing Batali. The four-hour meal, a piker for these
guys, has a sweet rhythm. One is allowed to rest quietly and wait for
strength to return or to walk around the block in the fall air while
Batali brings plate after plate, and a pasta with black truffle,
which is shaved generously and passed around, trailing a forest smell
from nose to nose, fondled and patted and shaved again.</TE>
<TE>   Harrison is moved to remember his first girlfriend, an insensitive
cheerleader who told him not "to write below the lines," when he went
for her skirt. "Some people have an excess of life," he says and
shrugs. "That time I was in prison in Duluth...." But the talk never
strays far from food. Over grilled lamb sausage and Cote Chino and
pork meatballs flavored with nutmeg, Harrison tries to explain his
40-year marriage. "How do I know she likes me?" writer Peter
Matthiessen once asked Harrison about his own wife. "You never will,"
Harrison replied.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the couple's success has something to do with the fact
that they eat pasta three times a week. Or with what sister-in-law
Cindy Harrison says is Linda's "ability to live her own life." "I get
the blues on book tours," Harrison says, "because I miss my family
and my dogs and my grandchildren." To conquer the blues while
traveling, Harrison reads Chinese poetry. When he is home, in
southern Arizona or Michigan, he walks for hours.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago an article Harrison was writing about a
19-year-old girl who died of thirst while crossing the border from
Mexico sent him into a bad depression. "I had confused her in my mind
with my sister Judith, who was also 19 when she died. I was trying,
again, to save my sister. And you can't, you just can't." Harrison
knew when he lost his sister and father that he had to be an artist.
"If people you love are going to be taken from you, why compromise?"</TE>
<TE>   Batali brings lardo, the fat cut from a pig's shoulder, on toast,
with a dish of Napa cabbage. Then comes the vin santo with once-baked
biscotti, eaten dipped and dripping.</TE>
<TE>   "To kindness," Harrison says raising a glass, "a simple thing my
mother taught me." He offers an old Navajo trick he uses to begin a
new day without "jumping into hell."</TE>
<TE>   "Bow to the six directions -- north, south, east, west, to the
earth and to the sky. Then locate yourself on Earth." He raises his
glass again, and puts one arm around Michelle, the waitress, and one
on his friend Lewis' shoulder, locating himself: at the head of the
table, full of sweet and short-lived happiness and well-being.</TE>

<DL>Orlando, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Lightning crackled in the night sky, West Nile virus-infected
mosquitoes buzzed in the distance, and a woman with a camel puppet
roamed the hotel lobby. It was the eve of the Famous Poets Society
convention, and things were just starting to get weird.</LD>
<LD>   I would soon learn that poetry, once the noblest of human
endeavors, had become a cutthroat enterprise, replete with poetry
spies, IRS investigations and a once-bankrupt Shakespeare scholar.</LD>
<LD>   A few months earlier, I had entered one of those "free poetry
contests" advertised in newspapers and on the Internet. I wrote the
lamest poem I could think of and sent it in:</LD>
<TE>   "Jumping Through Hula-Hoops for a Rhyme"</TE>
<TE>   Many things rhyme with hula</TE>
<TE>   Including the Greek food tabbouleh</TE>
<TE>   And ex-Miami Dolphin coach Don Shula</TE>
<TE>   Who used to earn plenty of moolah.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a sheik named Abdullah</TE>
<TE>   Who never sang be-bop-a-lula,</TE>
<TE>   And a brain part known as the medulla</TE>
<TE>   And the Montana town of Missoula.</TE>
<TE>   Could any word be any cooler?</TE>
<TE>   In June, a letter arrived from the Famous Poets Society,
inviting me to the group's eighth annual convention, in Orlando. "You
enrich our world with every poem you write," it cooed. "To honor you for
your influence as a poet, our Executive Committee has elected to
present you with the Roy Rivenburg 2002 Poet of the Year Medallion.
Your medallion -- suspended from a stylized red, white and blue
ribbon, like an Olympic medal -- will be exclusively handcrafted for
this occasion only."</TE>
<TE>   I had also been handpicked to receive the Shakespeare Trophy of
Excellence, said the letter, and Bay Area poet Mary Rudge had
"personally" asked that I walk with her in a Famous Poets Parade led
by Grand Marshal Mickey Mouse. "She invites you to bring a poem of
peace to release 'on the wings of Pegasus' during our Famous Poets
for Peace Balloonathon." Hundreds of balloons -- with poems attached
-- would be turned loose simultaneously, creating "a rainbow of
poetry in the sky."</TE>
<TE>   The cost was $495 (not including airfare and hotel), but that
would be pocket change compared with the $25,000 I was sure to win in
the writing contest. As the letter from Famous Poets executive
director Mark Schramm noted: "I also look forward to seeing you win
our poetry contest! ... I can already hear the crowd cheering as the
laureate crown is placed on your head! How beautiful you look!"</TE>
<TE>   Another letter said my verse would be included in an anthology
("truly a milestone in publishing history"), which I could purchase
for a "special pre-publication discount" of $39.95, plus additional
fees to add a biography, photo or dedication.</TE>
<TE>   I ordered a copy and booked a flight to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes, and some sad reality</TE>
<TE>   Stepping out of the airport into Orlando's suffocating humidity, I
boarded a jampacked shuttle to the convention hotel. As we drove off,
a blond in the front row piped up: "Are y'all going to the poetry
convention?" Nearly every hand in the van shot up.</TE>
<TE>   The girl was Tasha Clark, a cheerful 16-year-old from Tecumseh,
Okla. That night, she and her grandmother joined me for dinner, where
Tasha asked if she could read my poem.</TE>
<TE>   "Um, it's not very good," I protested. "I only entered the contest
as a lark."</TE>
<TE>   Her response was heartbreaking: "Well, it must be good or they
wouldn't have invited you here."</TE>
<TE>   What Tasha and most of the other poets I met didn't know is that
the Famous Poets Society is a vanity publisher that heaps praise on
even the worst poems to sell anthologies and convention tickets. The
letter about the coveted Shakespeare trophy and poet-of-the-year
medallion went to roughly 20,000 people, 500 of whom made the trek to
Florida, according to figures supplied by Schramm.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the poets, thinking this was a once-in-a-lifetime honor,
paid for the trip with help from church groups, city councils or
Rotary Club chapters. Amy Kelpine, 17, of Georgia, whose mother
recently died from a brain tumor, said her dad footed the bill using
the last of her mom's life insurance payout.</TE>
<TE>   Some big guns in poetry circles defend these conventions. Robert
Pinsky, a former U.S. poet laureate, said for-profit poetry
businesses are just as vital to the evolution of poetry as college
English classes, bohemia and literary fellowships. "These different
kinds of institutions, all imperfect in their various ways, may
correct and counterbalance the defects of the others," he said. "It
would be regrettable if poetry in our country became a guild, based
on the credentials of a creative writing program."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, has Pinsky ever met Famous Poets Society impresario
John T. Campbell?</TE>
<TE>   Part Shakespeare scholar, part businessman, Campbell, 61, is the
father of amateur poetry contests. The son of a railroad welder, his
passion for the written word began as a youth in Ashland, Ore.,
watching countless rehearsals for the town's famous Shakespeare
festival. By his late teens, he said, he was so familiar with the
Bard's plays that the actors sometimes flubbed their lines on purpose
to see if he could fill in the gaps. He even made sure his first wife
was named Anne, just like Shakespeare's spouse.</TE>
<TE>   As an adult, he translated that devotion to the Bard into a series
of poetry companies that have recruited customers via ads in
publications ranging from the New Yorker to the National Enquirer to
teen magazines. (Famous Poets Society also sends contest notices to
hundreds of newspapers, often using different names and addresses
that feed back to one source.) Although competitors have imitated his
formula, Campbell said, their efforts are hollow: "They're in it just
for the money."</TE>
<TE>   But critics say Campbell's motives are equally suspect. Since the
mid-1960s, when he moved to Sacramento and launched a
pay-to-have-your-poem-published newsletter called the Promethean
Lamp, he's been investigated by the IRS, the Justice Department and
the Sacramento County district attorney's office, among others.</TE>
<TE>   The slings and arrows intensified in the early 1990s. At that time
he owned a company called World of Poetry, which had started on a
$1,000 budget and exploded into a flashy vanity publishing empire
that held celebrity-studded conventions attended by thousands.
Campbell lived in a turreted estate known as the Castle, complete
with secret passageways and a lavish library collection that included
rare Shakespeare volumes and a book about the Doors autographed by
Jim Morrison.</TE>
<TE>   As he prepared for his 1992 convention in San Francisco, the IRS
swooped in, saying he owed nearly $600,000 in back taxes. Campbell
declared bankruptcy, and a federal court took control of World of
Poetry. In an e-mail, Famous Poets director Schramm blamed an
accountant for Campbell's tax woes and said he was railroaded by
overzealous government "thugs" and smeared by "the collusive press,"
which included a Sacramento Business Journal article that depicted
Campbell driving around in a limo with a gun and 200 hollow-point
bullets.</TE>
<TE>   In early 1993, World of Poetry's assets went on the auction block.
The crown jewel was the company's mailing list, with 1.5 million
names. It was sold for $180,000 to the rival International Society of
Poets in Owings Mills, Md. The tightly guarded list later
mysteriously fell into the hands of two other poetry companies and
became the basis for an episode of "L.A. Law."</TE>
<TE>   Possession of the list catapulted the Maryland company to the top
of the amateur poetry heap, a position it has aggressively defended
by suing imitators and, by its own account, sending spies to research
competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Sacramento County district attorney's consumer
fraud unit, responding to complaints from World of Poetry customers,
sued Campbell for deceptive advertising. The outcome was an August
1993 court injunction barring him and any business he is associated
with from certain unfair business practices within California,
including coaxing people to sign up for conventions by implying they
are one of the only poets receiving a trophy.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Justin Puerta, who won the injunction, said
Famous Poets Society, which is headquartered in Talent, Ore., is
probably breaking the court order because of its association with
Campbell. But Puerta said it's unlikely a case will be pursued
because both Campbell and Famous Poets are out of state and the
D.A.'s funds are limited.</TE>
<TE>   When Famous Poets was set up in 1994, Campbell's role was obscured
to shield him from more run-ins with the government, Campbell said.
In Orlando, his name was never publicly uttered, and he isn't
mentioned in any company literature.</TE>
<TE>   When I met him, he initially talked freely about his role as
"artistic director" with Famous Poets, but when I later tried to ask
about the court injunction, company officials said he was unavailable
for comment. And Schramm insisted Campbell didn't even work for the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Goofy goings-on</TE>
<TE>   In Orlando, the poets were blissfully unaware of all this. On
Saturday afternoon, the convention kicked off with a champagne
reception. The poets were herded into a cramped lobby to graze on
pretzels and pose for photos with Goofy, who was on loan from nearby
Disney World.</TE>
<TE>   The next stop was a hotel ballroom to watch a one-man play about
Ogden Nash, a mass-market humorist whose silly rhymes defied elitist
notions of poetic form. When it ended, a flurry of camera flashes and
applause filled the hall.</TE>
<TE>   During a break, Marvel Johnson, a friendly 47-year-old artist and
actor who traveled from Oklahoma by bus, told me he assumed he was
the sole recipient of the Shakespeare trophy and poet-of-the-year
medallion. He even hoped to parlay the honors into an appearance on
"Oprah" to promote his art. "When I show her these awards, maybe
it'll help inch me closer," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Up on stage, little-known actor Al D'Andrea grabbed the microphone
to explain the judging process for the $25,000 poetry contest. After
dinner, everyone would break into groups of about 50 and read their
poems aloud. At the end of the night, we would each vote for our
three favorites. "That will be the popular vote, which the judges
will take into account," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Well, not quite. Head judge Rudge, a published poet whose work
espouses humanitarian ideals, later told me that the popular vote was
largely ignored by the judges. The deciding factor is what's on the
page, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, many of the workshops were geared toward prepping us
for reading our verse aloud. D'Andrea's method was to have all 500
poets (plus their several hundred guests) stand up and recite
something, anything, simultaneously. When the unintelligible
cacophony subsided, he said his ears had detected "a lot of
incredible energy and bubbling thought." He urged us to "live in and
through" our poems when we read them aloud. "Be there for the poem."</TE>
<TE>   Next came the presentation of Shakespeare trophies and medallions.
One by one, we trudged up to collect our "no other quite like it"
trinkets. The oddest thing about the medallion is that it actually
says "medallion" on the medallion, apparently so it won't be mistaken
for a waffle iron or new car.</TE>
<TE>   After that, with the poets divided into 10 "home rooms," each of
us got called up to do our reading. Despite a 21-line maximum, it
took hours. But the scariest part was that my poem, bad as it was,
seemed better than most of the competition.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, what do I know? In 1962, William Carlos Williams
raided the fridge one night and jotted a note to his wife that became
the well-regarded poem "This Is Just to Say":</TE>
<TE>   I have eaten</TE>
<TE>   the plums</TE>
<TE>   that were in</TE>
<TE>   the ice box</TE>
<TE>   and which</TE>
<TE>   you were probably</TE>
<TE>   saving</TE>
<TE>   for breakfast</TE>
<TE>   Forgive me</TE>
<TE>   they were delicious</TE>
<TE>   so sweet</TE>
<TE>   and so cold</TE>
<TE>   Is it poetry? Not to my tin ears, but college professors
vociferously defend it. Was I underestimating the talent of the
Orlando poets, including the guy who pronounced his name "Anonymous"
but spelled it "Anomines"?</TE>
<TE>   Rudge acknowledged after the convention that some of the Orlando
poets were "struggling with the language." But she added: "I'm not
judgmental of anyone who wants to be a poet because I've been there.
My first poem was very sing-songy and trite. Some poets haven't found
themselves yet, but that doesn't mean you should tell them their work
is bad."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the verse at the convention did contain flashes of
brilliance. Lakeesha Nicole Sheares' "Ego Tripping" was told through
the eyes of a narcissist who thought "lightning [is] God taking
pictures of me."</TE>
<TE>   Rudge compared amateur poetry to folk art. Average people feel an
incredible need to express themselves in verse, she said, and
companies like Famous Poets Society, despite their shortcomings,
offer the only outlet.</TE>
<TE>   Contacted later, Marvin Bell, the poet laureate of
Iowa, countered: "The issue isn't the quality of poetry or the
genuineness of the people writing the poems. The issue is the intentions
of those who run these businesses.... The problem with these things is
it's not illegal but it's unconscionable. There's no defense for taking
money from people in this way." Famous Poets officials insist they're
squeaky-clean. "I have run everything we send by a lawyer, and it is
on the up and up," Schramm said.</TE>
<TE>   Although several of the poets I spoke with used words like
"misleading" and "false advertising" to describe the invitation to
the convention, they still felt the event was worthwhile. Many
enjoyed the camaraderie. Tasha, the Oklahoma teen, commented: "I
learned how to be a better public speaker and I also heard other
people's poetry and how writing affected their lives."</TE>
<TE>   It was a common refrain. Schramm said one of every five poets in
Orlando was a repeat customer.</TE>
<TE>   Workshops and a banquet</TE>
<TE>   Sunday was a blur of workshops leading to the much-ballyhooed
William Shakespeare Banquet. The invitation had promised an evening
"so opulent you'll want to dress up," and many of the poets did. They
came in tuxedos and sequined gowns, African robes and Elizabethan
costumes, cowboy boots and high heels.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the darkened auditorium, a red and gold crown glowed
onstage under a beam of light. A royal red robe with leopard-print
trim was draped nearby, waiting for the coronation of this year's
contest winner.</TE>
<TE>   At my table, the ages ranged from 16 to 88. "This is the best
experience of my life," said 50-year-old Donna Faye Eager-Stoneking
of Colorado. "It was my destiny to come here."</TE>
<TE>   Another tablemate, Carmen Rivera of Delaware, who was escorting
her 17-year-old poet daughter, Meshal, said she was suspicious before
coming. Whenever she had called for information, "The person in
charge was never there. I didn't know if it was a scam or if there'd
even be anything here when we got to Florida." But now she was
pleased: "I think it's good for people who write because it gives
them a place to come and meet."</TE>
<TE>   Also on the bill for Sunday evening was "critically acclaimed
entertainment ... produced by National Celebrities." Translation:
Campbell appeared onstage in a flowing black robe and puffy hat to
recite Shakespeare for 45 minutes while an electronic keyboard purred
in the background.</TE>
<TE>   And the winner is ...</TE>
<TE>   On the convention's final day, Rudge took to the pulpit
brandishing newspaper headlines about baseball. "Poetry deserves all
the cheers that sports get," she said. "This convention is, as far as
we know, the Olympics of poetry.... Consider yourselves as the
bringers of a new poetry to society."</TE>
<TE>   When she finished, a Dixieland band marched in to lead us outside
for the Parade of Peace and Balloonathon. Grand marshal Mickey Mouse
was a no-show, so Rudge took us on a loop around the parking lot. We
tied our poems of peace to red, white or blue helium-filled balloons
and released them into the sky.</TE>
<TE>   After basting in the tropical heat, we shuffled back indoors for
the awards ceremony, which started with "20 cash door prizes worth
$500 each." The cash turned out to be a $5 bill; the remaining $495
came in the form of a certificate for admission to next year's
convention.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it was time to announce the poetry contest winners. The
robe and crown were whisked in. Then 17 third-place victors were
summoned to read their poems and receive $1,000 checks. The poets at
my table liked one about a drunk father beating and killing his
daughter. And a British woman's lighthearted verse ("When
entertaining kin, I always need a double gin") got a standing ovation
from many in the hall. Another popular entry was "A Cowboy's Prayer"
("Lord, thank you for the stars across the sky tonight"), a simple
petition to God read by a guy in cowboy hat, boots and T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   The first Sept. 11-related winner was a 13-year-old boy from
Pennsylvania: "My heart is full of hatred and sorrow / I don't know
what will happen tomorrow / I live in a house like most people do /
and do my best for the red, white and blue."</TE>
<TE>   Mickey Mouse finally made his entrance in time for the big prizes.
The $3,000 winner was a 9/11 tribute titled "Going Up When Everyone
Else Was Coming Down," about New York firefighters. The $5,000 prize
fell to a poem about the joy of feeling alive ("Sweet God can you
taste this air? Ambrosia on the tip of a trained soul free at last").</TE>
<TE>   Drum roll, please.</TE>
<TE>   The $25,000 check went to a college biology instructor from
Palatine, Ill., for a poem about drinking coffee. After she was
crowned and swathed in the royal robe (both of which were retrieved
by Famous Poets employees after the show), she read her poem to
enthusiastic applause.</TE>
<TE>   Except at my table, where the troops were incredulous. "That is
scandalous," snorted a 29-year-old Texan. The poem wasn't my cup of
tea either, but now that I know what the judges are looking for, I've
got an idea for my next entry:</TE>
<TE>   Many things rhyme with coffee</TE>
<TE>   Including a hot dog company called Hoffy....</TE>

<LD>It was a feast fit for Huck Finn: Finger-lickin' chicken, grits,
cornbread and pecan squares were on the menu at the cast party
celebrating Deaf West Theatre's production of "Big River" at the Mark
Taper Forum. And there was toe-tappin' too, with a fiddler setting
the upbeat tone for guests including stars Scott Waara (Mark Twain)
and Tyrone Giordano (Huck Finn), and Deaf West artistic director Ed
Waterstreet.</LD>
<LD>   The musical, adapted from Mark Twain's "The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn," blends music, voice, dance and sign language. It
marks the first time a local production has been brought to the
Taper. Theater artistic director Gordon Davidson fell in love with
the show when he saw it last year at Deaf West's 85-seat facility in
the NoHo Arts District of North Hollywood. "It's a kind of miracle of
two languages and two cultures coming together," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Waterstreet, who is deaf and founded Deaf West because of his
inability to enjoy theater as a child, said he was so excited about
the production that he hadn't been able to sleep. "Every year we've
dreamed of stepping out from our small theater and getting exposure
with larger audiences," he said through interpreter Bill O'Brien, the
company's producing director. During the hoedown, Waterstreet
presented Davidson with a souvenir jacket, the lining of which was
embroidered with the names of each member of the cast and crew.
Thrilled, Davidson promptly turned the jacket inside out and modeled
it for the crowd. "When Gordon wears this jacket, he can feel the
hugs from everybody in 'Big River,' " Waterstreet said.</TE>
<TE>   Also partying on Nov. 14 in the Salvatori Room at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion were Mary Miller, widow of Roger Miller, who wrote
the show's music and lyrics; William Hauptman, author of the book for
the musical; Rocco Landesman, who produced the musical on Broadway in
1985, where it won seven Tony Awards; and Jeff Calhoun, director and
choreographer of the production at the Taper. "With half the cast
being deaf, you throw your directing skills out the door --
everything you've learned doesn't apply," Calhoun said. "Like a scene
with a coffee cup -- you can't have an actor hold the cup, because he
has to sign. Or when a doorbell rings and somebody needs to answer
the door and can't sign because they have their back to the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "I've learned that there is no difference between the deaf and the
hearing -- only that hearing people seem to be afraid of the
unknown," Calhoun said.</TE>

<LD>Damone Roberts calls it a five-minute facial -- and therein, he says,
is the eyebrow-raising reason why so many male agents, screenwriters
and producers-on-the-go are getting their brows plucked. Well, that,
and vanity.</LD>
<LD>   Roberts earned a reputation as a brow guru at L.A.'s Sager French
Salon, and he'll open his eponymous Beverly Hills eyebrow-grooming
salon next month. There, eyebrow tweezing will be the only service.
Men are 40% of his clientele, and he'll turn the place over to them
at least twice a month for a champagne-and-tweezers night.</LD>
<LD>   Who's he giving the eyebrow? Pro football players and "tons of
male agents" from CAA and William Morris, among others.</LD>
<TE>   Tweezing is also on the menu for men at the new Kinara spa in West
Hollywood and at Bobbe Joy Make-Up Studio in Beverly Hills, where
owner Bobbe Joy Dawson mans the tweezers. Most of her male clients
are Hollywood industry types who come in for a plucking and stick
around to learn to tint the gray hairs in their brows. Is there much
squirming? "Men have less tolerance for pain than women," she says.
"They're in here holding onto the seats as if they were on a roller
coaster."</TE>
<TE>   But discomfort's no deterrent in the battle of the unibrow. "This
is L.A.," Dawson says. "Men aren't that shy about stuff like this."</TE>

<LD>"Lots of people talking about the coming war,</LD>
<LD>   Some of them rich and some of them poor.</LD>
<LD>   Talk about it like a blackjack game,</LD>
<TE>   But win or lose you can't play again."</TE>
<TE>   -- Mark Spoelstra, "The Times I've Had"</TE>
<TE>   You are reading a piece I never wanted to write. A piece whose
idea has so unnerved me that I've put it off even though I've been
compulsively making notes for weeks. A piece about movies and the
American mind, about the inevitability of the coming war and its
potentially cataclysmic aftermath. For my fear is we are floating
toward terribly dangerous waters and that the movies have a share of
the blame.</TE>
<TE>   What initially captured my attention was not so much the pros and
cons of an Iraqi invasion but how unconcerned, how blase most
Americans seem to be about that impending event. "As things stand,"
wrote a concerned commentator, "if the president goes to war, then he
is likely to go without eliciting either the consent or the dissent,
the support or the opposition, of the storied American majority, more
silent today than ever before."</TE>
<TE>   As many political writers have noted, Americans are treating the
invasion of Iraq as what one columnist characterized as "a walk in
the park," an attitude our legislators seem to share. This despite
the fact that there does seem to be a whole lot to be worried about.</TE>
<TE>   News reports indicate that even our friends in the Middle East
fear an attack would bring chaos to the area, encouraging future
generations of terrorists and possibly destabilizing Pakistan and
allowing its nuclear weapons to fall into Al Qaeda's hands.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the war in Iraq goes well, John W. Dower, the leading
authority on our post-World War II occupation of Japan, cautions that
most of the factors that led to success there "would be absent in an
Iraq militarily defeated by the United States.... To rush to war
without seriously imagining all its consequences, including its
aftermath, is not realism but a terrible hubris."</TE>
<TE>   Where did our cockiness, our breezy confidence in the face of all
this come from? Why are we treating going into Iraq as an adventure
similar to what historian Byron Farwell has called "Queen Victoria's
Little Wars," small skirmishes in obscure locales considered at the
time as "the price of empire, of world leadership, and of national
pride -- and it was paid, usually without qualms or regrets or very
much thought."</TE>
<TE>   The source of our unworried attitude, our sureness that Iraq will
be no more than a blip on our glorious march toward the future, is, I
very much fear, that we have been brainwashed by history and, more to
the point, by the movies into thinking we cannot lose.</TE>
<TE>   We are the Americans, the good guys, and the good guys by
definition cannot be defeated. An entire century of westerns, crime
dramas and, of course, war movies has driven home that point so many
times that instead of viewing it as an assumption, we now accept it,
without thinking, as undeniable truth.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, given the enormous superiority with which we will go
into Iraq, the Hollywood solider is always the underdog. "Sergeant
York" single-handedly rounding up more than 100 Germans, or the
Marine raiders in 1943's "Gung Ho!," told by their commander, the
American Film Institute Catalog summarizes, that "though they will be
severely outnumbered by the enemy, through careful planning, teamwork
and surprise, they will be victorious."</TE>
<TE>   Of course we know, or we think we know, that there will be a cost
for our ascendancy. As George C. Scott's Gen. Buck Turgidson
memorably says when discussing nuclear disaster in "Dr. Strangelove,"
"Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed." Even
John Wayne may have to die, as he did at the end of "Sands of Iwo
Jima," but not before the American way has been preserved.</TE>
<TE>   Our troops might be unconventional and avaricious, as in "Three
Kings," but they still are part of a victorious army. Even a
nominally pessimistic film like "Apocalypse Now" ends with Kurtz, the
major threat, eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   This is especially true in the current spate of films (and books)
about the undeniable heroism of the combat soldiers of World War II.
Though the opening section of "Saving Private Ryan" was as savage a
depiction of the pitiless nature of combat as has ever been put on
film, the picture finally delivered quite a different, more uplifting
message about the virtues of heroism. And the fuss over the
Emmy-winning "Band of Brothers," complete with deserved bows by the
real veterans, also feeds the notion that our triumph in wars is
preordained.</TE>
<TE>   Eternal prominence or pipe dream?</TE>
<TE>   In truth, this inevitable American hegemony is written nowhere but
the movies. As Oscar Wilde memorably put it, "The good ended happily,
and the bad unhappily. That is what Fiction means." Other
globe-straddling cultures, from the Romans to the British to the
Arabs who once upon a time conquered Europe as far as Spain, had
similar illusions of eternal domination, but it was not to be.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Nazis, as recorded in the films made for domestic
consumption during World War II, felt themselves to be just as much
the invincible favorites of fortune as we do. While films like "Jud
Suss" were notoriously anti-Semitic, much of Nazi cinema was strictly
escapist, and movies like "Request Concert" are unnerving and
disturbing to watch because they so closely mirror images of American
films of the period. In fact, they so echo Hollywood norms that only
the differences in uniform and language mark them as coming from the
Reich.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the history of today shows the Germans to have been
deluded. How do we know the history of tomorrow, if there is a
tomorrow, won't say the same about us?</TE>
<TE>   I say "if" because, though the human race hasn't changed, though
people are as weak and fallible as they ever were, the weapons in our
control have gotten scarier. We have gotten smarter, but not wiser,
and now we have a catastrophic device in our charge.</TE>
<TE>   Scarier than looking silly in history is the notion that the hair
mussing we are in for might be even worse than the tens of millions
Gen. Turgidson was willing to concede. For it is also not written
anywhere, and this is the truly scary part, that the world itself has
to survive in a form we recognize, and who is to say that the threat
of an already existing Pakistani bomb falling into terrorist hands
isn't as likely, if not more so, than Saddam Hussein developing one
on his own.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps you're thinking: How could all these terrible things come
from a small military adventure? But World War I, which some
historians argue was a greater global catastrophe than anything that
followed, started from a finite event in a small country, an event
that a series of interlocking alliances and falling dominos turned
into a civilization-crushing cataclysm.</TE>
<TE>   If you're thinking that God's strong hand will keep us safe, you
can't be proved wrong, but it's important to remember that no one
believed more fervently and absolutely that the Lord would protect
them than the millions of pious Jews who did not survive the
Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, it was a movie that nurtured this fearful pessimism
in me. Not a studio blockbuster, obviously, but Jon Else's unnerving
1980 documentary "The Day After Trinity," the story of how scientists
working in Los Alamos during World War II came to construct the first
atomic bomb (initially tested at New Mexico's Trinity Site) and what
they felt about what they had done.</TE>
<TE>   What shocks me most every time I see Else's interviews is the
nature of the people who created the bomb. I'd always assumed --
foolishly, obviously -- that they were Dr. Strangelove types,
coldblooded and heartless. Who else would put the entire planet at
risk? To my surprise, the top Los Alamos scientists were revealed as
quintessential humanists -- warm, gregarious, cultured people, lovers
of nature and the classics, readers of Proust in the original French.</TE>
<TE>   If the best and the brightest, for what surely were the best
possible reasons, could create the worst, most destructive weapon the
world has ever seen, what are the reasons to be optimistic about the
actions of the hubristic few who are now in charge of its use? Truly,
as Walt Kelly had Pogo say, "we have met the enemy and he is us."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it is asking too much of the movies to explore these dark
and pessimistic thoughts, to do other than be an unthinking
cheerleader for the eternal domination of the American way. Perhaps
this wish is a hangover from the 1960s and '70s, when so many
American and foreign films explored so many dark corners of the human
condition, spoke out about so much that had previously been unspoken.
But even if it's not Hollywood's place to do anything differently,
our safety, even our survival, may depend on our being aware of what,
in all good faith, has been done to us for so many years. If we're
not aware, World War IV, as a wise man once said, will end up being
fought with sticks and stones.</TE>

<LD>For Plugged In magazine, on the Web site of the conservative
Christian organization Focus on the Family, morality is key in film
reviews aimed at helping parents find kid-friendly fare. Even films
like "Santa Clause 2" get close scrutiny. Here's an excerpt from
critic Steven Isaac's review:</LD>
<LD>   "Positive elements: ... Good holiday cheer, keeping oneself on the
'nice' list and off the 'naughty' one, and neighborly good deeds all
get thumbs up....</LD>
<LD>   "Spiritual content: In a word, Santa. And he's so big and glorious
that there's no room for anything or anyone else (namely, God). Santa
is presented as the only reason Christmas exists. His demise would
leave the world's inhabitants cold, mean and cheerless. Carol raises
the question of Santa to a spiritual plane when she sighs longingly,
'A person just wants something to believe in, you know?' Santa, of
course, is what she's offered as her solution.</LD>
<TE>   "Crude or profane language: One use each of 'golly' and 'heck.'</TE>
<TE>   "Conclusion: ... The G-rated 'SC2' (the original 'Santa Clause'
was PG) is fun, romantic, sentimental and warm, all the things a
Christmas movie should be. It just refuses to acknowledge God. Santa
is not the reason for the season, and kids need to be taught who is."</TE>

<HD>Clear Bombing Range, Now</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Uncle Sam says he can't fund the promised $2.7-million cleanup of a
former bombing range in south Orange County until 2023. What makes
the situation amazing is that the 1,812-acre range closed down three
years after the Korean War -- so nearly 70 years will pass before the
government completes its obligation to find and dispose of leftover
bombs and rockets.</LD>
<LD>   And some folks wonder why skeptics don't believe the Defense
Department's recent promise to clean up the toxic soup left behind at
the former El Toro Marine base, which landed on the federal Superfund
list as one of the nation's most polluted sites.</LD>
<LD>   Target practice at the Trabuco Bombing Range ended in 1956. The
former range extends from residential tracts in Rancho Santa
Margarita to the backlands of O'Neill Regional Park. About 70 tons of
bombs and rockets were carted away as the city was being built, but
an unknown quantity of potentially dangerous ordnance remains in the
soil underneath parklands where visitors hike, mountain bike and
picnic.</LD>
<TE>   There's no record of injuries being caused by unexploded bombs and
rockets that Navy pilots dropped during training flights, but dozens
of civilian casualties have been recorded at other sites with
unexploded ordnance--including the highly publicized deaths in 1983
of two San Diego boys who stumbled across a live mortar shell near a
residential community.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing range is caught up in a federal government numbers
game. It is one of 9,000 of what the government refers to as
"formerly used defense sites" scattered across the country. The
estimated tab for cleaning up after the military is $19 billion, but
annual spending on cleanup has averaged just $220 million. Absent a
dramatic and improbable hike in spending, the cleanup won't be
finished for about a century.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials say the danger at the old Trabuco range is
reduced by the fact that rockets and bombs usually carried just
enough explosives to create a puff of smoke that allowed pilots to
track where bombs and rockets landed. But residents in other parts of
the country haven't been as lucky.</TE>
<TE>   Bomblets containing sarin nerve gas were found in a national
wildlife refuge near Denver, and unexploded mortar shells filled with
an exploding gas were unearthed just 2,100 feet from a Massachusetts
elementary school.</TE>
<TE>   City construction workers find one or two bombs or rockets each
year at the Trabuco range. The county's bomb squad disposes of the
ordnance. Rangers at O'Neill Regional Park last uncovered a practice
weapon about two decades ago, but visitors are warned not to walk off
paths to explore the wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   That's not good enough.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Department should fulfill its obligation. It's bad
enough when unexploded ordnance rusts away in the middle of the
desert. It's simply not acceptable when bombs and rockets remain
buried for decades inside a city's limits or in a heavily used
regional park.</TE>

<HD>Take High Road to Tollway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Figuring out whether or where to build a major road through
environmentally sensitive territory is a complicated, nuanced job. A
federal sledgehammer isn't the way to get it done.</LD>
<LD>   If only the region's congressmen would get that message. It took a
U.S. Senate committee to kill an unseemly political move by Rep. Ken
Calvert (R-Riverside) to blaze a brazen path through a state park for
the Foothill South toll road extension. The rider to a military
appropriations bill would have exempted the project from state laws
governing the environment, public health and water quality, and from
future laws that might restrict roads through state parks. In other
words, it would have thrown out most of the important issues
affecting the quality of life for area residents so that toll road
builders could have their way.</LD>
<LD>   That's an ignorant way to plan a gargantuan construction project.
Worse, it stomps all over authority long granted to state and local
governments.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista) won passage for a much
milder -- but still meddlesome -- measure that allowed the toll road
to be built through San Onofre State Beach, which is leased from the
federal government on Camp Pendleton land. The toll road agencies'
preferred route for the road would take it through the base and park.
Even earlier, former Rep. Ron Packard (R-Vista) gave the toll road
extension a boost with a bill that softened federal environmental
oversight.</TE>
<TE>   But all this help wasn't enough for the toll road agency, which
wanted language allowing it to bypass state environmental review.
Issa's office, even though it supports the toll road proposal,
wouldn't comply, saying that the project should be subject to the
normal process for protecting the environment. So toll road backers
found a willing politician in Calvert. Fortunately, California's two
senators intervened and put a quick end to this latest D.C. escapade.</TE>
<TE>   As with its ill-conceived cousin, the San Joaquin Hills tollway,
the 16.5-mile Foothill South would run through pristine wild lands
and possibly harm endangered plants and animals. As with the
financially disastrous San Joaquin Hills project, demand for the
Foothill South has been questioned. The tollway agency eventually cut
it by half, acknowledging that ridership wasn't there.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of
Engineers initially questioned whether the road was needed but backed
off under political pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Planning for the Foothill South involves even more of a balancing
act, because Camp Pendleton brass has reservations and the
Legislature might move to block the tollway from the state beach.</TE>
<TE>   Local, state and federal agencies are working together on the
issue. Let them do their work based on the merits of the project,
minus the ham-fisted interference from political interests with
tunnel vision -- and without these continued, improper efforts by the
toll road agencies to take a detour around larger public interests.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the process is slow, but it's time for planners to show they
learned something from the San Joaquin Hills debacle.</TE>
<TE>   The last thing Orange County needs is another river of
underutilized asphalt ruining rare wild lands.</TE>

<LD>While they list their blessings this Thursday, a smattering of Orange
County families will offer thanks for the courteous behavior of the
young children at the feast.</LD>
<LD>   They can thank Karen Beckman, a second-grade teacher at Chapman
Hills Elementary School in Orange who has been teaching her young
charges some essentials that aren't found on the state's proficiency
exams. Such as refraining from gagging noises when asked if they'd
like some string beans or asking to be excused from the table when
they're finished.</LD>
<LD>   Mrs. Beckman got the idea several years ago after observing her
students' behavior whenever food came into the classroom. Especially
bothersome were the hurtful comments students would make about each
other's food contributions. ("You eat that!!???")</LD>
<TE>   Inspiring behavior.</TE>
<TE>   At least, it inspired Mrs. Beckman to develop a simple etiquette
program for 7-year-olds. She's not talking about snooty teas or
elaborate 26-utensil dinners--just enough savoir vivre to make the
little darlings bearable company. She teaches them to say their magic
words and ask for a second helping instead of reaching past Great
Uncle Harry to nab it.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, instead of the typical grab-a-snack-food class party,
Mrs. Beckman is holding a Manners Feast, a sort of finals exam in
politesse. The children are making their placemats and setting the
table. They will sit and practice their manners.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yes, and they'll eat. Chewing with their mouths closed, if
Mrs. Beckman has anything to say about it, their elbows off the table
and their burps restrained, thank you very much.</TE>
<TE>   Politeness is contagious. Mrs. Beckman has even inspired The Times
to a new level of etiquette, using her honorific title instead of the
usual style of last name only.</TE>
<TE>   So rare has true courtesy become that people seem amazed when a
door is held open for them or a bus seat vacated for their use. As a
result, Mrs. Beckman's pint-sized Emily Posts already have a head
start when it comes to making their mark in the world. Givers of the
feast might wish Mrs. Beckman would take some of their older guests
in hand.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows? Mrs. Beckman's second-graders might even grow into the
kind of adult who knows it's polite to turn off the cell phone during
dinner. Now that would make us thankful.</TE>

<LD>Re "Dove Drives Campus Debate," Nov. 14:</LD>
<LD>   I'm glad to see students at Fullerton Union High School, led by
Caitlin Orr, take an interest in U.S. foreign policy. I also agree
with Caitlin's view that we should not blindly support President
Bush's incursion into Iraq at this time. The problem is much broader
than that.</LD>
<LD>   Before committing our troops to the possibility of being bogged
down in the Middle East, where we are so hated, many of us believe we
should attend to more urgent matters first.</LD>
<TE>   Homeland security, Al Qaeda and finishing the job in Afghanistan
come to mind.</TE>
<TE>   Whether they're for or against the war, I hope the students (and
all of us) are reading and listening to many viewpoints so we can
speak from our own depth of knowledge rather than being brainwashed
by one side or the other.</TE>
<TE>   All politicians "play politics." Our job is to learn to extract
the truth from the propaganda, then use our voices to influence the
direction of our country.</TE>
<TE>   It's the American way -- thank goodness.</TE>

<LD>Re "Few Bumps Found on Caltrans' Path," Nov. 17:</LD>
<LD>   It is not surprising that Caltrans gets relatively high marks for
recent construction projects. Infrastructure projects, particularly
concrete structures, tend to show their defects many years -- or even
decades -- after they are built.</LD>
<LD>   Once the concrete is stripped, it is most often "spalling" of
concrete (flakes or chunks of concrete falling off the surface) that
indicates that rebar was placed too close to the inside of the form.
When this happens, the usual reaction is to patch the offending spots
as quickly as possible and make sure a good cosmetic appearance is
maintained.</LD>
<TE>   As a quality engineer, my reaction to the recent problems with the
flyover bridge near John Wayne Airport is to conclude that the
concrete pre-pour inspection was inadequate and that the placement of
rebar is suspect throughout. I say this because spacing between rebar
and the inside of the form is one of the first things an inspector
checks along with count, configuration, size, spacing and tie-down of
all the reinforcing steel. This takes time -- including time for
correction -- and trained personnel with adequate authority to get
the job done.</TE>
<TE>   Stingy state budgets have left Caltrans in the position of turning
over inspection and most oversight to the private sector, where low
bidders are given the opportunity to cut corners in areas where their
errors and omissions are unlikely to be discovered for years to come.
If Hoover Dam had been built under this philosophy, it would not
likely be standing today.</TE>
<TE>   Stu O'Guinn</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Transportation Authority has hired private
engineering firms to design, inspect and construct the ramp that
might need to be replaced connecting the San Diego and Costa Mesa
freeways. OCTA's project manager won't point any fingers of blame.
But why should taxpayers be saddled with this expense? Why aren't
these firms removed or fired?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, well! Remember, this is only the beginning. Proposition 35
will allow all public transportation projects to be completed by
private firms. So I guess Orange County will have its own "falling
bridge" song!</TE>

<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outlawing hand-held cell phones will not by itself reduce the high
automobile accident rate of cell phone users.</LD>
<LD>   Holding a cell phone while driving occupies the driver's hands,
which may prevent the driver from steering efficiently or flashing
the turn signals. But holding a phone conversation occupies the
driver's attention, which may prevent the driver from noticing or
reacting to signs, pedestrians, oncoming traffic, sirens or other
elements in the driving environment.</LD>
<LD>   Holding a phone conversation is not like holding a conversation
with an in-car passenger. Conversations between a driver and a
passenger are often discontinuous because the driver and the
passenger share the travel experience and are therefore both aware of
the tasks that the driver is facing at any given moment.</LD>
<TE>   For example, if the driver is trying to work through
bumper-to-bumper freeway traffic to an exit ramp, the driver usually
interrupts the conversation to give his/her attention to the driving
task. The passenger can see the task facing the driver and stops
talking too. In fact, the passenger often assists the driver, such as
by telling the driver when lanes are clear.</TE>
<TE>   However, telephone conversations are quite different. Telephone
etiquette requires the two people conversing on the phone to take
turns talking; they are not allowed to pass when it's their turn to
talk.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers using cell phones mistakenly adhere to this custom too.
This means that a driver's attention is often divided between
negotiating a complex action such as a freeway lane change and taking
his/her turn in the phone conversation.</TE>
<TE>   The other party cannot see the need to discontinue the
conversation and keeps on talking. The result is a distracted driver
faced with the choice of breaking a social rule by not taking his
turn to talk or breaking a driving rule by not paying attention to
maneuvering the car.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Leaders of Hate Groups Held," Nov. 19:</LD>
<LD>   Something seems fishy about the arrest of these three people.</LD>
<LD>   Consider: This week in Orange County, three alleged gang members
were arrested for brandishing a loaded gun at occupants of another
car.</LD>
<TE>   The alleged gang members apparently made their $10,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Now, three people in Orange County have been arrested for having,
among other things, "16 nails" in 1999? Oh, they also had pro-white
literature. Well, there's the problem, right? Can't read what the
thought police don't want you to read. The bail? $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   This sounds ominously like the run-up to both Ruby Ridge and Waco,
in which law enforcement authorities stretched to demonize the Weaver
family and the people at Waco, who were all pretty much minding their
own business but had nonconformist thoughts on society.</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Att. Tony Rackauckas apparently gives away the real
social-political agenda in this when he says: "This is the continuing
effort by law enforcement to suck the oxygen from these groups by
going after their leaders and using every legal remedy to raise the
price of doing their business in our community."</TE>

<LD>   The writer made it sound as though it was the storm's fault that
we had cans, cups, bags and Styrofoam spread all over our beaches.
However, the people of Southern California are the ones responsible
for making our beaches look like garbage dumps.</LD>
<LD>   As we throw our cups, empty food bags, cigarette butts, soda cans
and other junk onto the street, we do not realize the harm we are
causing our ecosystem. Our trash is swept into the ocean, killing
fish, seals, dolphins, sharks and other animals.</LD>
<TE>   Not only is the marine life feeling the effects of our profuse
trash, but so are the people who like the beach. Surfers get to spend
their session trying to avoid plastic bags and cups floating in the
water. No one should have to swim in trash when trying to enjoy the
ocean.</TE>

beach would be a whole lot cleaner and healthier.</TE>

<LD>Re "An Emission-Free Way to Meet Energy Needs," Nov. 17:</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista) describes a pumped storage project
at Lake Elsinore as a source of "much-needed clean hydroelectric
energy."</LD>
<LD>   This statement is very misleading. Pumped storage projects, of
course, produce no net energy and indeed are lucky to get back 75% of
the energy they consume. They are simply a scheme to take advantage
of the difference between daytime and nighttime electric rates.
Hardly a compelling reason to burn coal in the daytime.</LD>
<TE>   And of course, they do environmental damage -- at the top and
bottom of their run. Lake Elsinore will not benefit from having its
water removed and replaced daily and, more important, Morel Canyon
and the vicinity, though not formal wilderness areas, are de facto
wild areas valuable to the shrinking Cleveland National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Issa reassures us that we need not worry because the
National Environmental Protection Act mandates a thorough review of
the impact of forest giveaways such as this. But isn't the NEPA the
very law the administration in Washington is trying to eviscerate?</TE>

<LD>Re "With High Court OK, Family Sues an HMO," Nov. 11:</LD>
<LD>   I read with disbelief that Dr. Lakshmi Shukla settled a suit for
ostensibly withholding treatment information and recommendations. I
am a patient of Dr. Shukla's. He has been very caring and considerate
and very insistent in recommending additional testing for my
condition.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Shukla is more personally concerned and involved with his
patients than the opportunistic lawyers are with their clients. I
guarantee it.</LD>

<HD>Post-Mortem Continues on Great Park Measure</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Analyzing El Toro Ballot Measure Results," Letters, Nov. 17:</LD>
<LD>   Huntington Beach resident Paul Arms says he supports the Great
Park, he belongs to the Planning and Conservation League, which wrote
the failed Proposition 51, and he laments that the law would have
given money to Irvine, but not to other open space projects in Orange
County, some of which he lists.</LD>
<LD>   Not mentioned in the Arms letter was Measure W, which created the
Great Park, and, by voter sanction, significantly weakened the open
space protection he cherishes. In the fine print of Measure W, we see
that private and public open space property, "due to market pressures
to serve a growing county population, may ultimately be developed in
other ways."</LD>
<TE>   The mischievous wording in Measure W should not be surprising,
because it was prepared by Irvine, a city run by housing developers.
The airport plan, the plan Measure W was intended to displace, has a
great park too, and both the airport and Great Park allow for the
existence of the Cal State Fullerton satellite campus.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in South County who thought they were voting against the
airport were actually voting for, perhaps unwittingly, unbridled
urban sprawl. Fortunately, Orange County did not fall for Proposition
51.</TE>

<TE>   Re "El Toro Airport May Be Dead, but Debate Isn't," Nov. 10:</TE>
<TE>   When comments such as those from reader Linda Hoover are incorrect
to the core, they demand to be corrected.</TE>
<TE>   Hoover wrote: "The majority of north Orange County citizens voted
against Measure W." But only one-third of those registered voters
cast ballots March 5. This means that though No on W earned 60% of
the vote in north Orange County, that total represented 20% of the
registered voters in that area, while 13% supported W. This is
nowhere near an overwhelming rejection of Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   The brutal truth is that there are more than twice as many
registered voters in north Orange County than in the south. If there
were a groundswell of support for a new airport, then W would have
been crushed. Instead, two-thirds of the voters in the north stayed
home March 5.</TE>
<TE>   Those who propose an airport at El Toro need to let go of the
fantasy of North County support. On March 5, the voters there made it
very clear they don't care.</TE>

<LD>   Nativo Lopez is sweating his last days on the Santa Ana school
board. The defeat of Nadia Davis, who frequently voted with the
incompetent and perceived corrupt majority, has John Palacio, Sal
Tinajero and Lopez searching for a legislative intervention for the
recall set Feb. 4. The district attorney found no evidence of fraud.
Neither did the Orange County registrar of voters, who certified more
than 9,000 signatures.</LD>
<LD>   State lawmakers and Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer must reject the
request for an investigation. They should be focusing their energy on
resolving the state's huge deficit, energy crisis, and investigating
the carpool ramp linking the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways that
will cost the taxpayers more than $10 million to repair.</LD>

<LD>Re: "Yogi Helps Explain Why the Democrats Struck Out," Nov. 17:</LD>
<LD>   Here's why this Republican voted against the GOP in every category
this month. I believe in balanced budgets: I don't believe in raising
federal expenditures and cutting taxes, thereby widening the deficit.
I believe in real programs to cure the economy, rather than partisan
policies benefiting those who are not really affected by a poor
economy. I believe in bipartisan government rather than assisting
large energy companies to manipulate energy prices for their gain. I
believe in personal liberty, rather than permitting Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft to intern indefinitely anyone he suspects of anti-government
activity.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, I believe that our huge military budget not only causes
serious deficit problems at home, but also does not contribute to
world peace.</LD>
<TE>   Is the Orange County Taxpayers Assn.'s sole role in life to reduce
tax even if the resulting deficits destroy our economy? Maybe they
should rename themselves the Orange County "Massive Aggregate
Deficits" Assn. or MAD for short?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Friends Salute Surfer Killed in Bali," Oct. 20:</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for your coverage of Steve Webster's tragic death in
Bali. I wanted people to know that Steve was not only a beloved
family man and fellow surfer, but also that he cared a lot about his
community, especially kids.</LD>
<LD>   One of my most vivid memories of Steve was when he spoke several
years ago to the Newport Beach City Council, urging the council to
ratify the Parks and Recreation Department's plan to allow board
surfing at all times in Newport's "Hottest Hundred Yards" between the
52nd and 56th streets jetties.</LD>
<TE>   Gesturing to the crowd packed with supporters of this small
concession to the surfing community, Steve asked the reluctant
council, "Isn't this a democracy?" The mayor smugly replied to Steve
that "democracy is a representative system to protect the minority
from the tyranny of the majority." We knew at that moment that the
council would side with the wealthy beachfront homeowners, who didn't
want their weekly summer renters to have to walk 50 yards to the next
jetty to swim. The weekend before Steve left for Bali, I stood with
Steve and his son Dylan, 6, while Steve fished off the 52nd Street
jetty. It would be a nice tribute to Steve if we could see kids
surfing 54th Street every summer afternoon.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When I read the article regarding Steve Webster's funeral, I
realized I knew Steve long ago in Newport Beach. I cried when I read
about his untimely death.</TE>
<TE>   I was a new resident in Newport Beach in the late '80s and was
learning to surf at the 52nd Street jetty, where locals were very
territorial.</TE>
<TE>   "Webs" was a gifted surfer, highly respected for his skills. And
he supported me and my dream to become a surfer. Many times in the
lineup, he would tell me to take a wave that he could have had. When
other "locals" would get on my case for insufficient surfing skills,
he would tell them to back off and let me surf.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks, Steve, for being my friend.</TE>

<LD>   I am truly amused that I have finally seen in print, "The
thousands of gulls and other birds that leave their droppings ...
create health, safety and water-quality hazards." I have always
thought that Huntington Beach's ocean water quality problem rests
with birds whose droppings are washed into the ocean.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, might it also be said that it would be better to reduce
wetland area (and the number of gulls, etc.) in order to reduce
contaminants and to increase water quality? All one has to do is
visit the Santa Ana River area near the ocean and the various
wetlands north up the coast to Seal Beach to see firsthand that birds
can be a significant part of the water contamination problem.</LD>

<AU>Kelli Colby</AU>
<BD>Kelli Colby's 17-year-old son, Matt, died last
September after playing in a high school football game.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My 17-year-old son, Matt Colby, died last year doing the thing he
enjoyed most, playing football for his high school. He was, and
always will be, the love of my life. He was my best friend and
biggest supporter and I learned more from him than I ever taught him.
I thought raising him alone was hard, but living without him is much
harder.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the most painful moments of the past year: Going through
the 2001 holidays without taking out the decorations we'd collected
together over the years; May 29, the day that would have been his
18th birthday; graduation day; deciding which of his precious and
prized possessions and collections to sell at garage sales, which to
give to his friends and family members and which to store away in the
"Matt's Life" box.</LD>
<LD>   Matt died in late September 2001 of bleeding and swelling in the
brain, probably after repeated blows to his head during football
games he played for Costa Mesa High School, according to the Orange
County coroner. He collapsed during a game and never regained
consciousness.</LD>
<TE>   My life is not the only one scarred by Matt's death. His
grandfather will never again be able to take his only grandson
fishing in the Sierras, something they did together every year. His
coach, who was like a surrogate father, will live with the inner
turmoil and pain that this has caused him.</TE>
<TE>   These are only a few; there are hundreds of teenagers whose lives
will forever be affected by the loss of a friend many had known since
early childhood.</TE>
<TE>   In California alone, four other families and communities were
thrust into this same agonizing situation last year. All four had
children who died while participating in high school athletic
programs. And Andrew Castillo, a 16-year-old San Gabriel boy, has
been in a coma since Oct. 4 in circumstances remarkably similar to
Matt's. Andrew collapsed during a football game after complaining of
a headache.</TE>
<TE>   How long will we allow this to go on?</TE>
<TE>   Recently, I spent a long evening reading the California Government
Code, studying the Education Code and the Health and Welfare Code. I
couldn't find any legislation specifically defining guidelines for
injury prevention, treatment and return to play applicable to
interscholastic sports.</TE>
<TE>   In Section 35179 of the Education Code, school boards are given
control of and responsibility for "all aspects of the interscholastic
athletic policies, programs and activities in its district." It
states that the board is to assure that all policies, programs and
activities in its district are in compliance with state and federal
law, but I couldn't find any state or federal laws addressing
interscholastic sports injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The Interagency School Safety Demonstration Act of 1985 covers
school crime, vandalism, truancy and excessive absenteeism but
doesn't mention sports safety.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997 the Legislature passed Senate Bill 187, which mandates
safe school planning at every school site. Education Code Section
35294.2 lists the areas that require safety programs under this bill.
Again, no mention of sports safety.</TE>
<TE>   The Office of the District Attorney, in partnership with the
California Department of Education, published "Safe Schools: A
Planning Guide for Action, 2002." Sports safety is absent from this
publication as well.</TE>
<TE>   Early childhood development is provided for quite comprehensively
in the Health and Safety Code, even identifying multiple sources for
funding. Why stop at 5 years old?</TE>
<TE>   Last week a drill was conducted at Costa Mesa High School
simulating a terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Hours have been devoted to the state exit exams, including
opposing reports of their accuracy and overall value.</TE>
<TE>   Don't get me wrong. I think preventing school crime, vandalism,
truancy and disaster preparedness are worthy and necessary activities
of our school boards and legislators. I'm having a hard time finding
the rationale for virtually ignoring the issue of sports injury
prevention and safety.</TE>
<TE>   How many more young athletes have to die during high school
sporting events before sports safety becomes an issue worthy of our
legislators' and school boards' time and money? It is time that we
show our teenagers that their safety is more important than their
performance on the field.</TE>

<HD>Students, Suffering Yet Packaged</HD>
<DH>With our test-score fixation, the message we're sending is
denial</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Smith</AU>
<BD>Gary Smith is a high school teacher in Anaheim.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Supporters of standardized testing of California public school
students believe that the tests, though expensive and time-consuming,
are accurate evaluations of academic achievement and can be used to
compare the quality of education delivered in different school
settings. They believe that state-mandated penalties and dwindling
incentives, when combined with local pressure, will motivate schools
to improve student achievement.</LD>
<LD>   But there is widespread dissatisfaction among educators about the
validity of many content standards and the test questions used to
assess them. Observers also point out that the testing program's
underlying assumptions about students and learning environments are
out of sync with how students learn.</LD>
<LD>   More important is the inherent dehumanization of students that
testing creates by treating education like an assembly line. Teachers
pour information identified as important into the students' heads.</LD>
<TE>   If standardized test scores are low, teachers need only add more
information to create better products: information-rich students.
Neither research nor common experience support this approach.</TE>
<TE>   In our politicized rush to standardized testing, we have forgotten
that the products being rushed down the assembly line are our own
children.</TE>
<TE>   As we sit in the morning sunlight sharing milk and cereal with our
children, we celebrate their multidimensional personalities. We know
that each one has special wants and needs, dreams and aspirations,
strengths and weaknesses. When we turn them over to schools, we have
real expectations: We expect schools to be staffed by caring, skilled
educators. We hope that they will be provided sanctuary and guidance
so that they can grow in a safe and rich environment. We trust that
the schools will provide a safety net to catch children who need
special help and guidance.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, the pressure to prepare students for standardized testing
has undermined the ability of educators to maintain that trust. The
standardized testing program does not recognize the existence of the
whole child. Students who need more and more support in their lives
are getting less and less.</TE>
<TE>   To make student needs more concrete: Not long ago, a young high
school student of mine shared a story of staggering pain. When she
was 6 years old, her mother killed herself as part of a failed plan
to also kill my student and her sister.</TE>
<TE>   The young woman's story was heartbreaking and horrifying. Even
though I have had more than three decades of teaching experience, my
words of consolation were woefully inadequate. The story was dreadful
under any circumstances, but it had an even greater impact on me in
the wake of other events involving my students during the same year
-- events that revealed lives filled with uncertainty, anxiety, loss
and pain.</TE>
<TE>   Below are brief descriptions of incidents that provide a sobering
view of high school student life:</TE>
<TE>   Five girls became pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   A girl had to flee the state with her family because she witnessed
an off-campus murder attempt by a neighborhood gang.</TE>
<TE>   A girl left class vowing to attempt suicide.</TE>
<TE>   A girl told of having a baby who became increasingly ill and,
after a month, died.</TE>
<TE>   A boy at the school committed suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Students tried to stop a friend from having an abortion.</TE>
<TE>   A girl struggled with the effects of being molested.</TE>
<TE>   While the impact of these emotionally charged events on the
students varied widely, each eroded a student's sense of worth,
confidence and security, and disrupted their attention and
motivation.</TE>
<TE>   Because students volunteered this information, I believe that the
stories are true and represent only the tip of the iceberg. Linked to
growing evidence of student anxiety and anger being expressed as
violence on U.S. campuses and with the lyrics of the music they
choose, I must believe that my school is little different from the
rest.</TE>
<TE>   How am I to effectively teach students who have such urgent
personal needs? What is the best way for me to help students become
happy, productive and knowledgeable citizens? How can I reconcile the
differences between what students need and the insufficient, myopic
provisions of the standards-based education dictated by the
government?</TE>
<TE>   I ask that each of us reexamine our perspectives and priorities
for educating students. Children are fragile resources, not miniature
adults. They need considerable nurturing and care.</TE>
<TE>   It is time to aggressively push our political representatives and
school administrators to reexamine testing programs. We must insist
that they furnish schools with funding and strategies that provide
students with guidance in all areas of their development. In time,
increasing numbers of students will leave school able to cope with
the complexities of the real world and prosper as self-confident,
happy and fully functional human beings.</TE>
<TE>   Postscript: This year, my school district is requiring teachers to
use three more days of instruction to administer newly mandated
tests. These are above and beyond high school exit exams and the
multiday California standards exams already being administered.</TE>

<DH>If Things Go as Planned, Jeanie Buss and Her Siblings Will
Inherit the Lakers and the Rest of Their Father's Half-Billion-Dollar
Sports Dynasty. Is She Ready for This? Is Los Angeles?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Steve Springer is a Times staff writer. He wrote "The
Encylopedia of the Lakers" and co-authored, along with Scott Ostler,
"Winnin' Times, the Magical Journey of the Los Angeles Lakers."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The most powerful female sports executive in the country was sweating
profusely in the wilds of Montana, part of a month-long vacation at
her boyfriend's lakeside retreat. During an afternoon outing picking
huckleberries, she found herself playing a role--a sort of Beverly
Hillbilly in reverse--that didn't come naturally, though she was
coping. The former Playboy model could handle the sun beating down on
her no-longer-fancy hairdo, the dust spoiling her usually flawless
makeup, the shrubs scratching her nails. There are hardships you
endure for love. But she'd become separated from her boyfriend in the
woods, and suddenly he was talking about bears.</LD>
<LD>   ''I did tell you what to do if you run into a bear,'' he called.</LD>
<LD>   ''Uh, no.''</LD>
<TE>   ''If it's a black bear, play dead. If it's a grizzly, climb a
tree.''</TE>
<TE>   She felt the panic rising and snapped: ''How do I tell the
difference?''</TE>
<TE>   ''The grizzly,'' he said vaguely, ''is bigger.''</TE>
<TE>   The moment underscores the paradox that is Jeanie Buss--girlfriend
of Lakers coach Phil Jackson, daughter of team owner Jerry Buss and
administrative vice president and likely future president of one of
the richest and most successful teams in professional sports.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanie Buss plays many roles. She can be the damsel in distress
with her boyfriend, as she was that summer day in 2001, or the
nervous child with her father, as she was when she first told him
about her budding relationship with Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   But beneath the giggly, vivacious personality and stylish clothes
is a former model who can talk basketball with NBA owners, finances
with Staples Center officials and marketing with television
executives. She has proven that she can handle tough situations, as
she did when she dealt with the funeral of broadcaster Chick Hearn,
and she has shown that she has a few things left to learn about
basketball, as she did when she initially opposed the hiring of
Jackson as the Lakers' coach.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanie Buss is preparing to sit at the helm of a sports empire
that some estimate is worth half a billion dollars. Is she ready? Is
Los Angeles?</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Buss has been the majority owner of the Lakers for 23 years,
but at age 69, he is gradually turning over the reins of power to his
four adult children. Along with Jeanie (41), there is Janie (39) and
sons Johnny (46) and Jimmy (43), the four children he had with his
wife, Jo Ann, from whom he is divorced. He's also making room in his
operations for three boys from another relationship, two of whom,
Joey (18) and Jesse (14), the couple had together, and a third, Sean
(31), who is the woman's son from a previous relationship. Buss
considers him a stepson and employs him as a Lakers scout.</TE>
<TE>   "All of them will someday play a role in the Lakers if they so
desire," Jeanie says.</TE>
<TE>   But with Buss removing himself from the day-to-day operation,
rarely even coming into the office, and with Jeanie's two older
brothers making it clear they prefer smaller roles, and with a sister
who places homemaking first, Jeanie has already assumed command of
the day-to-day operations of the Lakers, the crown jewel of the Buss
sports empire.</TE>
<TE>   Some find it hard to take Jeanie seriously in this role, and she's
certainly not the first heiress apparent to face such skepticism. On
the day in 1996 when Irvine's St. John Knits announced that daughter
Kelly Gray was taking over the presidency of the family enterprise,
the company's stock dropped 7.5%. Skeptics grumbled, too, when
Christie Hefner took over the executive role that her father, Hugh, a
friend of Jerry Buss, had long played in the Playboy empire.</TE>
<TE>   Critics still think of Jeanie Buss as the girl who posed nude in
an eight-page Playboy spread, including a photo in which she hid her
breasts behind a pair of basketballs; as the girl who shopped and
hung out with her father's college-age girlfriends when she was also
that age; as the girl who cruised around town in fancy cars and was
romantically linked with various sports celebrities. Although her
father is a well-known adherent to the Playboy philosophy, Jeanie
says she realizes adopting that lifestyle in her younger days was an
open invitation to the tabloids. "I'm disappointed so much of that
stuff got put in the media," says Jeanie, who concedes that
detractors have called her "Jeanie the Bimbo." "But I understand
people like to gossip."</TE>
<TE>   While it's hard to find a discouraging word among other NBA team
executives about Jeanie's fitness to eventually run the Lakers, it's
also hard to find an encouraging word. Most plead ignorance simply
because they haven't dealt with her on major decisions. The truth is,
it's one thing to handle daily operations as Jeanie is doing, and
quite another to oversee a management group that, for example, must
continue to obtain superstars such as Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant, while at the same time needs to find unheralded stars among
low draft picks. Those are decisions her father still reserves for
himself. How will she handle life in the wider world of sports, which
is dominated by men who don't necessarily appreciate Jeanie Buss for
her management skills?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really know how good she'll be as an executive," says one
rival club official, "but I'd sure love to marry her."</TE>
<TE>   Those who watched her this past summer saw a mature, focused
Jeanie Buss. Despite the Lakers' third straight championship, it was
a stressful time in the front office because of the death of longtime
broadcaster Chick Hearn. When the 85-year-old Hearn died from head
injuries after a fall in August, Jerry was in Europe. He remained
there, confident his daughter could handle the situation.</TE>
<TE>   And she did. Jeanie was at Northridge Hospital Medical Center,
orchestrating the press conference to announce Hearn's passing.
During the next five days, she spearheaded arrangements for one of
the most elaborate funerals in this city's history--a private service
for 400, televised live, and a reception that followed at Staples
Center. The organization invited fans to Staples to file by Hearn's
broadcast perch above the court, and about 18,000 of them showed up.
Jeanie also handled the sticky negotiations with Hearn's successor,
Paul Sunderland, who wasn't happy with a contract offer of only one
year, but accepted it when Jeanie held firm.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the season, when the Lakers decided to honor the Hall
of Famers who led the Lakers to five championships while the team was
still in Minneapolis, Jeanie and her staff decided to publicly
present those former players and their coach championship rings,
which weren't given out half a century ago when they won those
titles. And last month, when the Lakers received rings for their
latest championship, Jeanie insisted that the Minneapolis players
also get rings, a decision that brought emotional calls from some of
the players and established her as someone with a deep understanding
and respect for the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We in the NBA know how much she knows," says NBA commissioner
David Stern. "She has an intimate [knowledge] of the business."</TE>
<TE>   "She always had a vision," says Linda Rambis, who has been working
alongside Jeanie for two decades and is married to Kurt Rambis, the
former Laker player and head coach who now is Jackson's assistant.
"But she was insecure. She didn't always have the confidence to stand
up for what she believed in. She always had to deal with that
backlash of being the boss's kid. She has really had to work her way
in and there has been a lot of resistance. But she's poised. She's
smart. If she was a man, she might have been accepted 20 years ago,
but sports is the last frontier for women."</TE>
<TE>   While Jerry Buss has stepped into the background, he's not about
to step out of the picture. "I just can't visualize myself walking
away, relinquishing control," he says. "My relationship with this
team is a lifelong marriage." But while he approved Sunderland as
Hearn's successor, it was up to Jeanie to make it happen.</TE>
<TE>   She has learned from watching her father operate, and can lean on
his longtime business partner, Frank Mariani, and attorney Jerry
Perzik, but she also has a style and staff of her own. Her smile is
bigger than his, her eyes wider and softer, her clothes flashy--an
obvious departure from her father's preference for jeans and cowboy
boots. She spends time honing her body in the gym while he gravitates
toward smoke-filled poker parlors. But their creed is the same:
"Never take no for an answer."</TE>
<TE>   With the passing of the years and the gradual passing of the
torch, Jeanie has won over some skeptics. When she first attended a
meeting of the NBA's Board of Governors, she put her normal wardrobe
in the closet, picked out a conservative business suit and carried a
briefcase. Then she sat by her father's elbow for three years of
meetings, listening, learning, but never speaking to the group as a
whole. Finally, when her father left the room and a minor matter came
up that required input from the Lakers, all eyes turned to Jeanie.
"I'm just so glad I finally get to say something," she said, and
laughter filled room.</TE>
<TE>   Other team owners and NBA executives soon found she had a lot to
say. "She's a smart businesswoman with good marketing ideas," says
Brian McIntyre, head of media relations for the NBA. "When they first
met her, some people were struck mostly by her looks, and she had to
overcome some of that."</TE>
<TE>   Stern echoes that opinion. As an example, he recalls that the
Lakers had an exhibition game scheduled for New Orleans for the
recently concluded preseason. He says Jeanie anticipated that the
Charlotte team might be moving to New Orleans for this season, making
that city the Hornets' exclusive territory and possibly creating
legal and logistical problems that could have cost the Lakers a lot
of money. "So she was on the phone lining the game up for Oklahoma
City instead," Stern says. "She has been really involved in the
operation of this franchise for several years on matters ranging from
television to the building to scheduling. There is no subject
involved with the team that she can't deal with. Actually, at this
point, I think she is more knowledgeable than her father. She can't
say that, but I can."</TE>
<TE>   "Who would have thought George Bush would be an effective
president?" says the vice president of an NBA club who asked not to
be identified. "I think those are awfully big shoes that Jeanie would
have to fill. I think Jerry is doing the right thing by bringing her
in now, but whether she will be capable of carrying on with the
operating blueprint he is giving her, I don't know. If it happened
tomorrow, it would probably make a lot of people nervous."</TE>
<TE>   He added that "I don't know what more he could do to prepare her.
She has been raised in the business, which gives her a lot more
experience than an outside buyer coming in. Disney and Fox, big
corporations, got into sports, and they haven't had a painless entry.
[But] let's just hope she is not required to fill those big shoes any
time soon."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry's kids may be inheriting an empire, but there were no such
riches on his horizon when he was a kid. When he was 4, growing up in
the midst of the Depression in Wyoming, the only thing he could count
on was a meal at the end of a bread line. He dug ditches, worked on
the railroad, and eventually got a PhD in physical chemistry from
USC.</TE>
<TE>   While working as an aerospace engineer, Buss and a fellow worker,
Mariani, each put aside $83.33 from their monthly paychecks until
they had accumulated $1,000. Then, in 1959, they invested in an
apartment building in Santa Monica. Drained of funds, they even did
their own repair work at night after working in aerospace all day.
Twenty years later, after riding Southern California's real-estate
booms, their empire was worth about $350 million.</TE>
<TE>   With such wealth at his disposal, Buss moved out of his house and
into a lifestyle that emulated that of Hugh Hefner himself, dating
women no more than a year or two on either side of 21 and even
acquiring his own version of the Playboy mansion in the 1980s when he
lived in Pickfair, the former home of actress Mary Pickford and actor
Douglas Fairbanks Sr.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, Buss, whose first sports venture was the Los Angeles
Strings of World Team Tennis, pulled off the biggest transaction of
his life, a $67.5-million deal with Jack Kent Cooke to buy the
Lakers, the Kings hockey team, the Forum and a California ranch in
exchange for the lease to New York's Chrysler Building (which Buss
obtained at Cooke's request) and several other properties. In all,
the deal involved nine pieces of property, 12 escrows in three
states, and more than 50 lawyers and advisors.</TE>
<TE>   It was Buss who ascribed the term "Showtime" to the Lakers'
entertaining fast-break offense during the 1980s, Buss who raised the
cost of courtside seats tenfold but kept them filled, Buss who for
years handed the basketball decisions over to NBA talent guru Jerry
West (now with the Memphis Grizzlies), Buss who paid the price for
developing championship teams beginning with a groundbreaking
25-year, $25-million contract for Magic Johnson in 1981. But Buss was
not content with just having a winner, or even a dynasty.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to create a family business.</TE>
<TE>   His children, though, had their own ideas. one by one, they let
their father know, in various ways, that maybe leading a Los Angeles
sports dynasty wasn't their thing. All except Jeanie.</TE>
<TE>   Her brother, Johnny, the oldest son, learned how harsh the sports
business could be at a young age when his father traded Johnny's
fiancee, Diane Fromholtz, a member of the Strings, in 1976. "He was a
wreck when he had to tell me," Johnny recalls. "When I came into his
office, he was chain-smoking. 'What if I told you I had a chance to
get Chris Evert?' he asked me."</TE>
<TE>   Johnny knew where his father was going with that question.
Fromholtz went to the Indiana Loves, and Johnny went with her. But
their relationship ended soon after and Johnny returned to L.A. He
resumed working for his father, first in the real-estate business and
then running the Lazers, his father's entry in the Major Indoor
Soccer League, in the early 1980s. But after the 1984 season, with
the team struggling financially, Johnny resigned. "I felt I had put
so much effort into it, given up my life and when it didn't work out,
it hurt," he says. "It hurt very badly. I felt as if I was a
failure."</TE>
<TE>   For all of the next-generation Busses, failure in their father's
eyes--real or perceived--is the ultimate horror. Although Johnny says
his father never made him feel that way, he couldn't be talked out
it. Needing to find his own identity, Johnny tried auto racing, but
eventually was lured back into the family business to run the Los
Angeles Sparks, his father's team in the Women's National Basketball
Assn. Johnny's team has won the league championship each of the last
two seasons, but Johnny remains a reluctant owner. He says he'd
really like to return to his first love, real estate, far from the
glare of the Buss spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Buss followed Johnny as president of the Lazers. When the MISL
folded in 1989, Jim also wanted to prove he could make it on his own.
"I was tired of the feeling of taking a paycheck from Dad," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He found his niche training racehorses and did it for seven years
until Dad again came calling. "He told me it looked like Jerry West
[who built the Laker dynasty in the 1980s as well as the current
three-time NBA championship team] was looking to retire," Jim
recalls. "He wanted me to learn the business."</TE>
<TE>   So Jim became West's shadow, traveling with him to colleges and
basketball camps, watching West zero in on the players he felt were
NBA material. Jim saw some similarity with his previous job
evaluating and buying racehorses. "When you watch an athlete in
motion, there are some of the same tendencies," he says. "I'm not
comparing horses to people. That's not fair. But with what I had
done, it was easy to relate to scouting."</TE>
<TE>   Jim ran into many of the same doubters as Jeanie--those who
considered him little more than the boss's privileged son. Now that
West has left for Memphis, Jim, the Lakers' assistant general
manager, feels he has found his role. He sees himself as a middleman
between his father and general manager Mitch Kupchak. "If my father
sees a player he likes and asks if we can do anything, and Mitch
doesn't feel it's a good fit, I can go back to my father and
[explain] why."</TE>
<TE>   Janie, the youngest Buss daughter, stayed home in an
unincorporated area of Riverside County the night the Lakers beat the
Sacramento Kings to win the Western Conference Finals last spring,
and when the game was over she put her two young kids in the bathtub.
"Family is definitely my priority," says Janie, who lives with her
husband of 11 years, David Drexel, her children, 9-year-old Riley and
5-year-old Sierra, several horses and a handful of dogs and cats.</TE>
<TE>   But, she says, don't think she's not part of her father's grand
scheme. Janie handles the finances for the Los Angeles Lakers Youth
Foundation and various other nonprofit team endeavors, from youth
centers to educational projects. In all, she oversees contributions
of several hundred thousand dollars a year. "The media don't know
me," she says, "but I'm just as involved. It's just with things you
don't hear a lot about."</TE>
<TE>   Perceiving that Jeanie was the logical choice to fill his shoes,
Jerry Buss tested her early. When Jeanie was 19 and one year into her
pursuit of a business degree at USC, her father gave her a summer
job: general manager of the Strings. He immediately told her to call
up McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, then two of the best tennis players in
the world, and get them to play a match at the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   An impossible task for a 19-year-old? "I didn't know any better,"
Jeanie recalls. "I figured, 'If Dr. Buss [she refers to him by his
preferred title] says he thinks I can do it, I must be able to do
it.' If he never doubted me, how could anyone else? It was only later
that I thought, 'What the hell was I doing?' " It took a couple of
years of being "annoying to the point of being ridiculous," as Jeanie
now concedes, but Connors and McEnroe finally agreed to the match. It
grossed $462,000, establishing a new gate-receipt record for the
Forum.</TE>
<TE>   Life was pretty good. She was a teenage executive living at
Pickfair and hanging out with her father's girlfriends. "Because they
were my age," she says, "they were girls I could relate to. We would
go to the movies and go shopping together." Jeanie married volleyball
player Steve Timmons in the spring of 1990 and moved to Italy with
him. The marriage ended in 1993. "Everybody can look back at failed
relationships," she says. "I never put my marriage first. I don't
cook. I'm not the greatest homemaker. It was always business which
attracted me."</TE>
<TE>   During her marriage, she had continued to work long-distance for
her father, in tennis as well as volleyball, roller hockey and indoor
soccer, all of the minor sports he had added to his burgeoning
empire. In 1994, Jeanie became more involved than ever in her
father's enterprises, joining the NBA hierarchy as an alternate
governor. That year, she also fulfilled a long-harbored dream to pose
in Playboy. "It was about celebrating women," she insists. "It's not
like I wanted to be naked in a magazine." Her father expressed his
mixed emotions by saying, "This is the first issue of Playboy I will
not read."</TE>
<TE>   By early 1995, as Jeanie was about to splash across the pages of
Hefner's magazine, the job of running the Forum opened up. "As your
employer, I am offering you this position," Jerry told his oldest
daughter. "But as your father, I am advising you not to take it."
Jerry was thinking of the magnitude and complexity of the job, a job
which required 12- to 14-hour days. She took the job, but the timing
was terrible. Jeanie was stepping into an important administrative
position, trying to earn the respect of her employees, and at the
same time was appearing in a skin magazine.</TE>
<TE>   She also stepped into the middle of a labor dispute involving
Forum stagehands. It got so bitter that Jeanie was advised, for
safety reasons, to stop driving her own car to work. Just down the
freeway, the nonunion Arrowhead Pond was opening up, offering lower
production costs and stiff competition for the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   She stayed on the job for four years and successfully handled the
union negotiations. "She's sharp," says Lon Rosen, an agent who has
negotiated with the Buss family over the years while representing
clients ranging from Johnson to Rambis. "She has learned the ropes.
Her dad has made her work very, very hard. People thought she wasn't
anything more than just the boss's daughter, but I've seen her grow."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in 1999, with the Lakers abandoning the Forum for Staples
Center, her father told her she was ready to take on the Lakers.
"Have you proved to yourself that you can do this?" he asked.
"Because you never had to prove it to me."</TE>
<TE>   All of her siblings say they are pleased with Jeanie's
front-and-center role. "My dad likes a system of checks and
balances," Jim says. "Jeanie has more of the administrative part. We
all have a good relationship. There's no jealousy or envy. It's very
smooth."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson spent the year between his head coaching jobs with the
Chicago Bulls and the Lakers trying to keep his 27-year marriage to
his second wife going, but it didn't work out and they are now
divorced. Jackson says he wasn't looking for a relationship when he
joined the Lakers. "It caught me off guard," he says, echoing
Jeanie's sentiment as well.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard we were talking to Phil, I said, 'That is not what
we need, another big personality around here, another big ego,' " she
says. "Fortunately, this was one time Dr. Buss didn't listen to me."
She says Jackson came into her office shortly after his arrival and
invited her to dinner. "Pretty soon," Jeanie says, "somebody I didn't
even want here became somebody I wanted to spend more and more time
with."</TE>
<TE>   Jeanie had been out to dinner with Jackson several times before
she decided it was time her father found out she was dating the man
he was paying $30 million to coach his basketball team, and who also
is 16 years her senior. "Before I met with my father," says Jeanie,
"I told [brother Jim] about Phil, knowing he would go to Dr. Buss. I
wanted him to have time to think about it, time for the shock to wear
off."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Jeanie nervously faced her father in his office. Before
she could speak, she says her father smiled and said, "I've always
thought you should date someone older, someone who would finally
appreciate you."</TE>
<TE>   What else could he say?</TE>
<TE>   Jeanie Buss and Phil Jackson ride motorcycles, play Scrabble,
travel abroad in the off-season and spend a month each year at
Jackson's cabin on Montana's Flathead Lake. When the Lakers are home,
they and the Rambises gather every day in Jeanie's El Segundo office
after the team practice, order take-out and eat with plastic forks
and knives. "We talk more at lunch as couples than at any time else,"
says Linda Rambis. Jackson says he and Jeanie "don't talk X's and
O's" but adds "she has spent a great portion of her adult life
involved in sports and she knows the territory."</TE>
<TE>   Jeanie recently bought a house next to Jackson's in Playa del Rey
and has learned not to discuss the team's performance on the drive
home from Staples Center after games. Jackson likes to pop in a jazz
CD, pull out a cigar and mellow out. If Jackson sometimes gets his
way, there are other times when Jeanie gets hers. Once, after the
huckleberry hunt, she says she insisted that Jackson take her to a
preserve near his cabin to see its captive bears. Although Jackson
dislikes the idea of seeing the animals in captivity--and refused to
even speak with the people who work there--he finally gave in and
took her.</TE>
<TE>   Will they ever marry?</TE>
<TE>   "I would very much like to get married again, but I'm not going to
put any pressure on Phil," Jeanie says. "If we don't get married,
that's OK. We have a wonderful relationship and my feelings for him
are unconditional. But whatever we do, it has to work for both of
us."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, she says, lives only for the moment. She, on the other
hand, is "committed to this job and to living in Los Angeles. I have
no idea how long he will coach, or what would satisfy his competitive
instincts if he wasn't coaching. As it is, when we play Scrabble, he
not only has to beat me, but he has to double my score. If he didn't
have basketball, he would be mean to me. I want him to coach
forever."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson seems determined to walk away from coaching when his
contract is up in three years, but he sidesteps questions about
marriage and how it might affect his future with the Lakers. "We've
kind of left that alone," he says, adding, "I may need to divorce
myself from basketball to live a normal life. It seems like I've been
doing this forever. I think I will eventually find a different arena
of competition."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers without Jackson is a jarring thought, but no less so to
Jeanie's brother Jim than the thought of the Lakers without his
father. To him, it seems his father will always be there. "I keep
forgetting he's aging," he says, "because the girls he dates never
age." But there was inevitable speculation over the future of the
Lakers ownership after Jerry suffered a pinched nerve in his neck at
a charity ball at the Beverly Hilton last month. He was taken from
the event on a stretcher, and Jeanie was angered by the questions
that followed her father's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "They were asking me, 'If anything happened to Dr. Buss, would
anything happen to the team?' " she says. "How could they ask me
that? This is my dad. Do they think the organization would go down
the drain? Do they think the house would burn down? We are business
people."</TE>

<DH>A Los Angeles Candy Maker Demystifies Marshmallows</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMELIA SALTSMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christine Moore loves the alchemy of the confectioner's art. Though
many of us give little thought to the origins of honeycomb, nougat
and butter-crunch, Moore, who owns the Little Flower Candy Company,
knows how to turn basic sugar into the delicacies she sells to
bakeries and restaurants throughout the Los Angeles area.</LD>
<LD>   Inside Moore's Mt. Washington kitchen, the sweet sounds of Elvis
and milky fragrance of caramels fill the room as stockpots, with
Taylor candy thermometers clipped to their sides, bubble away on the
stove. By 11 a.m., she has already turned out 40 pounds of vanilla,
lemon, roasted pecan, sea salt and chocolate-flavored caramels, and
is ready for her next project: marshmallows.</LD>
<LD>   The very idea that this childhood treat can be made from scratch
comes as news to many of Moore's customers. "People always ask, 'You
can make marshmallows?' " she says. "It's a novelty. Often they don't
know what it is when they first pick one up. When they realize it's a
freshly made marshmallow, they have to try it."</LD>
<TE>   Marshmallows have been around--in one form or another--for
thousands of years. Pliny, Horace, Virgil and the Bible all extolled
the virtues of the marsh mallow plant. The gummy sap from the plant's
roots was often used as an elixir for respiratory and other ailments
in ancient cultures. In fact, marsh mallow extract is still found in
herbal remedies today.</TE>
<TE>   The French created the first whipped sweet mallow confection in
the 19th century, called pate de Guimauve, which they shaped in
molds. Marshmallows were made this way until the early 20th century,
when sap was replaced by gelatin or gum Arabic, and extrusion
replaced molds in the late 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   Today, marshmallow's ingredients are considerably less mechanical:
sugar, corn syrup, water, flavoring and air. You simply soften
gelatin in water, cook the syrup without stirring until it reaches
248 degrees, pour it into the gelatin and beat the mixture until it's
glossy, thready and sticky.</TE>
<TE>   Though the initial process is easy enough, candy making is about
"hurry up and wait." It takes 30 minutes of boiling and whipping
before Moore piles the snow-white fluff into a sugar-lined pan. Then
she sets it aside to "cure," or dry out, until it's firm enough to
cut.</TE>
<TE>   From there the possibilities are limitless. Moore suggests
flavoring marshmallows with lemon or orange oil and rolling them in
tinted sugar, layering them with candied hazelnuts, dipping them in
dark chocolate and ground nuts, or piping the mixture through a
pastry tube to make your own holiday Peeps.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always loved candy," Moore says. "I grew up on James's
'cut-to-fit-the-mouth' saltwater taffy from the Jersey shore. Making
candy is magical to me." And a taste of the real thing is always
worth the effort.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marshmallows</TE>
<TE>   Makes 48</TE>
<TE>   4 packages or 4 tablespoons powdered gelatin</TE>
<TE>   3 cups granulated sugar plus 2 cups for coating</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups corn syrup</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1  1/2 cups water</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon vanilla</TE>
<TE>   Sprinkle 1 cup sugar evenly over bottom of 9-by-12-by-2-inch cake
pan and line sides with wax paper. In bowl of electric mixer, stir
gelatin into 3/4 cup of cool water and set aside to soften. In a
heavy pot, stir together corn syrup, salt, remaining  3/4 cup water
and 3 cups of sugar. Bring to a boil, uncovered, over high heat and
cook until mixture reaches firm ball stage, 248 degrees on a candy
thermometer, 10-15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Using whisk attachment with mixer running on medium, pour hot
sugar mixture in a stream into softened gelatin. Do not scrape pot.
Turn mixer to high and beat until mixture expands to nearly fill
bowl, is fluffy, glossy, pulls away from the sides, and clings to
whisk, about 15 minutes. Beat in vanilla. Pile marshmallow into
middle of prepared pan, gently pushing with spatula to edges.
Sprinkle with remaining cup of sugar. Allow marshmallow to set at
room temperature 10-12 hours. Turn out onto parchment paper, cut away
wax paper and shake excess sugar onto a plate. Cut marshmallows into
desired shapes, dipping cut sides into sugar. Store in airtight
container at room temperature.</TE>

<DH>Wayne Belger's Pinhole Camera Sculptures Put the 'Trap' in
Contraption</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURIE PIKE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't talk to Wayne Belger about the wonders of digital photography.
The didgeridoo player for the Celtic music band Wicked Tinkers knows
that old-fashioned tools are equally capable of modern artistry.
While his band uses vintage instruments and ancient Gaelic song to
propel world music into the 21st century, Belger spends his free time
applying the same concept to art photography.</LD>
<LD>   Many photographers process their own film, make their own prints,
or alter their cameras to get a special effect. Belger takes the
process further still: his made-from-scratch working pinhole cameras
themselves double as art objects.</LD>
<LD>   Five years ago, when a friend was taking photographs with a
pinhole camera, Belger noted that the apparatus looked flimsy. "The
cameras were made of foam core or wood and they had no stability,"
says Belger, who has been making art, often with found objects, for
20 years, and has shown his paintings and photos in several L.A.
galleries. Ever the tinker, Belger set out to build a more sturdy,
and artistic, pinhole camera.</LD>
<TE>   Requiring only a light-tight box, film and a small hole, pinhole
cameras are so simple that grade-school students sometimes build them
in class projects. But Belger's first camera went beyond the basics
into the sculptural realm; it was festooned with what seemed to be a
swarm of bees crawling from a keyhole on its side, and it launched
him on a new artistic track. It also gave him a place to use the
objects he collects on band tours and personal trips; pieces of
coral, hand-carved skulls, vintage photographs, surgical instruments
and insects have been collaged onto the dozen cameras Belger has
made. "I have always collected stuff to make stuff," says Belger, 38,
whose colorful Glendale apartment houses several altars and
collections of masks, musical instruments, candles and folk art.</TE>
<TE>   "Wood Camera" is a feat of construction with almost no bolts;
"Night Camera" is outfitted with two antenna-like halogen lights;
"Skull Camera" is, well, self-explanatory. Belger is working on
several new pieces, one of which will have a pneumatically powered
bellows--a low-rider pinhole, if you will. On a table in his
workroom, the sculptures look like relics from a Victorian-era
museum. Though each is different, they all put the "trap" in
contraption, often displaying animals or bugs in creepy scenarios
behind semi-cloudy plexiglass.</TE>
<TE>   Belger attributes his aesthetic to his religious background and
the fact that he often participates in Day of the Dead celebrations
in Mexico. "I was raised Catholic, and you see a lot of altars, so
that influenced me." Those ethereal dynamics also turn up in the
photographs he takes with the pinholes. One recent image shows a
woman with 4-foot wings, an effect achieved by attaching a slide of a
dragonfly to the camera while shooting. Another shows what looks like
a giant fish monster approaching a leafless tree looming from the
Salton Sea, a tableau Belger created by putting a fish head close to
the lens when pointing his camera at the landscape. Aside from
occasionally adding toner to developing solution for a sepia tone,
Belger avoids cosmetic touches. "There's no double exposure and no
post modification," he boasts. In that, his art mirrors his band's
music--a timeless format employed to make something weirdly new.</TE>

<AU>Susan Salter Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Susan Salter Reynolds' last story for the magazine was
a profile of Max Kennedy.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not that you don't love your family anymore. It's not that
you're not grateful for the roof over your head and the salary and
the dependable car. But one day it occurs to you that your life is
essentially over.</LD>
<LD>   You are now fertilizer for the next generation. You are not as
pretty as you used to be or as open or as agile or as interesting.
You will no longer have passionate escapades or romantic encounters.
Any money you used to spend on clothes will go to your children's
wardrobe.</LD>
<LD>   It's just a moment, a little whoosh of air, as your spirit leaves
your body.</LD>
<TE>   At this point there are several choices for women of a certain
age: Take a class, join a something or other, start speaking to
deities, work on the house. An affair usually requires more
self-esteem than you have at this moment.</TE>
<TE>   This is where I began the year. I needed an escape, but most of
them are marked with a big skull and crossbones. Alcohol makes you
fat. Marijuana makes you slow-witted, and besides, my husband is a
lawyer who wants to be a judge someday; blatantly illegal escapes are
out of the question.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles came to my rescue. It was Halloween, and some children
from my son's school were coming over. Most of the parents didn't
dress up, but one couple, Lohriena and J.D., looked awfully
comfortable in their vampire costumes. ''We dress this way all the
time,'' said one of the school's best PTA moms. When she smiled, you
could see her custom-made fangs gleaming.</TE>
<TE>   Lohriena wore a corset and a cape. J.D., who looks like Jesus
Christ, wore a singlet and a long wool coat. They looked as if they
were going to a party in London in 1848. I must have looked
stifled--or perhaps it was my witch costume. ''You look like you
could use a little absinthe,'' said J.D., who is prone to touching
and squeezing and hugging.</TE>
<TE>   I saw a door opening in my soul. On it was a sign with a skull and
crossbones.</TE>
<TE>   Absinthe was popular in Victorian England, especially among
members of a group that called themselves vampire Goths. In 21st
century Los Angeles, the term ''Goth'' usually conjures an image of
scruffy black-clad people who listen to heavy metal and stray into
various fetishes. They are usually young. But J.D. and Lohriena
explained that vampire Goths are usually middle-aged. They meet in
clubs; in fact J.D. and Lohriena run one called Club Noire on La
Cienega Boulevard that is open every other Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The vampire Goths of Los Angeles are a close, friendly group. They
dress up like crazy and fuss and coo over each other's clothes. They
drink absinthe (banned in the U.S. since 1912 but making a comeback
on the Internet and in underground clubs) and something called
"embalming fluid"--a mix of rum, melon liqueur, vodka and gin. They
smoke tobacco in hookahs. Frequently, there is a sadomasochistic
component to their gatherings--a show, or a room where you can go to
watch people being flogged or tied up. I'm sure that it can get very
dangerous, but to me it looked like theater.</TE>
<TE>   ''Are you just in?'' a contract lawyer asks me during a Goth
gathering at Club Makeup at the El Rey Theatre on Wilshire Boulevard.
He is wearing leather pants and a pirate shirt, and I'm sure he's
alluding to my tame dress (although I thought it was outrageous when
I first tried it on). Some of the vampires are here tonight, but the
crowd also includes men and women on leashes and the hollow-eyed,
chain-wrapped denizens of Melrose Avenue. The vampires stick
together, and I hang with the vampires.</TE>
<TE>   I arrive at Club Makeup courtesy of Lohriena, who calls herself
Lady L., and J.D. By day, he is an actor. Lady L. would rather not
say where she works, but she will admit that she ''fell in love with
the 'Addams Family' when I was a little kid.'' J.D. fell in love with
Lohriena when they met at Bar Sinister in Hollywood--our next stop.</TE>
<TE>   Lohriena wears a corset, a favorite among the vampires, and her
black cape. Both she and J.D. have fingers covered with rings and
long, curved talons (''hell on nylons''); their attire includes
custom-made fangs and yellow-green contact lenses. J.D. and Lady L.
know many people at both places (at Club Makeup we are brought
magically to the front of a line that snakes around the block), and
we are greeted with enthusiasm. These people don't air kiss. They hug
you by lifting you off the ground until your teeth rattle. I like all
the touching. No one ever touches at our dinner parties.</TE>
<TE>   Around 11 p.m., Lohriena asks if I would like to go upstairs. A
man from New Jersey who recognized me as the only other ''virgin'' in
the place had made a few tentative advances, so I decide to go
upstairs, although clearly ''going upstairs'' means more than going
upstairs. On the way up, two women are kissing so hard against the
wall that they start sliding down the stairs. At the top, a flogger
is gently whipping two women kissing in the middle of the room. When
the club closes, he tells me he is a music teacher, originally from
Iceland, a little man with round glasses. He carries his whips in a
long sports bag.</TE>
<TE>   The list of L.A. clubs that cater to the vampire Goth set includes
Addiction, Prodigy, Satellite, Stigmata, Perversion, the Dungeon, and
Cosmopolitan. Each has its heritage and its transformations. Fang
begat Antiquity, which begat Club Noire. ''This is a place where
people can come to escape, to play,'' Lady L. says of Club Noire.
''Sure, some people get stuck [in their role-playing], the young ones
we call KinderGoths, but for the most part these are sensitive,
spiritual people who don't fit in too well in the modern, plastic
world.'' It's true. I feel very safe, less judged than at the
fund-raisers we attend, more comfortable in my clothes and more at
ease with the men and women than at any party I've ever been to.</TE>
<TE>   There's a big emphasis on manners--opening doors for ladies,
commenting on appearances, all things that vanished with some
revolution or another. On one Saturday night at Club Noire there are
about 140 people of different colors and costumes, some made by hand.
There are two women in wheelchairs in full Victorian velvet and
brocade. The men are bowing and kissing and bringing drinks to their
ladies. Lloyd, a 64-year-old with a white beard and a staff who calls
himself a Druid priest, wanders through the crowd. People recline on
red couches covered in velvet. Red lights and red candles flicker
against the black walls.</TE>
<TE>   The favorite flogger of this crowd, a 26-year-old man named Gideon
in a bowler and plus fours, presides on the back patio. He is so cute
and clean-cut that I just want to go mommy on him and pinch his
cheek. He will perform a show later in the evening in which he winds
a woman completely in rope. Her name is Desiree and she wears a
flower behind her ear and holds a red rose. She does not drink. ''I
can do whatever I want to her in public,'' Gideon explains, ''as long
as it is consensual. If she drinks, that becomes questionable.''</TE>
<TE>   Lohriena asks me if I want to be flogged, but I decline. It's
enough, as they say, to know it's here.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the people at these clubs, such as Rick Friedman, say the
vampire Goths are like family. Lloyd, the Druid, adds: ''I'm treated
with consideration and respect here, and that's more than I can say
of the outside world.'' William Studor, dressed in full pirate
regalia, says the Goth lifestyle ''is very open and friendly,
pleasing and comforting.''</TE>
<TE>   I haven't been back but I think I could walk into Club Noire at
any time and feel that I had comfortably stepped outside my life.
Usually this involves risks that people with young children and jobs
are afraid to make. That's not the case here.</TE>
<TE>   A.A. Milne wrote a poem called ''James Morrison's Mother,'' in
which young James admonishes his mum never to go to the end of town
without him. Sure enough, one dark day:</TE>
<TE>   James James</TE>
<TE>   Morrison's Mother</TE>
<TE>   Put on her golden gown.</TE>
<TE>   James James Morrison's Mother</TE>
<TE>   Drove to the end of town.</TE>
<TE>   James James Morrison's Mother</TE>
<TE>   Said to herself, said she:</TE>
<TE>   ''I can get right down</TE>
<TE>   to the end of the town</TE>
<TE>   and be back in time for tea.''</TE>
<TE>   Of course, she does not reappear.</TE>
<TE>   James James</TE>
<TE>   Morrison's Mother</TE>
<TE>   Hasn't been heard of since.</TE>
<TE>   King John said he was sorry,</TE>
<TE>   So did the Queen and the Prince.</TE>
<TE>   King John</TE>
<TE>   (Somebody told me)</TE>
<TE>   Said to a man he knew:</TE>
<TE>   If people go down to the end of the town, well,</TE>
<TE>   what can anyone do?</TE>
<TE>   A night in Club Noire makes me feel like James Morrison's mother.
Give me a glass of absinthe and send me back in time. That's all the
escape I need. For now.</TE>

<HD>How a Self-Help Guru Is Born</HD>
<DH>Once Depressed, Overweight and Volatile, Byron Katie Awoke
One Morning to the Sensation of a Cockroach Walking Across Her
Foot--and Found Herself Transformed By</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Allison Adato</AU>
<BD>Allison Adato last wrote for the magazine about actor
and producer Rob Reiner's efforts on behalf of the California
Children and Families Commission.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two questions in the interview consume me. Although being a reporter
gives one license to ask just about anything, these two questions
knock around my head, unable to escape my mouth. The first feels
superficial, but I have to know: How does this woman achieve such
perfect fingernails? They are natural, unadorned, tapered to
exquisite ovals. The second question would make me appear uninformed.
For some time now I have been talking to her, to others about her,
and observing her at work. Yet still I want to ask, "What is it you
do exactly?" Finally I blurt out a wimpy, deflected substitute: "When
people ask you what you do, what do you tell them?"</LD>
<LD>   The woman fixes her aquamarine eyes on me, smiles and says, "I
clear people's minds." She illustrates the statement with a flick of
those fingernails, as if brushing crumbs from a tablecloth.</LD>
<TE>   Since 1992, Byron Katie, 59, has traveled the world clearing minds
en masse. She is not a therapist, a counselor or a religious leader,
though her work--which she simply calls "The Work"--suggests elements
of all these professions. She gives an average of three free
workshops per month, teaching people her method to end emotional
suffering. She instructs them to write down their troublesome
thoughts: My mother should love me more. My wife shouldn't cheat on
me. I need to lose weight. Then they apply to each thought the
following four questions: Is it true or can I really know that it's
true? How do I react when I think that thought? Can I find one
peaceful reason to believe that thought? Who would I be without the
thought? She then engages what she calls "the turnaround," flipping
those initial statements to see if their opposites don't feel
equally, if not more, true: I should love my mother more. I shouldn't
cheat on myself. I don't need to lose weight.</TE>
<TE>   Resting on this minimalist method of inquiry and linguistic
reversals, her philosophy can be used, say proponents, to overcome
troubled family relationships, problems at work, even the trauma of
rape or the grief of losing a loved one to terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   While Katie is tentative about saying that her method is for
everyone, the promotional literature for The Work isn't shy about
making claims. Her intensive school, which she holds in various
places around the country, is billed as "not only a way to find
freedom, it's a fast way. In just over a week, the school changes
lives radically and permanently."</TE>
<TE>   The number of people who attest to this statement is growing. Over
the course of a decade, The Work has spread from Katie's hometown of
Barstow and spawned both a nonprofit organization (The Work
Foundation) and a for-profit branch, Byron Katie International, which
has ocean-view offices in Manhattan Beach and an outpost in the
Netherlands. It is accepted as continuing education units for social
workers, nurses and marriage counselors by those professions'
respective governing organizations. Her ideas also are spreading
through the sale of videotapes, audiotapes and a Web site that is
translated into languages including Italian, Dutch, German, French,
Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish and Macedonian. In California, she has
garnered an eclectic celebrity fan base that she says ranges from
actor Richard Chamberlain to the anger-rock bands Slipknot and Korn.
She has held private workshops for donors such as Norman Lear's wife,
Lyn, who introduced The Work to 50 women friends, and former Warner
Bros. Records exec Jeff Gold, who shared it with his industry pals.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, Harmony Books--an early publisher of Deepak
Chopra--released Katie's "Loving What Is: Four Questions That Can
Change Your Life," which booksellers could display somewhere between
"self-help" and "New Age." The book is a collaboration with author
Stephen Mitchell, whose own works have topped the spirituality list.
Mitchell, 59, is a translator of religious texts from the "Bhagavad
Gita" to the "Tao Te Ching" to "Genesis." A widely respected
pan-religious scholar, he might be a good person to assess the rise
of Byron Katie--were he not her collaborator and her husband of the
last 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   The word "guru" comes to mind. But, says Mitchell, "Gurus are a
dime a dozen. There are people saying, 'Live in the now' or 'There
really are no problems.' It's nothing like what Katie's doing."</TE>
<TE>   So what is she doing? And how does a woman with no psychological,
theological, spiritual or therapeutic training, and who once earned
her living as a landlady, get taken seriously as a self-help
authority?</TE>
<TE>   It helps, for starters, to have a cockroach walk across your foot.</TE>
<TE>   From Aimee Semple MacPherson to Ram Dass to Marianne Williamson,
California has attracted gurus like medflies. But Barstow, the Mojave
desert town where Byron Kathleen Reid spent much of her youth, was a
virtual woo-woo-free zone. Raised by a housewife and a train
engineer, Katie grew up to be a fairly unhappy woman. As she tells
it, by the time she was 43 in February 1986, her life had hit a nadir
of hopelessness. What happened between then and now is an oft-alluded
to but little-probed story in Byron Katie circles.</TE>
<TE>   Every religion has its founding myth. All gurus have a saga of how
they came to know something from which the rest of us could benefit.
Who would buy Richard Simmons' "Deal-A-Meals" if he couldn't credibly
point to his own struggles with food? Katie's story appears in
abbreviated form in her book. Quizzed on many of its particulars, she
is at first cordially hazy.</TE>
<TE>   This is what her friends and family confirm: In 1986 Katie was a
mother of three, on her second marriage and had spent a decade
falling into depression, agoraphobia, overeating and addiction to
codeine and alcohol. They say she rarely left her bed and grew so
paranoid that she sometimes slept with a loaded gun under her bed.</TE>
<TE>   "She was probably one of the saddest, angriest people I've ever
known," recalls her daughter, Roxann Burroughs, who was 16 at the
time. Her sons, then ages 18 and 23, had moved out of the house. "She
was very closed up and volatile," says her eldest son, Bob Robinson.
"Her mood swings were incredible. She came down on me with a lot more
intensity than the other two siblings."</TE>
<TE>   Katie desperately needed help, but the idea of seeing a therapist
or even a religious or spiritual advisor didn't square with her
upbringing. "We're like Barstow desert people," explains Burroughs,
who still lives in the Mojave, where she and her husband own a
construction business. "We didn't know about therapy or 12-step. So
Mom stayed in bed, and we ordered pizza and watched TV."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Katie says, she called her insurance company, which
referred her to Hope House, a Los Angeles residential treatment
center for women with eating disorders that has since closed. While
there, she slept in the attic because the other residents were afraid
of her. "It was run like a home with a house mother, so there was
some democracy," recalls Pat Scales, who was a therapist at Hope
House but did not live on the premises. "I remember that she was very
emotional, both with anger and with tears. When she came into my
group, she was so emotionally fragmented there didn't seem to be a
self there, which is not the case with most people with eating
disorders. They're fairly functional. She could easily have scared
people."</TE>
<TE>   Less than two weeks into her stay, Katie says she awoke one
morning to the sensation of a cockroach crawling across her foot. She
opened her eyes and, she explains in her book, "It was as if
something else had woken up. It opened its eyes. It was looking
through Katie's eyes ... it was intoxicated with joy." At that
moment, she claims, the four questions appeared in her consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Applying the questions to her life, she challenged long-held
beliefs, such as "my children should respect me," and felt her
emotional suffering lift.</TE>
<TE>   Scales says that she had never seen anything like it in a therapy
setting.  "There was definitely a personality shift," she says. "I
was on a spiritual path at the time. I recognized that something
rather extraordinary had happened to her. She wasn't the same crazy
person that she had been the day before."</TE>
<TE>   "It was like they dropped off a completely different person--the
most innocent, sweetest child you've ever seen," Burroughs says.
"There just aren't programs that produce a different person." Katie's
son Ross Robinson adds, "She seemed like an alien to me."</TE>
<TE>   Katie attributes this difference to waking without memories. She
claims not to have recognized even her own husband and kids at first.
She also forgot conventions of contemporary life. "She would walk out
the door in pajamas," says Burroughs. "I'd say, 'You can't go out in
pajamas,' so she would change. She did it for me."</TE>
<TE>   There were other changes. She dropped 75 pounds. She says she
found that if she ate meat, her tongue spontaneously bled in a stripe
down the center. She meditated, sitting stone-still for hours a day
and perplexing her family.</TE>
<TE>   "I am one of the most down-to-earth, flat-footed people ever, so I
had a really hard time with it," Burroughs says. "We knew nothing of
Buddhism, Hinduism. I thought you were straight-up weird if you
meditated. I'd look at her and think, 'What is she doing?' I went
with the idea that she had had a nervous breakdown."</TE>
<TE>   Katie began taking long walks to rediscover Barstow. On these
walks she would embrace strangers. While some were put off by her
guileless approaches, others saw in her a peace that they wanted for
themselves. "People from the street, people I'd meet in stores,"
Katie says.</TE>
<TE>   "They would say, 'There are names for people like you. You're
self-realized. You're a mystic.'</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say, 'I'm a married woman with three children.'</TE>
<TE>   "And they would say, 'No, no, there's something else.' "</TE>
<TE>   Unable to offer them advice, Katie invited people home to observe
how she lived. The first was a depressed man she remembers only as
Jim, who saw Katie as his potential salvation. She showed Jim and the
others what she did when she had a problem: She wrote it down and
asked her four questions.</TE>
<TE>   Soon she was like that family in New Jersey whose home drew
reverent pilgrims to see a tablecloth with a spaghetti sauce stain
that looked like the Virgin Mary. Dozens, and eventually hundreds,
came to be with Katie. They stayed for hours or called in the middle
of the night. Some believed that she was healing them, though she
insisted that they were healing themselves. Some wanted to turn her
home into an ashram.</TE>
<TE>   These developments, as well as Katie's personality shift, would
prove taxing on her marriage. She and her second husband separated.
As her son Bob, a foreman supervisor, remembers, "We thought it was
crazy. She started caring for other people as much as she did her own
family. We had all these ragamuffins, street people in the house. But
we learned about others through her and became more tolerant of
society." Once skeptics, her children now embrace The Work to varying
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Word of mouth about her living room gatherings led to an
invitation to appear before a small group, composed mainly of
psychologists and therapists near Berkeley, Katie says. She recalls
the experience as "very odd. I was just this woman from Barstow. They
knew things that I had no concept of yet." But the professionals
wanted insight into Katie's practice. Answering their questions
provided a format for her traveling workshops. "That was probably the
real beginning of The Work," says Judith Avalon, who attended that
first gathering. Katie had been "ungroomed as far as doing retreat
work. But we were fascinated by her story and her power to shift
people." The experience also provided Katie with a mandate for
deciding with whom she would share The Work: Only those who ask. She
would not evangelize.</TE>
<TE>   Today Katie's schedule remains largely determined by request. If
she is asked to bring The Work to a prison in Texas, as she was in
1996, she goes. If they want to hear her in Germany again, she
returns.</TE>
<TE>   By the early '90s, the workshops began to look much as they do
now. At a Marin County appearance in 1995, Larkspur doctor Kevin
Maher, now a close Katie friend, saw her for the first time. In that
part of the state, he says, "You were used to seeing these
neo-bohemian Marinites who had been to India and declared themselves
enlightened beings. Katie shows up looking like Dolly Parton and
Tammy Faye Bakker. She had no idea of enlightenment or the
vocabulary."</TE>
<TE>   Today Katie no longer looks or sounds like a Barstow housewife.
Her flowing clothes, usually in black or earth tones, suggest a
well-tailored Jedi knight. Her personality has evolved into a
compelling set of contradictions. She retains a fair amount of earthy
pragmatism, yet occasionally refers to herself in the otherworldly
third person. She has been called a Bodhisattva--an enlightened being
who selflessly delays nirvana to assist others--but this has fostered
in her no curiosity about Buddhism or any other religion; she has not
read her husband's books on the subject. She rejects such lofty
labels, but sits quietly as Mitchell expounds on her awakening.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know of an instance of this happening to another human
being," he says. "It's like if you took psychosis or amnesia as a
negative and printed it as a positive photograph."</TE>
<TE>   Unavoidably, she has grown fluent in the language of the New Age
movement. She has refined her ideas into sampler-ready sound bites:
"Arguing with what is is like teaching a cat to bark. Hopeless."
Mitchell has anthologized them in a pamphlet available at Katie's
workshops. Attendees also can buy her tapes, videos, mugs, backpacks
or a $76 fleece jacket with her logo (a heart made of arrows pointing
inward). Revenue from these items goes to Byron Katie International,
not the nonprofit foundation.</TE>
<TE>   At the workshops, scented candles burn as you enter and music is
playing, something affirming such as John Lennon's "Imagine," Alanis
Morissette's "Thank U" or an original composition called "The Work
Rap: No Decision, No Fear." A typical program begins with a volunteer
from the crowd sitting in a chair opposite Katie onstage, a box of
Kleenex between them. All of her events are videotaped and the
volunteers are miked. Katie is introduced with no mention of her
spiritual resume. (Throughout the evening, she rarely alludes to her
past except to empathize. To a woman enduring power struggles with
her kids, Katie offers, "I know. My religion used to be 'pick up your
socks.' ") She starts by asking the volunteer to read his or her
answers to questions on a printed worksheet. "OK, sweetheart," Katie
says. "Do you really want to know the truth? Let's hear No. 1.... "</TE>
<TE>   Though she calls everyone "sweetheart" or "honey," there is little
coddling. Asking someone if the deeply held stories about them are
true requires a bluntness almost incongruous with Katie's Zsa
Zsa-meets-Deepak demeanor. At its most effective, her method can cut
through years of self-delusion and rationalizations; it leaves some
participants in tears of recognition. Many wrestle with Katie's
frequently repeated statement that she loves reality, whatever it
brings, because reality is "kinder than our stories."</TE>
<TE>   "I have a hard time with the passivity--what comes to you, be
happy about it," says Nancy, a Los Angeles lawyer who asked that her
last name not be used. She has been in the chair twice, and the first
time she spoke about losing her mother. "I needed God to put a mother
figure in my life. Katie turned it around: 'You be the mother figure.
It's not God's responsibility to give you that,' " says Nancy. "It
feels hokey. It ticks you off. But it returns the power to you."</TE>
<TE>   Marion Jacobs is a clinical psychologist who has studied self-help
groups. She is not familiar with The Work, although when it is
explained to her, Jacobs suggests it is similar in some ways to
traditional therapy. Katie's first two questions, says Jacobs, "are
fundamental to cognitive behavioral therapy. Then she makes the
connection between thoughts and feelings--any therapist is going to
do that. Finally, she's asking a person to use imagery to see what
would change them. Nothing in there that's new."</TE>
<TE>   While Jacobs isn't troubled by Katie's ideas, the format does
raise questions. "If she just got up and gave a sermon, you could
listen and decide where it fits in your life. But she's working with
people individually. When you do that, you're walking a fuzzy line of
what is therapy."</TE>
<TE>   In 1999 the California Board of Psychology raised that issue after
listening to a tape of Katie working with an incest survivor. Katie
says the board wanted to know what would happen if she were hosting a
session elsewhere and the woman subsequently had a breakdown. Katie
argued that the woman's emotional state after the dialogue was her
own responsibility, just as it had been before they met. Ultimately,
with no finding that she was practicing psychotherapy, the
investigation was dropped. As a matter of policy, the board would not
comment for this story or release records.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Smith, a self-described "Byron Katie groupie," drove up from
San Diego to hear Katie in L.A. She also has attended the five-day
"New Year's Cleanse," held at a summer camp in Malibu. Smith, an
ebullient woman who first used The Work to explore her struggle with
overeating, says that the only thing that concerned her going into
the Cleanse was the juice fast. The what?</TE>
<TE>   "I brought cheese and crackers--I was sure I wasn't going to make
it," she says, adding proudly that she existed for three days on
watermelon, beet, lemon, apple and cucumber juices and miso broth.</TE>
<TE>   Katie explains the reasons for relying on juice: "You take away
people's chewing and their mind goes nuts, they start getting angry,
feeling like little children. They feel deprived. It gets really
radical and that's what I want." She says she went through the same
changes in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   Using anger and deprivation is a rarely discussed element of The
Work. I ask if there are any other physical elements to the program.
"No sex, please," says Katie, smiling but serious. "We separate
husbands and wives so they can focus on their thoughts about that.
They don't have to, we just suggest it."</TE>
<TE>   It is virtually impossible to find a Byron Katie critic at a Byron
Katie event. (She more frequently attracts what one volunteer dubs
"Bliss Ninnies.") On three occasions I lurked in the parking lot,
trying to catch people leaving early. At an East Hampton, N.Y.,
workshop, two women emerge before the break, talking and laughing.
Perhaps they found it all too funny, possibly ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, no," one insists. "We love Katie. But we have dinner
reservations." Where, I wonder, are the skeptics?</TE>
<TE>   In Altadena, Calif., as it turns out.</TE>
<TE>   I call the Skeptics Society, a watchdog group that challenges
bogus science. They have not heard of Katie, so I run through the
four questions. "I like that fourth one," says Pat Linse, a Society
co-founder. I try to rile Linse's skeptical side: What about Katie's
lack of training? What about presenting The Work as a charity? What
about the mugs?</TE>
<TE>   "They are supporting themselves," she reasons. "We don't fault
people for making money."</TE>
<TE>   "Her Jaguar was a gift," Roxann Burroughs says, aware that seeing
a quasi-spiritual self-help authority roll up in a Jaguar sends up a
red flag with some people. The car was bought by Katie's son Ross, a
successful record producer who credits The Work with greatly
improving his life.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the depths of her depression, Katie says that she was
always able to make money. Byron Katie International now has a paid
staff of seven, and Katie receives an annual salary of $120,000.
Aside from the free public appearances, Katie charges $250 plus
accommodations for the Cleanse and $1,800 to $3,000 for the school,
plus room and board. "We're not trying to build anything, we're just
trying to meet the call," she says. "I don't have any ambition. I'm a
woman without a future."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Bernstein, director of Byron Katie International, is a bit
more focused than his boss, who doesn't seek out forums for sharing
The Work. "I'm pushing it," Bernstein says. "We don't just answer
phone calls. It's not as passive as it seems. We have a product: four
questions, and a spokesperson: Katie. It moves the way any product
moves, whether it's Nike sneakers or anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Katie plans to continue sharing The Work as long as people ask for
it and she is able. Still, she is preparing for the day when she
isn't. Hundreds of graduates of her school now lead groups of their
own, and her book will eventually reach many more people than her
workshops can. Although her wise pixie face twinkles on the book's
cover, Katie feels that the questions, and not the woman behind them,
are what's worth promoting. But her undeniable charisma is a selling
point. She plays down the import of discussing her awakening, yet she
and Mitchell already are at work on her autobiography. An early draft
suggests it will delve into Katie's cockroach moment, which otherwise
has been excised from her literature.</TE>
<TE>   "The cosmic side of things is a big stumbling block for a lot of
people," says Jeff Gold, who is now on the board of The Work. "It's a
stumbling block for me, but who am I to say it didn't happen? She is
clear in claiming to not be enlightened, but I think they were smart
to keep it out of the first book."</TE>
<TE>   Like many Byron Katie fans, Gold finds her practice useful
regardless of its origins, which is handy, since trying to confirm
the more incredible elements of her story is like looking for the
footprints where Jesus walked on water. Why have some of the key
people and places in her story been lost to history? Why didn't she
ever get a doctor to look at that bleeding tongue? (Her answer: "It
was beautiful, a stripe of red. It didn't hurt.")</TE>
<TE>   With Mitchell conveniently nearby whenever Katie and I sit down to
talk, posing the question about how new religions are born is
irresistible. Is it possible that, generations hence, the story of a
woman with little education, suffering from acute depression and
spontaneously becoming a charismatic teacher will be an article of
some new faith?</TE>
<TE>   "If we're lucky, people will have forgotten all of that, because
it's not about her, it's about The Work," says Mitchell. Still, he
will allow that "this kind of radical questioning is in the lineage
of the great spiritual traditions. The 'inquiry' is in Buddhist
traditions and my own Jewish tradition, from the book of Job to
Spinoza." He won't go so far, however, as to say that they are
actively trying to put a new brand of spirituality on the map. "I've
never heard Katie say, 'I have the truth.' It's not like that. It's
not a doctrine," he says. "She doesn't want to spread the word. She
doesn't want a following."</TE>
<TE>   The Work's simplicity is seductive, as is Katie's apparent
happiness. Her calm acceptance of reality is as enviable as those
unbreakable fingernails. I wonder if a mere mortal can achieve either
trait.</TE>
<TE>   One day, Mitchell, Katie and I go to lunch. The restaurant we
choose has a half-hour wait for a table, so we walk to another place.
Katie is pleased: This other restaurant is the right one. No
disappointment, because she always loves what happens. When Katie's
salad arrives, she tastes the vinaigrette and crinkles her nose. She
calls the waiter. Seeming like a gal from Barstow, she asks, "Could I
have some ranch dressing?"</TE>
<TE>   It is a relief to see even this little glimpse of desire in her.
Sometimes getting what one wants tastes even sweeter than accepting
what is.</TE>

<DH>British Author Michael Morpurgo's Books for Children Pose
Questions Rather Than Answer Them. Does His Success Blending History
and Harsh Reality Suggest Kids Don't Always Need Happy Endings?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>Marjorie Miller is the foreign editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a day of milking cows and shoveling manure, three dozen
fifth-graders dressed in fleece pajamas and terry robes clamber into
the living room of Michael Morpurgo's Devon farmhouse for a bedtime
story. The British author pulls out a volume that he says they cannot
possibly have read because it isn't published yet, and the students
smile with delight. Not only have they escaped their parents and
school for a week in his "Farms for City Children" program, but they
are about to get a preview of a Morpurgo book, which makes them
terribly cool.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the best title of any book I have written--'Cool!' "
Morpurgo tells the 10- and 11-year-olds seated on the carpet by a
Victorian fireplace. "It's a word I really, really hate that my
granddaughters use all the time: cool."</LD>
<LD>   The children giggle, knowing that they, too, abuse the word. They
settle down quickly, however, when they hear that "Cool!" is not a
breezy, upbeat book, but the story of a boy who has fallen into a
coma after being hit by a car. Robbie Ainsley can hear his parents
and friends trying desperately to draw him out, but he is unable to
speak or to move. He cannot acknowledge their declarations of love
and friendship or reciprocate them. He can't even utter his usual
seal of approval--cool.</LD>
<TE>   "My stepfather died last year and before he died, he was in a
coma," Morpurgo tells his audience. "I used to just sit by his bed in
the hospital until one day the doctor told me to talk to him. I said,
'What's the point?' and he said that we don't know, but that enough
people have woken up after a long coma and said they had heard people
talking to them. I tried but he died several months later."</TE>
<TE>   The experience, however, gave Morpurgo the idea for the book about
a boy locked in a coma with his thoughts. "It's what it is like to be
inside of his head," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Morpurgo, the 58-year-old author of more than 90 children's books,
often takes his readers "inside the head" of people whom they would
not ordinarily meet, and to places they would not normally go. He is
a teller of ancient tales and an adventure writer who
matter-of-factly addresses difficult subjects such as sickness and
death. "Waiting for Anya" is the story of an occupied French
village's efforts to smuggle Jewish children across the border to
safety in Spain during World War II. "The War of Jenkins' Ear"
examines faith and superstition through the boarding school
friendship between a young boy and an older student claiming to be
Jesus Christ. And in "The Ghost of Grania O'Malley," a girl grapples
with cerebral palsy while her cousin confronts his own father's
life-threatening illness.</TE>
<TE>   With the first chapter of "Cool!," Morpurgo's bedtime audience is
spellbound by a mixture of humor and drama, by references to Dr.
Smelly Breath and the more serious thoughts of a boy who can't move
his body. "I remember thinking in the ambulance, 'Maybe I am dead,' "
Morpurgo reads in a convincingly boyish voice. He pauses at the end
of the chapter, then teases, "Do you want another chapter?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes-s-s," the kids cry in unison. They're hooked.</TE>
<TE>   In an age when J.K. Rowling novels dominate bestseller lists by
plunging young readers into fantastic realms, Morpurgo continues to
infuse his books with what some consider inappropriate in children's
literature--geography, history and large doses of reality. He
believes children are simply small adults, less experienced but no
less intelligent than grown-ups, who should be exposed to life's
difficulties along with its pleasures.</TE>
<TE>   He is not alone in this. His compatriot Jacqueline Wilson does it
as well, and sometimes with more emotional depth. But besides
offering up reality, Morpurgo immerses readers in stories that draw
from the past. Characters such as Joan of Arc and King Arthur figure
prominently in his works, which he has set against the Spanish Civil
War, World Wars I and II and the Irish potato famine.</TE>
<TE>   His "War Horse" is about an animal that leaves the farm to join
the British cavalry in World War I only to be captured by the enemy.
In "Twist of Gold," an Irish brother and sister bid their starving
mother goodbye to search for their father, who has gone to America
looking for work. And the compelling hero of "Kensuke's Kingdom," due
to be published in the United States by Scholastic Press next spring,
is a Japanese survivor of the U.S. atomic bombing of Nagasaki during
WWII.</TE>
<TE>   These are some of the books that have made Morpurgo a best-selling
author in Britain, where he began his professional life as a primary
and middle school teacher and discovered all too quickly how most
children tuned out in the classroom. He started telling tales in an
effort to inspire his students, then wrote them down and eventually
published them. The death of his father-in-law, Penguin Books founder
Sir Allen Lane, more than a quarter century ago left Morpurgo's wife,
Clare, with an inheritance and the couple with an opportunity to "put
their money where their mouth was" to enrich the lives of children.
They founded the "Farms for City Children" charity, which now brings
about 3,000 underprivileged kids to farms each year in Devon,
southwest of London, in Gloucestershire and Wales for a hands-on
experience with rural life. (The Morpurgos also have supported a U.S.
branch of the program in Vermont.) For many of the city kids, it is
their first exposure to hedgerows and wild daffodils, their first
encounter with farm animals.</TE>
<TE>   That was the case for 11-year-old Elliott Debell, who visited
Morpurgo's Nethercott Farm in Iddesleigh with his classmates from
London's Ruislip Gardens primary school. Grooming a horse on a misty
morning, Debell gleefully recounts his experiences. "Yesterday we
cleaned out a massive yard of cow poo, and it was all soggy because
it had rained."</TE>
<TE>   Debell is equally enthusiastic about the author's books. "I've got
four of them. I like it when it's real and he describes things around
him. Tom, that's one of the workers on the farm, he used that name in
'War Horse.' "</TE>
<TE>   Morpurgo, a father of three and grandfather of six, is passionate
on the subject of history. He loves to tell of the time "War Horse"
was short-listed for Britain's prestigious Whitbread Prize in 1982
but failed to win. The celebrated author Roald Dahl, who was one of
the judges, explained to Morpurgo, "Children really don't like
history."</TE>
<TE>   With more than 60 books in print (some of the "early rubbish" has
been put to rest, he says) and translations in at least 20 languages,
Morpurgo makes a strong case that history sells. "History is as much
a fantasy world as other fantasies. We haven't looked at it, we have
to imagine it. It's just that we have the geography, the time, the
place there, so we can use this as the backdrop of whatever drama
we're going to create," he says.</TE>
<TE>   His books have never been as popular in the United States as they
are in Britain, but Morpurgo argues that last year's Sept. 11 attacks
highlight the need for children everywhere to learn about foreign
people and places. They need to be transported to different times and
exposed to other cultures if they hope to understand the world.</TE>
<TE>   If an English child reads "Toro Toro," his book set in the Spanish
Civil War, Morpurgo says the child will discover that Spain has a
history. "Every country is pretty much the same, but the English
and--I have to say it--the Americans specialize in focusing on
[themselves], and we see the world as Anglo-Saxon-centric. It doesn't
matter how often people tell us it isn't, how many bombs people throw
out to show us that it isn't, we still go on with this nonsense."</TE>
<TE>   Germany and France, Morpurgo notes, are keen to publish foreign
authors. Foreign books make up half the list of his French publisher,
Gallimard Jeunesse, he says. "French kids read stories from all over
the world, in circumstances from all over the world. The equivalent
list in England has about 3% foreign." But most countries are
reluctant to confront their own dark chapters of history. Even France
was initially reluctant to publish his book on its controversial
national saint, Joan of Arc, and publishers in Spain have apparently
passed on his "Toro Toro," set against the fascists' bombing of the
village of Sauceda in 1936.</TE>
<TE>   "Joan is this right-wing fascist symbol in France. I didn't know
it when I was writing the book, and when I presented it to my French
publishers, they said, 'What have you done? We can't publish this, it
would look like [ultra-right politician Jean-Marie] Le Pen.' And I
said, 'What are you talking about? It's Joan of Arc, nothing to do
with Le Pen.' "</TE>
<TE>   The French published the book in the end, but "Toro Toro" has yet
to see print in Spain. "The Spanish thing is different because it's a
hidden history, isn't it? They don't like talking about it. It's
recent, it's hurtful."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Morpurgo says he had difficulty finding a U.S.
publisher for what is arguably his best book yet, "Kensuke's
Kingdom." This is Morpurgo's "Robinson Crusoe," the tale of a
12-year-old British boy who is washed overboard while on his family's
sailboat and ends up on a Pacific island.</TE>
<TE>   "I disappeared on the night before my 12th birthday," the account
of the boy's odyssey begins. Alone and hungry, he braces for death
until he awakens on the island to find that a bowl of fresh water and
plate of fish have been left for him. Later, he meets Kensuke, a
former doctor in the Japanese navy who survived the atomic bomb and
sought refuge from a horrible world on the deserted island. The two
develop a deep friendship.</TE>
<TE>   Penguin Putnam, which had published other Morpurgo books, turned
"Kensuke's Kingdom" down, he says. "They'd been very keen on my stuff
and published everything and then all of a sudden I put this book in
front of them and they said, 'This is not what you usually do.' So I
said, 'Why should anything be what you usually do?' They were trying
to say something else, but weren't actually telling me what it was."</TE>
<TE>   After three or four publishers rejected the book, Morpurgo
confronted one of them and was told that the problem was that he had
implied that Americans were pleased about the bombing of Nagasaki, in
which an estimated 80,000 Japanese died.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Yes, and so were the British at the time, because it
saved millions of lives and everyone thought, "Good, the bloody war's
over." ' What I didn't know, I suppose, was that the Americans [are]
still sensitive about the atom bomb. But we've got to confront these
things. Just as Spaniards have to confront their fascist interlude
and the bitterness that went on, and we [Britons] have to confront
what we've done in Ireland for 500 years."</TE>
<TE>   Children should not be shielded from history, Morpurgo insists,
and Scholastic Press apparently agrees, having accepted the book for
publication. Elizabeth Szabla, editorial director of Scholastic in
New York, says the historical backdrop of the story was never a
drawback. "For me, 'Kensuke's Kingdom' was a perfect blend of
adventure, with its many details of survival, and introspection as
Michael [the central character] is forced to grow up quickly and
explore a friendship," Szabla says. "I believe our audience knows
this story [of the atomic bomb]. I hope so. Even if they have a vague
idea, I hope it spurs them to explore it more. I applaud this vehicle
for exploring that part of our history." Although it is not an
American book, the publishing house intends to bring it out next
March, in time for Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in May, to
draw attention to the subject matter.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Morpurgo's experience with "Kensuke's Kingdom" has
left him disappointed with the publishing industry. He acknowledges
that the Irish potato famine and World War II may not be as sexy as a
wizardry school, but he believes it is the duty of writers and
publishers to help young people develop an understanding of different
cultures. Morpurgo is earnest when he talks about this, but not
bitter. He even laughs when giving an example of how his American
editors wanted to change details in "Kensuke's Kingdom" to suit an
American audience. While still traveling with his family, Michael
stops in Brazil to play soccer on the beach with local boys, whose
only English words are "Manchester United." Morpurgo's editor wanted
to change the game to American football. "People have to grasp the
fact that this is an English child and that there are English points
of reference. Kids all over America play soccer. They aren't dumb."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Morpurgo adds, "I think children have a wonderful
ability to make imaginative leaps, and if you can catch them early
enough with other people's stories, they are going to become
interested in other people. Once you're interested in other people,
you will not despise them, you will not patronize them, you will
think of them as like you but different. And you'll learn from them,
as well."</TE>
<TE>   As he has defied skeptics by writing about history, Morpurgo also
writes stories that do not always turn out happily. "Waiting for
Anya," in particular, ends on a bittersweet note that comes as a
shock to some readers, but which Morpurgo says is an accurate
reflection of history. "I'm not so keen on what I call 'easy
redemption' in stories," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Maryam Alsop, a Ridgewood, N.J., mother who discovered Morpurgo's
work while living in London, says books such as this one and even
"Kensuke's Kingdom" are "too dark" for her 9-year-old daughter. "It's
beautiful writing, but the subject matter is a bit much for her. The
aloneness, being all by yourself marooned on an island, it's scary. I
think she projects and sees herself there. She won't be able to
sleep. She'll worry and wonder, 'Does this really happen?' "</TE>
<TE>   Morpurgo says he does not seek out the dark side of life, but
tries to portray the blend of blacks, whites and grays. He wants
children to understand that life is sweet and sour and usually does
not offer up easy solutions. "So I don't wish to answer questions
when I write a book," he says, "I wish to pose questions.''</TE>
<TE>   But Morpurgo does answer questions for his pajama-clad audience.
While "Farms for City Children" offers kids a valuable rural
experience, it provides Morpurgo a constant supply of material for
his child characters and an ever-ready sounding board for new
material. Morpurgo clearly likes children, respects them and knows
how to talk with them.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the difference between them and us? They have less
experience, less years, that's it. They're as bright as we are,
definitely as bright as we are, as perceptive, and the other thing
they have which we don't have is a wonderful freshness of
approach--we've done so much before and we're coming at it again. I
do feed on that, in that things they say and do endlessly come into
my books. I'm a terrible robber."</TE>
<TE>   It would be hard not to, as the kids are quick and charming. After
his reading of "Cool!," their hands fly into the air like fireworks.
Their questions come fast: "What's your favorite book you've written
so far?" one student asks. "How long have you been writing for?" asks
another. "Do you enjoy writing more than reading?" "Where do you get
all of your brilliant ideas from?"</TE>
<TE>   "You lovely person," Morpurgo responds to the last. The ideas are
ordinary, not brilliant, he says, but he tries to weave them together
in new and interesting ways. The children wave their hands in a
pick-me, pick-me frenzy, but are polite and do not shout out their
questions before he points to them.</TE>
<TE>   "When you were young, did you want to be famous?" a boy asks.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was young, being famous was not something you thought
about. Now you do because of TV. I wanted to play rugby for England,
but I didn't want to be famous. I didn't want it and I don't want it
now," he says.</TE>
<TE>   There are a handful of famous writers, he says, but most authors
enjoy "quiet fame. People may know your name, but you can walk down
the street."</TE>
<TE>   "What would you do if [another] writer nicks your ideas?" another
boy asks.</TE>
<TE>   "An original idea is almost impossible," Morpurgo says,
acknowledging that "Kensuke's Kingdom" bears similarities to
"Robinson Crusoe." "In a sense you could say I pinched the idea. But
everybody who writes has pinched something from someone. You take an
idea and make it your own." But, he cautions, now is probably not a
good time to write about a boy wizard at boarding school.</TE>
<TE>   As the hour grows late, the queries become increasingly
sophisticated. "Do you ever have any doubts about a book?" asks a
questioner.</TE>
<TE>   "All the time. It's like when you're running a race. When you get
past the middle, you have no more doubts, but up to the middle, you
doubt you'll get over the hill."</TE>
<TE>   The children stifle their yawns, but Morpurgo sees them and knows
they will have to rise early to do their chores before breakfast. One
more question, he says. Half a dozen arms go up and he selects one
before sending them upstairs to dormitories.</TE>
<TE>   "Any tips?"</TE>
<TE>   Morpurgo laughs. "You have to live a lot and read a lot and go to
lots of places. You have to have a well of experiences and make it as
full a life as possible. When you write stories, you use water from
the well and if you don't live an interesting life, you use up the
water."</TE>
<TE>   Their thirst for information sated for the moment, the children
file off to bed. Morpurgo, on the other hand, looks wide awake. His
face is glowing after the exchange, his own well having been
replenished.</TE>

<LD>Science fiction wasn't born in Southern California, but it definitely
grew up here. By way of film and television, Hollywood unleashed pulp
fiction's time travelers, triffids and tentacled mutants on the
three-dimensional universe and took pop culture to the outer limit.
That proud heritage is being celebrated in "Barsoom to Blade Runner:
Science Fiction in Southern California," on display at the Fullerton
Museum Center. Through books, photos, manuscripts, costumes, props
and models from film and television, the exhibit excavates the
missing link between literature and the final frontier.</LD>
<LD>   Curator John Karwin got the idea for the show two years ago after
viewing the staggering book and memorabilia collection of science
fiction guru Forrest J. Ackerman. Karwin also culled material from
the Pollak Library at Cal State Fullerton, which houses an extensive
science fiction repository that includes Ray Bradbury's original
manuscript for "The Fireman," which became "Fahrenheit 451," and
onetime Fullerton resident Philip K. Dick's "Do Androids Dream of
Electric Sheep?" which became the 1982 film "Blade Runner." Karwin
credits the library collection to Dr. Willis E. McNelly, who taught
one of the first courses in science fiction at Fullerton in the
1960s.</LD>
<TE>   As source material, the exhibit features early edition books
originating outside Southern California, such as Mary Shelley's
"Frankenstein," Jules Verne's "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" and H.G.
Wells' "The Time Machine." A 1930s book illustration of Frankenstein
as a long-haired ogre is juxtaposed with the Frankenstein mask
prototype created by makeup artist Jack Pierce for Universal
Pictures' classic 1931 film starring Boris Karloff. Pierce consulted
with surgeons on the concept, which entered the collective
unconscious as the archetypal horror-show Frankenstein. "Seventy
years of product is based on that design," says Karwin.</TE>
<TE>   Karwin tapped 15 different collectors for the display items. "It's
all local collections, from Woodland Hills to San Diego," he says.
Time travelers can see the original spaceship from "The Day the Earth
Stood Still"; the fiberglass Devil's Tower and a maquette of the
mother ship from "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"; a spacesuit
from "2001: A Space Odyssey"; the flying sub from "Voyage to the
Bottom of the Sea"; and an outfit from "Rocky Jones, Space Ranger,"
circa early 1950s. The sparkling gold tunic William Shatner wore in
"Mirror, Mirror," episode #39 of the original "Star Trek," is on view
along with a Klingon Battle Cruiser, a phaser pistol and a Tribble.</TE>
<TE>   At times, the speculative and the fantastic seem to be elements of
the Southern California landscape. Part of the show's title salutes
"Tarzan" author Edgar Rice Burroughs' other thrilling adventure
series, the epic saga of dashing ex-Confederate Army Capt. John
Carter, who founds a dynasty on the red planet of Barsoom, known to
us earthlings as Mars. Burroughs moved to California in 1919 and was
elected mayor of Malibu Beach in 1933. The city of Tarzana was once
"Tarzana Ranch," his 550-acre estate in the San Fernando Valley. L.
Frank Baum, author of the "Wizard of Oz" books, shot silent films in
Southern California. Baum died in Hollywood in 1919 and is interred
at Forest Lawn in Glendale. "Southern California is a fantasy land,"
Karwin says. "A metaphor for what's next for humans. It's sort of the
last frontier of the West, being optimistic about the future. It's
about being able to dream."</TE>

<LD>Since there have been indoor malls, there have been mall-walkers. The
Westside Walkers, a volunteer organization sponsored by UCLA
Healthcare 50 Plus, OASIS L.A and the Westside Pavilion, meet two
mornings a week to stretch their legs on the cool, clean and level
marble at the Westside Pavilion. Tinny pop music echoes hollowly as
these intrepid perambulators pass the still-closed stores. But for
these mall crawlers, the only conspicuous consumption is excess
calories.</LD>

<LD>It's hard to get parrot rescuers to speak on the record. Take the
unnerving vehicular incident reported by one driver. "People were
honking at me and yelling, 'There's a parrot on your grille!' " says
the Sherman Oaks woman. "When I pulled over, it was a parrot! He had
attached himself to my grille! I couldn't get him out and I didn't
know what to do, so I drove a couple of blocks to my veterinarian."
As it transpired, the bird was not roadkill. Reluctant to divulge her
name due to the potential swag value of parrots, which can be
thousands, the relieved driver posted a notice on
www.birdhotline.com, an international lost-and-found site that logs a
hefty influx of postings from Southern California. "I've gotten the
weirdest calls," she says.</LD>
<LD>   Steve and Sandy Kaufman have heard thousands of similar stories
since creating the Bird Hotline in 1999 on, um, a lark to reunite
wayward avians with their owners. "We've been helping a lot of people
in Southern California, which is pretty big, and you have a climate
where people leave their doors open," says Kaufman, a former Orange
County resident now living in Sedona, Ariz. "Sixteen years ago we
lost a cockatiel," he says. "It was part of the family."</LD>
<TE>   The hotline averages more than a dozen new listings a day, many
from Southern Californians who've lost parrots or budgies. "The darn
thing exploded on us," says Kaufman, who says the lost-and-found
listings connect an average of one bird with its owner per week. The
site's bird-finding tips also yield results, he says. (Essential:
alert your postal carrier.) "We have 'em in Kuwait, France, Spain,
[but] mostly English-speaking countries," he says. One unusual
posting came from a woman in Sweden. "The bird was waddling and
rubbing its bottom," he recalls. "I told her to get to a vet because
if you [were trying to lay an egg], you'd waddle." With timely
medical intervention, the bird survived. "Thank you from halfway
around the world," the Swede wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Those happy endings are the big payback. The couple, who currently
own a "very smart" sun conure, are hardly feathering their nests with
the Web site. "There's no money in this for us," Kaufman says. "This
is the Internet at its best."</TE>

<LD>"When people go to the beach, everybody gets excited if they see a
dolphin," says Jeff Frymer. "It's just so magical." Particularly when
said mammalians are neon-colored visions that cavort in dazzling
curves behind their creator's bicycle. Out pedaling on the town after
night falls, Frymer isn't always visible, but the animated dolphins
he fabricated from electroluminescent blue wire make quite a splash
as they leap and dive in his wake. Frymer, who during daylight hours
rides the bike sans dolphins to Cal State Northridge, where he's
getting his master's in psychology and counseling, has towed the
finny duo along the Santa Monica bike path, Pacific Coast Highway and
the avenues of Sherman Oaks. Friends have requested that the man-made
mammals accompany him to their birthday parties. "Anybody with any
kind of artistic or creative sense, or sense of wonder, reacts to
them," says Frymer, 40.</LD>
<TE>   Originally created for Nevada's Burning Man arts festival, what
appear to be two dolphins are actually multiple wire animals (10 per
dolphin) lined up and attached to a 6-by-6-foot mesh screen. As with
a cartoon "flip book," a sequencing instrument lights each figure one
after the other, creating the effect of individual creatures in
motion. Frymer, who's not a professional artist and had never worked
with EL-wire before, took about 200 hours to research the process,
complete the animation and rig the whole thing up.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people ask if I sell them," says Frymer of his creation.
"It's funny how commerce and commercial value are on people's minds a
lot. The whole idea is to get people to appreciate things the way
they are--when you see a dolphin in the ocean, you don't wonder what
it costs."</TE>

<CX>   Dog show -- The cover story in the Nov. 24 TV Times and a story in
last Tuesday's Calendar mistakenly said that NBC's telecast of the
National Dog Show on Thanksgiving Day marked the first time a dog
show had been shown on one of the major broadcast networks. It
wasn't.</CX>

<HD>A Woodworker's Ingrained Truth</HD>
<DH>This master craftsman has life in his hands.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If this is the age when anything is possible, isn't it peculiar how
narrowly we define the bounds of success in pursuing it?</LD>
<LD>   Those who set the cultural trends are decidedly single-minded
about the proper trajectory for "making it" just now: Parents must do
anything they can -- apparently quite literally anything -- to get
their children into the best nursery schools. If one's weight and age
add up to 20, it's high time to get started. A day lost from the rat
race is a day falling behind. From there, the pell-mell journey
travels a narrow gauge: college prep in elementary school, SAT
strategies in middle school and the go-for-broke admissions
competition to ranking universities, perhaps with some athletics or
theater thrown in for the chance of hitting it big or rounding out
the resume.</LD>
<LD>   After that? Well, we all know what achievement means, don't we?</LD>
<TE>   Americans laugh at arranged marriages in different cultures. They
think nothing, though, of arranging the other essentials for their
children's lives.</TE>
<TE>   With this on my mind, I have traveled to a lemon orchard at the
base of Southern California's Mt. Baldy in the community of Alta
Loma. I'm here to meet a man who has been a hero for years. His name
is Sam Maloof. He is 86. He took a different path. He enrolled in a
shop class in middle school.</TE>
<TE>   For most of his life since, from planks of figured hardwood,
chiefly walnut, he has found purpose, satisfaction, beauty and
comfort.</TE>
<TE>   If his name doesn't ring a bell, he calls himself a woodworker. In
a show of his creations, the Smithsonian called Maloof "America's
most-renowned contemporary furniture craftsman." He is best known for
his sculpted rocking chairs with elongated, sweeping rockers and
compound joinery. To me, he is an exemplar.</TE>
<TE>   At auction, a Maloof rocker has fetched $140,000. You can get one
for only five figures if you're willing to endure his long waiting
list. He works in his woodshop every day with near-ageless vigor but
never fast enough to meet demand.</TE>
<TE>   But money is only one point. It proves merely that Maloof's path
can lead to bottom-line financial rewards the same as the MBA, DDS or
MD. More interesting are the many ways in which Maloof is not the
same.</TE>
<TE>   He chose not to become a furniture industrialist and expand beyond
a few shop assistants. He chose not to franchise his name to those
who would market inferior copies in discount stores, even when
offered millions to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he freely shares his techniques and philosophy with those who
ask. Among the many who do are so-called professionals who sought
success as society defines it, only to wonder if they have been
miscast. The making of useful objects out of raw materials may have
diminished in social significance but not in the primal pleasures
earned by the maker.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us have God-given talent. Some of us use this talent,"
Maloof says. "We're not all scientists and engineers. But to ignore
these gifts we've been given for the sake of a job we're miserable
in.... " He stops, then finishes the thought with an imponderable
shrug.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is this compact, cheery man with the oversized
horn-rimmed glasses a master among craftsmen, he is a living argument
for craft and for individual pursuit. You can see for yourself.</TE>
<TE>   His home, built over the course of 50 years, has been moved out of
the path of a freeway extension and relocated a few miles away as a
museum: a curious and reassuring mix of the ordinary and the
extraordinary. This is not a house conceived by an architect or
worked over by a celebrated interior decorator. It is a home that was
constructed organically, and patiently, around a man whose first
year's earnings were $555. It is a house of tactile sensibilities, of
carved door latches, of fine art and found art, of dovetail joints,
oiled wood, add-on rooms, arched beams and floating floors that
"sing" when you put your weight on them. A California ranch house
exalted by a lifetime of details.</TE>
<TE>   Craftsmen from around the world make the trip here, 45 minutes by
car from Los Angeles, for the chance to pause and imagine life
through the eyes of Sam Maloof. Others ought to: In particular, those
public school administrators and political budget writers who are
closing shop classes as passe, those students caught in our culture's
totalitarian "one way" techno track for success without a chance to
see if their talents may reside in their hands, and most of all those
parents who say they want their children to be fulfilled but who lack
the imagination to realize that anything is possible.</TE>

<HD>Riordan Puppetry in Action</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frank del Olmo</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If someone like David Tokofsky were not on the Los Angeles school
board, we'd have to invent him. How else would we know what the
political puppeteers who want to control the city's public schools
are up to?</LD>
<LD>   Last week, he exposed another example of their shenanigans, but
more on that later.</LD>
<LD>   The puppeteers I refer to include busybodies like former Mayor
Richard Riordan and philanthropist Eli Broad, who want to use the
750,000 kids in our public schools -- 71% of them Latino -- as guinea
pigs in paternalistic school-reform experiments. That's why they've
spent so much money the last few years backing malleable, handpicked
candidates for seats on the Board of Education.</LD>
<TE>   So far Riordan and his moneyed mafia have put three people on the
board. Now their political hit men have their sights set on Tokofsky
-- whom they once supported, albeit tepidly.</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky is a former teacher whose 5th District runs from Eagle
Rock through East L.A. to several small cities southeast of Los
Angeles. He is up for reelection in March, and political analysts
consider him vulnerable because his recently redrawn district is now
56% Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Riordan, most of the city's Latino political
elite neither likes nor trusts the former mayor. Too many remember
how crudely his school board puppets fired Ruben Zacarias, a popular
Latino superintendent, within days of their election in 1999. That's
the main reason Riordan's political gofers have never been able to
find a viable Latino candidate to run against Tokofsky, who speaks
Spanish and worked hard to serve Latino constituents even before they
became a majority in his district.</TE>
<TE>   But that hasn't kept Riordan and his ilk from schemes that are
stunning in their mix of arrogance and stupidity. Riordan and Broad
offered to donate millions of dollars to Occidental College in an
effort to persuade its president, Ted Mitchell, to run for Tokofsky's
seat. The deal came to light when Mitchell told Occidental trustees
about it and was warned against it.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Riordan's defenders always rush to point out the good
things he and other rich donors have done for public school kids.
Buying computer equipment and library books for schools is admirable,
but Riordan can't seem to limit his largess to needy kids.</TE>
<TE>   That brings me to the latest Riordan-connected scheme, which
Tokofsky helped bring to light. It seems a college classmate of
Riordan's, developer William Carey, got a $107-million L.A. school
construction project without any competitive bidding. School
officials, including Supt. Roy Romer, are trying to explain the
sweetheart deal by saying it will allow a badly needed school to be
built near downtown Los Angeles sooner than it might otherwise be
completed.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps. But someone needs to ask questions when public funds are
spent on multimillion-dollar projects without any bidding --
especially now that state and local voters have approved billions in
school construction bonds. The only school board member who was
skeptical of Carey's deal when it came before the board was Tokofsky,
and he ultimately cast the lone vote against it.</TE>
<TE>   When the deal became public last week, Tokofsky was a key source
of information for journalists who covered the story. No wonder
Riordan and his buddies want this guy out of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Riordan and Broad have failed in their effort to push the
head of Occidental College to run against Tokofsky, they are waving
wads of money at three Latino candidates for the 5th District seat.
Political aide Jose Sigala, schoolteacher Nellie Rios-Parra and
educator Maria Lou Calanche have not yet agreed to accept Riordan and
Broad's endorsement or their filthy lucre. Before any of them even
think about it, they should ponder an old Mexican saying: "Dime con
quien andas y te dire quien eres." ("Tell me whom you associate with,
and I'll tell you who you are.")</TE>
<TE>   And while they're at it, the three Latino candidates should
remember the Spanish word titere -- puppet -- because it is also
likely to come up in any Riordan-backed campaign against Tokofsky.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Has to Gang Up on Violence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Earl Ofari Hutchinson</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The surge in killings -- mostly in South Los Angeles -- has prompted
some to call the city the murder capital of the nation. That may be
premature, but the violence has stirred anguish and anger among
residents, who implore police and city officials to do something, and
fast, to stop the violence. City officials have fingered gangs as the
culprits, but now they need to act.</LD>
<LD>   At last count there were more than 20 identifiable gangs in South
Los Angeles. City officials have tried to put more gang members
behind bars through gang injunctions. But that often takes months.</LD>
<LD>   Even with injunctions, gang activity is likely to worsen. The
flood of ex-felons being released from prisons will almost certainly
beef up their numbers. The disbanding of the LAPD's anti-gang CRASH
unit didn't help. Despite the allegations of abuse, corruption and
the indictments of several officers in the unit, many credit it with
having kept a lid on violence.</LD>
<TE>   Although more arrests, prosecutions, injunctions and stiffer
prison sentences for gang members are crucial to blunting some of the
carnage, they aren't enough. California already locks up far more
"three strikes" offenders than all the other states with a similar
law do, in total.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those who shoot up their neighborhoods hardly flinch at
the prospect of doing a long stretch in prison. There are troubling
reasons why they have no fear of jail, death or being reviled as
cowards, predators and urban terrorists. Many actual or wannabe gang
members believe that their lives are devalued, fostering a disrespect
for the law, and they displace aggression onto others.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them, mostly young black and Latino males, have become
especially adept at acting out their frustrations at white society's
denial of their "manhood." The accessibility of drugs, guns and the
influence of misogynist, violence-laced rap songs also reinforce the
deep feeling among many youth that life is cheap and easy to take,
with minimal consequences for their actions as long as their victims
are other young blacks or Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   The other powerful ingredient in the deadly mix of black and
Latino violence is the drug plague. Drug trafficking not only
provides illicit profits but also makes the gunplay more widespread.
Gang members use their arsenals to fend off attacks, protect their
profits from predators and settle scores with rivals. Often innocent
victims are caught in shootouts, further fortifying the conviction of
suburban whites that South-Central L.A. is a depraved war zone.</TE>
<TE>   Enraged citizens want the LAPD to mobilize even bigger armies of
police on the streets and to launch search-and-destroy missions
against gang targets. Yet LAPD officials are waging their own battle
not only to get more officers but also to keep the ones they have;
scratching for every penny to build new buildings and to upgrade old
facilities; and implementing reforms under a federal consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   There's no magic formula for stopping the violence. However, there
are some immediate actions that Mayor James K. Hahn and the City
Council can take. They must beef up foot and bicycle patrols in those
areas that have been hit hardest. They must increase funds for
violence prevention and gang intervention programs. They must call an
emergency summit of educators, health professionals, drug counselors
and gang intervention activists to devise and provide the crucial
resources for more job and skills training, education, drug treatment
and prevention programs for at-risk youth.</TE>
<TE>   These measures won't end all the violence, but they will help to
reduce it by dealing with the roots of the problem.</TE>

<HD>Full Democracy May Not Be an Answer for Mideast</HD>
<DH>U.S. should focus on making small steps toward goal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Makovsky</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A false debate has broken out between those who say a key goal of any
attack against Iraq would be the creation of an Iraqi democracy and
those who believe the world is ultimately more secure if reliable
authoritarians can be found in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East
to protect American interests. The answer lies somewhere between.</LD>
<LD>   There is a danger in setting the bar for an Iraqi democracy
unrealistically high: The Bush administration potentially could lose
support in the postwar period at home and abroad if Iraq did not
quickly and simply become a full-fledged democracy.</LD>
<LD>   Historical processes take a long time. It would be better for the
debate to center on the very worthy goal of democratization instead
of democracy, implying a process rather than an instant result.</LD>
<TE>   Let us be clear. Relying on Middle East authoritarians has not
succeeded. The lack of reform undermines peace, and President Bush is
right to make such a call for change as sine qua non in the search
for peace in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   The general approach to peacemaking since the Oslo accords in 1993
has been that Palestinian internal affairs were irrelevant to
diplomacy. Because Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat was
considered the source of Palestinian legitimacy, his authoritarianism
was not only inherent in the deal but even welcomed, in the belief
that an unrestricted Arafat would do the most for Israeli security.</TE>
<TE>   This did not work. As has been pointed out by leading Palestinian
analysts, the Palestinian violence since September 2000 has been
linked to dissatisfaction with Arafat's domestic performance as well
as dissatisfaction over Israel and peacemaking. Ultimately, Arafat
sought to deflect attention from his domestic nonperformance by
blaming Israel for all Palestinian woes.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, as a top Clinton administration Middle East advisor,
Martin Indyk, said last year, the Faustian bargain made to sweep Arab
regional democratization issues under the rug in favor of peace
failed to secure either.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the Arab press in Egypt and Saudi Arabia blames every
ill on the U.S. and Israel, which is a way for the countries' leaders
to deflect attention from their own nonperformance. As Americans
learned on Sept. 11, 2001, U.S. association with authoritarian
regimes has only earned it the enmity of the Arab public.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the opposite impulse -- that the U.S. can easily remake the
Middle East by imposing democracy -- also should be questioned. Some
key members of the Bush administration were enamored by the sweep of
democratic governments in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and may
feel that history can repeat itself with the same ease in the Middle
East. But the Middle East does not yet have Eastern Europe's Helsinki
human rights framework or watch groups; neither does it have such
grass-roots groups as Poland's Solidarity, which viewed the United
States as its ally.</TE>
<TE>   Both extremes are flawed. Democracy promotion should tailor itself
to local conditions and not believe one model works for all.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq will be daunting, and therefore the approach must be a
process: democratization.</TE>
<TE>   The complex ethnic makeup in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq coupled with
wariness of neighboring states that wonder what democracy portends
for them means that any transition will not be smooth. However,
perfect should not be allowed to be the enemy of good.</TE>
<TE>   A post-Arafat Palestine might not be Jeffersonian, but if it
follows a reformist impulse, this would be a major step.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. must not be shy in bringing its influence to bear in
dealing with the Middle Eastern regimes. These regimes will
prioritize their own survival, but they will think twice before
crossing a determined U.S. on second-tier issues, such as opening up
political opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   People in the Middle East will judge the United States by the
policy standard that we set for ourselves. For example, Iranian
reformers are known to believe that freeing the world of Hussein
would be a boost to their own internal struggle for reform. Yet
promising a full-blown democracy in Iraq and not delivering, they
say, could set things back in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Because of oil and other factors on one hand and the war against
terrorism on the other, the U.S. engagement in the Middle East will
continue for years. The contradictory pulls will be eased by American
credibility. This requires realistic expectations about the
importance of democratization, which can play a key role in
minimizing dangers and maximizing prospects for change.</TE>
<TE>   The inability to do everything should not be an excuse to do
nothing.</TE>

<HD>Friday traffic snares Salonen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Timberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thanks to Friday night traffic, Los Angeles Philharmonic conductor
Esa-Pekka Salonen didn't show up until after the all-Scandinavian
concert earlier this month had started "It seems to be the kind of
thing that everybody deals with," Salonen said dolefully a few days
later. He felt he'd failed as a professional, despite efforts by his
driver to negotiate the 10 Freeway, Olympic Boulevard and Pico en
route from his home in Brentwood, calling the Phil repeatedly on a
cell phone.</LD>
<LD>   "I've been stuck in traffic before," Salonen said. "This was the
first total defeat."</LD>
<LD>   But his defeat was an opportunity for assistant conductor Yasuo
Shinozaki, who came onstage with five minutes' notice to conduct
Edvard Grieg's "Peer Gynt" Suite No. 1. It's standard practice to
have a conductor standing by in case of such any emergency, though a
spokesperson says no one at the Phil can remember a conductor
replaced because of traffic.</LD>
<TE>   Shinozaki, who was backstage, had more time to prepare than the
orchestra's musicians, who found out from an announcement on the
house P.A. system that Salonen would not be leading them.</TE>
<TE>   With a "romantic piece like Grieg, it's important that the
orchestra see my expression," wrote Shinozaki, who chose to respond
via e-mail because of limited English. "Of course I didn't have a
chance to speak to the orchestra in that time. But they completely
know my conducting and they quite understood my expression."</TE>
<TE>   Shinozaki said he was at ease when he took the stage. "To be
honest I didn't have a time to get nervous because I had to get my
tails, put them on, and check the score within five minutes."</TE>
<TE>   The following night, a repeat of the same program, Salonen gave
himself an hour and a half to get to the Music Center. "It took just
25 minutes," Salonen reports. "So you just can't tell these days."</TE>

<HD>Tiffany is keeping watch over the L.A. scene</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Timberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes it's hard to tell who's branding whom. This week at Tiffany
&amp; Co. in Beverly Hills, between cases of gold necklaces and an
extensive martini bar, the jewelry maker threw a cocktail party to
launch a new watch -- called the Tiffany Mark -- and to honor two
local arts stars. Tiffany has chosen cultural figures from five U.S.
cities and Toronto, offering watches to such luminaries as hockey
great Wayne Gretzky and "Sex and the City" author Candace Bushnell.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles, perhaps incongruously, the two figures are
emissaries of the high arts, Los Angeles Philharmonic conductor
Esa-Pekka Salonen and Walt Disney Concert Hall architect Frank Gehry.</LD>
<LD>   Asked why he'd shown up, the blue-blazered Gehry pointed to his
new Tiffany watch. "Whenever there's a freebie, I'm there," he said,
with a just-along-for-the-ride smile. It turns out it's his first
Tiffany; he pulled a battered black Timex out of his pocket that he
seemed eager to put back on.</LD>
<TE>   When asked about his own appearance, Salonen shrugged ambiguously.
After being introduced -- as a figure worthy of "what we consider to
be the quintessential watch," in the words of a Tiffany vice
president -- he was more eloquent.</TE>
<TE>   "What's delightful is that the Los Angeles recipients belong to
the arts and not to any other discipline," Salonen said, describing
the potency of the local cultural scene. Then, to scattered laughter:
"This is not widely known."</TE>
<TE>   The party also marked a gift Tiffany has given to the Phil;
another donation will come when Disney Hall opens. In best Old Money
fashion, the company's spokesman would only call it "a sizable grant"
but wouldn't name the figure.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Acclaimed New York modern dance choreographer Donald Byrd is moving
to Seattle next month to take over Spectrum Dance Theater, a
contemporary jazz dance company founded in 1982.</LD>
<LD>   "I have some mixed feelings about leaving New York," Byrd says,
"but I feel I can concentrate on some of the things I love to do and
are difficult to do here. Spectrum has a very strong school that's
very much involved in the community. I wanted to do more of that,
engage myself that way. It's a small company. There's lots of room
for growth artistically as well as institutionally."</LD>
<LD>   Founded by Dale A. Merrill, Spectrum operates on an annual budget
of about $600,000, presenting about 35 performances of 25 programs in
Seattle. More than 700 students study at the dance school, where Byrd
will serve as director. Merrill, who is stepping down to become a
professor of dance at Chapman University in Orange, handpicked Byrd
as his successor.</LD>

<HD>Forsythe prized for independence</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On Tuesday, 52-year-old expatriate American choreographer William
Forsythe receives the $50,000 Wexner Prize at Ohio State University
in Columbus. Awarded annually for the past nine years to a major
contemporary artist, the prize honors Forsythe at exactly the moment
he has resigned as artistic director of the Frankfurt Ballet in
search of what he calls "a more independent organizational path."</LD>
<LD>   Like Carolyn Carlson, John Neumeier and other American
choreographers, Forsythe found the American dance scene too
constricting and left to make a home and career in Europe -- in his
case Germany, beginning in 1973. He became the artistic director of
the Frankfurt Ballet 11 years later, famed for a style of daring,
futuristic classicism that has, arguably, influenced more
dance-makers than anything since George Balanchine's neoclassicism
swept the dance world.</LD>
<LD>   These achievements will be celebrated in Columbus beginning today
through Wexner-sponsored film, lecture and panel presentations, plus
a Forsythe master class.</LD>
<TE>   Previous recipients of the prize include director Peter Brook,
music and dance icons John Cage and Merce Cunningham, filmmaker
Martin Scorsese and artist Robert Rauschenberg.</TE>

<LD>Why the sudden change in the lineup of the Hot Properties series at
[Inside] the Ford?</LD>
<LD>   A "misunderstanding," said Steven Leigh Morris, whose play
"Moscow" was dropped.</LD>
<LD>   According to Morris, who's also the theater editor of the LA
Weekly, he and Tracy Young, who would have directed his play, "were
blindsided by assumptions we had both made" in the process of
preparing for the production. "You don't want to go into it without
being on the same page."</LD>
<TE>   Morris' play was going to be presented by Both, the new theater
company from former Actors' Gang mainstays Young and Chris Wells,
Jan. 18 to Feb. 23. But Both decided to do Wells' "Liberty!" instead.</TE>
<TE>   "Our visions of what we wanted the production to be diverged,"
Young said, "and we found that out late in the game."</TE>

<HD>Personal politics: Coburn's last film</HD>
<DH>The as-yet-unreleased movie about gun issues departs from
many of the works that brought fame to the actor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ellen Baskin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Coburn, who died Monday, achieved stardom in the 1960s in such
popular studio films as "The Magnificent Seven," "The Great Escape"
and "Our Man Flint." In a career that spanned nearly five decades, he
amassed more than 100 film and television credits, culminating in his
Academy Award-winning performance in "Affliction" (1997).</LD>
<LD>   His final film, the as-yet-unreleased independent production
"American Gun," was a very different kind of project -- more personal
and political. The film stars Coburn as a man who sets out to track
the provenance of the handgun whose use resulted in a family tragedy.
His quest takes him across the country and includes visits to the
factory where the gun was made and flashback sequences depicting the
weapon's past owners.</LD>
<LD>   Written and directed by Alan Jacobs ("Just One Night," "Nina Takes
a Lover"), "American Gun" was shot in early 2001 on location in
Vermont, Florida, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, on a budget that Jacobs
wryly noted was "less than the average house in Beverly Hills."</LD>
<TE>   In an interview after Coburn's death, Jacobs recalled the actor as
straightforward and remarkably amenable to the project's small-scale
production considerations. "We took him all around the country,"
Jacobs said. "He was so good about it. We had him in Vermont for a
month in the winter, then down to Florida. He was in four states for
the better part of 40 days, making this low-budget film."</TE>
<TE>   And despite the painful arthritis that had severely inhibited
Coburn's activities in recent years, Jacobs noted, "You needed him to
walk, he walked."</TE>
<TE>   When it came time to screen the finished film for distributors,
Coburn again stepped up to the plate. "He came out for two of the
screenings we did here in L.A.," Jacobs said. "He also made calls to
a couple of the film festival directors, and he put in a call to some
prospective buyers. Whenever we needed him to make a call, he was
there."</TE>
<TE>   "American Gun" carefully balances the points of view it presents
on the volatile issue of handguns. . In some ways, though, it could
serve as a companion piece to Michael Moore's "Bowling for
Columbine," an acerbic documentary look at the American gun culture.
(Currently in theaters, "Bowling" recently became the most successful
non-concert documentary ever released.)</TE>
<TE>   Jacobs became friendly with a number of National Rifle Assn.
members while developing his story -- several appear in small roles
in the film -- and went through the process of applying to buy a gun
as part of his research. However, while waiting for his background
check to clear, Jacobs realized he had no safe place to keep the gun
in his home, where he lives with his wife and their four young
children. Once he was notified that he could pick up the gun, he
never followed through with the purchase.</TE>
<TE>   The first public screening of "American Gun" was at the Seattle
International Film Festival in June. The movie was shown again, in
New York at the Hamptons International Film Festival in October,
where Coburn was given a career achievement award. The actor had
originally planned to travel to both festivals but was not well
enough for either trip. He was recovering at home from foot surgery
for his arthritis when he suffered a fatal heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Before Coburn's death, Jacobs was in conversation with "a couple
of potential distributors" and hoping for a theatrical release early
next year. The writer-director is keenly aware of the unfortunate
irony that now surrounds his film.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes everything the opposite of what it was yesterday," he
said, sadly acknowledging that "two days ago I had a film that had a
shelf life; now I have a film that will always be James Coburn's last
movie."</TE>

<HD>First the rescue, then marketing of the miners</HD>
<DH>Plucked from doom, workers were flooded by pitches in a
process that says a lot about Hollywood's own rapid response teams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Bates</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Third-generation Pennsylvania coal miners. First-generation
celebrities.</LD>
<LD>   Up to their necks one minute in 50-degree water. Up to their
eyeballs the next in pitches from lawyers, agents, producers,
networks, studios and marketers eager to cash in. A nine-man cottage
industry from the moment they were hoisted from 20 stories
underground before dawn on July 28 after a 77-hour rescue ordeal that
captivated worldwide television audiences.</LD>
<LD>   How the nine workers trapped in the Quecreek No. 1 Mine went from
anonymous swing shift workers -- guys nicknamed "Moe," "Flathead,"
"Harpo," "Boogie" and "Hound Dog" -- to VIP celebrities and marketing
commodities says a lot about the way Hollywood's rapid response teams
operate to bag stories fresh off their news cycles.</LD>
<TE>   The "Pennsylvania Miners' Story" TV movie airing tonight on ABC
was the cornerstone of Miners Inc.</TE>
<TE>   So frenetic was the pace to lock in that deal that an agent from
International Creative Management enlisted an operator to break into
the middle of a miner's home telephone conversation. Inundated with
160 calls in the two days after he returned home, the man had been
unreachable, frustrating agents, producers and Hollywood executives
encamped in western Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   "These things happen quickly, and very quickly," said the agent,
ICM's Robert Lazar.</TE>
<TE>   With backing that reached all the way to chief executive Michael
Eisner, Walt Disney Co. raced to lock up the rights, seeing it as an
uplifting, Disneyesque tale that could give the company's struggling
ABC network a ratings boost during the critical November sweeps.
"It's one part 'Apollo 13,' one part 'The Perfect Storm,' " says
Quinn Taylor, ABC's executive vice president for TV movies.</TE>
<TE>   The company quickly discovered that Lazar and a colleague from ICM
were a step ahead in Pennsylvania, dealing with a Pittsburgh lawyer
hired by the miners to field offers. Lazar had already obtained the
rights to the story of rescue worker Bob Long, dubbed "the man behind
the miracle" by TV newscasters for pinpointing where the miners had
likely fled the rising waters.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer, Thomas Crawford, had started the bidding at $450,000.
Faced with the possibility of a competing project stemming from
Long's rights, Disney made a preemptive $1.5-million strike to wrap
up all the rights in one package. CBS was a distant second.</TE>
<TE>   The miners in the Disney deal alone saw as much money as they
would typically make in three to four years, $150,000 for each one
and a 10th share for Long. Crew boss Randy Fogle, who among the nine
has emerged as the point man, said he doesn't see it as a chance to
get rich.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping that it would give everybody -- including me, but
the other guys mainly -- a chance to make some money and then to go
into a different type of job instead of staying in the mines if they
wanted out. Just to give them a choice," Fogle said. He says he plans
to return to mining after Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   ABC made the TV movie for $8.5 million. That's a near record for a
two-hour broadcast TV film, which means it will take solid ratings, a
good run in foreign countries and strong sales on DVD and video to
recoup the investment. Disney's deal with the miners also includes a
book, "Our Story," an account from the miners and their families
published by the company's Hyperion unit.</TE>
<TE>   For the miners, that's only the start. A Pepsi endorsement fell
through in the days after the rescue. But the miners did retain
Stephen Reich, a Pittsburgh marketing executive whose clients include
hockey superstar Mario Lemieux, to field calls and scope out
potential offers.</TE>
<TE>   Reich recently cut a licensing deal for T-shirts reading "Quecreek
9 for 9," hoping to ride the coattails of the TV movie, book release
and wave of fresh publicity, which included an "Oprah" appearance by
all nine miners.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR hosted the miners at one of its races, where drivers
greeted them as if they were the celebrities. All nine appeared on
the field before a Pittsburgh Steelers football game, wearing
Steelers jerseys numbered 1 through 9.</TE>
<TE>   To send a message to its managers about the importance of
teamwork, Microsoft had two of the miners appear at a regional
meeting at a Pennsylvania resort. Wal-Mart plans to fly all nine to
Houston for an appearance in February before its Sam's Club managers.
The miners are getting top billing at the sold-out Pennsylvania
Credit Union annual meeting in Harrisburg. Reich won't say how much
they are earning. People in the speakers business estimate the miners
would cost about $15,000.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the miners never used a lawyer before. Now they have an
intellectual property attorney, who secured trademarks on four
slogans for merchandise possibilities: "Quecreek 9 for 9," "Quecreek
9," "Quecreek Survivors" and "Quecreek Miracle 9."</TE>
<TE>   The miners have experienced their own bumps in their road to fame.
They had a falling-out with lawyer Crawford, with some of them taking
him to court when they felt he was too slow to forward the Disney
money to them. Some members of miner families have complained because
Long is sharing in the proceeds when he wasn't a miner.</TE>
<TE>   There's also resentment of projects not sanctioned by the miners
themselves, notably "Nine for Nine" by British author Andrew Morton,
famous for his bestselling biographies of Princess Diana and Monica
Lewinsky. Morton defends his book as a comprehensive account of the
entire rescue effort. He said he even had conversations with some of
the miners before Disney locked up their story exclusively, boasting
that he beat Hollywood to Somerset, Pa., to talk to them. "They
hadn't taken the Disney dollar when I got there," Morton said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview in a nondescript office park in Valencia, where
ABC re-created the flooded mine on a makeshift soundstage in an
industrial building, miners Randy Fogle and Mark "Moe" Popernack are
at once giddy and uneasy with their instant celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost incomprehensible," says Fogle. "You're sitting at
home one day, and the next day you're doing this. You never think
you're going to get a movie made about you." Fogle is dressed in a
green Mountain Dew T-shirt, a tribute to the drink that sustained the
miners underground, and a cap from Black Wolf Coal Co., where they
work.</TE>
<TE>   "With this much attention, you kind of learn in hurry who you want
to talk to and who you don't," Popernack says. "Then you start to not
trust anyone. You don't know who to trust."</TE>
<TE>   Popernack is still undecided if he will return to the mines where
he worked for 21 years.</TE>
<TE>   ABC wanted him to promote the TV movie before the media at
Disney's California Adventure. He passed because one of his children
was selling a pig at a 4-H auction. Another miner had a celebrity
skeet shooting event to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Popernack tells of venturing a few days earlier to a Hallmark
store near the Valencia set to buy a gift to ship to his wife. A
conversation with the clerk led to the discovery that he was one of
the nine miners. "She went nuts," he said of the woman's reacting
almost as if a movie star had walked into the store.</TE>
<TE>   "I want a normal life back, if possible," Popernack said.</TE>

<LD>Wearing a blue sanitary paper hat and a matching UCLA Medical Center
gown, the glamorous Maria Celeste Arraras made her NBC debut on
"Dateline" and in the process made herself into the most prominent
player in a blossoming media experiment between two television
networks in different languages. In the coming weeks she will appear
on NBC as well as Telemundo, the second-largest Spanish-language TV
network in the country, stirring bilingual talent into the broadcast
mix.</LD>
<LD>   Celeste's perky good looks have drawn comparisons to NBC's "Today"
host Katie Couric, but her cross-network contract brings to mind the
deal worked out by CNN's foreign correspondent Christiane Amanpour,
who filed special reports for "60 Minutes" on CBS.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to keep reinventing yourself," the 42-year-old broadcast
journalist says during a recent visit to Los Angeles. "The public is
like a boyfriend, and you have to keep doing exciting things to keep
him interested."</LD>
<TE>   In April, when NBC officially acquired Telemundo, Celeste signed
on as managing editor and star of "Al Rojo Vivo con Maria Celeste"
("Red Hot With Maria Celeste"), a prime-time weekday magazine show.
She also agreed to report and record special segments for NBC's
prime-time evening magazine show, "Dateline."</TE>
<TE>   "Because of the NBC-Telemundo joint venture it has opened a third
dimension ... where there are no rules," she says, explaining that
the cultural differences between the two networks range from the
tonality of a breaking story to the amount of flashy accessories a
female broadcaster is allowed to wear. On her Telemundo show, Celeste
dresses more "Entertainment Tonight" than "NBC Nightly News."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to experimenting with broadcast journalists,
executives are arranging inter-network "visits" by actors and
actresses, and on a recent Monday, Celeste was filming a guest
appearance on NBC's daytime drama "Passions," which features a Latino
family. In the "Passions" Thanksgiving episodes, scheduled to air
Friday and Monday, she plays an embellished, flirtatious version of
herself.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Celeste nor Telemundo executives see her guest spot on
"Passions" as a threat to her credibility. Celeste even admits to
having quite a bit of fun doing a sendup of herself for entertainment
TV and says she doesn't feel the least bit uncomfortable about how it
might affect her role as a journalist. It's an attitude not shared by
the vast majority of reporters on English-language networks; while
some take news reporter roles in feature films, it's virtually
unheard of for a broadcast news figure to appear on a soap.</TE>
<TE>   Her character goes undercover and sneaks a hidden camera into the
wealthy patriarch's mansion to reveal that he is a racist. For her
cameo, she was decked out in skintight brown pants with a wide belt.
Her low-cut lace shirt showed off the breast implants she got nine
years ago, and with a glint in her eye, she stood in front of the
cameras and fed hors d'oeuvres to the graying patriarch.</TE>
<TE>   In real life, Celeste is married to a Cuban-born real estate
attorney, and they live with their three children in South Florida,
where Telemundo is based. The area's celebrity-crazed media culture
has propelled Celeste beyond the status of a recognizable, Emmy
Award-winning newscaster. She is a cover girl who was chosen this
month as one of the "10 Most Intriguing People of the Year" by People
en Espanol, and her every move is watched by Spanish-language
entertainment press -- a critical cachet for this bilingual synergy
test.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a journalist in both worlds," she says, "but in the Hispanic
world everybody follows what I do, whether it's my kid's baptism or
what I wore to a party."</TE>
<TE>   Executives hope her well-cultivated appeal will lure some
bilingual Spanish-language viewers to "Dateline," if only on the
special occasions when Celeste appears. Also as important is her
ability to draw bilingual NBC viewers to Telemundo for a chance to
see Celeste on her nightly magazine show.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Rojo Vivo" is very popular -- the most watched show in any
language in New York in its time slot. She is a household name among
Spanish speakers and was all but unknown in English-only homes until
she "premiered" on NBC in August with a piece on the 10-month-old
Guatemalan sisters conjoined at the skull who were surgically
separated at UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "NBC and Telemundo have had exclusive access for months now," said
anchor Stone Phillips, who then mispronounced Celeste's Spanish last
name twice. (It's Ah-RAH-ras.)</TE>
<TE>   "That's OK. I don't mind," Celeste says. "He took the time and
called several times to try and pronounce it correctly. It showed a
lot of sensitivity to the market and the Spanish-speaking audience."</TE>
<TE>   The girls' family let Celeste spend the night in the hospital, and
she was on deadline for both networks at the same time, finishing the
"Dateline" segment less than one hour before it was broadcast. For
Celeste, the twins story was more than just exposure to a new
audience. It was a delicious opportunity to investigate what she
calls "American TV" -- the "other" world that Spanish-language
broadcasters have long glorified.</TE>
<TE>   "We had this big myth that it would be a different ballgame --
that it would be awesome, bigger and better. But, to my surprise, it
was very similar," says Celeste, who sounded like a spy divulging
intelligence from the front. "The only difference is there were more
resources. You can pre-plan and take things at a more normal pace. In
Spanish TV, we have less resources, so we are more aggressive. We are
hungrier."</TE>
<TE>   Andy Lack, president and chief operating officer of NBC, says he
was concerned her English would not be up to "prime-time standards."</TE>
<TE>   "Not only was it acceptable, it was great. It was one of the
highest segments at 'Dateline' that quarter," he says. "She was
credible, so I didn't think viewers were sitting around thinking,
'Why is this Spanish-accented person doing this story?' I think they
thought, 'This person knows the place, knows the story, and it's
important and authoritative.' She's a serious, smart journalist."</TE>
<TE>   Crossover appeal</TE>
<TE>   Less well-known talent is being cultivated as well. Last April,
Telemundo affiliate reporter Angie Sandoval filed reports for MSNBC
during the attempted coup in Caracas, Venezuela. And last summer, NBC
affiliate reporter Patricia Andreu, of NBC6/WTVJ in Miami, helped
host a telethon on Telemundo's Miami affiliate, Channel 51/WSCV.</TE>
<TE>   Andreu has also filed breaking news stories for both stations.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gone live on top of NBC6 newscast in English and a few
minutes later, the earpiece is switched by master control and
suddenly, I'm hearing Spanish, and I have to do the same thing," she
says. "In five or 10 minutes, I will have filed breaking news stories
in two different languages, for two different stations. You
definitely have to switch your brain to make sure you don't try to
translate word for word. You actually have to think in the different
language to speak intelligibly."</TE>
<TE>   And that can be a sticking point. The correspondents must be
thoroughly fluent in both languages, not just conversational.
Executives at Telemundo and NBC say the key to success for the
bilingual experiment is clarity and quality, so that viewing
audiences never worry that information got lost in the translation.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important for diction to be as perfect as possible," says
Telemundo's President and CEO Jim McNamara, who likes to say that
NBC's $2.7-billion purchase of Telemundo will go down as the best
bargain the Peacock network ever made.</TE>
<TE>   That remains to be seen, but the average Latino household has more
children than non-Latino families, a statistic Telemundo and
Univision use to urge ad buyers to plunk down money on domestic,
child-oriented products, like detergents and diapers.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers from the 2000 census that show Hispanics have strong
incomes and are buying a lot of new products gave a legitimacy and
credibility that no marketeer can ignore anymore," says Maria "Liz"
Castells-Heard, president/partner of Castells &amp; Asociados, an ad firm
that specializes in Spanish-language ad campaigns for clients such as
McDonald's, Toyota, AT&amp;T Broadband and Safeway.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, advertisers say, Spanish-speaking consumers tend to
be more loyal to products and brands than non-Spanish-speakers. And
in Celeste, the network already has a brand viewers like and trust.</TE>
<TE>   For eight years, Celeste anchored "Primer Impacto," an
investigative newsmagazine on the Univision network, the country's
largest Spanish-language TV network. It was a platform that made
Celeste famous and garnered her two book deals. After only a few
years, though, Celeste was champing at the bit for more
responsibility and variety, but Univision did not want to rejigger
what the ratings showed was a winning format.</TE>
<TE>   On the same day in April that the FCC approved NBC's purchase of
Telemundo, Celeste publicly hitched her star to Telemundo -- her
former rival -- and agreed to do some stories for "Dateline."</TE>
<TE>   "What worries me is that instead of seeing it as a magnificent
project that opens doors on both sides, some shortsighted people will
feel threatened by it," she says, sipping a Diet Coke and waiting for
her next scene on the soap opera.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially anchor people that speak only English."</TE>

<HD>On to the next stage of hip-hop's development</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two weeks ago, the hip-hop-punctuated feature film "8 Mile" opened
No. 1 at the box office, and a mixed chorus of euphoria and mild
surprise went up in CEO suites across the entertainment industry. The
movie's star, rapper Eminem, could really act! A movie with a mostly
African American cast set in grim, battle-scarred Detroit could
attract white suburban boomers and other demographic untouchables
(i.e. anyone older than 25).</LD>
<LD>   But the idea that hip-hop can pump up the volume on dramatic
storytelling, or that the old-fashioned dramatic elements of acting,
writing and narrative structure may have something to teach hip-hop,
comes as no surprise to Danny Hoch and Jonzi D. Solo artists who are
intent on merging hip-hop's freewheeling sensibility with time-tested
forms of stagecraft, they're wary that "8 Mile's" commercial success
could cement an already limited, commercial-driven notion of what
hip-hop culture is, and isn't.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's dangerous to talk about hip-hop by always referring
to what pop culture tells us hip-hop culture is," Hoch said. When
hip-hop began, the Bronx b-boys who started break dancing on scraps
of cardboard, and the emcees and DJs who fashioned poetry from lived
experience and old James Brown beats, were taking part in an act of
"cultural resistance," Hoch said. "Little did we know we'd be selling
Sprite 15 years later."</LD>
<TE>   The Queens, N.Y.-bred Hoch and London-based Jonzi D recently were
in Los Angeles to perform in "Blazin'," excerpts from last summer's
New York City Hip-Hop Theater Festival. Their free Nov. 12 gig at the
Ivy Substation in Culver City and Hoch's later appearance at Cal
State Northridge with another hip-hop theater artist, Will Power,
underscored the way in which hip-hop culture is reshaping the
performing arts.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, rapper Mos Def won accolades for his Broadway
debut in the Pulitzer Prize-winning play "Topdog/Underdog" by Venice
resident Suzan-Lori Parks. A few days ago, "Russell Simmons Def
Poetry Jam on Broadway," orchestrated by the eponymous rap
impresario, opened to enthusiastic New York reviews.</TE>
<TE>   Hoch's response? It's about time. "The theater community has taken
awhile to catch on, but they're starting to realize hip-hop is the
dominant youth culture of the world. It's the audience of today;
forget about tomorrow," he said over lunch with Jonzi D last week.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting of art forms</TE>
<TE>   The two men had just finished performing for participants in the
HeArt Project, a nonprofit organization that facilitates learning and
cultural interaction between professional artists and hard-to-reach
L.A. teenagers. What surprised some students watching the show was
how hip-hop culture's various elements -- break dancing, emceeing,
DJing -- can be broken down and combined with traditional dialogue,
choreography and set and sound design.</TE>
<TE>   Jonzi D, a gifted mime and brilliant mimic who honed his movement
skills at the prestigious London Contemporary Dance School, led off
the program. A dreadlocked East London Cockney, he uses rap, humor,
graceful athleticism and the metaphors and gestural language of
hip-hop to create funny, thoughtful parables about modern urban life
and identity.</TE>
<TE>   His work also manifests a sense of pan-African identity often
missing from insular American hip-hop. In "Aeroplane Man," this son
of Grenadian immigrant parents plays out a jet-hopping odyssey in
search of his roots. After encountering a British racist, scornful
Grenadians and Jamaicans, a hostile African American and a
contemptuous Zulu, he comes full circle and declares that "this brown
frame has found its name."</TE>
<TE>   So what advice would Jonzi D give a young rapper or hip-hop artist
with ambitions of appearing on stage or making movies? "I'd probably
say, 'Go take some theater classes.' "</TE>
<TE>   One student, Stanley Boston, 19, seemed to be taking that message
to heart. "You can go on TV and have all this jewelry and cars," he
said of the consumerized hip-hop ethos. But after watching the
performance, he said, "I'd rather just go on my own. Even if it takes
a different path, I think it'd be better."</TE>
<TE>   No dis against Mathers, but for subtlety, polish and provocative
content, Hoch and Jonzi D make the Eminem of "8 Mile" seem as
white-bread and innocuous as Poppin' Fresh.</TE>
<TE>   Which perhaps isn't surprising. Despite the actors' hard-core
performances and Curtis Hanson's smart, visceral direction, "8 Mile"
is, at bottom, a conventional-minded Hollywood rap-to-riches tale
about the pursuit of fame and material success in the name of art and
blue-collar solidarity. Nothing wrong with that story: It's the
American Dream, poised on the border of 8 Mile Road, which separates
the charred houses and empty lots of Detroit from its upscale
suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   But artists like Hoch and Jonzi D believe hip-hop has many other
stories to tell. In his set, Hoch revived several theatrical
monologues from his show "Jails, Hospitals &amp; Hip-Hop," previously
seen in Los Angeles at the Actors' Gang.</TE>
<TE>   With no props but baseball caps, a chair and a filing cabinet, he
conjures fully formed characters such as a white Montana teenager
pretending he's a gangsta thug named Flip-Dogg; a young Puerto Rican
shooting victim chatting up a girl; and a Cuban engineering student
hawking tchotchkes to gringo tourists in Havana. Hoch uses hip-hop
not just in its most marketable form, rap music, but as a filter for
expressing life on America's margins.</TE>
<TE>   For the past two decades, hip-hop and rap have defined themselves,
not always flatteringly. But they've also let themselves be defined
by a false pop culture dichotomy, which insisted that hip-hop
devotees had to choose between being BMW-driving players or opting
for gun-toting ghetto authenticity and "keeping it real."</TE>
<TE>   In "8 Mile," Eminem's character wins the climactic rap showdown by
outing a rival for attending a local prep school, as if street cred
were a one-way cul-de-sac of poverty and hopelessness.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that really disturbed me with that 'keep it
real' thing is young, really intelligent emcees dumbed themselves
down and pretended that they didn't go to college just to conform to
this whole pop culture," Jonzi D said.  When hip-hop first hit
Britain in the early 1980s, he recalled, it was an inclusive,
ethnically ambiguous "amazing bringing-together of people, a really
beautiful time."</TE>
<TE>   Beauty, inclusiveness and a sense of community haven't always been
hip-hop's top priorities. But they can still be found, even amid the
rubble of 8 Mile Road -- and its new Hollywood imitation.</TE>

<HD>Chance to play a hero</HD>
<DH>During Ramadan, TV viewers in the Arab world tune in to the
simple wisdom of Goha. A top Egyptian actor considers it a plum role.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Lamb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Cairo</DL>
<LD>Why is Dr. Yehia Fakharani, one of Egypt's foremost actors, riding
around on a jackass these days, wearing the flowing djellaba of a
peasant and sporting a wide grin as if he knows some deep wonderful
secret?</LD>
<LD>   Easy question. This is Ramadan, Islam's holy month, when Arabs
spend hours around their televisions, and networks broadcast their
best soap-opera series of the year, like some holy sweeps month. And
Fakharani, a physician-turned-actor who has portrayed King Lear and
starred in some of Egypt's top movies, finally has the chance to play
the role he really wants -- that of Goha, the most revered mythical
figure in the Arab world.</LD>
<LD>   For Arabs, Goha is the Walter Mitty of Arabia, the little man
living out his fantasies, always triumphing over great odds. He is
lovable, eccentric, simple. His optimism is boundless, his generosity
has no limits. He is said to be a fool, but he is clever and crafty
and always outwits the sultans he encounters.</LD>
<TE>   "To know Goha is to understand a bit more about the Arab peasant,"
said Hussein Amin, a professor of media studies at American
University in Cairo. "Goha adds a human dimension to the Arab
character with his humor and self-criticism. It's a dimension people
don't see in the West, where the Arab is often stereotyped."</TE>
<TE>   One American equates Goha with Yogi Berra. "You can't quite figure
out if what he says is really stupid or really smart," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Goha, who is said to have been born in Iraq, has been around for
centuries. Whether such a character ever existed is unknown, but his
stories are passed down through the generations.</TE>
<TE>   Books are written about him in Iraq. He stars in a puppet show in
Syria. Parents tell their children stories about him in Morocco. A
political satire about him in 1985, "Goha Rules the City," ranks as
one of Egypt's most popular plays since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Wise words</TE>
<TE>   So this Ramadan, Arabs by the millions gather around their TV sets
at 6:30 each evening to cheer the buffoon who proves more learned
than the scholars.</TE>
<TE>   Goha's robe falls off a hook and he observes: "Thanks be to God, I
wasn't in it." He loses his money in the desert one night and
explains to a friend that he is searching for it in his house because
"it is dark outside and here I have light."</TE>
<TE>   Egyptian television in general emphasizes soap operas, apolitical
mixes of comedy and romance centering on Egyptians coping with
everyday problems. "Goha," in particular, provides a lighthearted and
whimsical contrast to the economic and social tensions gripping Egypt
as threats of war rise in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Fakharani says playing Goha has put him in a good mood for the
holy month of dawn-to-dusk fasting (it ends Dec. 30) by satisfying
his longtime craving for the role. "You know how you feel like eating
certain foods sometimes?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   Fakharani sees Goha as reflecting the masses' cynicism toward the
ruling elite and representing the homespun wisdom and stubborn
optimism of the desert Arab.</TE>
<TE>   Once, when the sultan wanted to teach his donkey to read and
write, Goha volunteered. He said the task would take three years and
he'd need a villa with servants. The sultan agreed. Time passed.
Friends who visited found Goha lounging about. They warned him he
would surely lose his head if he didn't come up with a literate
donkey at the end of three years. Goha was unperturbed.</TE>
<TE>   "I shall not give up hope," he said. "After all, one of four
things might happen: The sultan may die, I may die, the donkey may
die or -- who knows? -- the donkey may learn to read and write."</TE>

<HD>Behind Jay-Z Inc.'s doors</HD>
<DH>The rapper has his hand in many businesses. But he plans to
leave the one that made him a star.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Light</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>New York</DL>
<LD>"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming out," says Jay-Z in a
Vegas lounge lizard voice. "Now don't forget -- there's a $10,000
cover charge, so if you could just take care of that on the way out."</LD>
<LD>   Jay-Z always thinks big. One of the towering names in hip-hop,
with seven platinum-plus albums to his name, he stands at the center
of an empire that includes Roc-a-Fella Records and the Rocawear
clothing line -- a hot young men's sportswear brand with sales
projected at more than $300 million in 2002.</LD>
<LD>   He and his team branched out into film, producing 2000's hip-hop
documentary "Backstage" and the recently opened action flick "Paid in
Full." They even made a deal to distribute Armadale vodka, a British
brand whose promotional material says that its strategy is "to be the
highest-priced vodka on the market."</LD>
<TE>   So here at rehearsal for "Saturday Night Live," Jay is launching
his new album, "The Blueprint 2: The Gift and the Curse," with an
appearance that's almost star-studded enough to make a five-digit
admission price sound reasonable. He's performing the record's first
single, " '03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde," with Destiny's Child leader (and his
much-rumored squeeze) Beyonce Knowles, and Lenny Kravitz and band are
playing behind them.</TE>
<TE>   This blend of hip-hop, R&amp;B and rock exemplifies the crazy-quilt
approach Jay took on the album, a two-disc extravaganza full of
big-name collaborations and surprising styles. In addition to Knowles
and Kravitz, guests include Big Boi from OutKast, the illustrious
rapper Rakim and rising dancehall reggae star Sean Paul. Producers
Dr. Dre, Timbaland and the Neptunes -- the three leading studio
wizards in hip-hop -- are also on board.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at a point in hip-hop where everyone is sounding like each
other," Jay says, relaxing backstage during the endless, tedious
hours of downtime during "Saturday Night Live's" all-day run-through.
"If someone doesn't experiment with the music, it's not going
anywhere. So as one of the people at the forefront, I feel like I
need to put out all different types of music, to show that you could
make a rock song, a reggae song. You could make a song with live
drums. You can make any type of music you want, and you don't have to
feel like you're selling out."</TE>
<TE>   The 25 songs on "The Blueprint 2" could certainly benefit from
some editing. Part of the power of Jay's best albums -- his 1996
debut, "Reasonable Doubt," and last year's "The Blueprint" -- was in
their concision and consistency. But here, the sprawl is part of the
point. "Some people might have to skip over some tracks," says Jay.
"I'm saying that, and I'm the one that made 'em!"</TE>
<TE>   He's everywhere you turn</TE>
<TE>   In a year when it truly felt as though hip-hop was spinning its
wheels, this sort of all-inclusive ambition is a statement in itself.
And Jay-Z, who turns 32 next month, is nothing if not ambitious. In
the past few weeks, as well as releasing his own album, he has turned
up on the soundtrack to Eminem's movie "8 Mile" and on new albums by
Missy Elliott and Snoop Dogg. ("Blueprint 2" knocked the Eminem
soundtrack out of the No. 1 spot on the charts last week, selling
545,000 copies its first week out.)</TE>
<TE>   Since the release of "The Blueprint," he's recorded a triumphant
"MTV Unplugged" backed by Philadelphia hip-hop band the Roots, and
released the massively anticipated, and ill-fated, "Best of Both
Worlds" project with R. Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   "Best," which seemed like a sure commercial juggernaut, came out a
few weeks after Kelly's arrest last June on child pornography charges
and has sold less than a million copies. (Over the summer, he told
Teen People, "If [Kelly] is doing something morally wrong, he should
get help, and I pray for him. I still think the album is a piece of
art I wanted to do with a creative person I respect.")</TE>
<TE>   Soft-spoken and quick to laugh, Jay-Z (sometimes called Jigga or
Jay-Hova or various other ever-evolving nicknames) sits forward on a
couch in the "Saturday Night Love" lounge area and talks excitedly
about his new songs. He travels with no entourage, just one security
guard. A walking example of cross-promotion, he sips at an Armadale
and cranberry juice, and wears a dark Rocawear jersey. For the show's
broadcast, he'll change into a Run-DMC T-shirt in tribute to the
group's slain DJ Jam Master Jay.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on whom you ask, Jay-Z represents the best or the worst
of hip-hop. His effortless, conversational delivery ("He flows like a
faucet," according to "The Vibe History of Hip-Hop"), innovative
slang and irresistible hooks on singles such as "Hard Knock Life" and
"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)" rank him with the genre's greatest talents.
"Remarkably, rap's best MC may be its most popular," wrote Spin
magazine earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   But his relentless materialism and obsessive product-placement
lifestyle -- complete with multimillion-dollar fantasy videos,
carousing in the Hamptons and rhymes crammed with prestigious brand
names and glamorous, high-maintenance women -- is something many in
the hip-hop community have grown tired of. Jay-Z's 1999 single "Big
Pimpin' " even created a name for this sensibility.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, his lyrics often point to the roots of his
fascination with all that glitters. Filled with references to his own
past and intricate narratives of drug deals and street crime, they
tell a classic rags-to-riches story. Born Shawn Carter, Jay was
raised in Brooklyn's Marcy Projects by his mother, a city worker (he
recently met with his father, who left the family when Jay was 11).
He dropped out of high school to tour as rapper Big Jaz's sidekick,
but when that didn't work out he returned to Brooklyn and a life of
dealing crack, he says. After someone shot at him from close range in
1995, he decided to get back into the rap game.</TE>
<TE>   Unhappy with the record deals being offered to him, Jay formed
Roc-a-Fella Records for the release of "Reasonable Doubt." He and his
partners eventually signed a distribution deal with rap powerhouse
Def Jam Records and began a run of hits few rappers have ever
matched.</TE>
<TE>   Several well-publicized offstage actions, however, add a
disturbing underside to his story. Most notable was his 1999 stabbing
of record executive Lance "Un" Rivera at a party. Jay pleaded guilty
to misdemeanor assault and received three years' probation. ("It was
a fight that escalated and got crazy," he told XXL magazine recently.
"It made me that much more cautious -- even more levelheaded.")</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the ugly war of words between Jay and rival rapper
Nas. What started as a feud over who has superior talent devolved
into personal attacks and talk of either a pay-per-view rhyme battle
or a boxing match. Discussion of this bad blood dominated New York
rap radio for much of this year and gave a dramatic boost to Nas'
career.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent speech at a New Jersey hip-hop conference, Public
Enemy leader Chuck D attacked the "criminal element and criminal
attitude" of rappers like Ja Rule and Jay-Z. "They can't tell you the
difference between a musical note and a banknote," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jay-Z shrugs off the disapproval, attributing most of the
criticism to jealousy. "Everybody wants to come for the top guy," he
says. "That's an easy target. Everyone wants to root for the
underdog, that's just our nature. After a while, it's not cool to say
Jay-Z is hot anymore. It's like saying, 'Michael Jordan can play
basketball,' 'Michael Jackson can dance.' OK, fine, cool. I just got
to keep continuing to make great music and people will support me."</TE>
<TE>   Getting his hooks into a song</TE>
<TE>   One thing no one can deny is Jay-Z's pure rhyme skill.
Astonishingly, like his late friend and fellow Brooklynite the
Notorious B.I.G., Jay never writes anything down on paper, but
improvises his raps in the studio. "It's a gift, man," he says
quietly. "Even I'm like, damn, how the hell did I do that? Sometimes
I finish songs in like seven minutes -- three verses, hooks, and
perform it. Think it, do it, and gone right there on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe in coming in with ideas," he says. "Putting it on
paper makes it too uniform for me. It puts it between those two
margins and it locks the flow up, so I don't ever think about what
song I'm gonna make. I listen to a track and I think this track is
saying this or saying that. Or I'll think of an idea and try to find
a track that matches, but that's much harder, that's tough."</TE>
<TE>   He did finally break down and buy a Dictaphone recently so that
he'll stop losing ideas that come to him and disappear before he
makes it to the studio. "I really believe I lost about three albums'
worth of music that were in my head and I just didn't get them."</TE>
<TE>   But, Jay claims, those ideas won't be making it onto records for
much longer. His own relationship to performing has been sufficiently
ambivalent that he's talked about retiring ever since his first
album. He swears, though, that he now has his exit strategy worked
out.</TE>
<TE>   After the experimentation of "The Blueprint 2," he says he's got
one more album in him and then it will be time to move on. "My next
album will be 'The Black Album,' " he says, "and then that's it. I
want to make it a prequel to 'Reasonable Doubt,' leading up to me
having an idea for a song. I'll be saying, 'I'm going to use that
Four Tops song, "Ain't No Woman" [a reference to his breakthrough
single "Ain't No Nigga"],' and that's how the album's going to end.
I'm going to loop the whole thing back together, make it a nice
package, and that's it -- it truly, truly is. I just feel like it's
time to do something else."</TE>
<TE>   He sees his future not in the clothing line or film or even the
liquor business -- he leaves those divisions to his longtime partner
Damon Dash -- but in getting more involved in Roc-a-Fella Records.
The label has enjoyed moderate success with acts like Beanie Sigel
and Memphis Bleek, and Cam'ron's single "Hey Ma" went Top 10 this
fall, but Jay thinks that with his experience, he has more to offer
on the executive side of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I really enjoy new artists," he says. "I like watching someone
grow, watching when they first get on Letterman, hearing them say,
'I'm never going to get a chain, I ain't into it like that,' and then
next time you see them, they have eight chains. It's almost like
having a kid. I don't have any kids, but I can imagine that's what
it's like."</TE>
<TE>   As for the widespread speculation about his relationship with
Beyonce Knowles -- who's not just one of the biggest names in R&amp;B but
also a budding movie star in her own right after her role in "Austin
Powers in Goldmember" -- Jay prefers to let the music do the talking.
His new " '03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde" is a sweet declaration of love and
devotion, with a chorus featuring Jay singing the line ( taken from a
2Pac song) "All I need in this life of sin / Is me and my
girlfriend."</TE>
<TE>   His version of "no comment" goes like this: "As far as making
music, we make music -- the record is out there, listen to it. It
could be entertainment, might not be. But as far as elaborating on
the details of one's relationship, I think that's a bit much. I think
that's crossing the line as far as being an entertainer."</TE>
<TE>   He's more eager to talk about the unconventional tour he's doing
in the weeks after "The Blueprint 2" comes out -- traveling the
country, speaking at schools, acting as "Principal for a Day."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you remember the guy who came in with the fake smoke in his
lungs, to show how your lungs look after smoking?" he asks. "I
thought about that for years. I still think about it. So I'd like to
maybe be able to get to somebody and be able to affect their life. I
just want to give them my story, and my story is a long road. I want
to show them that there's at least five or six times I could have
given up before I ever made an album, tell them about perseverance
and about working hard.</TE>
<TE>   "I still beat a lot of my artists to the studio -- that should
never happen, but it does. Just tell these kids they can do anything,
and I ain't one for preaching, but I really mean it. It's sort of
like my music. I don't tell people to deal drugs or be hustlers or do
anything, I just show them my life, show them, this could happen to
you. This ain't every day, this is one in a billion."</TE>

<HD>Time to learn the next move</HD>
<DH>The Martha Graham legacy has atrophied during a long legal
battle. But a court decision may help revive her languishing dances.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne Midgette</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>New York</DL>
<LD>Four women skitter across the floor, arms held with geometric intent.
Another lone woman, exuding a quiet radiance, paces at an angle to
them, oblivious.</LD>
<LD>   "More like this," explains Terese Capucilli, rising from her seat
against a wall of the tiny, sweltering room. A former lead dancer
with the Martha Graham Dance Company, now its co-artistic director --
and expecting a baby in March -- she demonstrates to the young chorus
a gesture: a bit of the most famous movement style in the modern
dance repertory. The dancers go through the motion, echoing it,
assuming it and finally catching some of the quality that gives it
the unmistakable accent of Graham technique.</LD>
<LD>   It's almost like watching a game of Telephone, in which a
sentence, whispered from one player to another, starts to change. The
idea of owning a dance is bound up with reversing this process,
bringing the movement, intact, from another's body into yours. The
dance they're working on is "Appalachian Spring," from 1944. It
belongs to everybody -- and nobody.</LD>
<TE>   The Martha Graham Dance Company, rehearsing for its first season
in three years, at New York's Joyce Theater, is emerging from one of
the dance world's most-watched lawsuits. The company was shut down
starting in 2000 while Ron Protas, Graham's legal heir, and the board
of the Martha Graham Center and School of Contemporary Dance battled
over the rights to the Graham name and the dances she created.</TE>
<TE>   In court, Protas' argument was that Graham, in her will, left him
everything she owned. The center's argument was that Graham had
created her dances while technically a center employee, and that they
were therefore "work for hire" and belonged to the center.</TE>
<TE>   The issue has proven hotly divisive. Protas, on the one hand, is
widely loathed in the dance world, accused of manipulating Graham
when she was weak and elderly, selling off parts her legacy after her
death for his own profit, running the center into the ground.</TE>
<TE>   The term "work for hire," on the other hand, has been a red flag
to others who bristle at the idea that a choreographer should be
viewed as a mere employee of her own board.</TE>
<TE>   There was, accordingly, much debate when, on Aug. 23, U.S.
District Court Judge Miriam Cederbaum ruled in the center's favor. Of
the 70 Graham dances that can still be reconstructed, the company,
she decided, has rights to 45; commissioning organizations own five;
nine are ambiguous; and 10 -- including "Appalachian Spring" -- are
in the public domain. Protas holds rights to one.</TE>
<TE>   To the company, it's a clear-cut victory for the rights of
artists. Dancers speak of Graham's work being "liberated." "So many
individuals and companies share our excitement that the work is back
in hands of the people," says Capucilli.</TE>
<TE>   Others are not so sanguine. "It raises some serious legal issues,"
says Charles Reinhart, president of the American Dance Festival in
North Carolina, who sees the ruling as a blow against the rights of
choreographers. "Suppose ADF says, 'Wait a minute: We commissioned
her to do that work; that should belong to ADF.' We, ADF, have
commissioned 500 works. We've never said who the work belongs to."</TE>
<TE>   And Protas -- who is appealing the decision -- seems to be in a
tailspin, repeating a litany of his grievances. Graham "did not want
her name and her aesthetic controlled artistically by anyone except
me," he says. "History is being rewritten. Martha has been
misrepresented, by this board, and these people, who knew the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Advisor, caretaker, companion</TE>
<TE>   Martha Graham and Ron Protas first intersected in 1967, when he
was an aspiring twentysomething photographer and she was in her 70s,
still head of her dance company and its umbrella organization, the
center. But the pioneering grande dame of modern dance was also ill,
and uncertain about her future.</TE>
<TE>   The two were soon inseparable. "We were joined at the hip; she was
my family," says Protas, who became her advisor, caretaker and
constant companion. Graham, he says, was "terribly worried" about
attempts to displace her at the head of her empire, and Protas took
it on himself to help shore up her authority -- and by extension, his
own. He began working at the center in 1972; within a few years he
was co-director; and, as Graham's sole heir, he took over as artistic
director at her death in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   He was not, however, popular with many of the dancers or board
members. "Ron mistreated people," says Elizabeth Auclair, who joined
the company that same year. "A lot of fear was generated; very rough
energy. The environment was very difficult to work in."</TE>
<TE>   That effect wasn't lost on the larger dance community. "In May
'97," says Francis Mason, chairman emeritus of the Graham board,
"Protas called me up and said, 'Will you please go to see the
Harkness Foundation? They normally give us $20,000.' " Mason says he
and the center chairman, Judy Schlosser, met with Ted Bartwink, head
of the foundation, and were told that Protas was a stumbling block,
that they weren't going to be able to raise money with him in place.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Look, he's her heir,' " Mason continues. "And he said,
'Does he own it?' When Martha died, we all should have asked it."</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be the $64,000 question. The wording of the will
even left it open. "All ... tangible personal property ... if owned
by me at the time of my death, I give and bequeath to my said friend
Ron Protas," it states. As early as 1992, Protas' own lawyers
suggested he needed to establish exactly what copyrights Graham had
owned at her death.</TE>
<TE>   That suggestion would come back to haunt him when he sued the
center in 2001. He and the board were already in a state of open
warfare. The board had tried to cajole him onto the sidelines for
several years, says Marvin Preston, who became the center's executive
director in March 2000. Protas responded by setting up a trust to
license the Graham dances to the center; the trustees signed on,
thinking Protas would then step aside as artistic director.</TE>
<TE>   Protas, however, wasn't budging. Meanwhile, the company was in
ever direr financial straits. In 1999, the Graham building on East
63rd Street was sold. Even that couldn't fix the cash flow problem.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000 things came to a head. The trustees voted to remove Protas
as artistic director in March; in June, they voted him off the board
altogether. At the same time, they suspended operations at the nearly
bankrupt center. Protas' reaction was swift. He notified the center
that the licensing agreement was withdrawn. And in January 2001, when
the school resumed operations, "he immediately filed a lawsuit for
use of the name, use of the dances, everything," says Preston.</TE>
<TE>   In the course of the trial, the center's lawyers offered evidence
-- old income tax returns, personal letters -- that Graham had
transferred rights in her dances to the center when she set it up in
1956. As late as the '70s, a number of documents echoed that the
center, not Graham personally, held the rights.</TE>
<TE>   Those documents persuaded Cederbaum. Protas was "not a credible
witness," she wrote in the ruling. A part of the ruling stipulates
that he pay back to the center $87,000 he personally netted from
selling some of the Graham archive to the Library of Congress. In the
end, he was left with a single dance, "Seraphic Dialogue," because
the center had neglected to renew the copyright, so it had reverted
back to its creator.</TE>
<TE>   Two roads to the future</TE>
<TE>   Despite the worries in the dance community, the nature of the
Graham decision -- grounded in specific ownership documentation,
dance by dance -- makes it unlikely that the center's win will
impinge on choreographers' rights. Choreographers just need to make
their claims clear -- "a one-line statement will do it," Preston says
-- to assure their rights, on paper at least.</TE>
<TE>   And, ultimately, the dance world debate over the battle may be
more about underlying issues than the particulars of Cederbaum's
findings.</TE>
<TE>   The living heads of America's major dance companies -- Merce
Cunningham, Paul Taylor, Twyla Tharp -- are facing, more or less
urgently, the same questions the Graham case raises: What remains of
a choreographer's art after he or she is gone? What does it mean to
"own" a dance? How can any dance legacy be protected and preserved?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think artists have faced this clearly," says Senta
Driver, a former choreographer and active board member of the Dance
Notation Bureau, which preserves dances by writing them down. "It's
cumbersome to keep dance alive, to keep it coached. The issue isn't
solved by leaving the rights explicitly to your dog."</TE>
<TE>   People who care about Graham's work inevitably care about how it
will be carried on. Even before the suit, many observers questioned
whether anyone could fully re-create the charged emotionalism that
was a Graham hallmark -- without the intensity of Graham herself.</TE>
<TE>   The Graham company intends to try. Preston plans to notate and
archive all the dances available to him, restoring and updating old
video footage. And, although specific plans for a tour after the
Joyce season are not firm, he also wants the company to dance full
time. "As broke as we are," he says, "you either stay small or you
fill City Center. You don't have any in between."</TE>
<TE>   Protas means to try, as well. "I don't care how silly people want
to make me seem," he says. "You take the period after Martha died and
read the reviews. They were good. People didn't like me -- I would
say, 'You're leaving out part of the choreography,' or 'This is
wrong' -- but I was right."</TE>
<TE>   His plan is to establish a new trust with a new name -- "Ron
Protas Martha Graham," he suggests -- and devote himself to raising
money "to set performances of her work to her standards," with former
Graham dancers who are willing to work with him. And, of course,
there is his appeal. His lawyer, Judd Burstein, calls it a strong
case: "The trial court," he says, "completely misapplied the law."</TE>
<TE>   Headed back to the stage</TE>
<TE>   IN May 2002, in the middle of the trial, the Graham company
reconstituted for a single, illicit and highly charged performance in
New York City. In September, after the ruling, the dancers took part
in a three-week workshop on "Appalachian Spring" and "Chronicle."
Then they went into rehearsals for the Joyce season in January.</TE>
<TE>   "The rehearsal period is longer than we ever had," says Christine
Dakin, another company dancer and the troupe's other artistic
director, "but we have so many new people." More than half of the 27
dancers are new, although all came up through the school. And the
Joyce season involves 15 ballets from eight decades, from "Heretic"
(1929) to "Maple Leaf Rag" (1990). "The pressure now is not just
about learning a step," Dakin says, "we hope that it will sink into
their bones."</TE>
<TE>   In 2003, the company will take over a new home, at its old
address, moving into space within the building that was erected at
the former Graham site. Occupying the same space, yet with a new
appearance and structure: It's an appropriate metaphor for a group
whose future is still open.</TE>
<TE>   "We did the easy part -- we won," says Dakin. "Now all we have to
do is the hard part -- keep the company alive."</TE>

<HD>With all its hang-ups, the L.A. gallery scene thrives</HD>
<DH>It may suffer from an inferiority complex and urban sprawl,
but it still has an impact in the nation's second city for the visual
arts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzanne Muchnic</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The art gallery season got off to a slow start this fall with two
dozen openings scattered from Santa Monica to Chinatown. But that was
only the first week of September. More than 50 additional galleries
launched new shows during the following week. And by the end of the
month, another two dozen commercial showcases had geared up and
opened new attractions.</LD>
<LD>   If the annual ritual sneaks up on the city and ultimately offers
much more than meets any one set of eyes, it reflects the gallery
scene at large. Sprinkled across a vast swath of territory and tucked
into everything from tacky storefronts and defunct factories to
gleaming white architectural jewel boxes, L.A.'s archipelago of
galleries doesn't look like a critical mass. And no, it's not New
York, which has four times as many galleries -- densely packed.</LD>
<LD>   But despite its endemic sprawl and persistent inferiority complex,
Los Angeles is the nation's second city for the visual arts, and
commercial galleries are a vital part of the scene. With nearly 100
that present public exhibition programs and keep their doors open
during regular hours, Los Angeles is second only to Manhattan and
well ahead of Chicago, its closest competitor, which has about 60
comparable galleries.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't see the growth because we live here, but it's
astounding," says Douglas Chrismas, a high-end dealer who has
operated Ace Galleries in Los Angeles for 36 years, maintains a
cavernous second-floor space in the mid-Wilshire district and is
about to expand in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Operating a gallery anywhere is much more likely to be a labor of
love than a lucrative business. For every art dealer who makes a
comfortable living at it, there's one who holds down a day job or
depends on a backer to pay the overhead. And many an exhibition of
new, hard-to-sell art is financed by back-room sales of more
conventional works. Particularly in Los Angeles -- where the fine
arts are always overshadowed by the film industry {mdash} keeping an
art gallery afloat isn't a job for the weak or the practical.</TE>
<TE>   "At times it feels like such an indulgence," says veteran dealer
Margo Leavin, who presents museum-like exhibitions of contemporary
art at her pristine, light-filled gallery on Robertson Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "We deal with the ultimate discretionary goods," says Louis Stern,
who offers Impressionist, modern and contemporary art at his cozily
elegant showcase on Melrose Avenue. "Art is the last thing anybody
needs."</TE>
<TE>   Still, art-impassioned visionaries and entrepreneurs have figured
out ways to survive. Half a dozen notable galleries have been in
business in Los Angeles for more than 30 years, and an additional two
dozen have chalked up at least 15 years. And the pace is
accelerating: More than 30 local galleries that currently attract
critical interest have opened during the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   The secret? It's partly a matter of setting up shop in a major
center of art production, where the art schools are arguably the best
in the nation, the supply of new art is plentiful and affordable
space is available.</TE>
<TE>   After that, what separates most of the galleries that last from
those that don't are brand and reach. You need a distinctive niche
or, in most cases, a niche within the niche of contemporary art that
dominates L.A.'s scene: photography, Latin American art or
international blue-chip work, say. And once you set yourself up to
show locally, you need to sell globally and maybe even establish a
related business.</TE>
<TE>   British gentility by the beach</TE>
<TE>   At L.A. Louver, now in its 27th year in Venice, the niche isn't
the look of the art. It's an attitude of high purpose and British
gentility, improbably ensconced at the beach. This is where dealer
Peter Goulds and his associate, Kimberly Davis, show the work of Los
Angeles artists in, as Goulds puts it, "an international context."</TE>
<TE>   On any given day, visitors may find an exhibition of David
Hockney's exuberant landscapes, Kenneth Price's otherworldly ceramic
sculptures or Gajin Fujita's cheeky mergers of East L.A. graffiti and
Japanese prints {mdash} all made in L.A. Or they may encounter
British painter Leon Kossoff's dour portraits or Argentine artist
Guillermo Kuitca's melancholy musings on the nature of loss.
Disparate as their work may appear, the artists share "a deeply
rooted sense of art history," Goulds says.</TE>
<TE>   A transplanted Englishman who moved to Los Angeles 30 years ago to
teach graphic design at UCLA, Goulds became fascinated with the art
being produced in Los Angeles. He decided to open a gallery and chose
a beach-side spot on Venice Boulevard because many artists lived and
worked nearby.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that if I could present a serious program, there would
be a serious audience here," he says. "Rents were low, and I had
modest means. I thought I could compete with established galleries on
La Cienega and Santa Monica boulevards on a low budget."</TE>
<TE>   As the business grew -- to as much as $12 million in annual gross
sales -- he added an international flavor to his exhibition program,
expanded into six buildings sprinkled around the neighborhood and
briefly branched out in New York. In 1993, amid a sagging economy, he
retrenched in Southern California and consolidated his operation. Two
years later he opened the gallery's current home, an elegant
two-story building designed by L.A. architect Frederick Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   About 10 miles northeast of L.A. Louver, Regen Projects has carved
out its niche in a clunky little cement block structure behind a West
Hollywood upholstery shop. It may look like an ad hoc operation, but
it's as hot as L.A.'s art scene gets. And it's about to expand into
an adjacent building on Almont Drive, more than tripling its
exhibition space.</TE>
<TE>   The 13-year-old gallery was founded by Stuart Regen, who died in
1998 of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, at 39. His mother, Barbara Gladstone,
is a leading contemporary art dealer in New York, and Regen had
extensive experience in the field before he opened his own gallery in
Los Angeles. He and his wife, Shaun Caley Regen, built a critically
acclaimed exhibition program, and she has maintained the gallery's
reputation for being first with the most talked-about contemporary
art.</TE>
<TE>   It's all meant to feel "very essential," Caley Regen says. "It's
art that appeals to the intelligence, nourishes society and
transforms our vision."</TE>
<TE>   That philosophy has produced an edgy mix that encompasses
Catherine Opie's photographs, Lari Pittman's paintings and Charles
Ray's sculpture. In perhaps its greatest coup, in 1991, the gallery
presented the debut solo show for Matthew Barney, a then-unknown
24-year-old New Yorker who soon catapulted to international acclaim
and created an art-world sensation with his "Cremaster" films.</TE>
<TE>   There are more easily defined niches as well. With about a dozen
galleries, photography is a major L.A. specialty. And at Bergamot
Station in Santa Monica, the Frank Lloyd Gallery occupies another
distinctive slot: top-of-the-line contemporary ceramics.</TE>
<TE>   Because his gallery is "the only ongoing ceramics exhibition space
in Southern California," Lloyd says he has "an obligation to present
museum-quality exhibitions and operate as an educational facility" as
well to pay the bills by selling art. His pristine space offers
ceramics publications and examples of works by many artists as well
as a program of solo shows.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd got his start with Garth Clark, a leading ceramics dealer
and scholar who ran a gallery in Los Angeles from 1981 to 1995, along
with the gallery he continues to operate in New York. When Lloyd
opened his own gallery, in 1996, he decided to focus on major
California figures -- Peter Voulkos, John Mason and Paul Soldner,
whose work revolutionized the field in the 1950s and '60s -- and
their successors. That remains his primary mission, but he has
expanded the exhibition program to include ceramics from elsewhere in
the United States and from Europe, Asia and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Always on the go</TE>
<TE>   Once they have established their identity at home, most Los
Angeles dealers get out of town regularly.</TE>
<TE>   "Galleries do not thrive in any city if they rely exclusively on a
local audience," Goulds says. Like many of his Los Angeles
colleagues, he makes about half of his sales to out-of-state clients,
but that was also the case when he operated a gallery in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Caley Regen makes roughly 80% of her sales to Southern California
collectors -- an unusually high percentage -- but travels frequently
to attend openings of her artists' out-of-town exhibitions and to
show their work at fairs. "I feel like I spend 50% of my time in
airplanes," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She is among 14 L.A. dealers who are gearing up to show their
wares at the Dec. 5-8 debut of Art Basel Miami Beach, a U.S. offshoot
of the venerable Swiss fair Art Basel.</TE>
<TE>   "Art fairs are crucial to expanding your audience, especially if
you are on the West Coast," says Kristin Rey, who operates Sandroni
Rey, a contemporary art gallery in Venice, with Tara Sandroni.</TE>
<TE>   Other Los Angeles dealers expand their gallery business through
related enterprises that require travel. Stephen Cohen organizes
photography fairs in Los Angeles; Santa Fe, N.M.; and San Francisco.
Robert Berman operates an art auction firm. Cirrus Gallery is
affiliated with Cirrus Editions, a leading publisher of artists'
prints. Remba Gallery is an offshoot of Mixografia, which produces
limited-edition works on handmade paper.</TE>
<TE>   Photography dealer David Fahey, who operates the Fahey/Klein
Gallery on La Brea Avenue with partner Ken Devlin, organizes
traveling photography exhibitions accompanied by gallery-produced
books. "If I just send a show to London, I have a 1-in-10 chance of
getting significant press," Fahey says. "If I do a book and send the
artist, I have a good chance of getting coverage in the London Sunday
Times. I sell the books, and the books help to sell the prints."</TE>
<TE>   High art amid pop culture</TE>
<TE>   None of this is easy, but many dealers are committed.</TE>
<TE>   "It might seem obvious to move to New York, but for me it's not
worth it," says Christopher Grimes, who shows works by an
international mix of artists at his gallery in Santa Monica. "If you
choose to have a gallery here, you lose the power structure and
competitive sense of New York and its proximity to Europe, but you
gain a quality of life and great artists."</TE>
<TE>   Having an art gallery is "a subscription to a way of life," Goulds
says. "If you just want to make money, you'll get nowhere fast."</TE>
<TE>   And labors of love bring rewards.</TE>
<TE>   "This business is a trap," says Patricia Faure, whose personal
charm and stellar track record have made her the beloved grande dame
of Bergamot Station. "If one show doesn't work, you always think the
next one will," she says. "But next to having a child, this is the
best thing I've ever done."</TE>
<TE>   As for plying high art in a pop culture town, it isn't all bad.
Stars don't line up at their doors, but many dealers do a big chunk
of their local business with collectors who work behind the scenes in
the entertainment industry. And there's something to be said for
operating out of the limelight.</TE>
<TE>   "We're eclipsed by the Hollywood glare, but I think that's a
healthy thing," Caley Regen says. "We can all just do our work."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a decade ago, Priority Records made a name for itself with
a notorious song by Compton rap group N.W.A titled after a common
epithet directed at police.</LD>
<LD>   Now, a new company with roots in Priority's legacy is firing the
same invective at the music industry.</LD>
<LD>   Believing the music business has gotten off track in marketing and
development issues as well as in its fight against Internet
downloading, the new independent label M.S.C. Music &amp; Entertainment
is starting a campaign called F.T.I., the acronym for its broadside
against "the industry."</LD>
<TE>   The effort gets off the ground this week with the company's first
album, "Absolute Power" by Kansas City rapper Tech N9ne, a highly
respected figure in hip-hop circles but one without a big national
profile. The album was officially released in September, but full
promotion is just kicking into gear now.</TE>
<TE>   It's a two-pronged effort: First, promotion will bypass
conventional radio and video avenues in favor of direct marketing via
TV commercials; second and more controversially, M.S.C. is
encouraging fans to download the entire album for free over Tech
N9ne's Web site (www.therealtechn9ne.com).</TE>
<TE>   "The major labels are involved in lawsuits against file-sharing
companies, and the [Recording Industry Assn. of America] has an ad
campaign guilting fans into not downloading," says Dave Weiner,
senior vice president of M.S.C., which was founded by Mark Cerami,
co-founder of Priority. "We believe that if you have a quality album
and let people get it for free, it will translate into sales.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's asking the same questions -- is the Internet good or
bad for music?" Weiner adds. "We're willing to try this and we hope
it works, and if not we'll walk away."</TE>
<TE>   M.S.C. is hedging its bet a bit: The new retail version of the
album includes seven bonus tracks not on the original album -- nor on
the downloadable version -- plus a DVD.</TE>
<TE>   M.S.C. has the enthusiastic support of its distributor, Sony-owned
RED, which specializes in independent labels.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably going to be a little hard for some people to
swallow," says RED President Ken Antonelli.</TE>
<TE>   "But ultimately, if the music gets into more people's hands that's
good, and [Tech N9ne] is in ads encouraging people to support him out
in the field at retail. If it's real, people will buy it."</TE>
<TE>   Central (Valley) casting: Log on</TE>
<TE>   Modesto band Grandaddy has given at least some alt-rock buzz to
California's Central Valley. Now the group is hoping to give a boost
to other acts from the region by starting its own label.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the company Sweat of the Alps, Grandaddy will at first
sell CDs only via its Web site (www.grandaddylandscape.com) starting
in early December, and later will explore putting them in stores. The
label's first release will be by Tracy, Calif., band Arm of Roger,
with a second in the works from Oakdale-based group Built Like
Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   "Like everything we do, it starts with a little idea," says
Grandaddy multi-instrumentalist Jim Fairchild. "It turns out there's
a decent amount of traffic that goes through our Web site, and plenty
of bands out there that might deserve more attention than they're
getting."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Grandaddy is halfway done with its own new album, the
follow-up to the wry, yet lush and somber music of 2000's acclaimed
"The Sophtware Slump."</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for a May release on V2 Records. Fairchild says the
album has turned into an ambitious project, with a filmmaker working
on visuals to go with each song.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if we could get more orchestral in approach than in
the past, but we're trying," he says. "It will be very difficult to
replicate the stuff live."</TE>
<TE>   Small faces</TE>
<TE>   He may or may not be dressed as Santa Claus, but Offspring singer
Dexter Holland will be on hand Dec. 7 to help with Christmas shopping
ideas at the Xmas Warehouse Sale being put on by Nitro Records and EC
Star Clothing. Of course, Holland owns Nitro (with a catalog
including Offspring, AFI the Vandals and the Damned), so he does have
a vested interest. The two-day sale starts Dec. 6 at the EC Star
Warehouse in Costa Mesa. For details and location, go to
www.nitrorecords.com.</TE>
<TE>   Former Flying Burrito Brothers pedal steel player Sneaky Pete
Kleinow and the Band's keyboardist Garth Hudson have joined
country-rock veterans Tommy Spurlock and Carlton Moody, along with
newcomer singer Willie Watson, to form Burrito Deluxe. The group is
working on an album titled "Georgia Peach," a tribute to Burrito
Brothers founder Gram Parsons, who died in 1973. Gillian Welch and
David Rawlings are guests on the album, due Feb. 25, as are former
Burrito fiddler Floyd "Gib" Guilbeau and bassist Barry Bales of
Alison Krauss' Union Station.</TE>

<LD>Snoop Dogg, "Paid Tha Cost to Be Da Bo$$" (Priority) ***</LD>
<LD>   As one of the most charismatic rappers to emerge from Los Angeles,
Snoop Dogg has been able to establish himself as a kingpin of West
Coast hip-hop despite releasing some questionable material throughout
his decade-long career.</LD>
<LD>   With his sixth studio album (due in stores Tuesday), the rapper
regains the reserved force that made him such a compelling figure in
the early 1990s. Dr. Dre, his producer from those days, is nowhere to
be seen on "Paid," and he's hardly missed. Omnipresent producers the
Neptunes provide synthesized funk for "From Tha Chuuch to Da Palace"
and give a breezy feel to the gangster love ballad "Beautiful." Snoop
even raps a surprisingly straight-up soulful love song on the bluesy
"I Believe in You," which features soaring vocals from the impressive
Latoiya Williams.</LD>
<TE>   But make no mistake: This is a decidedly hard-core affair. Snoop
blasts his former record label boss Marion "Suge" Knight as well as
onetime friends Kurupt and Xzibit, and his rough rhymes on "From Long
Beach 2 Brick City" rock harder than Nirvana. When he slips into his
pimp persona, Snoop oozes extra charm, evidenced on the lively
blaxploitation vibe of "Lollipop." Snoop earns the "Bo$$" title.</TE>
<TE>   Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   McGraw scares up pop-rock spirits</TE>
<TE>   Tim McGraw, "Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors" (Curb), ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   McGRAW'S roots are showing on his seventh and most ambitious album
(due Tuesday). That's no shot at his hair, just recognition of the
'70s pop and rock ghosts that lurk within many of the songs.</TE>
<TE>   His album-closing take on Elton John's "Tiny Dancer" is more cover
than remake, one final tip of a Stetson that's doffed in other songs
to Jimmy Buffett, Billy Joel, the Eagles and Hall &amp; Oates.</TE>
<TE>   There's no seismic shift here, nothing like the move from country
to pop, soul and R&amp;B that his wife Faith Hill takes on her latest
album. But there's a welcome effort in several songs -- all by
outside writers -- to reach beyond the formula-bound numbers he's
turned into hit after hit over the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   He edges toward social commentary with the first single, "Red
Ragtop," a remembrance of an affair that ends, it's implied, after an
abortion. The more politically pointed "Who Are They" breezily takes
on the collective "they" that dictates society's do's and don'ts.</TE>
<TE>   With 15 songs, the album is too generous, and he would have made a
more forceful case for his musical growth if he'd dropped the
overblown arena-rock ballad "She's My Kind of Rain" and left the Hank
Jr.-esque chest thumping in "Real Good Man" to Toby Keith.</TE>
<TE>   -- Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   System up to its provocative ways</TE>
<TE>   System of a Down, "Steal This Album" American/Columbia) *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   With its manic yet rapturous instrumentation and politically
charged themes, System of a Down's 2001 album "Toxicity" was a real
breakthrough for the L.A. band, and a striking example of how
unpredictable and inspiring metallic music can be.</TE>
<TE>   "Steal This Album" (due Tuesday) isn't exactly new -- it gathers
material from the "Toxicity" sessions with older compositions in a
melodic and menacing collection that provides a link between the
band's initial wacky aggression and its current role as fiery social
commentator.</TE>
<TE>   From crazed rants to grim political anthems, this relentless
recording is in some ways even more provocative and diverse than its
predecessor. It's also more hook-driven. Singer Serj Tankian's
animated croons have an operatic quality, especially when melded with
guitarist Daron Malakian's higher-pitched howls. Their harrowing
harmonies and weird, repetitive vocal effects alternately glide and
grind against chugging guitars and their signature mix of Middle
Eastern rhythms and punk tempos.</TE>
<TE>   -- Lina Lecaro</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez handy with Lara songs</TE>
<TE>   Vicente Fernandez, "35 Aniversario, Lo Mejor de Lara" (Sony
Discos) ***</TE>
<TE>   On his new album (in stores Tuesday), Mexico's long-reigning king
of mariachi changes his charro suit for a tuxedo to interpret the
romantic standards of the late Agustin Lara, the urbane composer who
dominated Mexican pop music in the pre-rock era.</TE>
<TE>   Lara was a prodigious songwriter who left a legacy of classic
songs, many of them considered shocking at the time. "Perevertida,"
included in this collection, is a yearning ode to a woman he loves
"although people call you perverted."</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez tones down his normally booming voice to evoke the
aching textures of Lara's futile loves, as well as the tenderness of
his graceful tribute to true love, "Solamente Una Vez." Fans will
also recognize the jaunty "Maria Bonita," dedicated to mercurial
actress Maria Felix, with whom Lara had a tempestuous relationship.
Glaringly absent is "Noche de Ronda," Lara's famous song of
heartbreak and lonely nights.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez's elegant backing mariachi is enhanced with orchestral
strings, horns and light percussion, though a tune such as "Veracruz"
could use a touch more tropical sway. But that's a minor quibble in
an otherwise classy production.</TE>
<TE>   -- Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   In brief</TE>
<TE>   The Roots, "Phrenology" (MCA) *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   As hip-hop's premier live band, this Grammy-winning sextet is
renowned for jazzy, organic grooves and taut, sociopolitical
lyricism. On this wildly experimental sixth album (due Tuesday), they
flirt with Hendrix-inspired cacophony (the 10-minute-plus "Water")
and mosh-pit hard-core amid the thoughtful verses and soulful
arrangements. Contributions from Cody Chesnutt and neo-soul singer
Musiq contribute to the Roots' most accessible and enjoyable release
yet.</TE>
<TE>   -- Scott T. Sterling</TE>
<TE>   Joni Mitchell,  "Travelogue" (Nonesuch) ***</TE>
<TE>   The superb singer-songwriter shows us another side of her music in
this two-disc set by revisiting some of her older tunes (including
"For the Roses" and "Amelia") and more recent ones with the help of a
70-member orchestra and 20-voice choir. The added weight of the
arrangements makes some of the tracks feel strained, but the overall
effect is liberating and revealing.</TE>
<TE>   -- Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   Ja Rule, "The Last Temptation" (Def Jam) ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Hip-hop's preeminent thug lover has added his gruff crooning and
rapping to songs by everyone from J. Lo to Mary J. Blige. On his
fourth album, Rule serves up the same type of coarse love songs
("Thug Lovin'," "Mesmerize") and hard-core manifestos ("The Pledge
Remix," "Connected") that have become his staple. Though these catchy
songs work well on radio, Rule's simple lyrics and his
tormented-artist routine aren't always as stimulating.</TE>
<TE>   -- S.B.</TE>
<TE>   Matchbox Twenty, "More Than You Think You Are"
(Melismatic/Atlantic) **</TE>
<TE>   The title notwithstanding, this Florida band's third album is less
than you'd hope it might be. Melodic hooks still abound -- "All I
Need" is a pure pop delight -- and singer Rob Thomas' voice is as
easy as ever on the ears, but Matchbox is still in search of a third
dimension to make most of its songs come alive.</TE>
<TE>   -- R.L.</TE>
<TE>   Sum 41, "Does This Look Infected?" (Island/Def Jam) **</TE>
<TE>   On their third release (in stores Tuesday), the bad boys from
Canada show they aren't growing up any time soon. They're still
hurling bratty punk baubles bulging with mischievous attitude and
punk-pop energy, but aside from bulking up a few tunes with the
metallic muscle toyed with on their hit debut, "All Killer, No
Filler," this release just feels like a rowdy recap.</TE>
<TE>   L.L.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are already
released unless otherwise noted.</TE>

<DH>London's wildly popular 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' is borne
up by a flying auto and nostalgia-fueled audiences.</DH>

<AU>Robin Rauzi</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>London</DL>
<LD>A very un-British thing happens during the finale of the West End
musical "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang." Everyone in the London Palladium
stands up and, with no discernible prompting from the stage, begins
to clap in time and sing: "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you!"</LD>
<LD>   "It happened from the very first preview," said Nichola McAuliffe,
who plays the wicked Baroness Bomburst in this $10-million adaptation
of the 1968 movie. "We assumed it was a lot of Americans."</LD>
<LD>   Nope, not yet. Right now it's largely the British, who, in a
climate of depressed international tourism, made the upbeat and
flashy "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang" a box-office record breaker at the
2,300-seat Palladium, where it's been playing to full houses since
opening in April. It's probably only a matter of time until "Chitty"
-- the story of a flying car and its caretakers -- turns its
red-and-gold wings toward Broadway.</LD>
<TE>   Though a stage version of a story about a flying car might seem an
unlikely choice, the fusion of spectacle and nostalgia was a powerful
draw. "Chitty" has sold more tickets in advance of its opening than
any other show in West End history, according to its producers.</TE>
<TE>   Singer Michael Ball, who created the role of Marius in "Les
Miserables" but works mostly in concert settings, stars as Caractacus
Potts. Also in the West End cast are Olivier Award winners Anton
Rogers as Grandpa Potts and Edward Petherbridge as the Toymaker and
Brian Blessed as Baron Bomburst. The Childcatcher was originated by
Richard O'Brien of "Rocky Horror Show" fame and is being played
through Dec. 7 by Paul O'Grady, who is perhaps better known as his
drag alter ego Lily Savage.</TE>
<TE>   When reviews came in, they were mixed, though generally good for
many critics not known for their kindness toward musical comedies.
Alistair Macaulay of the Financial Times actually kicked off his
review, "I am bewildered by how much I love the new stage version of
'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,' " though it struck the Daily Telegraph's
Charles Spencer as "a show with a big budget where its heart should
be."</TE>
<TE>   But they all agreed on one thing: the car. The car soars.</TE>
<TE>   Adventure and whimsy</TE>
<TE>   The film, which starred Dick Van Dyke as goofy inventor Caractacus
Potts, has proven remarkably durable, despite an undeniable weirdness
and a roster of not particularly memorable songs. The original story
came from Ian Fleming, who wrote it for his son. Cubby Broccoli, who
had acquired the rights to Fleming's 14 James Bond novels as well as
"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang," took a break from the spy film series to
produce the film musical.</TE>
<TE>   "How on Earth Cubby Broccoli saw in that novel that it would make
a great musical I'll never know," said Adrian Noble, who directed the
London production. "He brought Roald Dahl on board, which I've always
thought was a really inspired piece of producing."</TE>
<TE>   Dahl would infuse the "Chitty" movie with the same qualities found
in his own work, most prominently "Charlie and the Chocolate
Factory": children on a fantastic adventure, whimsical machines and
disturbingly dark overtones. The villains, Baron and Baroness
Bomburst, rule the fictional European country Vulgaria, where they
have outlawed children and have them rounded up nightly by their
sinister henchman, the Childcatcher.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Sams, who was commissioned by the Broccolis to adapt the
movie into a stage musical in the late 1990s, remembered being struck
by the rawness of that allegory when he watched the film again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's interesting how those Holocaust overtones in the early '60s
were totally undigested, when people were still alive who went
through it but weren't writing or talking about it.... It was just
absolutely in the zeitgeist. They might not have even noticed. And
it's really horrible, that Childcatcher. He doesn't say he kills the
children, but he makes them disappear."</TE>
<TE>   Overlying the whole adventure of finding, fixing and flying "our
fine four-fendered friend" are melodies by Richard M. Sherman and
Robert B. Sherman -- the Oscar-winning songwriters behind "Mary
Poppins" and one of the most widely translated songs on Earth, "It's
a Small World (After All)." The Sherman brothers also wrote songs for
many of Walt Disney's best-known children's films of the 1960s,
including "The Jungle Book."</TE>
<TE>   To see the fusion of these elements, consider Caractacus' love
interest. Her name is absolute Ian Fleming: Truly Scrumptious. Her
family owns an elaborate candy factory (ahem, Roald Dahl), and she
leads the ensemble in a relentlessly upbeat Sherman Brothers anthem
to the candy stick flute. ("A bonbon to blow on at last has been
found!")</TE>
<TE>   "The original is a very strange film. I think they were all on
drugs," Sams said. "It's astonishing. Psychedelic. It's Roald Dahl.
Questions that one asks about story were not asked in any way. Things
just happened, and then if they were too incredible, they just became
dream sequences."</TE>
<TE>   None of that would wash in a big-budget West End musical. Sams,
first on his own and then with director Noble, would have to rebuild
"Chitty" in such a way that it looked familiar but was a more
comfortable theatrical ride. Always, all involved knew "Chitty Chitty
Bang Bang" had to fly right off the stage.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it couldn't just fly, said Noble. It had to be
awe-inspiring. It had to be better than the movie. "If it wasn't
going to be that, then what's the point?"</TE>
<TE>   Aimed at young people</TE>
<TE>   It was around November 2000 when Noble, artistic director of the
Royal Shakespeare Company for 12 years, signed on to direct. Noble
was in the midst of a major overhaul of the RSC, changing the entire
operational structure, altering actors' contracts and pushing a plan
to demolish and replace the Royal Shakespeare Theater in
Stratford-upon-Avon. Some members of the theater press in London were
harshly critical of everything: his ideas, the execution, his
sabbatical to direct "Chitty," his failure to make the RSC a
producing partner.</TE>
<TE>   Consensus among the "Chitty" crew is that Noble was exactly right
for this project. Actress McAuliffe, who worked with Noble before on
"The King and I," remarked that it was his diplomacy as much as his
intelligence that were needed. "What's necessary is to bring all the
departments and elements together. You need a strength of character
that is warm inside a velvet glove."</TE>
<TE>   (Noble announced last April, shortly after "Chitty" debuted, that
he would step down from the RSC when his contract ends in March
2003.)</TE>
<TE>   "I saw it as an opportunity to create something that was very
special ... on the one hand to use modern technology, but on the
other hand, [it] was a warm story with vivid characters and lovely,
lovely melodies," Noble said. "When young people go to the theater
for the first time, we have the responsibility to delight them in a
really special way. We want them to come back and back."</TE>
<TE>   During June 2001, Noble, Sams and the Sherman brothers gathered in
the den at the Los Angeles home of Barbara Broccoli (Cubby's
daughter, who now produces the James Bond films) and her husband,
Frederick Zollo, also a theater and movie producer. They bounced
around ideas for scenes and new songs. When one of them said, for
instance, "It takes teamwork to make a dream work," Sams commented
that that would make a great song. And the Shermans just wrote it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like something out of a Mickey Rooney movie," Zollo said.
In addition to rearranging scenes and resurrecting songs cut from the
film, the Sherman brothers wrote four new songs that were added to
Act 2.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the real treats was watching these guys write a hit song,"
Noble said. "They quite literally created it before our eyes.
Sometimes they'd write a number and I'd say it doesn't quite work,
and they'd just say, 'OK,' and try again."</TE>
<TE>   Making Chitty fly</TE>
<TE>   Back in England, the nuts and bolts of making Chitty fly were
getting sorted out in a warehouse in Norfolk, where designer Anthony
Ward was halfway through developing the flying car. It would
eventually take nearly a year to perfect the mechanism that launches
Chitty up off the stage, out past the orchestra pit and dips the car
over the first two rows of seats -- to immediate and irrepressible
applause at the end of Act 1.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone involved deftly avoids spelling out exactly how Chitty
defies gravity. The mechanics that fly the car through the air, and
the lighting that makes it so convincing, however, are only part of
what makes the stunt work. The rest of the magic is supplied by an
auditorium full of expectation.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it doesn't fly, it's a simple theatrical device," Sams
said. "But by the end of Act 1, we know and love the character of the
car and the people in it. And they're in mortal danger, and the only
way they can escape is for the car to fly, so we will it up there.
Nobody is really looking for the mechanism that makes it so. Why
would they? We the audience are actually making it so."</TE>
<TE>   The flying Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (which, by the way, has seat
belts for up to five passengers) is but one of the stunts that make
the musical a full-fledged spectacle. There's also a chorus of 34,
not including dozens of children, miniature cars and zeppelins, and
some 20 trained dogs.</TE>
<TE>   The producers come from the can-do culture of film. And not just
any movies, James Bond movies. They don't easily accept that a stunt
can't be done. When, for instance, Barbara Broccoli suggested that
the Childcatcher be caught in a net and hoisted through the top of
the theater's ceiling -- more than 100 feet up -- the initial
reaction was no, you can't do that. "She was quiet for about 20
seconds," Sams recalled, "and then they said, 'Well ... we could have
a go.' "</TE>
<TE>   Zollo is confident that within a year "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"
will have found a spot to park on Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   And while a New York version could cost up to $20 million to stage
-- rivaling the $25-million budget of "The Lion King" -- Broadway
tickets sell for more than those on the West End, where tickets top
out at 40 pounds, about $65. The Broadway hit "The Producers," by
contrast, has a top ticket price of $100.</TE>
<TE>   They're in early talks with theaters, hoping to find a space that,
like the 2,300-seat Palladium, is big enough for "Chitty" to spread
its wings. In the right setting, Chitty could fly out even farther
over the audience and do a few other yet-unused maneuvers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fantastic," Noble said. "I tell you, we could just sell
rides."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What we said then</TE>
<TE>   "There's singing, dancing, some ingratiating people and all manner
of visual delight, but this fantasy about the adventures of an
eccentric inventor (Dick Van Dyke) and his magical automobile too
often huffs and puffs when it should be chugging along.</TE>
<TE>   "In short, it suffers from all the chronic ailments of
blockbusters: It's too long, the production numbers are so lavish and
numerous they begin to cancel each other out, and the songs, though
pleasantly functional, are not really memorable.</TE>
<TE>   "So much for the drawbacks. None of them is likely to faze the
children for which this film is a natural or those adults who prefer
Disney-type entertainment. Indeed, among the year-end deluge of films
it is one of the very few suitable for kids and appropriate to the
holiday season." -- Kevin Thomas, Los Angeles Times, Dec. 18, 1968,
on the film "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"</TE>

<HD>Ex-publisher on a mission to reengage the citizenry</HD>

<LD>Jay Harris triggered debate and soul-searching throughout the
newspaper industry last year when he abruptly quit as publisher of
the San Jose Mercury News. Continuing reductions in staff and news
space mandated by the paper's owner, Knight Ridder, were leading to
an erosion of quality, and Harris said he could no longer tolerate
the company's willingness to sacrifice its longtime commitment to
journalistic excellence on the altar of higher corporate profits.</LD>
<LD>   Overnight, Harris became every journalism organization's first
choice for after-dinner/lunch/breakfast -- not to mention
seminar/conference/campus -- speaker.</LD>
<LD>   But Harris thinks he's been preaching to the choir. He thinks
journalists talk too much to each other -- and not just in speeches.
He thinks many stories they write and broadcast, ostensibly to
enlighten the public, are also -- even if only subconsciously --
aimed primarily at their colleagues and their sources, rather than
the reading and viewing public.</LD>
<TE>   "Reporters ... covering Iraq from the United Nations, the State
Department, the Pentagon and the White House are basically covering
it for the people who are already part of that debate, not for the
average reader," Harris says. "They cover every nuance, every turn of
the screw in the process, but there's nothing to connect to the
reader or enable him to feel a real part of a public debate."</TE>
<TE>   Coverage of Iraq is but one symptom of what Harris sees as a
general failure of the news media to engage ordinary citizens in a
discussion of important public policy issues. In an effort to address
that problem, he recently became the director of the newly created
Center for the Study of Journalism and Democracy at USC's Annenberg
School for Communication. There he hopes to read, ask questions,
write for general-interest publications and grope his way toward a
brand of journalism that will link the news media and the body
politic -- and reinvigorate both of them.</TE>
<TE>   Harris is not alone in either his concerns or his efforts, but I
think he's right when he says, "Democracy is less vital now than it
once was. Not only are voting and the level of civic engagement and
participation down, but even among those who vote, the level of
discourse has declined, in quantity and quality, on issues related to
the common good.''</TE>
<TE>   There is considerable ammunition for Harris' argument in "The
Vanishing Voter," the new book by Thomas Patterson of Harvard's Joan
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at
Harvard, one of several institutions examining the role and state of
the modern media.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson points out that despite higher education levels, despite
the addition of millions of blacks and women to the voter rolls and
despite the relaxation of voter registration laws, voter turnout has
declined almost steadily for 40 years. Indeed, he says, since 1960,
individual "participation has declined in virtually every area of
election activity" -- not just voting but watching televised debates,
campaigning for a candidate, contributing to a candidate or party,
attending campaign rallies and reading about campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Harris thinks the news media bear a large measure of
responsibility for this.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't do our craft in a way that makes people want to
participate in the democratic process or see that it's important to
do so," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Only 39.3% of the country's voting-age citizens turned out for the
recent election -- the second-lowest total since 1942 -- and Harris
thinks the turnout would have been better (and maybe the results
would have been different) had the news media done a better job of
covering the Bush administration's foreign and economic policies.</TE>
<TE>   "There are forums," he says, "where you'll hear very thoughtful
discussions about how America, as the one hyper-power in the world,
should conduct itself, what our guiding principles should be. This
raises important questions of national security and of empire, and
yet these issues were not discussed much during the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say the same about the tax cut that was passed last year.
Were articles written that would be interesting to members of various
relevant elites? Yes. But did we really write about the consequences
of the tax cut so that it became a matter of central concern to the
American people? Not really."</TE>
<TE>   Although the media have addressed these issues in election
post-mortems, they've largely done so, Harris says, by "laying much
of the responsibility on the Democrats' doorstep ... for their
decision not to campaign on those issues and not to draw serious
distinctions between themselves and the president.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think it's fair to wonder ... no matter where you come down
on the issue itself: If we had covered all this in a more compelling
way, would it have shifted the focus of the debate?"</TE>
<TE>   Making time for Aristotle</TE>
<TE>   Harris doesn't claim to have any answers yet. But he's determined
to look for them. At USC, he hopes to "contribute to the public
dialogue by working with all parts of the university, drawing
together political science and sociology and business and other
disciplines" and, ultimately, by writing -- magazine essays and, when
he's learned enough, a book.</TE>
<TE>   But before writing, he's reading. He thinks the secret to
re-creating a public dialogue may lie in the works of some early
thinkers, men who wrote about the political system as if it were a
living, evolving organism, rather than the corrupt, moribund process
we see depicted in the media today.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going back to Aristotle and the writers of the Enlightenment
and Locke and Mill," Harris says. Then he chuckles self-consciously,
acknowledging that this seems an unlikely mid-career curriculum for a
53-year-old who's spent most of the past two decades as a business
executive.</TE>
<TE>   But Harris majored in English in college and had planned to study
philosophy in graduate school until he fell in love with journalism.</TE>
<TE>   He sees a "fundamental connection" between his recent rupture with
journalism and his current mission. Newspapers, he says, are "trapped
inside corporations that are competing for capital. The corporation
has a profit ethic, but newspapers have no legitimate, well-developed
competing ethic to act as a brake on the drive for profits."</TE>
<TE>   Editors and reporters at good newspapers do operate from principle
and do try to serve their communities by fairly and accurately
reporting the news.</TE>
<TE>   "But part of the core ethic of American journalism is to create an
informed citizenry, and we've largely stopped performing that
function," Harris says. "I want to help develop a philosophy of
journalism in the public interest."</TE>
<TE>   The ivory tower of academia may not seem the ideal base from which
to create a dialogue between elite journalists and disengaged
citizens, but as Harris points out, "The legal scholarship that led
to cases being filed in the South against segregation in the 1930s
and '40s -- and which ultimately ended up before the Supreme Court in
1954 as Brown v. Board of Education -- proceeded in large measure
from the law school at Howard University, which was among the
preeminent ivory towers in black colleges.</TE>
<TE>   "That sure had an enormous impact on ordinary people."</TE>
<TE>   It did indeed. And with so noble an exemplar in his personal
memory bank, Harris is setting the bar awfully high. I think his
criticisms are worth serious consideration and his objectives are
admirable, but as Locke himself said more than 300 years ago, "It is
one thing to show a man that he is in error, and another to put him
in possession of truth."</TE>

<HD>Artists alike only in their genius</HD>
<DH>Oscar Peterson, "Tenderly" (Just a Memory Records) ****
Erroll Garner, "Erroll Garner in Performance" (Kultur) ****</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The greatest jazz artists are inimitable. Sure, they can inspire
legions of copycats, as did Louis Armstrong, Lester Young, Charlie
Parker and John Coltrane, among others. But their distinct voices,
flowing from an utterly original inner source, remain sacrosanct, one
of a kind, instantly identifiable.</LD>
<LD>   Among the hundreds of pianists who have claimed jazz attention at
one time or another, only a relatively small percentage can claim
that sort of status: James P. Johnson, Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, Fats
Waller, Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell, Bill Evans are a few who come to
mind. And, in the post-WWII era, there are two more, each beyond
comparison: Oscar Peterson and Erroll Garner.</LD>
<LD>   Separated by four years in age (Garner was born in 1921, Peterson
in '25), they came to maturity during the bebop years of the '40s,
with Garner a participant in some early Parker recordings. But,
responsive only to their own inner voices, their paths were
startlingly different: Peterson took bebop into the outer limits of
virtuosic expressiveness, while Garner developed a rhapsodic style
blending bop with elements of swing, ragtime and stride piano.</LD>
<TE>   Two new releases, both issued for the first time in the United
States, are marvelous additions to the already extensive catalogs of
both Peterson and Garner. "Tenderly" was recorded live at a 1958
concert in Vancouver by a Peterson trio that included guitarist Herb
Ellis and bassist Ray Brown. It is the third release (after "Oscar
Peterson 1951" and "Oscar Peterson Trio: Live at CBC Studios, 1960")
personally approved by Peterson for release on this label, which is
the catalog imprint for the Canada-based Justin Time Records.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson was 33 at the time of the performance, and very much at
the height of his considerable powers. Equally important, the trio --
one of the legendary ensembles of the period, in fact of any jazz
period -- had been playing together for five years and was
functioning with impassioned musical unity.</TE>
<TE>   Just managing to stay rhythmically together in the overdrive tempo
of "The Surrey With the Fringe on Top," for example, would be an
almost insurmountable challenge for most groups, yet the Peterson
trio executes the piece with flashing speed as well as an inexorably
propulsive swing. And that's pretty much par for the course
throughout the entire album -- Peterson's wildly effusive soloing on
tunes such as "The Gypsy in My Soul," "How About You" and Ellis'
boppish "Pogo," grunting along with his lines as he goes.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, there is Peterson's often underrated lyricism, his
rich chording and arching way with a ballad line. Most of these
qualities are especially present in his lovely extended piece, "The
Music Box Suite," which moves from childlike charm through brisk
counterpoint into straight-ahead swing. Brown and Ellis are
Peterson's partners in every creative sense, with the former's
powerful foundation providing the support and the voltage for
Peterson's excursions, and the latter's blues-roots lines offering
the perfect foil for Peterson's technical brilliance.</TE>
<TE>   Keyboard technique</TE>
<TE>   "Erroll Garner in Performance" is a video of a pair of 1964 BBC TV
performances by the Garner trio (with Eddie Calhoun on bass and Kelly
Martin on drums), available on VHS or DVD. Garner, who died in 1977,
was in rare form for the appearances, which have been digitally
remastered.</TE>
<TE>   Characteristically, the BBC production had no superfluous fluff.
Announcer Steve Race comes out to introduce the trio at the beginning
and to sign off at the end of each of the 35-minute sets. In between,
the black-and-white video simply focuses on the Garner trio, playing
one tune after another, only pausing between numbers to acknowledge
the enthusiastic applause from the studio audience.</TE>
<TE>   The selections range from "Just One of Those Things" and "What Is
This Thing Called Love?" to "Honeysuckle Rose" and "The Lady Is a
Tramp." Missing, but included as a bonus audio track played to
accompany a Garner photo gallery, is his classic "Misty."</TE>
<TE>   The spare simplicity of the black-and-white production allows the
music to come through with superb clarity -- fascinating for Garner's
fans, useful for pianists to view the keyboard technique of his
extraordinarily natural talent. Stroking out left-hand chords,
dancing through one fascinating melody after another with his busy
left hand, slipping in rolling, harp-like arpeggios, dramatically
shifting dynamics from soft to loud, Garner is a joy to watch, as
well as hear. Perspiring profusely, his smiling countenance
reflecting the shifts and changes in his musical line, he comes alive
again as one of the jazz world's most matchless and inventive
originals.</TE>

<HD>A grandmother's quest for truth</HD>
<DH>Kathy Graham Wilburn, whose grandsons died in the Oklahoma
City bombing, asks the hard questions in 'Terror From Within.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 9:02 a.m. on April 19, 1995, Kathy Graham Wilburn was watching her
daughter, Edye, cross the room to blow out the candles on her 23rd
birthday cake when a powerful explosion shook the downtown Oklahoma
City office building where their co-workers had gathered for an
office birthday party.</LD>
<LD>   Someone yelled then that a nearby bank had just been blown up, and
Wilburn and her daughter dashed outside as shards of glass rained
from the sky and smoke billowed over the city.</LD>
<LD>   But it wasn't a bank. It was the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building, and inside was a day-care center with Edye's two children,
3-year-old Chase and 2-year-old Colton, who would perish in the
blast.</LD>
<TE>   "I stood and watched my daughter crumble," Wilburn recently
recalled. "She said, 'My babies! My babies!' I said, 'Edye, it's
going to be all right.' But I knew in my heart it wasn't going to be
all right."Now, a feature-length documentary titled "Terror From
Within" is raising disturbing questions about the Oklahoma City
bombing, which claimed 168 lives, including 19 children. It asks
whether a more complex mastermind was behind the blast than Timothy
McVeigh, who was executed last year, and his imprisoned
co-conspirator, Terry Nichols.</TE>
<TE>   A driving force behind the film is 49-year-old grandmother Kathy
Wilburn, who, as associate producer, has been on a years-long mission
to unearth facts about the event that took the lives of her
grandsons.</TE>
<TE>   Like the divorced mother of three who took on a corporate giant in
"Erin Brockovich," Wilburn has been waging a crusade against the
secrecy and power of the federal government almost since the day of
the bombing.Her quest has taken her to England and Ireland to conduct
interviews, and she has befriended relatives of McVeigh and Nichols,
hung out of a helicopter guiding cameras over a white separatist
settlement in rural Oklahoma that McVeigh telephoned in the weeks
before the bombing, and even entered the Aryan Nations compound in
Idaho, where hatemongers wearing swastikas shouted "Heil Hitler!" and
saluted a life-size bust of the Fuhrer.</TE>
<TE>   "It made me feel sick," she said of her visit to the compound, but
Wilburn still managed to charm Aryan Nations founder Richard Butler
into giving her an on-camera interview by telling him: "My name is
Kathy Wilburn. I lost both my grandchildren in the Oklahoma City
bombing, and I don't like the story the feds are telling me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Whenever someone balked, Wilburn would "guilt" them into
cooperation by showing them a small artist's rendition she carries of
her two grandchildren with angel's wings.</TE>
<TE>   Before the bombing, Wilburn had been in charge of employee hiring
at the Internal Revenue Service in Oklahoma City. Her husband, Glenn,
was a certified public accountant. Two years after the bombing, he
would die of pancreatic cancer, a condition, he was convinced,
precipitated by stress caused by the bombing and its aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   "We were the kind of people who got up in the morning, we went to
work, we came home and played with the babies and worked in the
yard," Kathy Wilburn recalled. "Never had a political agenda. I would
have never believed this could have happened if it hadn't happened to
me."</TE>
<TE>   Now a motivational speaker, Wilburn has been seen on numerous
television programs, including "The Oprah Winfrey Show," "CBS This
Morning," "The Today Show" and "America's Most Wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Director and producer Jason Van Vleet, 32, credits Wilburn with
not only providing valuable research for the documentary, but also
with landing key on-camera interviews from people who normally might
shun professional journalists.</TE>
<TE>   "What was unique is, we were able to get into some of the places
that most reporters don't get into," Van Vleet said.</TE>
<TE>   Wilburn not only worked behind the scenes but is also featured on
camera, as is Jannie Coverdale, who also lost her grandchildren in
the blast. Visiting the gravesites of the children, the women lend
poignancy to an otherwise hard-edged documentary.</TE>
<TE>   "Terror From Within" screened in September at the International
Documentary Assn.'s "DOCtober" showcase in Santa Monica, in a
qualifying run for Academy Award consideration. The documentary was
produced by Colorado-based MGA Films, which has a domestic television
distribution deal with Solid Entertainment of Santa Monica and an
international distribution deal with Sound Image Broadcast Sales out
of London. The documentary won the grand jury award at this year's
Houston Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   The 90-minute film claims that right-wing extremists had targeted
the Murrah building as far back as 1983 and notes that April 19
loomed large in militia circles for several reasons.</TE>
<TE>   April 19 not only marked the second anniversary of the day the
Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, went up in flames, but also
the 10th anniversary of the day in 1985 that federal and state
authorities laid siege to the Arkansas compound of a military group
called the Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord.</TE>
<TE>   On the very day that McVeigh set off the bomb in Oklahoma, Richard
Wayne Snell, a white separatist and Covenant member who had once
conceived of a plan to blow up the Murrah building, was executed in
Arkansas for murdering a black state trooper and a white businessman
he suspected of being Jewish. Snell originally wanted to use a truck
bomb to destroy the Murrah building, but the plan was changed to
employ a rocket launcher. The plot fizzled after the device blew up
prematurely.</TE>
<TE>   'Truth' dies with McVeigh</TE>
<TE>   Almost from the beginning, Wilburn and her husband had questioned
the official version of events. They wondered, for example, why the
FBI had dropped its search for John Doe No. 2, the mysterious,
olive-skinned man several people had reported seeing with McVeigh in
the days leading up to the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "To this day, what's disturbing to me is the fingerprints that
were in Timothy McVeigh's car when he was arrested in Perry, Okla.,
were never run through the FBI files to be checked," Wilburn said.
"And the 22 security cameras that were downtown around the Murrah
building, the judge placed them under seal and they are under seal to
this day.... People who saw McVeigh downtown in the Ryder truck that
morning said they saw another individual with him."</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Wilburn and her husband had their critics, including
those who believed if she kept asking questions about the involvement
of other people in the bombing, it might result in McVeigh and
Nichols getting off. At Nichols' trial, she even sat with the
defendant's mother and sister. Her reasoning? They hadn't done
anything wrong.</TE>
<TE>   On the day McVeigh was executed in Indiana, Wilburn joined the
families of other victims in Oklahoma City to watch via
closed-circuit television.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't in favor of killing McVeigh," she recalled. "However, if
anyone ever deserved to die for any one thing, he certainly did. But
I thought with the death of McVeigh died the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Yet she was shocked at the look McVeigh gave them just before the
poison was injected into his veins. "He deliberately looked at our
camera and gave us the most cold, heartless look.... He glares at us
and then he dies. We got to sit there in stone silence with his eyes
open staring at us."</TE>
<TE>   Until the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and
the Pentagon last year, Oklahoma City had been the deadliest act of
terror on American soil. In the days after 9/11, Wilburn traveled to
New York to console some of the family members whose loved ones died
in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew immediately I had to commiserate with those people," she
said. "They needed to know you're going to be all right because right
after the bombing was the only time in my life that I ever considered
suicide. It was like, I don't want to live in this world, it's too
painful.</TE>
<TE>   But I heard John Walsh of 'America's Most Wanted' [whose son was
abducted and murdered] and he said, 'You will grieve, and you will
grieve deeply, but you will survive.' And that is the first time that
I thought that I will."</TE>
<TE>   Van Vleet said he doesn't know if the documentary will be
nominated for an Academy Award, but if it were and should it win,
nothing would please him more than seeing Wilburn join him onstage to
accept the Oscar.</TE>
<TE>   Wilburn knows what she would say in her acceptance speech. She
would say that the Oscar was purchased with blood.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Angelenos may not realize it, but their city is a lonely, sprawling,
polluted place full of publicity hounds and agents, cars, empty
streets, cars, rats, 100-degree days and did we mention lonely people
who'd probably rather live in New York if they were smart enough and
could handle the big-time pace.</LD>
<LD>   According to a recent surfeit of news coverage elsewhere, L.A. has
a new downtown cathedral that looks like an auditorium, a new
downtown auditorium that looks like a cathedral, some lame attempts
to redevelop downtown life with apartments only seven miles from the
nearest grocery and a death wish to split apart the -- you guessed it
-- lonely, sprawling, polluted city.</LD>
<LD>   At last (how many generations did this take?) L.A. has a decent
pastrami sandwich thanks to New York, bagels to yawn for and a new
police chief recycled from you-can-guess-where.</LD>
<TE>   Not that anyone here needs out-of-town publications, but we owe
all this new wisdom to a number of non-L.A. periodicals that
coincidentally have New York bases. The selective tone of the L.A.
coverage provides insights not only into what others see here, but
what they want to see here and the apparent need to compare
themselves with others.</TE>
<TE>   Story subjects are as predictable as a presidential photo op to
top the daily news. Raging brush fires cloak millions of gasping
Californians in smoke and fear. Gang murders drive fear-stricken L.A.
to finally hire a real police pro, William Bratton, the former New
York chief (who's actually from Boston, by the way). One of the best
things about having to live in L.A. apparently is the New York
farewell party given Bratton by Tina Brown, not a New York native
either.</TE>
<TE>   These newspaper and magazine stories describe Mayor James K. Hahn
less as a former city attorney who led the successful fight against
valley secession and more as the somnolent, colorless
"anti-Giuliani." Hollywood Boulevard is "the neglected stepsister of
Times Square." Beverly Hills, one piece observed, "is a nice place to
be a rat." As opposed to, say, Brooklyn?</TE>
<TE>   According to another report, "It is commonly said at cocktail
parties and on the street corners of New York that Los Angeles is an
insipid backwater, a lukewarm bath." Good to know, eh?</TE>
<TE>   Such accounts will surely help Angelenos understand why all their
neighbors are leaving, why Southern California property values are
dropping so badly, why houses can languish unsold for hours and why
the freeways are empty most days.</TE>
<TE>   It's always interesting to know what others say when you're out of
the room. As opposed to, say, caring.</TE>

<LD>Forest infernos led TV newscasts and made front-page photos all
during the long, dry summer and fall of 2002. With more than 6
million acres burned, this was one of the biggest fire years ever.
President Bush even tried to harness the emotion triggered by the
wildfires to bypass environmental laws and allow more logging of
forests with high fire potential.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the worst fires were in the drought-plagued Rockies.
California too had its high-profile fires, such as the 150,000-acre
Sequoia National Forest burn.</LD>
<LD>   Curiously, however, Yosemite National Park just to the north was
an oasis of green calm this year. Last week, in declaring the fire
season over, park officials called 2002 "one of the most successful
fire years" in a 112-year history. Much of Yosemite, which is the
size of Rhode Island, is forested.</LD>
<TE>   Yosemite was extremely dry, as was the rest of the state, but the
largest nonintentional fire, touched off by lightning, covered just
2,000 acres in the White Wolf area north of Yosemite Valley.
Lightning accounted for 13 other fires. The three largest accidental
human-caused blazes burned only 125 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Park officials said the season was a good one partly because of
quick control and suppression of fires as they were detected, but
they said luck and planning were factors too. The largest fire was
one deliberately set by park officials. The 3,500-acre fire near
Crane Flat was set to clear the forest of highly flammable debris and
underbrush near a ranger station and Yosemite Institute facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Park officials even conducted visitor tours of the low-intensity
White Wolf fire while it was underway to demonstrate how such blazes
rid the forest of excess fuels and benefit the ecosystem.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, even some of the more dramatic of the year's fires
were less devastating than they looked. The Times' Bettina Boxall
reported that only about 8% of the Sequoia fire area was severely
damaged -- to the point where trees were consumed or clearly killed.
The rest benefited from the cleansing effect of the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Forests abutting human settlement do need to be thinned and
cleared to reduce the fire risk. But the major factor in the severity
of the 2002 fire season was simply the dryness of the forests. The
Bush plan to increase logging stalled because of objections from
Senate Democrats and environmental groups that it was more
profit-making logging program than fire prevention measure.</TE>
<TE>   This new report should help put fire danger in perspective and
persuade the White House that a logging spree isn't the answer to
forest fires.</TE>

<LD>So much partisan bickering has surrounded the homeland security bill
passed last week by Congress that the sheer magnitude of creating the
department is only starting to sink in. The federal government is
preparing for its biggest reorganization in 50 years -- consolidating
22 agencies with 170,000 employees into a new department.</LD>
<LD>   Though the White House is claiming that the department can be
fully up and running in less than a year, the nonpartisan General
Accounting Office has properly cautioned that it will take a
systematic and patient "multiyear effort." The administration and
Congress need to ensure that the department does not attempt to
accomplish everything overnight, only to end up accomplishing
nothing.</LD>
<LD>   The department will be divided into four divisions --
transportation; emergency preparedness; chemical, biological,
radiological, and nuclear countermeasures; and information analysis.
Despite the fancy titles, the first questions facing the department
are nuts-and-bolts ones.</LD>
<TE>   The department will have to work on the morale problem from the
outset. The Bush administration's resistance to guaranteed job
protections for many homeland security employees has prompted the
American Federation of Government Employees to post a sign on its Web
site: "Remember your workplace rights -- because you're about to lose
them!"</TE>
<TE>   The department will have to decide on a single computer system to
coordinate agencies such as the Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency that will come under its umbrella. With so many
jobs at stake, even the question of where the new department will be
based has triggered controversy.</TE>
<TE>   In deciding these logistical and equipment issues, the government
will inevitably rely heavily on outside contractors. The department
should not rush into signing contracts, but rather should scrutinize
competitive bids and have a coherent month-by- month plan for buying.
To its credit, a White House transition team has been working on some
of these issues.</TE>
<TE>   The department also faces the longer-term question of how far its
reach should extend, particularly in the area of intelligence. Here
again, the department should not overreach initially.</TE>
<TE>   Though the department does not have the power to collect data, it
will have an information analysis unit that can process information
from the CIA, FBI and other intelligence agencies. This should help
coordinate information and should be the priority of the department.
Even if the Homeland Security Department never obtains the ability to
carry out intelligence work, its mere existence could serve as a spur
to the FBI to improve its performance.</TE>
<TE>   As daunting as the start-up problems are, the creation of the
Homeland Security Department offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
for the administration and Congress to systematically overhaul the
bureaucracy and strengthen security. The government must move
deliberately as it works to bring about the birth of the new agency
that could profoundly affect everyday American life and safety.</TE>

<LD>THINGS are falling apart for my family right now. I am getting older
but times are getting harder. I heard my mom blame our troubles on
9/11 and something called the economy. And I learned what the word
"unemployment" means.</LD>
<LD>   No, I won't tell you what it means. You can look it up in the
dictionary like I had to do.</LD>
<LD>   All the girls around me look so cool in their clothes. Sasha has a
brand new pair of Nikes. Well, I am not jealous. They are cute.</LD>
<TE>   Brittany is excited because her birthday is two days before mine
and her mom is taking her to California Adventure. She's so lucky. My
mom told me that she was going to take me to Disneyland but now, she
can't afford it.</TE>
<TE>   Why is this happening to us, I ask myself? Why does everyone else
get to do fun things on their birthdays except for me? It's sooo not
fair!</TE>
<TE>   My auntie can't even buy me anything and she always does something
for me. But this year is different. Every time I think about it I
start to cry.</TE>
<TE>   As I ride along in the car with my mom, tears flow from my eyes.
This is the worst birthday ever. I wish ... I wish for my birthday
that ....</TE>
<TE>   Then, I notice a little girl sitting in a shopping cart with her
baby brother. Their clothes are old and torn. Their mother is pushing
them along the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   They must be homeless.</TE>
<TE>   I wish ... I wish for my birthday -- that homelessness would end
forever.</TE>

<HD>Police Chief Bratton Faces L.A. Gang Culture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Get Angry, Bratton Tells L.A.," Nov. 21: Yes, gang violence is
much bigger than the police, as the Rev. Frederick O. Murph rightly
concludes. But the real issue is not lack of jobs and opportunity,
the real issue lies in the fact that people's values are formed first
and most impacted by their parents and families in their earliest
years. Multiple generations of gang members now exist in the same
family, passing on their gang culture to the next generation. Quit
using lack of jobs as the reason for these murders.</LD>
<LD>   Julia Huntsman</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief William Bratton is telling it like it is. To quote
the chief: "Existing laws are not adequate to control guns in this
city. Too many people here are comfortable carrying [illegal] guns."
I doubt that when the founding fathers added the 2nd Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution they considered street gangs to be a "well-ordered
militia." Disarmament will be a major step forward in bringing down
our city's shameful homicide rate.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Green</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gee, what a shock. The LAPD anti-gang units have been disbanded
and the number of gang-related shootings rise. Then Chief Bratton
says L.A. needs more gun control laws.</TE>
<TE>   Really? Since when do gangbangers care about laws? Cut the
nonsense -- get rid of ridiculous city expenditures and bring back
the anti-gang CRASH units [dismantled after the Rampart scandal].</TE>
<TE>   Steve Reynolds</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The characterization of the LAPD as a "rogue subculture" is
completely unfair ("The Gang-Bratton Face-Off," editorial, Nov. 21).
Granted, there have been officers who in the past have engaged in
serious misconduct. The large majority of the officers, however, are
exemplary professionals whose only goal is to provide the
highest-quality service possible to the citizens of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The eruption of violence over the past few days, and the officers'
response to that violence, proves the department to be an
organization of courageous individuals willing to face an
unprecedented challenge. They are asked to face risk and danger and
move to the sound of the guns, frequently having only a fraction of a
second to make a decision involving life and death. It is a job that
few can do. Far from a "cowboy mentality," the men and women of this
department are asked to perform one of the toughest jobs in the
country -- that of an L.A. police officer.</TE>

<TE>   LAPD, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Re "LAPD May Seek New Quarters," Nov. 20: Let's get real. The only
source of funding that will be considered for the new LAPD
headquarters will be yet another bond issue. Our so-called city
leaders have demonstrated time and time again that their failure to
budget money for capital improvements (i.e., schools, health-care
centers, community colleges) only leads to higher property taxes via
bond indebtedness.</TE>
<TE>   Now Mayor James Hahn says he "can't believe" that the poor
condition of the building has been allowed to go on so long, as if he
has never entered Parker Center in his many years as a city leader.
Well, I believe it. And I believe it will cost us all ... again.</TE>

longer are we going to tolerate the underhanded work of the
politicians? Now they are going to use the state water bond money we
approved to purchase the Ahmanson Ranch. The developer was going to
give us 10,000 acres of the 13,000 total acres, but the wealthy want
all of the 13,000 acres. The wealthy in the Thousand Oaks/Calabasas
area do not want affordable housing in their area. And we know why!</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, members of Congress have been unable to come up with a way
to provide universal health insurance, and they have been unable to
come up with a plan to provide seniors with reasonable prescription
coverage. However, they came up with $90 billion in a jiffy to bail
out the insurance companies for future claims in the event of a
terrorist attack ("Terror Insurance Bill Backed by Bush Is Passed,"
Nov. 20).</LD>
<LD>   The American taxpayer will foot the bill for the insurance
companies, and at the same time, President Bush is calling for more
tax cuts. How big are the insurance company executives' bonuses going
to be this year?</LD>
<LD>   David Lamont</LD>
<TE>   Malibu</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What surprises me is not that this Republican-led Congress pushes
for tax cuts for corporations and the rich (Nov. 21), or that it
demands tort protection for major companies that will make millions
from vaccines, or even that it will terminate unemployment benefits
in the dead of winter just three days before the new year, but that
their hearts, so cold and hard, continue to beat at all. Let us all
wish Congress a happy holiday season. This Thanksgiving they have a
lot to be thankful for.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Sheppard</TE>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's said that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. But the
hyperbole, hysteria and double standards with which some liberals are
responding to the war on terror is flirting with self-parody.</TE>
<TE>   They shriek that President Bush is bent on establishing a "police
state" (letters, Nov. 21). When he proposes to restrict liberties as
much as did Democratic heroes like Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson, then I'll worry. They wail that the entire Bill of Rights
itself is being abolished -- as if I can expect redcoats to be
quartered in my guest bedroom by Monday night. The danger is that, by
crying wolf, they may discredit genuine, future dissent should the
government ever truly restrict liberty -- in the wake of a nuclear or
biological attack on a city, for example.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic candidates didn't lose the last election because they
muted their message. They lost because the public associated them,
rightly or wrongly, with the callow mindlessness of the far left --
whose remoteness from reality is starkly exposed in these sterner
days.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Eastmond</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Never let it be said that the Democrats passed up an opportunity
to say to those who voted for them, "In your face!" They blustered
about protecting us from the Republican pork in the homeland security
bill, then turned around and approved it (Nov. 20). My grandfather
was wrong when he said, "The difference between Republicans and
Democrats is that Republicans also steal the eggs, but they hide the
shells." Oh, how overpowering the smell of money in Washington today!</TE>

<HD>Air Board's Unchanged Goal: Zero Emissions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "A Diesel-Powered Intrusion," by Marc Haefele, Opinion, Nov. 17:
In 1998, the California Air Resources Board passed new,
more-stringent regulations for passenger vehicles. Auto manufacturers
complained that they would not be able to sell diesel passenger
vehicles when the rules took effect in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, the ARB has held to the new rules, leaving auto
makers with a simple choice: If they produce diesel passenger
vehicles that meet our emissions standards for 2004 and beyond they
can sell those vehicles in California. If they can't meet those
standards they can't sell diesel passenger vehicles here.</LD>
<LD>   Haefele misconstrued my remarks that we might see diesel passenger
cars being sold again here within the next five years. Those remarks
were based on the progress auto manufacturers appear to be making in
bringing diesel vehicles up to California's tough 2004 emission
standards. Only time will tell if the manufacturers can meet that
challenge.</LD>
<TE>   I have not chosen diesel or any other fuel as the solution to
California's smog problems. The board's goal for the future of
California's passenger vehicles remains unchanged: zero emissions --
whether that is achieved by fuel cells, batteries or other
technology.</TE>

<LD>Many thanks to Judge Michael Nash for his eloquently written Nov. 20
commentary, "Kids in Search of Open Doors and Open Hearts." As a
longtime volunteer in the foster-care system, I can attest to the
lack of adequate foster homes as well as to the incredible resiliency
of the children who, through no fault of their own, find themselves
part of this system.</LD>
<LD>   There is no happier experience than participating in or attending
adoption day. When I hear about international or private adoptions,
though I know the families' hearts are in the right place, I feel sad
for the children in L.A. County who end up being left behind.</LD>
<LD>   I am the board vice president for a foster family and adoption
agency. In any given month we can receive up to 100 calls from the
Department of Children and Family Services looking for homes in which
to place the children. We are not able to recruit nearly enough
foster parents to fill this kind of demand. Judge Nash's statement
bears repeating: "Giving them a chance to grow up in loving and
supportive homes benefits us all."</LD>

<LD>In his Nov. 20 commentary, "No Question, the Climate Is Heating Up,"
about President Bush's hate for environmentalists, John Balzar
correctly describes the dire situation: Bush has the power to stomp
all over the environmentalists. However, he fails to mention that
Mother Nature will get Bush, or really his grandkids, in the end,
because the forces of nature are a million times stronger than any
president of a superpower nation.</LD>
<LD>   Bush will destroy the future of his grandchildren by ignoring the
warning of scientists who understand the basic natural limits that
humans cannot escape. Ecological catastrophe is Bush's long-term
policy, all because of his vindictive and greedy nature. It seems
that the public will let him prevail and we all, through our
grandchildren, will pay for his spite.</LD>
<LD>   Arlene Williams</LD>
<TE>   Sparks, Nev.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Balzar's long list of the Bush administration's "crimes against
nature" is a ridiculous, one-sided recap of the environmental issue.
It appears that he's been swallowing all that the Greens have on
their propaganda plate. An attempt to bring back some balance to the
activism against business and personal property rights that found
sympathy in the last administration does not equate with a desire to
trash the environment.</TE>
<TE>   In case nobody noticed, big and small businesses produce
everything we use in our lives, from computers to cars to clothes.
The Greens produce nothing and neither does the government. I'm sure
a lot of workers are pleased that someone is remembering that fact
when making environmental policy.</TE>

<HD>Kurdish Eyes on Iraq's Future</HD>
<DH>Eastern sector's chief urges limited U.S. aid to the
opposition in ousting Hussein</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Robin Wright is The Times' chief diplomatic
correspondent and the author of four books on international affairs.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jalal Talabani used skills learned during his obligatory Iraqi army
duty to fight in and help lead the first Kurdish revolt in 1961. He
subsequently became a top official in the Kurdish Democratic Party of
Mustafa Barzani. After the collapse of the Kurdish revolt in 1975,
precipitated by a U.S. policy shift, Talabani and other Kurdish
intellectuals launched a more modern and less clan-based movement,
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which then began its own
armed resistance inside Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   The split reflects a core problem for the Kurds, the world's
largest ethnic group without a country and the most victimized sector
of Iraqi society -- the only group in Iraq against which Saddam
Hussein used chemical weapons. The rivalry between the two Kurdish
parties has diverted attention from their long-term goal. Disputes
over revenue-sharing and land led to two years of sporadic clashes.
In 1996, Hussein's intervention helped the Kurdistan Democratic Party
push the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan back to the Iranian border,
leading Talabani to call Barzani a traitor.</LD>
<TE>   Talabani now controls the eastern sector of "liberated" Kurdistan,
Barzani the western area. Both have their own administrations and
military forces. But they share a national assembly originally
elected in 1992. It reconvened last month for the first time in six
years, a symbolic move reflecting new attempts at unity mediated by
the United States. Talabani's headquarters are in Sulaymaniyah.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Will the new U.N. resolution inevitably lead to war?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: We're not against an invasion, but I would be glad not to
see a U.S. invasion of Iraq. It would be better to help Iraqis
liberate their own country. If an invasion means 150,000 troops,
occupying Baghdad and imposing a government, this should not be the
intent of the United States. But if the United States helps the real
opposition forces -- the peshmerga, the Supreme Council for the
Islamic Revolution in Iraq, the Free Officers and others -- with its
Air Force and Special Forces, [victory over Hussein] will be easy. It
won't need to send a large army.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Would the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan collaborate with a U.S.
military campaign?</TE>
<TE>   A: When [Secretary of State] Colin Powell sent his message of
congratulations to our parliament [last month], he said he was proud
that the Kurds are partners of the U.S. in the fight against tyranny
and terrorism and for a free, democratic Iraq. This [partnership] was
unanimously adopted by the national assembly.... But we would also be
happier if the United States agrees on a future plan for Iraq based
on democracy, federalism and a multiparty state.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Since the imposition of the no-fly zones in 1991 and the U.N.
oil-for-food program in 1997, the Kurds have created an area of
self-rule in the north. What difference has it made?</TE>
<TE>   A: The Kurds [proved] we can administer our territory and provide
an example of peace and stability in Iraq. We're a balance between
Sunni and Shiite, secular and fundamentalist. You see the climate of
democracy even in the progress of [Kurdish] women -- two women
ministers and four judges, many Kurdish women's organizations, even a
battalion of women fighters [in the PUK area].</TE>
<TE>   Q: Aren't Kurds actually better off now than if they were
integrated back into Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   A: That's very shortsighted. What we have is not stable or
permanent. Half of [Iraqi] Kurdistan is still under Iraqi
dictatorship. We need to reunite Iraq to get back with other parts of
Kurdistan and reunite with Iraq for a permanent democratic life.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are the Kurds willing to give up their dream of an independent
Kurdistan?</TE>
<TE>   A: We never asked for an independent Kurdish state. These are only
accusations of neighbors. What we ask for always is in [the] context
of Iraq. But we do want a new government within a framework of
self-determination.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In a new government, Kurds talk about federalism as the
solution to the problem of Iraq's long-standing ethnic and religious
rivalries. What does this mean?</TE>
<TE>   A: It means giving the rights of sovereignty to the central
government -- the presidency, control of the finance ministry,
foreign policy, the army and important industries like oil. Other
powers will be given to the freely elected regional governments. We
haven't selected one final model. There are lots of federal systems
as models -- the United States, Belgium, Canada, Switzerland, the
United Kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What should happen to Kirkuk, the Jerusalem of Iraq, claimed by
different ethnic groups?</TE>
<TE>   A: President Clinton wrote a letter to the U.S. Congress in which
he described Kirkuk as a Kurdish city. But Kirkuk is, historically, a
city of Kurds, Turkmen, Assyrians and Arabs in the region of the
Kurds. It should be ruled like Brussels. It should be a city of
brotherhood, not what it is now, a city of hatred undergoing ethnic
cleansing.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, Sulaymaniyah has also been a [Kurdish] capital, and
Iraq made Irbil a capital. The future capital must be decided by
parliament. We may even build a new town so there is no rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Al Qaeda is active in Al Biyara in the PUK part of Kurdistan.
Your forces have clashed with them. What are you doing to contain
them?</TE>
<TE>   A: This is now the main base for those who left Afghanistan. They
are leading all Al Qaeda activity in the Middle East, including
Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria. They have tried some car bombs and
assassinations [against us]. They planned to kill me and almost
killed our prime minister. They operate in the mountains but are not
too active at the moment. They are training, but they're also daily
losing people who are leaving their ranks and going to other groups
or going back home. Their morale is not good. We are trying to
[contain] them with our Iranian brothers.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Does U.S. involvement in Iraq this time differ from previous
interventions?</TE>
<TE>   A: This is the first time we have an overt relationship with the
United States. Before, it was all covert relations and operations....
I'm confident the United States will not walk away this time [like it
did] in 1991. They promised.</TE>
<TE>   But we are not the puppet of anyone. We are not struggling for the
United States but for the Kurds. It'd be great to have the backing of
the United States, but we will continue either way.</TE>

<DH>Heir of legendary leader sees little for his troops to do
if the U.S. invades</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Massoud Barzani is a respected military strategist and a survivor who
can play all sides of the fence. In the 1980s, Iraqi troops killed
three of his brothers, 29 family members and some 8,000 Barzani
clansmen. Nevertheless, in 1996, Barzani briefly allied with Saddam
Hussein and allowed Iraqi troops into Kurdistan to rout rival Kurdish
leader Jalal Talabani and his Iranian backers. A good chunk of
Barzani's budget comes from levies on goods smuggled into and out of
the rest of Iraq through the northern Kurdistan enclave.</LD>
<LD>   Barzani inherited the leadership of the Kurdistan Democratic Party
from his father, the legendary Mulla Mustafa Barzani, the
charismatic, dagger-wielding fighter who launched the Kurdish
nationalist movement in Iraq and, in 1961, an armed struggle.</LD>
<TE>   The Barzani family history chronicles the repeated U.S. betrayal
of the Kurds. After using Kurdish fighters to pressure Baghdad,
then-Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger turned around and
negotiated a deal between Iran and Iraq in 1975 that let Hussein
crush the movement launched by Barzani's father, who was forced into
exile. In 1991, after calling for a Kurdish uprising against Baghdad
after the Gulf War, the United States allowed Hussein to quash the
rebellion, which led to thousands of deaths and more than 1 million
Kurds fleeing to the borders with Turkey and Iran. Barzani's
headquarters are in Salahuddin, a mountaintop retreat near Irbil.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Do you think the new U.N. resolution renewing weapons
inspections in Iraq means war can be avoided? Or do the chances of
war now increase?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The resolution has probably delayed [the war]. I think
that the decision about war has already been taken.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do the Kurds really want a change of government? Kurdistan is
the only area of Iraq to thrive since 1991, effectively gaining
self-rule [under protection from U.S. and British warplanes] in the
northern no-fly zone. You would have to give this up if Iraq is
reunified.</TE>
<TE>   A: We want a democratic, federal Iraq. So we welcome whatever
achieves this goal.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What role will the Kurds play if there is a war? For example,
would you be prepared to allow U.S. troops to use your facilities in
Kurdistan?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't think that the fighting will be in our region, but
Americans could come via Kurdistan. We cannot prevent them from doing
so.... During a war, I don't think we will be able to offer anything,
because there are differences in systems of command, training and
ways of fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Is there a role for Kurdish fighters, the peshmerga? Are they
the equivalent of Afghanistan's Northern Alliance?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's a mistake to compare the situation here with Afghanistan
or to compare the peshmerga with the Northern Alliance. But this is
not purely a matter of toppling Saddam Hussein, which is not a
difficult job.... The most important thing is what happens after the
war. We have proposed, first, that within three months [of a regime
change], Iraq establish a federal parliament; and, second, that we
have guarantees that the United States would not allow any foreign
interference in Iraq or in the Kurdish area. If we are given these
guarantees, the Kurds will do their best to cooperate in all possible
ways. But if the war is merely to overthrow the regime, and we don't
know what lies ahead for the Kurds, why should the Kurds put
themselves in a trap?</TE>
<TE>   Q: So you're not satisfied with the U.S. commitment so far?</TE>
<TE>   A: The commitment we have is different from [the one] in the past.
There is trust [this time]. What worries me is the lack of
transparency and details -- specifically, on the formation of the new
government. The United States should respect the will and the desire
of the Iraqi people to decide on the formula for a new government.
The other issue that worries us is the danger of foreign interference
[by a neighboring state].</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is the Kurds' vision of a post-Hussein Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   A: We are opting for a voluntary union. There is no animosity
between the Kurds and the Arabs. There are other minorities living
here, like the Turkmen and the Assyrians, who are all brothers. We're
working for an alternative that is pluralistic and federal. There is
a desire and will to preserve the unity and the territorial integrity
of this country within the state of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Q: One of the most explosive issues of post-Hussein Iraq is the
fate of the northern city of Kirkuk. The Kurds' proposed constitution
makes Kirkuk their regional capital, which makes Turks nervous
because Iraq's Kurds would have strategic and economic power that
might inspire Turkey's own restive Kurds. Some Turkish politicians
even warn of military intervention if the Kurds take control of
Kirkuk. Is there room for compromise on Kirkuk?</TE>
<TE>   A: What right does Turkey have to dictate to us? We are not going
to accept this kind of interference from any country. Other people
have made a big thing out of Kirkuk. For others, Kirkuk is important
because it lies on a sea of oil. For us, Kirkuk is important because
it lies on a sea of our blood.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkuk is the symbol of the suffering of the Kurdish people. But
when we talk about Kirkuk, it doesn't mean that there should be no
one else there except Kurds. Kirkuk is part of Kurdistan, and it has
the identity of Kurdistan. But at the same time, it's a city of Iraq,
like Basra and Baghdad. So there could be Arabs, Turkmen and Shiites
living there, too. But what we are not ready to compromise on is the
identity of that city. Also, whatever we have submitted is a
proposal. Both the [Kurdish] constitution and the issue of Kirkuk are
points to be discussed. They're negotiable.</TE>
<TE>   Q: After all these years of tension among the Kurds, is the
fighting really over?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. It was an unfortunate thing to happen, but it has happened
to other peoples as well. The circumstances are conducive for peace
four years after signing the Washington agreement in 1998 because of
confidence-building measures. Trust has come back to people. The rank
and file of the Kurdish parties have been convinced that war leads to
the destruction of the Kurdish whole. So I'm optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is your role if Hussein is ousted?</TE>
<TE>   A: I've been a peshmerga for 40 years, since I was 16. My personal
desire is to go to one of the villages in the Barzan area to be left
to my personal life, to retire. So, the moment our people are
liberated and free, I think my mission would end.</TE>

<AU>William M. Arkin</AU>
<BD>William M. Arkin is a military affairs analyst who
writes regularly for Opinion. E-mail: warkin@igc.org.</BD>
<DL>SOUTH POMFRET, Vt.</DL>
<LD>It was California's own Hiram Johnson who said, in a speech on the
Senate floor in 1917, that "the first casualty, when war comes, is
truth."</LD>
<LD>   What would he make of the Bush administration?</LD>
<LD>   In a policy shift that reaches across all the armed services,
Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld and his senior aides are
revising missions and creating new agencies to make "information
warfare" a central element of any U.S. war. Some hope it will
eventually rank with bombs and artillery shells as an instrument of
destruction.</LD>
<TE>   What is disturbing about Rumsfeld's vision of information warfare
is that it has a way of folding together two kinds of wartime
activity involving communications that have traditionally been
separated by a firewall of principle.</TE>
<TE>   The first is purely military. It includes attacks on the radar,
communications and other "information systems" an enemy depends on to
guide its war-making capabilities. This category also includes
traditional psychological warfare, such as dropping leaflets or
broadcasting propaganda to enemy troops.</TE>
<TE>   The second is not directly military. It is the dissemination of
public information that the American people need in order to
understand what is happening in a war, and to decide what they think
about it. This information is supposed to be true.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, the administration's new policy -- along with the
steps senior commanders are taking to implement it -- blurs or even
erases the boundaries between factual information and news, on the
one hand, and public relations, propaganda and psychological warfare,
on the other. And, while the policy ostensibly targets foreign
enemies, its most likely victim will be the American electorate.</TE>
<TE>   One of Rumsfeld's first steps into this minefield occurred last
year with the creation of the Pentagon's Office of Strategic
Influence. Part of its stated mission was to generate disinformation
and propaganda that would help the United States counter Islamic
extremists and pursue the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The office's nominal target was the foreign media, especially in
the Middle East and Asia. As critics soon pointed out, however, there
was no way -- in an age of instant global communications -- that
Washington could propagandize abroad without that same propaganda
spreading to the home front.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a public outcry, Rumsfeld declared it had all been a
big misunderstanding. The Pentagon would never lie to Americans. The
Office of Strategic Influence was shut down. But the impulse to
control public information and bend it to the service of government
objectives did not go away.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, Rumsfeld created a new position of deputy
undersecretary for "special plans," a euphemism for deception
operations. The special plans policy czar will sit atop a huge new
infrastructure being created in the name of information warfare.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 1, in a little-noticed but major reorganization, U.S.
Strategic Command took over all responsibilities for global
information attacks. The Omaha-based successor to the Strategic Air
Command has solely focused up to now on nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the country's most venerable and historic bombing
command, the 8th Air Force, which carried the air war to Germany in
World War II, has been directed to transfer its bomber and fighter
aircraft to other commands so that it can focus exclusively on
worldwide information attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy, meanwhile, has consolidated its efforts in a newly
formed Naval Network Warfare Command. And the Joint Strategic
Capabilities Plan, or JSCP, prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
now declares information to be just as important in war as
diplomatic, military or economic factors.</TE>
<TE>   The strategic capabilities plan is the central war-fighting
directive for the U.S. military. It establishes what are called
"Informational Flexible Deterrent Options" for global wars, such as
the war on terrorism, and separate plans written for individual
theaters of war, such as Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   To a large extent, these documents and the organizational shifts
behind them are focused on such missions as jamming or deceiving
enemy radar systems and disrupting command and control networks. Such
activities only carry forward efforts that have been part of U.S.
military tactics for decades or longer.</TE>
<TE>   But a summary of the strategic capabilities plan and a raft of
other Pentagon and armed forces documents made available to The Times
make it clear that the new approach now includes other elements as
well: the management of public information, efforts to control news
media sources and manipulation of public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   The plan summary, for instance, talks of "strategic" deception and
"influence operations" as basic tools in future wars. According to
another Defense Department directive on information warfare policy,
military leaders should use information "operations" to "heighten
public awareness; promote national and coalition policies, aims, and
objectives ... [and] counter adversary propaganda and disinformation
in the news."</TE>
<TE>   Both the Air Force and the Navy now list deception as one of five
missions for information warfare, along with electronic attack,
electronic protection, psychological . attacks and public affairs. A
September draft of a new Air Force policy describes information
warfare's goals as "destruction, degradation, denial, disruption,
deceit, and exploitation." These goals are referred to collectively
as "D5E."</TE>
<TE>   In order to do a better job of deception, the joint chiefs have
issued a "Joint Policy for Military Deception" that directs the
individual services to work on the task in peacetime as well as
wartime. Specifically, it orders the Air Force to develop better
doctrine and techniques for incorporating deception into war plans.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force, in response, now defines military deception as
action that "misleads adversaries, causing them to act in accordance
with" U.S. objectives. And, like the other services, it is
increasingly folding its "public affairs" apparatus -- that is, the
open world of media relations -- into the information warfare team.</TE>
<TE>   "Gaining and maintaining the information initiative in a conflict
can be a powerful weapon to defeat propaganda," the Air Force said in
its January doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   That echoes a statement by Navy Rear Adm. John Cryer III, who
worked on information warfare in the Combined Air Operations Center
in Saudi Arabia during the Afghanistan war: "It was our belief ... we
were losing the information war early when we watched Al Jazeera,"
Cryer said at an October conference, meaning that the U.S.
perspective was inadequately represented on the Arab world's
equivalent of CNN. "We came around, but it took a lot longer than it
should have."</TE>
<TE>   Of course there is nothing wrong with making sure the U.S. point
of view gets represented in the news media, both abroad and at home.
Done properly, that is a prescription for more openness and less
unnecessary secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that Rumsfeld's vision of information warfare seems
to push beyond the notion that American ideas and information should
compete with the enemy's on a level playing field. And Rumsfeld's
vision, with its melding of public information and deception, is
taking root in the armed services.</TE>
<TE>   The new Air Force doctrine, for example, declares that the news
media can be used not only to convey "the leadership's concern with
[an] issue," but also to avoid "the media going to other sources
[such as an adversary or critic of U.S. policy] for information." In
other words, information warfare now includes controlling as much as
possible what the American public sees and reads.</TE>
<TE>   The disinformation campaign being constructed goes against even
the military's own stated mission. Truthfulness, the Air Force says,
is a key to defeating adversaries. Accordingly, the service branch
adds, "U.S. and friendly forces must strive to become the favored
source of information."</TE>
<TE>   The potential for mischief is magnified by the fact that so much
of what the U.S. military does these days falls into the category of
covert operations. Americans are now operating out of secret bases in
places like Uzbekistan and the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq;
Special Forces units are said to be inside western Iraq as well. In
the meantime, the armed forces are making use of facilities in the
Arab states along the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   In all these cases and more, the U.S. and other western news media
depend on the military for information. Since reporters cannot travel
into parts of Iraq and other places in the region without military
escort, what they report is generally what they've been told.</TE>
<TE>   And when the information that military officers provide to the
public is part of a process that generates propaganda and places a
high value on deceit, deception and denial, then truth is indeed
likely to be high on the casualty list.</TE>
<TE>   That is bad news for the American public. In the end, it may be
even worse news for the Bush administration -- and for a U.S.
military that has spent more than 25 years climbing out of the
credibility trap called Vietnam.</TE>

<HD>A Haunting Echo</HD>
<DH>All who condemn the 1930s appeasement of Hitler's Germany
should reflect long and hard on whether a failure to act today
against Iraq will one day be viewed the same way</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shlomo Avineri</AU>
<BD>Shlomo Avineri is professor of political science at the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Let me start on a personal note: Three of my grandparents perished
during the Holocaust in Poland. This is why I find it an unspeakable
obscenity that my three grandchildren, who live in Jerusalem, may one
day be exposed to gas attacks by Iraq -- they have already been
issued gas masks. I am not alone among Israelis in having such
feelings. Together with strategic considerations, thoughts like mine
are ever present as Israelis contemplate the complex prospect of a
U.S.-led military strike against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   During the Gulf War of 1991, Israel experienced 39 missile attacks
by Iraq. So it's not surprising that today, most Israelis are deeply
ambivalent about the prospects of military action against Saddam
Hussein. On the one hand, they feel deeply threatened by Iraq and its
development of nonconventional weapons. The elimination of a bloody
and aggressive dictator like Hussein from the neighborhood would make
Israel more secure, and so there is an almost unanimous support in
Israel for toppling him, by force if necessary.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, Israel knows that if a military campaign is
undertaken, Hussein may respond, once again, by launching missile
attacks against the Jewish state.</LD>
<TE>   Israelis understand the reluctance to go to war; it should always
be the last resort. There is sympathy here for a Europe which,
devastated twice by wars in the last century, prefers negotiations to
force. Even German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's stated refusal to
join a United Nations-sanctioned action against Iraq is,
paradoxically, understood by many Israelis. They may criticize the
political wisdom of such a stance, but they also believe a pacifist
Germany is better than a belligerent one.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, though, Israelis cannot forget what happened when a
brutal and megalomaniacal dictator was ignored for too long during
the last century. Hussein is obviously not Hitler, but there are some
haunting parallels that cannot be overlooked. European appeasement of
Hitler in the 1930s is today viewed almost universally as a strategic
mistake and a morally bankrupt act. Perhaps we should examine the
lessons.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine Europe in 1936. Nazi Germany had not yet attacked any
country, but Hitler had:</TE>
<TE>   * violated the Versailles Treaty, which limited Germany's military
capabilities, and started rearming on a massive scale;</TE>
<TE>   * publicly committed himself to reversing the territorial losses
of Germany in World War I;</TE>
<TE>   * reoccupied the demilitarized Rhineland, in blatant contravention
of international agreements signed by Germany;</TE>
<TE>   * abolished the democratic structure of the Weimar Republic and
banned all political parties except his own;</TE>
<TE>   * thrown tens of thousands of opposition members, Jews, Gypsies
and gays into concentration camps;</TE>
<TE>   * expelled Jews from public service, the professions, universities
and schools and confiscated much of their property.</TE>
<TE>   But because Hitler had not yet attacked any foreign country, his
treatment of Jews and others was deemed an internal matter. Europe --
and the League of Nations, which Germany had in the meantime left --
ignored the catastrophe that was brewing. We now refer to that
willful blindness as appeasement.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine what might have happened had Britain and France followed a
different path and launched a military strike against Germany, with
or without a League of Nations mandate. Hitler's Germany, not yet the
military power it would become in 1939, would have been quickly
crushed. In the process, of course, numerous innocent Germans would
have been hurt or killed, but Germany's later aggression against
Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland, which caused huge numbers of
casualties, would never have happened. There would have been no World
War II, no Nazi occupation of Europe, no Holocaust. Last and perhaps
not least, some 12 million ethnic Germans who were expelled after
1945 from Eastern Europe would still live today in their ancestral
lands.</TE>
<TE>   Declaring war on Hitler's Germany in 1936 would have been the
correct course of action, morally and strategically, for the European
powers. European pacifists would have opposed military action, but
they too would have been spared the agonies of the following years
and of a devastating world war.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, Hussein's record today is worse than Hitler's was in
1936. Hussein has already invaded two of his neighbors (Iran and
Kuwait), attacked Israel with missiles and used poison gas against
his own population. His treatment of the Iraqi Kurds is much worse
than Hitler's treatment of the Jews was by 1936. And Hussein may
possess weapons of mass destruction Hitler hadn't dreamed of. With
all the understandable reluctance to launch a war, shouldn't Europe
-- and the rest of the world -- be considering these parallels?
Wouldn't the world be a better place today if the international
community in 1936 had possessed the will to stop Hitler?</TE>
<TE>   The question of what happens in Iraq after Hussein is legitimate,
but it should not be used as an excuse for inaction. When Britain
declared war on Nazi Germany in 1939, had the British planned for a
"post-Hitler" Germany? Would President Franklin D. Roosevelt have
believed that U.S. troops would still be stationed in Germany 60
years after the U.S. entered the war?</TE>
<TE>   Wars are unpredictable, even for the victors, and therefore should
be waged only if all other avenues have been exhausted. But all who
condemn the 1930s appeasement of Germany should reflect long and hard
on whether a failure to act today against Iraq will one day be viewed
the same way.</TE>
<TE>   If Hitler had been stopped earlier, my three grandparents -- and
numerous uncles, aunts and cousins -- would not have perished in the
gas chambers. That's my personal story. But the "if only" that stems
from the 1930s appeasement extends to tens of millions who lost
family members, both civilians and soldiers, who might have been
spared. A world without World War II would have been a better place.
A world without Hussein will ultimately be a safer place, regardless
of how he is brought down.</TE>

<AU>Scott Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Scott Gottlieb, an internist, is a resident fellow at
the American Enterprise Institute and a staff writer for the British
Medical Journal.</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Leigh was admitted to my hospital's medical service with fever and
severe lower abdominal pain. A CT scan of her belly revealed a large
infection. All the internists caring for Leigh agreed she needed to
have the infection surgically drained. But she was gravely ill. The
hardest part of her care was finding a doctor willing to cut her
open.</LD>
<LD>   A few surgeons took one look at the size of Leigh's infection and
her weak condition, and recommended that she have it drained by a
less-invasive procedure performed by an interventional radiologist.
It was true, the less-invasive route was easier and posed fewer
immediate risks to Leigh's health. The surgeons worried that she
would die from an operation as surely as from the infection. They
didn't want to take the chance.</LD>
<LD>   But the less-invasive procedure wouldn't get rid of all the pus in
her belly. The internists caring for Leigh remained sure the risky
surgery was her only hope. These are the medical battles played out
every day in hospitals as doctors of different temperament and
training approach similar problems with different resolve. So we
called the hospital's most daring surgeon. He agreed to operate.
Leigh's abscess was surgically drained. She recovered quickly and
left the hospital two weeks later.</LD>
<TE>   A surgeon's decision to wield a scalpel is a subjective one. Some
are eager to pursue the surgical fix. Others are more conservative
and see it as a tool of last resort.</TE>
<TE>   In California, two surgeons at a Redding hospital were recently
accused of performing unnecessary heart operations in order to reap
extra revenue. The California doctors might well be guilty of
terrible abuses -- federal investigators are still examining
documents seized recently in a raid of the doctors' offices -- but
the questions raised by the investigation are having consequences far
beyond Redding. They are stoking a reexamination of surgery rates
nationwide and sending a chill through surgical suites.</TE>
<TE>   The same source that tracks health-care utilization rates and
first brought attention to the Redding doctors -- the Dartmouth Atlas
of Health Care in the United States -- has meantime found a host of
disparities in care.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare patients who live in Stockton, for example, are more than
six times as likely to have coronary angioplasty as those in Buffalo,
N.Y. Seniors living in Fort Myers, Fla., are four times as likely to
have back surgery for disc disease as those residing in nearby Miami.
Resection of the prostate for enlargement is performed in Columbus,
Ga., at three times the rate it is in nearby Augusta.</TE>
<TE>   But do these numbers really tell us much beyond that different
doctors have different approaches? Do they really suggest that some
doctors are being too quick to cut?</TE>
<TE>   When surgeons display different propensities to use certain
procedures, it's rarely a symptom of malfeasance. Surgery is an
inexact science, subject to a doctor's judgment and daring and also
to the desires of the patient. Still, discrepancies between one
hospital's surgery rates and another's are increasingly being
interpreted as possible indicators of abuse. This has become a
primary way by which Medicare manages its costs.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare flags physicians according to certain statistical
yardsticks, such as the number of procedures they perform, and then
launches a probe to sift through a possible offender's records. While
most doctors are cleared of these suspicions, the threat of the
auditing process itself sends the desired message: Administer care
sparingly or face a time-consuming and costly federal probe. The
episode in California will probably be taken by the government as a
vindication of its efforts and may well increase reliance on the
practice.</TE>
<TE>   The system is structured this way because Medicare is the primary
watchdog. Health-care plans like Medicare and its member HMOs cite
the wide range of practice variations to justify efforts to
standardize care according to their medical cookbooks. Patients don't
always keep watch, since they are shielded from the cost of medical
decisions and have little incentive to resist a procedure pitched as
necessary, particularly if it is noninvasive and low risk. Patients
are also effectively prevented from seeking out the best information
since Medicare's increased reliance on HMOs often makes second
opinions costly and difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Medical decisions -- and very likely, outcomes -- could be
improved if insurers encouraged patients to participate in health
care decisions and gain the knowledge they need to make informed
choices. If doctors fully took patient preferences into account,
there would still be practice variations. But the authors of the
Dartmouth study argue that patient choices wouldn't produce nearly as
much variation among regions as do physician choices. So about the
same percentage of informed patients would choose, say,
breast-sparing surgery in Ogden, Utah, as anywhere else. In contrast,
lumpectomies are now performed 15 times more often on Long Island
than in Ogden.</TE>
<TE>   In New York City, heart surgeons were ranked for a time by the
state medical authorities according to the mortality rates of their
patients. Where high-risk patients could have received open-heart
surgery from dozens of top doctors a decade ago, there were suddenly
fewer surgeons willing to take a chance on the most difficult cases.
They didn't want to rack up too many bad outcomes, lest they appear
in the rankings to be poor surgeons -- and invite the ire of state
medical investigators. New York righted the system by relying on
risk-adjusted measures that took into account how sick the patients
were to begin with.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of shared decision-making, the impetus to use raw
measures such as surgery rates as red flags is destructive, a kind of
arbitrary scrutiny that will make aggressive or high-volume surgeons
an even rarer breed. These kinds of crude numbers give an incomplete
picture, and will bring the same undesired backlash experienced in
New York, making surgeons like the one who ultimately operated on
Leigh more reluctant to take on the most difficult cases lest they
run afoul of a yardstick.</TE>
<TE>   Referring physicians like me, who often must spend hours calling
around in order to find a surgeon willing to take on a tough case,
aren't well served well by the government's heavy-handed tactics.
Neither are our patients.</TE>

<KH>LATIN AMERICA</KH>
<HD>The New Crop of Leaders Is No Cause for U.S. Worry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Hakim</AU>
<BD>Peter Hakim is president of the Inter-American
Dialogue.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>After nearly five years of deepening economic despair and growing
political disorder, Latin Americans may be tempted to abandon market
economics, democratic politics and their decade-long effort to hook
their economic future to the United States. Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva's victory last month in Brazil's presidential elections
suggests they may be giving in to temptation. Not since Hugo Chavez
was elected president of Venezuela in 1998 has the left registered
such a success. With the expected election today of a populist
president in Ecuador and gains made by Peru's leading leftist party
in regional elections last week, that success shows signs of
multiplying.</LD>
<LD>   The longer-term significance of Lula and other leftist leaders
hinges mostly on whether they can govern responsibly, revive growth,
maintain economic stability and deal effectively with critical social
needs. If so, they may produce a reordering of Latin America's
political map -- and help reinvigorate the region's erratic and
dispirited politics.</LD>
<LD>   But some in Washington, including the chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), already
see the emergence of a Latin axis of evil, with Lula making common
cause with Fidel Castro and Chavez. Their anxiety is unwarranted.</LD>
<TE>   Wherever one turns in Latin America, moderation, not extremism,
seems the order of the day. Despite his populist rhetoric and
origins, Ecuador's Lucio Gutierrez, if elected today, will retain the
U.S. dollar as his country's official currency -- and, like Lula,
will work with the International Monetary Fund to pay down his
nation's debt. In Argentina, the "anti-system candidates" calling for
a radical political make-over have been dropping steadily in the
polls despite the economy's continuing woes. The winner of next
March's presidential election is likely to come from the Peronist
party. And Latin America's most vocal populist, Chavez, may soon be
forced from office.</TE>
<TE>   Nor are Latin American countries turning their backs to the United
States. Chile will soon sign a free-trade agreement with Washington.
This year, Central American countries eagerly accepted a U.S.
invitation to begin free-trade negotiations, and the Andean region
countries lobbied Washington hard to maintain trade preferences.
Nearly every nation in Latin America wants the continuing free-trade
negotiations with the U.S. to succeed. The exception may be Brazil,
but free-trade arrangements fell out of favor there long before
Lula's triumph at the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Latin American support for market economics, at around 57%, has
remained stable over the last three years, according to the respected
Latinobarometro poll. Most of the region's citizens oppose turning
state enterprises into private companies because these transactions
are widely viewed as rife with corruption. In the same poll, some 70%
of Latin Americans held a "good" or "very good" opinion of the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   These positive trends do not offset the fact that dissatisfaction
with economic performance in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America is
widespread and deep. Many blame the IMF, World Bank and the U.S.
Treasury -- along with the national leaders and parties implementing
the market model for economic growth -- for their misery. If the
region continues to stagnate economically and flounder politically,
advocates of alternative policies and approaches will gain strength
and begin to win more elections, as happened in Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   The most important test of Lula's commitment to a centrist agenda
is whether he adheres to the strict fiscal targets of Brazil's IMF
program. So far, he has resisted appeals from state governors to
renegotiate debts and has proposed only moderate wage hikes. If Lula
perseveres, the new president will reassure foreign investors and
enjoy access to the international credit Brazil needs.</TE>
<TE>   Lula's government also has to kick-start a languishing economy,
which will require Brazil's still-insular economy to open further.
That means the United States and Brazil will have to reach
politically difficult compromises if they are to successfully
negotiate a hemisphere-wide free-trade agreement. In addition, Lula
will be challenged early on to win congressional approval for two
critical reforms that will help the government balance its books and
free resources for social uses. One is revamping the country's
archaic tax system; the other is restructuring wasteful and patently
unfair pension plans that Lula's public-sector union allies zealously
defend.</TE>
<TE>   That will make it difficult for Lula to satisfy immediately his
staunchest supporters, Brazil's poor. He has announced a campaign
against hunger, but it is also important that he sustain his
predecessor's progress in education, health and land reform. That all
requires money he doesn't have. But by attacking racial
discrimination, which demands presidential leadership more than new
resources, he can help Brazil's poorest and most excluded group, the
40% of African descent.</TE>
<TE>   Although Lula may not become a Latin American Tony Blair, a fully
committed "third way" politician, he is no Marxist-Leninist, and his
commitment to democratic politics is unquestioned. Nor is he a
one-man band like either Chavez or Castro. He is backed by an
established political party that has elected half a dozen governors
and more than 70 mayors, and now holds more seats than any other in
the Brazilian congress.</TE>
<TE>   Washington needn't worry.</TE>

<HD>Latino Pols Face a Double Standard</HD>
<DH>When did you last hear of a case of 'white sleaze'?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory Rodriguez</AU>
<BD>Gregory Rodriguez, a contributing editor to Opinion, is
a senior fellow at the New America Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When James K. Hahn's mayoral campaign aired a racially loaded TV ad
featuring the image of a crack cocaine pipe, attacking rival Antonio
Villaraigosa, there was no public uproar over the sorry state of
"white politics." When Gray Davis and Bill Simon were mired in an
issueless negative campaign for governor, nobody expected fellow
"white leaders" to call a summit meeting and denounce their
uninspired tactics. Yet, when Ricardo Torres II, on behalf of his
friend, Councilman Nick Pacheco, distributed two sleazy fliers
attacking Villaraigosa, Pacheco's chief rival in Los Angeles' 14th
Council District, Latino officials rushed to denounce the tactics.
Many even felt compelled to forswear the use of negative campaigning
in future political races. The patronizing moral outrage of the media
and many non-Latinos amounted to a collective gasp at the newest
antics of "those darn Latinos."</LD>
<LD>   The media have long tended to treat nonwhites as if they live in a
different country from white Americans. Journalists routinely write
about monolithic ethnic and racial "communities" with their own
leaders, agendas and codes of ethics. But this vision of America as a
confederation of mutually exclusive "communities" is not only
wrongheaded, it obscures the fact that we all share a common civic
and political culture. Mexican American politicians neither invented
nor perfected the art of political sleaze.</LD>
<TE>   The criticism heaped on Hahn for his crack-pipe ad did not
generalize to whites because they are portrayed as thinking and
acting as individuals. The media never describe them as living and
working in the "white community." We don't expect whites to shoulder
the burden of having to reprimand or keep "their people" in line.
When a white politician disgraces himself in office, it reflects on
him, not on his race.</TE>
<TE>   The sin of a nonwhite political leader, in contrast, is treated as
an extension of some minority mind-set. His disgrace becomes ethnic
disgrace, and "responsible" leaders must discipline the perpetrator
to defend ethnic honor.</TE>
<TE>   This antiquated understanding of minority "leaders" stems in part
from the civil rights era, when the African American elite was
morally bound to speak for blacks who were denied the vote. But it's
long past time that we acknowledge that contemporary black and Latino
officials represent the districts that elected them, not their racial
and ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   Many Latino and black officials, to be sure, like to talk as if
they do represent their minority groups. By doing so, they hope to
broaden their influence and increase their moral authority. But it
can't be much fun to be propped up by the media as an ethnic leader
or icon. By some accounts, Villaraigosa, who generally ran an
exemplary pan-ethnic campaign for mayor, was unduly burdened by the
media's apparent need to place the adjective "Latino" before his
candidacy. The heavy ethnic symbolism imposed upon him may have
undercut his pan-ethnic appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it is Villaraigosa's iconic value that drew Torres'
below-the-belt fire in the first place. Reports to the contrary, the
hit pieces were not focused on white people or pochos, the term
Mexicans sometimes use to demean Mexican Americans. The mailing
accusing the former Assembly speaker of listening to his "white
advisors," "speaking pocho Spanish" and selling out "our community"
was crudely calculated to call into question Villaraigosa's ethnic
credibility among newly naturalized immigrant voters in the district.
The second, more disturbing flier, attacking Villaraigosa's personal
life, aimed to tarnish his moral authority.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the tactics nor the fliers' messages are new -- or, for
that matter, noteworthy in U.S. politics. It is their crude and
amateurish nature that makes them so shocking. "We're used to them
being more insidious and subtle," says a City Hall insider. "If
anything, these fliers offend our sense of professionalism. They're
just not sportsmanlike."</TE>
<TE>   In politics -- brown, black, white and striped -- ethnicity or
race is often deployed, subtly or overtly, as a weapon to divide and
conquer. "This is a very old story," says Jack Pitney Jr., a
professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. "The personal
attacks and the injection of race and ethnicity into the campaign ...
are, unfortunately, classic parts of American politics."</TE>
<TE>   Surrogates for Villaraigosa's mayoral campaign played the ethnic
card when they publicly questioned the ethnic loyalties of Pacheco
and Council President Alex Padilla after the two Latinos endorsed
Hahn for mayor. The first Torres mailing similarly attempted to
leverage ethnic distrust to undermine Villaraigosa. But this is not a
"Latino thing."</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, then-Republican Gov. Pete Wilson leveraged fear of and
disdain for immigrants to further his political ambitions. Ever
since, the state Democratic Party has used the specter of Wilson --
the ultimate big, bad white guy -- to push Latinos to the polls. A
few years ago, one Democratic group sent out "voter identification
cards" to registered Latino voters in case they were prohibited from
voting, presumably by a racist white poll worker.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the identification cards, Torres' 6,000 pieces of mail
aimed to depress voter turnout. Readers of the fliers cannot help but
feel turned off by the nasty tone the campaign has already taken. In
a slash-and-burn campaign, when voter turnout is low, the incumbent
usually wins by default. If that's the case, the 14th District will
be the real loser.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, it's important to understand why the 14th District and others
like it are natural spawning grounds for sleazy politics. Despite
their portrayals in movies and television, barrios tend to be
transitional, unstable neighborhoods, where people are not fully
invested in their communities. In 1990, about three-quarters of
adults in Boyle Heights, which is the heart of the 14th District,
were foreign-born, and roughly half of them had arrived in the
country during the previous decade. Over the last 30 years, the
neighborhood has become denser, poorer and more heavily immigrant.
While newcomers have injected energy and renewed commercial activity
into the area, they are often just passing through on their way to
more desirable living conditions. Relatively low civic participation
and the absence of strong local institutions converge to allow
district politicians to function with little accountability.</TE>
<TE>   The huge rush to naturalization in the 1990s, as well as the
excitement generated by campaigns like Villaraigosa's bid for mayor,
was good for immigrant neighborhoods and the city's democracy. The
greatest tragedy of the Torres mailings is that these newly energized
citizens might become fully turned off by the nastiness of U.S.
politics several generations ahead of schedule. The negativity of the
recent gubernatorial campaign produced the lowest voter turnout in
California in almost a century. If Californians are ever going to
turn this around, they can't afford to pretend that any one group
bears more responsibility than others for the sorry state of
politics.</TE>

<HD>Striking Iraq, Stroking North Korea</HD>
<DH>Why can't President Bush show the same restraint toward
Baghdad that he's shown to the far-more-dangerous Pyongyang?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jay Taylor</AU>
<BD>Jay Taylor is an associate in research at the John
Fairbank Center for East Asian Research at Harvard University and a
former deputy assistant secretary of State for intelligence and
research in the Reagan administration.</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>The Iraq crisis will probably be resolved one way or another over the
next few months. Either U.S. military action or simply its threat
will again prove effective. This is because Iraq has no significant
deterrent to our use of force. In fact, the Iraq threat, although
certainly serious, is comparatively small. So why, then, is the full
force of our national invective being aimed at Baghdad, particularly
when the world holds a much greater threat to the United States and
its allies: North Korea?</LD>
<LD>   In contrast to his demands for dealing quickly and forcefully with
Iraq, President Bush seemed positively calm last month when
discussing the disturbing news that North Korea has been -- and
continues -- working on a uranium enrichment program. "We felt like
they had given their word they weren't going to do this," the
president mildly complained. He then went ahead and approved the
delivery of a U.S. shipment of heavy fuel oil to North Korea under a
1994 agreement, which Pyongyang asserted was "nullified" or "hanging
by a thread."</LD>
<TE>   North Korea attempted to justify its actions with the explanation
that its designation by the U.S. as part of an "axis of evil" was
tantamount to a declaration of war, and that therefore North Korea
had every right to pursue the development of any powerful weapon it
needed to defend itself. After Bush talked over the matter with his
counterparts from Japan and South Korea, the three countries, in
cautious diplomatic language, warned North Korea that its "relations
with the international community" hinged on the prompt dismantlement
of its clandestine nuclear weapons program. Further oil shipments
have been halted.</TE>
<TE>   Few in the United States or elsewhere have objected to the
president's coolheaded and multilateral approach to Pyongyang's
provocation. Americans, however, may be excused if they wonder
whether Iraq or North Korea is the bigger threat and which is the
best target for a preemptive American military strike.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea has a far greater capability of inflicting death and
destruction on the U.S. and its allies than Iraq. Pyongyang may
already have one or more plutonium-based nuclear weapons and now
brazenly admits to a program that, if successful, could lead to the
production of six high-yield enriched uranium bombs a year. At the
same time, intelligence agencies here and abroad agree that Iraq has
no nuclear weapons and is at best four years away from obtaining
them.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea, meanwhile, is the world's largest exporter of missile
technology. According to the latest CIA National Threat Estimate,
Pyongyang will by 2015 "most likely" possess missiles that could
deliver nuclear weapons onto American cities. The same report judges
Iraq as having only the "possibility" of building a similar threat in
that time, and that would only be if international sanctions on
Baghdad were lifted. North Korea also has an advanced program of
chemical and biological weapons development and unlike Iraq did not
have international inspectors detecting and destroying its stockpiles
during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In explaining the differences between Iraq and North Korea,
President Bush has emphasized Hussein's oppression of his people,
implying it is worse than that of North Korea. But in comparing the
terrible things the two regimes have done to their respective
subjects, the brutal totalitarianism of North Korea, by almost any
measure, is considerably worse than the brutal dictatorship of
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   In suppressing a Kurdish uprising during the 1980s, the Iraqi
government killed some 5,000 civilians with poison gas. If there had
been a similar uprising in North Korea -- a more closed society than
Iraq -- the world would very likely never have heard of its bloody
suppression. We do know from international aid workers, however, that
as a result of disastrous economic policies, up to 2 million rural
North Koreans have died of starvation, malnutrition and related
diseases in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   If a war on Iraq is to be considered part of a war on terrorism,
North Korea has proved itself a far greater terrorist threat. Its
agents blew up a South Korean airliner carrying 115 people in 1987,
carried out assassinations in South Korea, kidnapped Japanese
citizens and tried to kill a South Korean leader traveling abroad.
Moreover, the regime has dealt in narcotics and distributed
counterfeit U.S. dollars.</TE>
<TE>   A conservative conclusion is that North Korea is certainly no less
"evil" than Iraq and no less hostile to America. But it is without
question much more powerful than Iraq and thus poses a much greater
threat to the United States. But up to now neither menace has been
imminent and thus neither has warranted preemptive destruction.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, when the North attacked South Korea, and in 1990, when
Iraq invaded Kuwait, the regimes thought or had been led to believe
the U.S. would not intervene. Since those dates, the two states,
despite their intense hatred of the U.S., have been deterred from
attacking either militarily or through terrorism. They know and
greatly fear the inevitable reprisal that would surely end in their
own ruin. Iraq, with its huge potential oil wealth, has even more to
lose than desperately poor North Korea. But in both cases, deterrence
has worked very well, and there is no good reason to believe it would
not continue to do so.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, when we turn the dynamic of deterrence around
and calculate the cost to the U.S. of launching a preemptive war, we
find a great difference between Iraq and North Korea. Iraq may have a
few rusting Scud missiles hidden away in the mountains that might
possibly hit invading American troops and Israel -- perhaps with
biological and chemical weapons. The White House and the Israeli
government, however, believe such threats to be containable;
otherwise they would not be so willing to risk provoking them.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, North Korea, as it has threatened, could
unquestionably turn Seoul into a "sea of fire" in the event of a U.S.
attack. The North has thousands of artillery cannon and missiles
aimed at the South Korean capital and U.S. forces in the South. Most
of North Korea's million-man army is poised for attack near the
border. This includes 50,000 special operations personnel trained for
rapid deployment behind South Korean and American lines. One of the
North's fleet of submarines might get through and sink an American
carrier. (Hussein, by comparison, essentially has no navy.)
Washington must also assume that the North has at least one nuclear
weapon that could conceivably be deployed in several ways.
Eventually, American and South Korean forces would prevail, but
hundreds of thousands or even millions could be killed.</TE>
<TE>   This brings up the other telling difference between Iraq and North
Korea. Almost every South Korean man, woman and child is aghast at
the thought of the United States launching a preemptive war against
the North. Without the most serious provocation or compelling proof
of an imminent North Korean onslaught, South Korea would vigorously
oppose any such American strike. The Israeli government of Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon, in contrast, is pleased with the prospect of
America destroying a regime that it sees as one of Israel's principal
state enemies. The new Israeli foreign minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,
has publicly suggested that Israel's hand in dealing with the
Palestinians will be strengthened once the Americans get rid of
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Bush seems to recognize that the best way to deal with the serious
threat that North Korea poses to the South -- and could eventually
pose directly to the United States -- is to continue the policy that
has succeeded over the long term with other powerful adversaries:
working with regional allies to assure the continuation of collective
military deterrence; pursuing diplomacy; and exploiting opportunities
to open up the hermetically sealed enemy. In his first few months in
office, Bush brusquely rejected this long-term approach to Pyongyang.
Today, he wisely embraces it.</TE>
<TE>   Why hasn't the president adopted a similar policy of deterrence
and diplomacy toward Iraq? The threat of war against Baghdad helped
the Republicans, perhaps critically, in the recent elections. But
Bush is also clearly convinced that a war against Iraq, unlike one
against North Korea, could be concluded quickly and successfully with
few casualties among Americans and friendly neighbor countries. In
addition, Bush no doubt believes a successful military assault on
Iraq would provide a needed victory for his newly proclaimed strategy
of preemptive war and would, rather than provoking the "Arab street,"
teach it a sobering lesson.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's success in getting the
president to sign on to another round of U.N. weapons inspections may
have slowed the momentum for war. And Bush senior advisor Karl Rove,
with his Republican electoral victory in hand, may be less likely to
urge Bush to action. Still, the threat of a costly, unilateral,
preemptive war looms. One hopes the president will consider taking
the same calm and deliberate approach with Iraq that he has taken
with the more dangerous North Korea.</TE>

<LD>Question: We live in Carson. When we applied for senior citizen
apartments, we were approved based upon my husband's Supplemental
Security Income check of $692 per month and support from our children
of $200 a month. Things haven't worked out too well for our children,
and in 2001 they had to cut off their support. Despite this, we give
priority to paying our $561 monthly rent and we have never been late.
Can we be evicted now for not meeting the income requirements?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: No. The income requirement is used to determine whether
you are a good rent-payment risk before you rent the apartment. You
cannot be evicted now for not meeting the income requirements unless
there is something specifically written into your lease or rental
agreement that constitutes some good reason for the requirement,
which I can't imagine. The bottom line, though, is that as long as
you pay the rent on time, the issue should never come up.</LD>
<LD>   Laws on eviction, rent-control vary</LD>
<TE>   Question: Several of my friends and I own duplexes in Los Angeles.
We are always wondering about your general information about
evictions, rent raises and rent controls. Does rent control apply to
duplexes? How about owner-occupied duplexes? Are they one-unit
rentals and, thus, exempt from rent control? Finally, can we evict
tenants at the end of their leases if they are not good tenants?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: In Santa Monica, owner-occupied duplexes and triplexes are
exempt from rent control if the owners apply to the city for
exemptions. Not so in Los Angeles. In the early days of Los Angeles
rent control, two unattached houses on a lot were exempt from rent
control. They are no longer exempt since the Los Angeles City Council
changed the law a few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Duplexes were covered by rent control from the beginning except
for those defined as new construction (Certificate of Occupancy first
issued after Oct. 1, 1978). As you may know, under rent control,
annual inflation rent increases are limited to 3% of the monthly
rent.</TE>
<TE>   Evictions are limited under the "just cause eviction" section of
the law. You may evict only under the following circumstances:
Nonpayment of rent; violation of the lease or rental agreement; being
a nuisance or causing damage to the unit; using the unit for illegal
purposes; refusing to sign a new lease with similar provisions;
refusing reasonable access; having an illegal subtenant in
possession; owner- or manager-occupancy; demolishing the property;
removing the unit from rental housing use permanently; to comply with
a government agency's order; or certain Housing and Urban Development
units. No-fault evictions in which the tenant is not at fault --
owner move-ins, demolitions or evictions pursuant to government
orders -- require payment of relocation fees ranging from $2,000 to
$5,000 to tenants. Seniors 62 or older, the disabled or tenants with
minor dependent children (younger than) all get $5,000. Others
receive $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   Give tenants adequate notice</TE>
<TE>   Question: I own a single-family home in Studio City. It is for
sale now. I am renting out a couple of rooms to unrelated tenants on
a month-to-month basis. I have no agreements or contracts with them,
nor do I have any problems. One has lived there for eight months and
the other for over a year. When I sell my house and want them to
leave, what are my responsibilities? How much notice must I give?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: You must give tenants in Los Angeles 60-day notices to
move if they have lived in the apartment for at least one year. A
30-day notice is required for tenants in residence for less than a
year. Starting Jan. 1, all tenants in California who have lived in
their rentals for one year or longer are entitled to 60-day notices
under a new state law. Although single-family homes rented to one
group of tenants (one tenancy) are exempt from rent control, you are
covered by it because you have two separate tenants and tenancies,
unless your home is defined as new construction or exempted from the
law for some other reason. As a result, you will also have to pay
both tenants' relocation fees. The "just cause" of the eviction would
be for owner-occupancy.</TE>

<HD>Altadena balances the traditional and offbeat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Carrier</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Altadena, at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains, was named to mean
"above Pasadena," but it could just as easily be a contraction for
"alternative Pasadena." During Prohibition, Pasadena practiced
temperance while Altadena cultivated wine grapes. That same
resistance to conformity continues today in this diverse community of
43,000.</LD>
<LD>   Insider's view</LD>
<LD>   Altadena has a reputation for attracting independent-spirited
people, from prolific western writer Zane Grey to bongo-playing
Caltech physicist Richard P. Feynman, who was well-known for both his
zest for life and his Nobel Prize in physics.</LD>
<TE>   Altadena's unconventional citizens include an artist who is
building a never-ending wall from recycled materials and a
conservationist who has created a controversially large compost pile.
But you're just as likely to live next door to a Disney or Jet
Propulsion Lab executive, a teacher or a machine operator.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing card</TE>
<TE>   Like much of Pasadena, Altadena has historic homes, architectural
variety and mature foliage. But Altadena is more relaxed, rustic and
often more affordable than its incorporated neighbor to the south.</TE>
<TE>   Wow factor</TE>
<TE>   Altadena is bordered on three sides by nature: the San Gabriel
Mountains to the north, the Arroyo Seco to the west and Eaton Canyon
Park to the east.</TE>
<TE>   The mountain views and easy access to hiking and biking trails, as
well as lot sizes of one-third to one-half an acre and a scarcity of
sidewalks, lend an away-from-it-all feel.</TE>
<TE>   Good news, bad news</TE>
<TE>   Since 1880, Altadena has repeatedly shot down attempts to
incorporate or be swallowed up by Pasadena. Many of Altadena's
independent residents think that's a good thing. A few, however, long
for more city control, pointing to pockets of sloppy subdivisions and
poorly executed add-ons as evidence of loose reins.</TE>
<TE>   Hot spots</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena has its bungalows, Angeleno Heights has its Victorians
and Altadena has its English Tudors.</TE>
<TE>   In northwest Altadena, Janes Village boasts more than 180 English
Tudor cottages. The two- and three-bedroom homes, built in the 1920s,
sell in the mid-$300,000 range, according to Tom Joyce of Tom Joyce
Realty.</TE>
<TE>   On the east side of town, more palatial English Tudors dominate
Boulder Road. Before flood-control measures, boulders sometimes
tumbled down the picturesque street. Those same rolling stones are
used to landscape the front lawns of homes priced between the low
$600,000s and the high $900,000s.</TE>
<TE>   Report card</TE>
<TE>   Altadena's seven elementary schools and one middle school are part
of the Pasadena Unified School District, where most standardized test
scores fall below the 50th percentile nationwide. Many who can afford
the tuition opt for private schools, but Eliot Middle School is
seeing a gradual return of middle-income families from the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   On the market</TE>
<TE>   Homes in Altadena's nine square miles range from manicured estates
in the east to rustic mountain homes on the northern edge to more
urban, higher-density housing on the western fringe.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, 67 homes are on the market, ranging from a two-bedroom
condominium for $150,000 to an estate on more than an acre for
$1,795,000, according to Ken Balder of Coldwell Banker Realty.</TE>

<LD>Nicole Kidman's Pacific Palisades home is in escrow at close to $11
million.</LD>
<LD>   The actress assumed ownership of the property as part of her 2001
divorce settlement with actor Tom Cruise, who purchased the home for
about $4.7 million shortly before they were married in 1990.</LD>
<LD>   Kidman also got the couple's multistory waterfront home on Sydney
Harbour through the divorce, and she recently bought a place in
Manhattan in the West Village.</LD>
<TE>   The 1940s Palisades house, behind gates at the end of a long
driveway, has five bedrooms and six bathrooms in about 7,600 square
feet, according to public records. It is on nearly an acre with a
pool.</TE>
<TE>   The home wasn't listed and was only shown a couple of times.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman, 35, co-starred with Cruise, 40, in the 1990 movie "Days of
Thunder," which marked her U.S. film debut. The couple subsequently
co-starred in "Far and Away" (1992) and "Eyes Wide Shut" (1999).
Kidman also was in "Batman Returns" (1995). She made her acting debut
on the London and Broadway stages, starring in "The Blue Room," in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   She was nominated for a best actress Oscar for her role in "Moulin
Rouge" (2001) and the same year had a No. 1 hit record in Britain
when she recorded "Somethin' Stupid" with singer Robbie Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Kidman plays Virginia Woolf in "The Hours" and co-stars in "Cold
Mountain." Both films are due out in December. She also stars
opposite Anthony Hopkins in "The Human Stain," expected to be
released in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Musician hits a high note in Hancock Park</TE>
<TE>   Beck, the Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter who came to
national attention in the '90s with his single "Loser," has purchased
a Spanish-style home in Hancock Park for slightly more than its
$2.3-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The house has three bedrooms, a maid's quarters, a game room and
an office in about 6,600 square feet. There are hand-painted ceilings
and mosaic tiles in the 1920s home. The property also has a guest
house and a pool.</TE>
<TE>   Beck, 32, teamed up this year with Nigel Godrich to produce the
album "Sea Change." Among Beck's earlier albums were "Odelay,"
"Mutations" and "Midnite Vultures."</TE>
<TE>   Beck -- known as "the king of musical collage" for fusing rap,
rock, folk and funk -- has been on tour this fall and is scheduled to
appear Monday with Flaming Lips at the Universal Amphitheatre in
Universal City.</TE>
<TE>   Skating pair warm to Laguna Beach</TE>
<TE>   Todd Sand and Jenni Meno, U.S. champion pair skaters preparing for
their fifth season on tour with Stars on Ice, have purchased a Laguna
Beach home. The asking price was $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The married couple are residents of Nevada but bought in Laguna so
they could continue their training in Orange County near their
longtime coach John Nicks.</TE>
<TE>   The contemporary-style Laguna house has three bedrooms and
an office in 3,100 square feet. The master suite has a fireplace. The
1991 home, above Victoria Beach, abuts acres of picturesque canyons
and has coastal and Catalina Island views.</TE>
<TE>   Sand and Meno are three-time U.S. Pair Champions, 1998 World
Silver Medalists, two-time World Bronze Medalists and three-time
Olympians.</TE>
<TE>   They are due to appear with skating champ Scott Hamilton in an NBC
special Dec. 14 and with singer Ray Charles in an NBC special Dec.
21. They are also planning to skate in a Christmas special with
singer Charlotte Church on Christmas and on NBC's "Today" show
Christmas morning.</TE>
<TE>   Meno and Sand were represented by Victoria Strombom of Re/Max Real
Estate Services, Monarch Beach. Strombom also represented the couple
in the sale of their previous Orange County home. That home was in
Aliso Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Empty-nester opts for the farm life</TE>
<TE>   Casey Coates Danson, Hollywood activist and environmental
designer, has put her Brentwood home on the market at $3.95 million.</TE>
<TE>   She is selling because her children, by former husband actor Ted
Danson, are in college and she is spending more time at her Santa Fe
farm. She also has purchased a smaller home in Rustic Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   She founded and runs L.A.-based Global Possibilities, a nonprofit
organization dedicated to promoting the use of solar and renewable
energy to reduce a dependency on fossil fuels and to mitigate climate
change.</TE>
<TE>   Danson bought her Brentwood house 4 1/2 years ago. Two years ago
she completed a two-year project, turning the nondescript '50s home
into what she calls "a contemporary craftsman" that is about 95%
solar-powered. The house, on 1.3 wooded acres behind gates, has wood
and stone features and many skylights.</TE>
<TE>   The 5,000-square-foot residence, with canyon-to-ocean views,
includes a three-bedroom, 3 1/2-bathroom main house and a detached
guest house. The master suite has a fireplace and a gym. Among other
features in the main house are an art studio, office and dark room.
There is also a newly built, solar-heated infinity pool and spa on
the property.</TE>
<TE>   Kathi Holland and Penny Warren of Coldwell Banker, Studio City,
have the listing and represented Danson in buying her homes in
Brentwood and Rustic Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   New chapter for Sinclair home</TE>
<TE>   The Upton Sinclair House in Monrovia has sold for $725,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish Colonial Revival-style home, built in 1923 for a hotel
magnate and his wife, was purchased in the early '40s by the
author-social reformer already known for his expose of the
meat-packing industry in "The Jungle" and for his failed bids for
governor.</TE>
<TE>   After Sinclair moved into the house, he finished his novel
"Dragon's Teeth," for which he won a 1943 Pulitzer Prize. Sinclair
lived in the house for 24 years.</TE>
<TE>   In the '70s, the three-bedroom, 2,380-square-foot house was
designated a National Historic Landmark, and it was granted local
landmark status.</TE>
<TE>   A Mission Revival parapet tops the facade. The front door is
covered with bronze grillwork depicting the initial "V" for Louis B.
Vollmer, the hotelier. On the inside, there are pocket doors, a stone
fireplace and Batchelder tile.</TE>
<TE>   The original garage, now a guest house, and a fireproof storage
building, which long housed Sinclair's collection of nearly half a
million letters and manuscripts, still stand on the property, along
with a detached two-car garage. Sinclair built the garage and the
storage building. He used the original garage as a writing studio.</TE>
<TE>   The house, which has a basement, was built of concrete blocks.</TE>
<TE>   The buyers, a venture capitalist and his wife, closed escrow on
the house last week. He grew up in a Victorian in Auburn in Northern
California. She was raised in Monrovia and had long admired the
Sinclair house. Both buyers are preservationists.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Baker of Century 21 Adams &amp; Barnes, Monrovia, had the
listing.</TE>

<HD>Caught in a storm</HD>
<DH>Homeowners insurance costs are skyrocketing, and some
longtime customers are not being renewed. Insurers blame higher
losses, huge payouts in mold cases and the downturn of their equity
investments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen E. Klein</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 20 years of homeownership, Barbara Bratcher had never filed a
homeowners insurance claim. So when she returned from a two-week
vacation last spring to find that a pipe under her kitchen sink had
dripped and soaked the floor, warping her kitchen cabinets, she
reported it to her State Farm agent.</LD>
<LD>   "They came out and tore out the warped board, replaced a piece of
wall behind my sink, dried up the puddle of water and sprayed for
mold," Bratcher recalled. "I paid the $500 deductible, and the
company paid out all of $400."</LD>
<LD>   End of story?</LD>
<TE>   Hardly. Bratcher, an emergency room nurse who owns a
1,400-square-foot, three-bedroom home in Modesto, had unknowingly put
herself squarely in the center of an insurance crisis that the
industry is calling "the perfect storm."</TE>
<TE>   Unexpectedly high underwriting losses for non-catastrophic events,
increased litigation over so-called toxic mold, investment losses
tied to the stock market and more expensive construction materials
and methods have led to a near-shutdown of the homeowners insurance
market.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm, the nation's largest personal insurer, is not writing
any new homeowners policies in California or 17 other states.
Allstate, which earlier this year was refusing to sell to new
customers who had filed water damage claims, is now taking on new and
renewal customers with one claim in the last three years, but only if
they have good credit reports.</TE>
<TE>   All of the major carriers have raised premiums this year, most by
double digits and some by as much as 50% for certain customers, and
they are all using much stricter standards for policy renewals.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line for consumers: higher premiums; tougher
inspections, especially for older homes that do not have copper
wiring, retrofitted plumbing and new roofs; increased scrutiny at
renewal time, particularly for policyholders who have filed claims in
the previous year; and difficulty securing new homeowners insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The fat '90s, when overcapitalized insurance corporations were
reaping high investment returns and competition kept rates
artificially low, are long gone.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say that consumers will simply have to get used to paying
more for homeowners insurance and learn to be judicious about filing
claims, treating homeowners insurance as they do automobile policies.</TE>
<TE>   When Bratcher's homeowners policy came up for renewal in August,
she received a bill that was double what she normally paid. When she
placed a shocked call to her longtime agent, he apologetically told
her that because she had filed a claim for water damage, her premiums
would be increased from $543 to $1,000 annually for the next three
years. She approached Allstate and Farmer's for comparison quotes,
but they rejected her immediately when she told them she had filed a
water-damage claim.</TE>
<TE>   "It was outrageous. I hadn't made a claim in 20 years," Bratcher
said. "Why do I even have insurance if I can't make a claim?"</TE>
<TE>   She wound up finding a smaller insurance carrier at a more
reasonable $663 annually, with a promise of a reduction after two
years, but some Californians have not been as lucky. First-time
homeowners, particularly, are finding that the once-effortless task
of buying insurance has become a chore.</TE>
<TE>   Natasha Dierwechter, 34, purchased her first home in the Altadena
foothills in August. She called her Allstate broker, who carries her
auto insurance, to get a policy for the 1,750-square-foot,
three-bedroom house with a pool.</TE>
<TE>   "First they told me I'd have to buy renter's insurance for the
place I was living in with two housemates, cancel it and then they
could convert it to a homeowners insurance policy," Dierwechter said.</TE>
<TE>   She complied, but the nightmare was just beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "Because there's a pool in the backyard, I had to certify that I
do not have a child living in the house and will never take in a
roommate with a child," she said. "Next, the inspector came over and
saw a pit bull in my backyard. It's not my dog -- I don't even know
how it got back there -- but that raised all kinds of questions, and
they were going to suspend my policy. I had to prove that was not my
dog before they would issue the policy."</TE>
<TE>   Dierwechter began renovations recently and at one point had some
concrete piled in the frontyard. Before she knew it, she received a
warning that her policy would be canceled in 30 days if she didn't
"clear the clutter."</TE>
<TE>   "Now I have to take a photo of the house and e-mail it to them to
prove that it's cleaned up," she said. "The whole thing has been a
terrible hassle."</TE>
<TE>   Insurance insiders blame the industry's clampdown in large part on
attorneys who, they say, have taken advantage of public panic over
mold-related health problems. They point to heavily publicized
allegations that airborne illness has resulted from mold spores and
to a large increase in mold claims in Texas, which cost the State
Farm subsidiary there $625 million in capital reserves. State Farm
recently received approval to put a cap of $5,000 on mold remediation
damages nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   In California, State Farm paid $92 million for 35,000 water-damage
claims in 1997, according to company spokesman Bill Sirola. But it
cost $190 million to handle 39,000 water-damage claims in 2001
because of the intensive cleanup required to prevent mold growth.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1999, if a toilet would overflow or pipe would burst, it would
cost $3,500 to mop up, make repairs and clean out the space with some
bleach," said Dan Dunmoyer, president of the Personal Insurance
Federation of California Trade Assn., an insurance lobby group. "That
same repair in 2002 now costs $38,000 because there's such a fear of
litigation and courtroom attacks that we have to bring in
mold-remediation specialists and people to scrub the air so mold
doesn't develop."</TE>
<TE>   While the industry blames lawyers and a flighty public, insurance
critics sympathize with annoyed consumers. "The idea that mold has
caused all this crisis is ridiculous," said Robert Hunter, director
of insurance for the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America.</TE>
<TE>   "There are manic and depressive periods in the insurance cycle.
This is the depressive phase, in contrast to the mid- to late '90s,
when companies were falling all over each other to write homeowners
policies," he said. "State Farm, in particular, was writing new
business very aggressively and holding prices down ... so they could
compete."</TE>
<TE>   Because homeowners insurance traditionally has not been a
profitable line -- it's often used as a loss leader for the far more
lucrative auto insurance business -- the industry has tended to make
up the gap between premiums and payouts by investing in equity
markets. That strategy worked well during the '90s, when investments
paid off handsomely and the large corporations were heavily
capitalized, but it came to a crashing halt when the stock market
turned sour, said Charlie Titterton, a personal insurance lines
analyst and director at Standard &amp; Poor's corporate and debt ratings
agency.</TE>
<TE>   State Farm, which had enjoyed triple-A Standard &amp; Poor's ratings
for years, suffered the largest underwriting loss of any insurance
company in a single year -- $9 billion total, with a net loss to the
firm of $5.3 billion -- in 2001. As a result, Standard &amp; Poor's
lowered its rating one notch. State Farm's reaction -- the moratorium
on new homeowners policies and the closing of many claims centers in
California -- caused a shudder throughout the industry, one that the
public is now starting to feel.</TE>
<TE>   Although homeowners insurance remains available, the lid on prices
is coming off, Titterton said. "For the three years from 2001 to
2003, I'd say homeowners pricing may go up 40% on average," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What can consumers do? Shop around, do some research and don't
wait until the last minute before escrow closes to arrange for
insurance. Repair or replace older pipes and washing machine hoses
regularly, before they leak or burst. And if you have a relatively
small loss, consider fixing it out of pocket rather than filing a
claim and risking a huge increase or non-renewal.</TE>
<TE>   Don Griffin, assistant vice president for business and personal
lines for the National Assn. of Independent Insurers, recommends that
policyholders check with their agents before their renewals come up
to help avoid the kind of surprise that hit Bratcher.</TE>
<TE>   "They should talk about what they can do to make sure they get
renewed and consider taking a higher deductible that will keep their
payments down despite the increases," Griffin said. If a claim has
been made and the premium is scheduled to go up substantially, the
consumer can ask an agent to shop around for a better deal.</TE>
<TE>   One thing is certain, Griffin said: "Getting homeowners insurance
will be more time-consuming and more expensive than it has been in
the past."</TE>

<HD>Renter's insurance protects tenants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Svensson</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I've heard of renter's insurance, but do I really need it?
Doesn't the landlord's policy cover most misfortunes?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: No, the landlord's insurance doesn't the cover the
contents of your apartment. Yours is a common misconception, and it's
probably part of the reason why only about a quarter of renters have
insurance.</LD>
<LD>   According to Jeanne Salvatore of the Insurance Information
Institute in New York, some other common misconceptions about
renter's insurance are that it's expensive and that the contents of a
modest apartment aren't worth insuring. Also, because renter's
insurance, unlike homeowner and car insurance, isn't required by law
or by lenders, many tenants don't bother.</LD>
<TE>   "In particular, younger renters assume that because their
apartment is fairly bare-bones, they don't need insurance," Salvatore
said.</TE>
<TE>   Renter's insurance costs about $150 a year on average nationwide
(more in states prone to violent weather) for about $30,000 worth of
property coverage. Apart from fire, renter's insurance typically
covers theft, vandalism, water damage and weather damage.Policies
usually have liability coverage, which insures against medical claims
by guests and visitors injured in the apartment.</TE>
<TE>   There are two main types of renter's insurance.</TE>
<TE>   One is the actual cash value policy, which replaces the value of
the item at the time it was lost. In other words, a television bought
for $300 and destroyed five years later by a burst pipe would be
valued at much less, maybe $100.</TE>
<TE>   The other kind of policy, replacement cost, would give the
policyholder the $300 it would take to replace the TV with a new one.
It costs perhaps 10% more than an actual cash value plan and
represents a much better value, according to Salvatore.</TE>

<LD>The number of low- to moderate-income working families spending more
than half their earnings on housing climbed more than 67% from 1997
to 2001, the result of stagnant wages and rising housing costs, a new
study shows.</LD>
<LD>   The report, released last week by the Center for Housing Policy,
revealed that those with "critical housing needs" reside not only in
urban areas but also in the suburbs and outside major metropolitan
areas. And those affected are not only the poor; many middle-income
Americans also are unable to afford decent housing.</LD>
<LD>   In 1997, about 3 million low- to moderate-income working families
had "critical housing needs," meaning they used more than half their
incomes on housing. By 2001, that number rose to 4.8 million
households, according to the study.</LD>
<TE>   While some of these households were in the nation's most expensive
housing markets, such as San Francisco, others had stagnant salaries
that could not keep up with the cost of owning or renting a home,
said Ann Schnare, president of the Center for Housing Policy.</TE>

<LD>U.S. home remodeling activity dropped in the third quarter to the
lowest level since the months following the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, as Americans put off spending money on their homes in a slow
economy, according to the National Assn. of Home Builders.</LD>

<LD>   The decline was the biggest monthly drop since January 1994, and

<LD>   Groundbreaking for new homes slid to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.603 million units last month, down from a revised 1.810

<LD>Here come the holidays, and with them the season's usual bounty from
the publishing industry: coffee-table books. Here are four new
travel-related volumes that might make worthy gifts.</LD>
<LD>   "Planet Earth" is a book that strikes you between the eyes. Its
lures are many, from the richness of the colors in these pictures
taken from space to the thrill of spotting a familiar continental
profile. Then there's the overarching idea that all these
half-abstractions are really the skin of the planet, seen from near
and far.</LD>
<LD>   One series of images shows the cities of Mecca, Jerusalem and Rome
from the sky, with the pyramids of Giza thrown in as a bonus.
Elsewhere, a lone cloud hangs over the coffee-colored Sahara, and the
"Marree Man," a 2.4-mile-long drawing, is gouged in the soil of
Australia's Simpson Desert by artists whose identities are unknown.
(Computer enhancements account for the supernatural sharpness and
dramatic colors of many of the images.)</LD>
<TE>   Those entranced by abstraction will enjoy the format, which opens
with 199 unnumbered pages (including several that fold out) crowded
with blazing, not-quite-comprehensible shots. Many of them, in fact,
might pass for canvases by German painter Gerhard Richter, whose
color-drunk abstract works are part of a retrospective at the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art this winter.</TE>
<TE>   More literal-minded readers will prefer pages 200-231, where the
editors show thumbnail renditions of previous images, this time with
often-staggering caption information. The book's 150 color images,
most shot from satellites and all gorgeously printed in Italy, were
gathered by the German Aerospace Center, with help from NASA and
other national agencies that pay attention to satellites.</TE>
<TE>   Also just out from the same publisher: a book titled "Full Moon,"
which collects 128 NASA photos (72 in color, 56 in black and white),
mostly from Apollo missions. Images were selected by Michael Light
from a trove of about 32,000 shot by U.S. astronauts. This hardback
edition is priced at $24.95, about half the cost of the first release
of "Full Moon" in larger format in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Before the sun set on the empire</TE>
<TE>   From the considerable Royal Geographic Society archives in Britain
come these images and brief chapters: a Tibetan musician, mouth agape
in song, from the 1860s; a four-car caravan across the Gobi Desert in
the 1920s; elephants rinsing off in India's Gandak River in 1996; and
about 295 more. Caption information is generous -- and enough to make
you wistful for those days when truly undiscovered wonders were still
within reach. Images are sepia-toned and color, mostly depending on
when they were taken. The cover is paperback. Together, these
elements serve as a grand reminder of the days when the
empire-building British were venturing into every earthly extremity
they could find, and then emerging to write dryly about their
adventures.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, much of the text is in the voice of the heroic deadpan
British explorer. For instance:</TE>
<TE>   "I myself am fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to
organize one or two minor expeditions to remote spots in Africa where
there were no roads or airfields and marching with porters and/or
camels was the best option at the time," writes Richard Leakey.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico as seen by home decorators</TE>
<TE>   More interior designers than travelers have heard of Witynski and
Carr, but for anyone contemplating a trip to Mexico's eastern end,
there's ample reason for paying attention to this coffee-table book.
These two know the territory, and the illustrations they choose,
though mostly intended to inspire civilian and professional
decorators at home, throw a welcome light on historically rich
corners of Mexico that lose out to beach resorts (especially the
nearby Cancun) in many travel texts.</TE>
<TE>   This volume is Witynski and Carr's fifth Mexico-inspired design
book since 1997. Along with information on materials and architects,
its back pages include hotels and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   This book alone isn't enough to get a visitor through the Yucatan,
but it will certainly fuel daydreams with its images of restored
courtyards, stenciled walls, tiled floors, carved wooden shutters and
shaded hammocks.</TE>
<TE>   An artist's eye on England's capital</TE>
<TE>   Here is a pleasant look at London. The design is inviting,
Byfield's watercolors are exacting and evocative(and printed on
luxuriously thick paper stock), and Binney's text on London's
workings and notes on architectural history are authoritative. It's
entertaining to consider that No. 10 Downing St., with its 1766
facade, is "possibly the most famous front door in the world" and
satisfying to learn that while SW1 and SW3 (which include Harrods,
the trendy shops of Sloane Square, parts of Knightsbridge,
Westminster, Pimlico, Belgravia and Chelsea) are among the most
fashionable postal codes in the country, SW2 and SW4 (Brixton and
Clapham, basically) are "rather less so."</TE>
<TE>   The scores of illustrations range from such aged wonders as
Westminster Abbey to the London Eye Ferris wheel, opened in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Asia packages offer deals aplenty</HD>
<DH>Tour operators have negotiated some unusually low prices
for trips to the South Pacific and the Far East.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent terrorist bombing of a nightclub in Bali, a beautiful
destination, has removed that island -- temporarily, let's hope --
from the world of international tourism.</LD>
<LD>   Elsewhere in the South Pacific and along the Asian rim, tourism
continues at a decent pace. It's been aided by the growth of
appealing air-and-land packages created by tour operators that
negotiate with airlines and hotels for radically reduced rates and
then offer overall prices that are irresistible. Among the leading
opportunities for the coming months:</LD>
<LD>   Tahiti for $699 per person: Locked in a price war with its
competitors, Discover Wholesale Travel, (866) 215-4625,
www.discoverwholesaletravel.com, has lowered the price of its classic
package to otherworldly Moorea. It flies you from Los Angeles on
French-owned Corsair to Tahiti's capital of Papeete, then ferries you
to neighboring Moorea for seven nights at the beachfront Hotel Kaveka
on Cook's Bay. The $699 price is through Dec. 9; it then jumps to
$728 from Jan. 7 to March 31 -- $70 or so less than what has been
charged for many years.</LD>
<TE>   Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, for $880, comes next: The
bargain package from Pacific Delight tours, (800) 221-7179,
www.pacificdelighttours.com, will fly you from Los Angeles on Thai
Airways and then puts you up for six nights with daily breakfast in
the first-class, high-rise Century Park Hotel. You also receive
transfers and two escorted city tours: one to the Grand Palace and
Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the other to the floating market.
Departures are approximately every week and are available at the $880
price from Jan. 12 though Feb. 27.</TE>
<TE>   New Zealand for $1,064: The Middle-Earth in the "Lord of the
Rings" films is more than just a fairy-tale setting: It's New
Zealand's landscapes. The best way to explore this dramatic land is
in your own RV. Several companies offer this arrangement, but no one
beats the prices from Sunspots International, (800) 334-5623,
www.sunspotsintl.com, which flies you midweek from L.A. on Air Tahiti
Nui to Auckland, where you settle into your Spirit 2 motor home for
seven nights with unlimited mileage. The $1,064 price is good through
Dec. 15; the rate is available again January through February.</TE>
<TE>   Six Chinese cities, 10 nights, $1,079: Tour operator China Focus,
(800) 868-7244, www.chinafocustravel.com, keeps surprising the world
of travel with its low-priced China itineraries. On the one called
Historical China, you sample six locations on an escorted,
all-inclusive (that's three meals a day) trip that hits Beijing,
Shanghai, Suzhou, Jinan, Taian and Qufu for $1,079 per person, plus
taxes. That's out of San Francisco on Air China in December, January
and February, but not during the Christmas period.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Vietnam for $899: From Jan. 7 until March 31, Escapes
Unlimited, (800) 243-7227, www.escapesltd.com, has this price to
Vietnam from L.A. or San Francisco on Air China. You fly to Ho Chi
Minh City (formerly Saigon), receive all transfers, five nights in
the modern Huong Sen hotel in the heart of downtown, breakfast daily
and a half-day sightseeing tour.</TE>

<HD>Carmel Valley, a hideaway east of Eden</HD>
<DH>While crowds adulate the coast, visitors venturing inland
revel in the country charms of a luxury lodge, an organic farm and an
elite music institute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Marlowe</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Carmel Valley, Calif.</DL>
<LD>I saw it in his eyes. He caught it in mine. It strikes every few
months. That desire to go, go now, before we change our minds.</LD>
<LD>   Our usual remedy: to hit Highway 1 heading north, engine full
throttle, for 325 miles. Our usual destination: a region John
Steinbeck chronicled as "The Pastures of Heaven."</LD>
<LD>   Carmel Valley is our beloved hideout. My husband, Brian, and I
have vanished into these hills at least twice a year for the last
decade and been lucky enough to stay at many of the area's top
hotels, including stately Stonepine and laid-back Los Laureles.</LD>
<TE>   But Carmel Valley Ranch suits us best. Every guest room is a suite
that feels more like a countryside condo than a hotel: 650 to 1,200
square feet, with two wood-burning fireplaces, fresh flowers, a
Jacuzzi tub and warm cookies at bedtime. Craving this kind of gentle,
genteel warmth, we departed for the resort again one Friday morning
in May.</TE>
<TE>   Like clockwork, just past San Simeon, Brian started imagining the
triple-berry pie at Nepenthe, the landmark Big Sur bar, cafe and gift
shop on property once owned by Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth. After
a brief stop for pie and tea, we continued north on Highway 1 to
Carmel Valley Road.</TE>
<TE>   Seven miles inland from the hordes of Carmel's touristy village,
Carmel Valley is a place apart: bucolic, still surprisingly rural,
lovely in any season. Ranches, vineyards and nurseries outnumber golf
courses. Try as it might, the fog rarely creeps into this pass,
leaving unobscured the Santa Lucia Mountains and oaks draped with
Spanish moss. Here, where designer dairies churn chevre and ersatz
French chateaux produce Cabernet, flocks of wild turkeys still
saunter the paths of luxury lodges. I once spied a wildcat by a barn
in broad daylight.</TE>
<TE>   An organic experience</TE>
<TE>   We entered Carmel Valley Ranch's gated private road as the
retreating sun left a hint of red on the hills. The 144-unit resort
was built in 1987 across 1,700 acres that include three restaurants,
a Pete Dye golf course, tennis courts (hard, grass and clay), two
pools and a scattering of outdoor hot tubs.</TE>
<TE>   We were granted (as requested) a corner unit, which had a big
wraparound deck and views of the valley and fairways. The presence of
deer under our deck at dawn and dusk was a highlight; the animals are
unofficial resort mascots present in daylight too, seen contentedly
grazing along the golf course.</TE>
<TE>   Room rates vary weekend to weekend, depending on season and
availability. Packages that include spa treatments or golf often are
the best deals. We paid $195 plus tax nightly for a golf package, but
prices for rooms alone can rise to $400.</TE>
<TE>   A daily $20 resort fee is automatically added to the bill to cover
gratuities for bellmen, housekeepers, the concierge and tennis and
golf staff -- everyone except the kitchen servers. Some people object
to such fees, which are increasingly common at high-end resorts. But
here, the fee is truly earned by -- and passed along to -- a young,
on-their-toes staff.</TE>
<TE>   After our long drive, we looked forward to dinner at the casual
Corkscrew Cafe, about five miles east of the resort on Carmel Valley
Road. Locals treasure this rustic, bloom-shrouded outpost, with its
quirky Corkscrew Museum collection displayed in the restaurant and
adjoining wine-tasting room.</TE>
<TE>   As we sat down to candlelight, a petite plate of hummus, diced
cucumber, red pepper, Spanish onion and crostini appeared. We shared
a romaine-and-shaved Parmesan salad and then chose from an urbane
daily menu of 10 main courses. We skipped the chef's signature dish,
tequila- and lime-cured salmon, in favor of a tender cowboy steak
with crispy red potatoes, balsamic red onions and roasted mushrooms
for Brian, and pan-seared halibut in a fresh leek broth, served with
baby artichoke, asparagus and tomatoes, for me. Strawberry-rhubarb
pie had a leaden crust but was redeemed by fragrant, homemade
vanilla-bean ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   Though Brian had skipped the 5-pound wine list, which included
local Bernardus Merlot, Jouillian Cabernet and Talbott Chardonnay (he
chose beer from the Czech Republic instead), he is a bit of a wine
snob. Mercifully for me, he's no fan of winery tours. Tomato tasting
is more his style.</TE>
<TE>   So Saturday morning we headed for Earthbound Farm, open to the
public for nature walks, cooking demonstrations and seasonal
festivals. At the time of our visit, the Farm Stand shop -- closed
for the season now but reopening April 22, Earth Day -- was stocked
with just-plucked organic produce, juices and baked treats. It's a
favorite source of baby vegetables among Northern California chefs
and a prime introduction to Carmel Valley's countrified realm.</TE>
<TE>   A pair of fresh-from-college New Yorkers began Earthbound Farm in
1984 with 2 1/2 acres and a roadside raspberry stand. Today the farm
produces more than 100 kinds of certified organic salads, fruits and
vegetables for sale across the country.</TE>
<TE>   Ever hear of a tangerine tomato? Me neither. With bales of hay for
benches, we sat down to sample it and other heirloom varieties.
Nearby, a gaggle of girls got messy making cornhusk dolls, part of
the farm's children's workshops, while their parents consulted
shopping lists and loaded up baskets.</TE>
<TE>   I wanted to explore nearby Garland Ranch Regional Park, and Brian
wanted lunch. So we bagged some Greek salad and herb focaccia at the
stand and drove five miles to the 4,500-acre park.</TE>
<TE>   Set in a sweeping meadow along the willow-lined banks of the
Carmel River, trails for walkers and equestrians weave high into the
Santa Lucias. Red-tailed hawks spiraled above fields of blue lupine
and groves of sycamore and sage. Where a rusting 1940s tractor rested
behind a ghostly barn -- relics from when Garland was a lively
working ranch -- I got a sense of what this land had been like.
Pastures of heaven, indeed. Even after a brisk two-hour walk, we were
reluctant to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Kicking back by the fire</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night found us at Hidden Valley, a music institute a few
miles east of our resort in Carmel Valley. The elite 40-year-old
organization is devoted to developing young musicians, actors and
dancers. The school offers chamber music, jazz and dance performances
throughout the year.</TE>
<TE>   I had reserved tickets for one of its rare full-scale productions,
a version of "La Boheme" in English. Staged with the help of San
Francisco Opera wizards, conductor Randall Behr led a rousing
performance with full orchestra and chorus in the 300-seat theater in
the round.</TE>
<TE>   Though one would think an evening at the opera might inspire
elegant dining, nothing sounded better to us than room service by the
fire. We kicked off our shoes, donned cushy hotel robes, ordered goat
cheese-and-basil pizza and popped the tops on bottles of Perrier.
(Every suite is equipped with a coffee and tea maker, mini bar and
toaster. For $3, the hotel also will provide a microwave, dishes and
cutlery for light in-room cooking, though I doubt many guests
partake.) Our dinner arrived crisp and hot, my husband lighted the
bedroom hearth, and I hid the remote.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning, Brian had an early tee time, but I slumbered on.
We eventually met at the resort's Club Grille. Over fresh-squeezed
orange juice, he regaled me with the golf course's finer points: "A
relatively flat front nine along the riverbank, then there's a
dramatic fairway elevation...." When he finished, I paused politely,
then suggested, "Let's go shopping."</TE>
<TE>   Checkout was smooth, and though I hated to go, we had a little
time to investigate the wares at artist Jan de Luz's eponymous Carmel
Valley emporium.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, after buying an antique weaving machine and loads of
vintage fabric, De Luz researched the material and discovered its
origin: cattle blankets used by French ranchers since the 18th
century. Woven from soft linen, the cattle "coats" held greater
symbolism: The larger the stripes, the richer the cattleman. When
those original fabrics had disappeared, De Luz re-created them by the
traditional methods. He also continued designing housewares and
collecting antiques. The store brims with old ornate furniture,
fireplaces, fountains, doors and gates culled from Europe.</TE>
<TE>   I could have wasted hours, but time ran short. After one last stop
at Earthbound Farm for fresh ginger cookies -- fuel for the long ride
home -- we said farewell to our hideout until the fever strikes
again.</TE>

<LD>Nearly 36 million Americans are expected to travel 50 miles or more
from home during the Thanksgiving holiday this year, according to the
latest projections from the American Automobile Assn. That's an
increase of 2% from last year. Air travel alone will climb 6%, the
AAA estimates.</LD>
<LD>   If history repeats, you can figure you'll encounter more than a
few crabby seatmates, enraged motorists and maybe even a curt ticket
agent or two as you try to get from here to there.</LD>
<LD>   Maintaining a healthy holiday travel mind-set isn't impossible,
experts say, even in the face of post-Sept. 11 security increases,
SigAlerts and long lines. Here are their best tips for staying
mentally balanced along the way:</LD>
<TE>   "Focus on the breath," says Shosha Marie Bottoms, a yoga therapist
at Angel City Yoga in Studio City. She's talking not just about
taking deep breaths when you find out your flight has been delayed
yet again, but about consciously using your breath to practice what
she calls "walking meditation," something you can do at the airport:
"Walk, and watch your breath as you walk," she says. "Focus on the
inhalation and exhalation. Concentrate on taking slow, deep breaths."</TE>
<TE>   Then focus on how you feel when you breathe this way; are you more
relaxed?</TE>
<TE>   Rather than turning inward, as in traditional meditation, she
suggests observing those around you. As you walk your way through the
masses, it helps to repeat something comforting. "At this time of
year," she says, "I choose 'Peace on Earth and peace in my heart.' "</TE>
<TE>   Change your attitude about being on a plane and you'll
automatically change your state of mind, says Dr. Deepak Chopra, the
mind-body medicine pioneer and bestselling author. "For me, being on
a plane is an opportunity to get away from stress," says Chopra, who
logs several million air miles annually. "My mind-set is, 'I'm
traveling. I can be disengaged from what I do all the time.' "</TE>
<TE>   Look on a long flight as an opportunity "to maintain some silence
in your mind, to solve a problem that's been bugging you, to read a
really good book or do some journaling," he suggests. At this time of
year you might make a list of what your priorities will be for the
new year, he adds.</TE>
<TE>   For a crash course on meditation, see "The Relaxation Response"
(Quill, 2000) by Herbert Benson, M.D., a revised paperback edition of
the original, published in 1975. Journaling how-to books are
plentiful, including "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Journaling"
(Alpha Books, 2000) by Joan R. Neubauer and Kathleen Adams, and
"Journaling From the Heart" (Whole Heart Publications, 2000) by
Eldonna Bouton.</TE>
<TE>   Chopra takes his own advice about turning a long flight into an
opportunity. During a 36-hour trip from Southern California to
Australia and then Singapore that was plagued by delays, he decided
to make good use of the time. He handwrote the manuscript for "The
Seven Spiritual Laws of Success: A Practical Guide to the Fulfillment
of Your Dreams," his 1995 bestselling book.</TE>
<TE>   Before the trip he had given a lecture on the topic, and an
audience member had approached him afterward to ask him to turn the
information into a book. So he wrote the entire manuscript, which
would become a 111-page volume, on the plane. "In Singapore I locked
myself in a phone booth and dictated it to my voicemail," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Being realistic about travel, as simplistic as that might sound,
can improve your mental state, says Robert Maurer, a psychologist on
staff at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center. He notes that the words
"travel" and "travail" share some common origins.</TE>
<TE>   "Lower your expectations," he tells holiday travelers. The notions
that travel should be easy, that planes should be on time and that
traffic should flow should all go out the door, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "People who do best in holiday situations [with crowds and delays]
are the ones who say, 'We knew it would be like this. It's just part
of the trip,' " agrees Harriet Braiker, a psychologist in Los Angeles
and Pasadena. The problems occur, she says, when you don't prepare
for the reality of holiday travel. "That's what tends to flip you
out."</TE>
<TE>   What can keep you patient? "Try to remind yourself of when you did
lose it in the past ... and how much better you are doing this time,"
she suggests.</TE>
<TE>   You can also shift your attitude about what constitutes the
vacation or pleasure part of the trip, Maurer contends. Rather than
thinking that getting there is the awful part, "decide that the trip
portion is the beginning of your journey, and make it a point to make
it fun. Decide that the vacation starts the minute you leave home,
whether you are stuck in line or on a plane going nowhere." If you
are going with a loved one, this becomes easier. "The very reason for
the travel is not the destination but [being with] the travel
companion," Maurer says.</TE>
<TE>   That advice could apply just as well to motorists as to airline
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Ellison, a public affairs spokesman for the California
Highway Patrol who is also a traffic officer, thinks drivers' mental
state would be healthier if they went with the flow and focused not
only on road conditions but also on the comfort of their fellow
passengers. "If there's heavy traffic, take a two-hour dinner," he
suggests. Take more breaks, plan your route carefully and "try to
leave when the traffic is not heavy." If you do all that, you're
bound to be less aggravated, he says, and a safer, saner traveler.</TE>
<TE>   Adopting the attitude of Robert Louis Stevenson couldn't hurt,
either. "For my part," he said, "I travel not to go anywhere, but to
go. I travel for travel's sake. The great affair is to move."</TE>

<LD>"See where those garbage trucks are parked?" asked Russ Guiney,
superintendent for the state parks' Angeles District and my hiking
companion in the Baldwin Hills. "Imagine a lovely park entrance,
where visitors board a tram for a lift up slopes carpeted with native
grasses and wildflowers to a nature center, where they join a
ranger-led hike up to this magnificent viewpoint."</LD>
<LD>   Guiney was talking about Vista Pacifica, where the landscape of
the imagination may be the most important landscape of all. Right now
much of the Baldwin Hills resembles a conservationist's nightmare,
not a dream. But parks officials are imagining -- and planning for --
something different.</LD>
<LD>   Vista Pacifica is part of a planned expansion of Kenneth Hahn
State Recreation Area. Surrounding the tidy lawns of the existing
park are bulldozer-battered slopes smothered in sagebrush and weeds.
Adjacent ridges and canyons are dominated by oil fields, ugly as can
be.</LD>
<TE>   But even in their degraded state, the Baldwin Hills are habitat
for animals, including the gray fox, black-tailed rabbit,
black-bellied salamander and side-blotched lizard. Scientists from
the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles have identified more than
160 species of birds here. All are residents of what Guiney and other
conservationists say is the last large, undeveloped space in urban
Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   To check out Vista Pacifica, exit Interstate 10 at La Cienega
Boulevard, drive south to Rodeo Road and turn right. At Jefferson
Boulevard, turn left and drive about one-third mile to Hetzler Road
on your left. I suggest you begin your Baldwin Hills walk from here.</TE>
<TE>   A half-mile ascent brings you to Vista Pacifica, where the
stunning 360-degree view encompasses the city, the mountains and
Santa Monica Bay. You will have an air-traffic controller's view of
planes approaching LAX and a great introduction to the Baldwin Hills.
Bring a picnic -- and your imagination.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to volunteer trail builders, the park has more than seven
miles of trail. The 2.6-mile Ridge Trail and 2.2-mile Burke Roche
Trail are the newest. Other popular walks include the mile-long
Waterfall Trail and the 0.8-mile Bowl Loop.</TE>

<HD>If your airline goes belly up, must trip plans also
succumb?</HD>
<DH>This year's bankruptcies have focused attention on steps to
take if you're holding a losing ticket.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Engle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The airline you're booked on just went out of business. Now what?</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of National Airlines passengers faced that dilemma this
month when the Las Vegas-based discounter ceased operations. It
joined two other U.S. airlines that quit flying this year, Vanguard
and Midway, both in July.</LD>
<LD>   Here are two tales from the chaos that ensued:</LD>
<TE>   The night of Nov. 6, Mariko Gallaga of Chicago called her
sister-in-law in Las Vegas to ask what to pack for a family reunion
there. Gallaga was flying to Vegas the next morning on National, as
were her husband, son and brother. As the two women talked, the news
broke on TV: National had stopped flying.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a shock," Gallaga says.</TE>
<TE>   Her son called Southwest Airlines and was told he could use his
National ticket to fly standby free or get a confirmed seat on a
special low fare; he booked a $308 round trip. She tried the same and
got a different Southwest agent, who, she said, told her she couldn't
fly standby and would have to pay full fare. Gallaga finally got a
$615 fare on American Trans Air -- more than her $250 National ticket
but less than the $1,000-plus other carriers wanted.</TE>
<TE>   While Gallaga scrambled, Steve and Germaine Devery of Bremerton,
Wash., were sitting in the Las Vegas airport, wondering what had
happened to their 4:15 p.m. National flight to Seattle. It was about
6:30 p.m., and National had announced only that the flight was
delayed. They learned the truth from a fellow passenger, who told
them Alaska Airlines would honor their tickets on standby. The
Deverys got out on a 9 p.m. flight. It was a memorable end to their
57th anniversary jaunt to Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some options for stranded travelers:</TE>
<TE>   Immediately get on another airline: Passengers whose airline has
stopped operating are entitled to fly standby on another carrier if
it has space available. They must travel on the same date and to the
same place as originally ticketed.</TE>
<TE>   These rights are in a ruling that the U.S. Department of
Transportation issued in August to clarify a law passed after the
travel disruptions of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Details are open to interpretation. The ruling appears to allow
airlines to charge processing fees up to $25 each way to carry
standbys from defunct airlines. Some airlines say they won't have to
honor such standbys after May 19, when the law on which the ruling is
based will expire; others put the cutoff in early January. (To see
the full text, visit dms.dot.gov/general/orders/aug02/183624web.pdf.)</TE>
<TE>   The DOT ruling does not require airlines to provide confirmed
seats in this situation, so you'll probably have to buy a new ticket
if, like Gallaga, you want a guaranteed seat. Some examples of
policies, according to airline spokesmen:</TE>
<TE>   Southwest will honor National tickets on a standby basis, without
a fee, until early January. For confirmed seats, it waived
advance-purchase rules, allowing National customers to get the lowest
available fare, through Nov. 13. Now they'll have to buy a new ticket
at the market price. (Southwest says the advice given to Mariko
Gallaga was wrong.)</TE>
<TE>   America West is honoring National tickets by offering only
standbys, with a $25 fee per flight segment (leg), until Jan. 6.
American will honor standbys only for travel through May 19, with a
$25 fee, but you must notify the airline by Jan. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Ask for a credit-card refund: If you fly standby on another
carrier, you can't get a refund on your National fare, say Visa,
MasterCard and American Express. In their view, you got the service
you paid for.</TE>
<TE>   If you buy a new ticket on another carrier, policies vary. Here's
what company representatives told me:</TE>
<TE>   MasterCard will generally refund your National ticket. At Visa,
the policy varies by the issuing bank. At American Express, if you
can't be accommodated on another airline, "we will give credits ...
consistent with our legal obligations and with our commitment to
providing the high level of customer service that is associated with
the American Express brand," a spokeswoman said. She declined to be
more specific.</TE>
<TE>   Collect on your travel insurance: If you were booked on National,
this is probably not an option. None of several big travel insurers I
spoke with covered National because it had been in Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection for two years. Ditto for US Airways, also in
Chapter 11.</TE>
<TE>   If your airline is covered and your policy includes "financial
default" or similar wording, you generally would be compensated for
the cost of your ticket if the carrier goes out of business. Most
insurers require you to try to deal with your credit card company
first.</TE>
<TE>   Better luck next time: Steve Devery liked the National fare, $144
round trip between Seattle and Las Vegas, that his daughter found on
the Web. So he booked it, even though he'd never heard of National.
Had he done his research, he would have known of the airline's
troubled financial history.</TE>
<TE>   But companies may go broke without warning, and some, like
National, defy the odds for years by continuing to operate under
bankruptcy protection. So experts offer these tips:</TE>
<TE>   Always pay for plane tickets by credit card. Be sure it's a
credit, not a debit or ATM card. Those don't offer
consumer-protection policies.</TE>
<TE>   Consider buying travel insurance. This typically costs 4% to 8% of
the trip price, depending on the type of coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Save all receipts to document your claim.</TE>
<TE>   As for bankruptcy court, don't get your hopes up. Resolving a
claim can take months or years. Even then, "it's 5 cents on the
dollar, if you're lucky and the company has assets," says Patricia
Campbell, formerly president of the California Travel Consumer
Restitution Corp., which administers a state fund for consumer
claims.</TE>

<LD>Writer Rosemary McClure ("Bumpy Road of a Novice RVer," Nov. 10)
should be commended for having the spirit to try RVing for the first
time -- with so little preparation by the rental agency.</LD>
<LD>   An excellent way for novices to try a motor home is to go in the
company of experienced RVers. Many groups, among them the Good Sam
Club ([800] 234-3450), can put a novice in touch with clubs.</LD>
<LD>   Also, the cost of an RV may be reduced by buying a used one. Many
with more money than determination have purchased an RV, used it a
couple of times, then lost interest. Often these rigs may be
purchased at a fraction of the original cost.</LD>
<TE>   With hotel rooms commonly costing more than $100 a night, it is no
accident that families are turning to RVing.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Haage</TE>
<TE>   Montclair</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A functional RV can be had for less than $10,000. Someone who has
camped in tents will find any RV almost ridiculously luxurious. Warm
and dry accommodations, a flush toilet, a hot shower and
refrigeration are part of any RV; those who require marble
countertops are merely looking for creative ways to dispose of
income.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Copper Canyon Thrill Ride" (Oct. 27), writer Susan Spano tells of
an encounter with a young thief with a knife.</LD>
<LD>   I have just reread Spano's laudatory article on Naples ("Loving
Naples, Flaws and All," March 4, 2001) and found no reference to
threats of violence. I have visited Naples and the rural areas of
Copper Canyon and felt safer in Copper Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   Whether these incidents occur is a matter of chance and not
necessarily locality. If journalists demean a region they should use
statistics, not an isolated personal incident, to back their
experience.</LD>

<LD>On a September visit to San Francisco I got a deal at one of the
hotels mentioned in "Time for a Splurge in S.F." (Nov. 17). The
"spiffed-up" Union Square is nothing more than concrete and metal.
They got rid of the grass, trees and flowers to keep the homeless at
bay.</LD>

<HD>California sparkles in AAA ratings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's luxury lodgings were big winners in the 2003 AAA
five-diamond listings released this month. AAA's highest rating was
awarded to 130 North American hotels and restaurants, a record
number.</LD>
<LD>   The St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort &amp; Spa in Dana Point; the
Ritz-Carlton, Half Moon Bay; and the Lodge at Torrey Pines in La
Jolla were added, giving California 14 five-diamond lodgings, the
most of any state. (Florida was second, with seven.)</LD>
<LD>   California has four five-diamond restaurants in 2003 after San
Francisco's Charles Nob Hill, listed for 2002, lost a diamond. In
Hawaii, the Kahala Mandarin Oriental Hawaii returned to the list
after being dropped in 2002.</LD>
<TE>   Mobil, which also issues ratings, awarded its highest, five stars,
to 44 lodgings and restaurants in North America for 2003. Notable
additions include the Four Seasons Hotel San Francisco and
Ritz-Carltons in Chicago and San Francisco. Notable demotions to four
stars include the Phoenician in Scottsdale, Ariz., and two Las Vegas
restaurants: Picasso at the Bellagio and Renoir at the Mirage, which
AAA continues to list as five diamonds.</TE>
<TE>   Boarding pass rules tightened at some airports</TE>
<TE>   You'll need to get a boarding pass before you go through security
under a pilot program at Los Angeles International and airports in
Long Beach, Detroit and Newark, N.J., and New York's John F. Kennedy
and La Guardia.</TE>
<TE>   Only certain airlines and terminals are affected. At LAX, it's
American Airlines at Terminal 4, and in Long Beach, it's JetBlue.
Fliers must get a boarding pass from an e-ticket kiosk, ticket
counter or skycap before going to security checkpoints. An itinerary
with a seat assignment is not sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   The Transportation Security Administration is trying to "reduce
the hassle factor for travelers" by testing whether initial security
checks can eliminate random checks at the gates, TSA spokesman Nico
Melendez said. "We will continue to test it through the holidays, and
that will determine whether or not the pilot program becomes
permanent."</TE>
<TE>   Picture this: A museum of book art</TE>
<TE>   A $15-million museum of picture books opened this weekend in
Amherst, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art features works of its
namesake author-illustrator, known for his 1969 "The Very Hungry
Caterpillar." Carle's publishers and a foundation formed by Carle and
his wife, Barbara, helped build the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Other artists' works are also displayed. Opening exhibits focus on
Maurice Sendak (to Jan. 12) and Robert Ingpen (to Feb. 23).</TE>
<TE>   Admission is $4 for adults, $2 for ages 1 to 18, $10 for a family
up to six. Open daily except Mondays and holidays; hours vary. (413)

<TE>   Aloha, Hawaiian airlines shuffle island flights</TE>
<TE>   If your trip to Hawaii in the next few months includes
inter-island flights on Aloha or Hawaiian airlines, it's a good idea
to check schedules for changes.</TE>
<TE>   The two carriers are adjusting schedules month by month under an
unusual program approved this fall by the U.S. Department of
Transportation. In some cases they are adding flights, in other cases
subtracting. The program lets the two airlines coordinate capacity on
inter-island flights to avoid duplicating service; transpacific
routes are not affected.</TE>
<TE>   Aloha will reduce its inter-island flights "a bit" Dec. 2 to Dec.
19, then restore some for the holidays, a spokesman said. Hawaiian
has similar plans. Expect more significant changes on both airlines
to kick in after the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   A burning question: Where can you smoke?</TE>
<TE>   More tourist spots are looking to limit where you light up.</TE>
<TE>   In actions this month, Florida voters approved a ban on smoking in
workplaces, including restaurants. In Hawaii, Kauai's mayor said she
would sign a bill to prohibit smoking in restaurants but not in bars,
starting Jan. 1. Oahu already restricts smoking in restaurants. Maui,
Lanai and Molokai will begin restrictions Jan. 1. In New York, the
City Council held a hearing on a proposal to ban smoking in most
workplaces.</TE>
<TE>   Traveler's Notes</TE>
<TE>   The second annual "Dine-About-Town San Francisco" will be Jan. 11
to 31. About 150 restaurants will offer three-course, fixed-price
menus for $19.95 at lunch and $29.95 at dinner; days and meals vary.
You must pay with a Visa card. Reservations are recommended. (415)

<HD>Chicago's mighty new mini train</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Engle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What has 34 model trains, more than 1,000 miniature automobiles and
1,485 mini-people going about their daily business?</LD>
<LD>   It's "The Great Train Story," a $3-million model railroad display
at Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry. Opened this weekend, in
time for the holidays, it replaces a more modest exhibit that
choo-chooed through six decades.</LD>
<LD>   The new display sprawls over 3,500 square feet of meticulously
re-created American scenery from Seattle to Chicago. In the Emerald
City, with its grassy parks, vintage Space Needle and new Experience
Music Project, a ship loads containers onto the train for its journey
east, past the Cascades, Rocky Mountains and Northern Plains
farmlands and into Chicago. There are hundreds of custom-made
structures, including 192 buildings, along 1,400 feet of track.</LD>
<TE>   Visitors walk around and through the snake-shaped terrain,
stopping at several interactive stations where they can raise
drawbridges, blast tunnels, blow the horn of a container ship and
more.</TE>
<TE>   The trains are on a 1:87 scale; the scale of the scenery varies.
Chicago's Sears Tower tops out at nearly 14 feet, the Rockies at only
11 feet. The Windy City tooting its own whistle, perhaps?</TE>
<TE>   The exhibit is included in museum admission, which is $9 for ages
12 and older and $5 for ages 3 to 11. Open daily except Dec. 25.
Hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday to Saturday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Sunday. (800) 468-6674, www.msichicago.org.</TE>

She found it, half a world away, during a nine-week backpacking trip

shifting hues of green due to minerals in the water. Behind it is
Licancabur, a dormant volcano in Chile. It rises 19,455 feet, nearly
as high as Mt. McKinley in Alaska.</CP>

<HD>Remembering some close shaves on the travel-writing road</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a decade of travel writing under my money belt, I like to think
I have it down. I don't leave for the airport without tickets, get on
the wrong train or let my wallet out of my hand.</LD>
<LD>   Still, unnerving things have happened to me from which I try to
draw lessons. On the road, I use street smarts gleaned from 20 years
in New York City, and I try to trust my instincts. As a solo woman
traveler, I know I should not walk alone in strange, edgy places,
though the strong attraction of doing so sometimes leads me to break
the rule. And I'm wary of strangers, even though, I believe, only a
few of them have malice in their hearts. Taking such precautions on
solo trips as far afield as India, Eastern Europe, the South Pacific
and China has helped me make it home to my easy chair.</LD>
<LD>   But I refuse to be too slavish about playing it safe because
pushing the envelope a little often yields rewards, like getting to
know a stranger who becomes a friend or seeing something wonderful
around the bend. So I am always looking for the perfect balance
between staying safe and taking risks.</LD>
<TE>   Fortunately -- and I do think that fortune has something to do
with it -- I've gotten the balance wrong only a few times. Here are
some of those times:</TE>
<TE>   There is an island in French Polynesia, near Bora-Bora, called
Huahine, that's little frequented by tourists. It has jungly
mountains, sweeping beaches, coral shoals. I was seeking a South
Pacific paradise off the beaten track, so I went there.</TE>
<TE>   I stayed in a French pension in Fare, the island's main town,
where the rooms were simple but charming. It bothered me that they
had curtains instead of locking doors, but the pension was the best
place in town.</TE>
<TE>   One night a diminutive intruder came into the lodge through an
open window. I was sleeping lightly and awoke when the thief's feet
appeared below the doorway curtains. As his arm inched around the
fabric, I screamed for him to get out, and he did. From the size of
his feet, I suspect he was about 10 years old, a threat to my
property, if not to my person.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime later I went walking on a path in the mountains to see
the ruins of several ancient Polynesian temples. Suddenly a dog ran
out of the jungle and started barking at me. Then more appeared until
I was surrounded by a couple of dozen at least. They bared their
teeth, snarled and snapped, coming closer and closer. I pulled a
branch from a tree and tried to fend them off. My hands shook, and my
heart hammered. Suddenly, in the distance, I heard a whistle from a
man working in a field, calling off the dogs. Like a cloud of bees,
they lifted. I ran back to my bike, blessing the man and vowing to
remember that not all dogs are Lassie.</TE>
<TE>   I had another close call on a trip to India. From New Delhi I went
north to the hamlet of McLeod Ganj, a favorite spot for mountain
trekkers and devotees of Tibetan Buddhism in the Himalayas. But I
found neither peace nor enlightenment.</TE>
<TE>   My guidebook said solo walkers had been robbed and raped on trails
around McLeod Ganj, so I went hiking with two women I met in town.
But I lagged behind and suddenly was face to face with a gang of
boys. Surrounding me, they jostled and touched me on the arms and
back. I pushed through the gang and started shrieking, which seemed
to surprise them. Then I ran, rejoining my walking mates around the
next bend. What bothered me most, I think, was that the incident
occurred even though I had taken the precaution of finding
companions.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, in rugged, isolated Copper Canyon in
north-central Mexico, I went on a walk that could have cost me my
life. I was staying in the old mining town of Batopilas at the bottom
of the canyon. From there, a dirt road leads about five miles south
to a beautiful Jesuit mission church in the village of Satevo.
Everyone who visits Batopilas takes the walk to the church. The road
along the river is easy to follow, lined with houses and begging
kids. I made it to Satevo with no trouble.</TE>
<TE>   On the way back, though, a boy of about 15 started following me,
asking for money. I refused, but he kept after me, saying he was a
bandido. It seemed almost laughable, given his size. But then he took
out a folding knife. I pushed him away and felt his heart thumping in
his chest, which gave me the courage to yell. He opened the knife,
and I screamed louder -- not in fear but like a banshee, which was
enough to discourage him from following me as I took off.</TE>
<TE>   Home now, I think about these encounters and realize how lucky
I've been. I argue with myself about what I could have done to avoid
them and memorize the lessons they teach.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there's no guarantee I'll avoid trouble. So, for me,
traveling safely remains a constant negotiation between being careful
and pushing the envelope just enough to see as much of this good,
bad, beautiful and ugly world as I can.</TE>

<LD>   Creature comforts on a safari from sky to savanna</LD>
<LD>   See beauty and beasts on a 12-day Christmastime safari to southern
Africa that will whisk travelers from one game preserve to another on
chartered aircraft.</LD>
<TE>   The Dec. 23 tour, which has several other departures from March
through October, includes helicopter flight-seeing at thundering
Victoria Falls and a sunset cruise on Christmas Day on the Zambezi
River.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers will board small planes and fly across the desert to
explore several wildlife areas, including the Okavango Delta in
Botswana, home to wild game and more than 550 species of birds. "The
plane charters make the trips more comfortable," said tour
representative Doug Bolnick. "You can avoid four or five hours in a
jungle van on dusty roads."</TE>

<HD>Getting the boot from the Wyoming wilderness</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Jay Weiner</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boldly the intrepid adventurers (and their dog) strode off into the
wild. Meek and chastened they returned. Mother Nature, 1. Rebecca and
Jay, 0.</LD>
<LD>   The end of the adventure really should have been Friday morning,
when, a couple of miles from our campsite, my wife was knocked off
her feet by the powerful current of what the map called a creek but,
swollen by snowmelt, was really a river. Twisting awkwardly while
trying to make sure that our dog, Calypso, wasn't drowning, Rebecca
fell and lost her grip on her boots (she had taken them off to ford
the creek), which the current swept away.</LD>
<LD>   We quickly recovered one, which still had a sock tucked snugly
inside it, and found the second sock snagged on a branch 50 feet
downstream. But the other boot eluded us.</LD>
<TE>   We spent close to three hours dredging the riverbed, floating
sticks to gauge current patterns, losing feeling in various
appendages in the frigid water and getting devoured by mosquitoes.</TE>
<TE>   Early the previous evening, with visions of campfires and starry
skies dancing in our heads, we pitched our tent a few miles from
where the road became impassable to our beat-up Honda. We were hoping
to spend 3 1/2 days hiking 30-odd miles in northern Wyoming's Cloud
Peak Wilderness Area. There we were, marveling at the quality of our
packing job, our love of the outdoors, the beauty surrounding us,
when the winged bloodsuckers descended on us like a biblical plague.</TE>
<TE>   We had bug spray, which slowed their onslaught. Rebecca built a
fire, but even smoke didn't deter them. Our dinner plans quickly
shifted from the leisurely kind (pasta) to the
stuff-our-faces-and-take-cover variety (peanut butter and jelly
sandwiches). We gave up and, with nightfall at least an hour away,
took our bug-spray-slathered sandwiches into the tent.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, we found that the mosquitoes hadn't been
discouraged by our early retreat but were waiting for breakfast. We
broke camp hurriedly in the mistaken belief that motion would keep
them at bay. Coated in enough bug spray to cover a small hippo, we
were afforded a respite, but sloshing around in the creek rinsed us
clean. Our options were reduced to searching for the boot in the
water with our feet burning from the cold or recovering on the shore
and losing pints of blood. So we searched, got bitten, searched, got
bitten, searched and got bitten.</TE>
<TE>   Then the dog rolled in a deposit of poorly buried human feces that
she had unearthed near the bank. That should have been the last
straw, but Rebecca and I had been ignoring ill omens for three days
and weren't about to let a stinky dog or a squadron of airborne
vampires defeat us.</TE>
<TE>   I had next to no vacation time at my job, and with many far-flung
family commitments, we have little time to escape on our own. Here we
were with a five-day Fourth of July weekend. It didn't matter that I
had a raging sinus infection and a tubercular-sounding cough; that I
had buckled the nail on my left big toe playing basketball in
too-tight shoes the day before we left and was in pain; or that my
wife had a vicious case of tendinitis in her right knee. We were
going camping, come hell or high water. (We should, perhaps, have
been less specific in our ultimatum.)</TE>
<TE>   An uphill battle</TE>
<TE>   We came close to giving up on the boot more than once, but our
stubborn streaks won out. The creek had the last laugh, though.
Rebecca, digging under a natural dam beneath which we thought the
boot might have lodged, lost her footing on the slick rock, slammed
her back against a log, twisted her good knee and ended up neck deep
in the icy water. Not long after, we conceded the boot -- but not
before Calypso had rediscovered the pile of excrement and I had been
reduced to one giant welt.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than acknowledge that we had been defeated completely,
Rebecca decided to soldier on in her soaked running shoes. So, wet,
bug-bitten and ill shod, we pushed on, climbing up past one lake,
which involved another freezing ford, though with a less bullying
current, and ultimately to a spot just before a second creek.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently the author of our guidebook had done this route in late
summer, because what was rated as barely a puddle jump was a torrid
rush of a river that I would have hesitated to raft. Although the
ford was narrow and there was a luscious (though probably
bug-infested) campsite on the other side, we saw no way to get
across. Rebecca's running shoes had no traction, and we doubted that
Calypso could withstand the current. One misstep would have swept us
onto some nasty rocks.</TE>
<TE>   After some desperate speculation (maybe we could swing over the
river on those tree branches; maybe we could build a little stone
bridge; maybe we could levitate), we concluded that retreat was the
better part of valor.</TE>
<TE>   It was past 4 p.m., and we were nine miles from our car. But
determined not to spend another night Out There, back we went.
Sensing my departure, the mosquitoes redoubled their efforts,
hovering just millimeters above any bare patch of skin. I had a nasty
sunburn on my shoulders, so every time my pack jostled, I felt as if
I were being cut by a blowtorch. Rebecca's back and knee were sore,
and her running shoes squished with every step. Calypso too was
dragging, even ignoring a pair of deer that crossed our path.</TE>
<TE>   We recrossed a tributary of the lower lake. Its current had picked
up by then, which didn't bother us but freaked out Calypso, who hates
water over her shoulders. Rebecca had to carry her across.</TE>
<TE>   Finally we returned to our personal River Styx. I think we were
both hoping to see the errant boot -- maybe then we could salvage our
holiday.</TE>
<TE>   We got back to our first night's campsite (still 2 1/2 miles from
the car) around 8 p.m. Any latent thoughts of spending one more night
out were quickly squelched when we discovered the spot to be full of
car campers gearing up for a drunken celebration of independence.</TE>
<TE>   The sky was just starting to bruise when we reached our car. Too
tired to start the trek for our home in Helena, Mont., we overpaid
for a dingy room at a motel in Sheridan, Wyo., and collapsed onto the
lumpy mattress.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, we decided that we should try to have some fun on
the way home, so we consulted our atlas for a scenic route. It took
us across northern Wyoming, through the Big Horn National Forest,
past rock sheets millions and then billions of years old. At one
scenic viewpoint, a sign said the panorama below once was submerged
by an inland sea that covered the Great Plains.</TE>
<TE>   We moderns tend to think we have mastered our planet and unlocked
the secrets of the universe, but there's no reason to doubt that the
tectonic forces that drained that inland sea and sent the Rockies
shooting skyward will rouse themselves again and bury our hubris.</TE>
<TE>   But not the mosquitoes.</TE>

<HD>The case of the shiftless Zastava</HD>
<DH>On a European tour, their tiny auto fails them in a clutch
situation. Is it a question of nationalism gone awry?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Whitehead</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Don't stop!" Katherine shouted. "Don't even slow down! We may not
get going again."</LD>
<LD>   We were certainly going now -- ripping along about 60 mph in a
Zastava, a tin can of a car, on an Austrian highway, about 50 miles
from the Yugoslavian border.</LD>
<LD>   This wasn't our first trip to Europe, but it was our first time
renting a car on the Continent. I liberated us from train schedules
to give us flexibility.</LD>
<TE>   That, of course, was well before I noticed the clutch pedal
resting on the floorboard. It hadn't fallen off, mind you; it was
flat against the floor as if I had pushed it in. Had I treated it
indelicately, being a less-than-regular driver of stick shifts, or
was it just time for a breakdown now that the odometer was
registering a whopping 4,000 (miles or kilometers, I wasn't sure)?</TE>
<TE>   More important, what was I to do now?</TE>
<TE>   Levelheaded and in complete control of the situation, I did the
logical thing: I asked my wife. Not only is she bright, but she's
also an experienced stick shift driver and, most important, the
eldest child of a mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   Her advice was simple: Keep going if we wanted to keep going.</TE>
<TE>   And so we did, stuck in fourth gear, speeding through small towns
and valleys, up hill and down dale, never above 60 and never below
40.</TE>
<TE>   About 90 minutes from our destination, we wondered aloud whether
we should stop at a garage. Having seen few of them along the way, I
immediately discarded this idea.</TE>
<TE>   And we immediately passed a garage.</TE>
<TE>   OK. We would continue on to Vienna and have the car repaired
during our two-night stay -- a better idea anyway so we wouldn't get
stuck some place in between. As we sped along, I occasionally checked
the clutch, perhaps out of some deep-seated hope that it might spring
back to life. But it just lay there like road kill.</TE>
<TE>   About now, you may be asking why a Zastava. I certainly was. This
had been preceded by another question: What is a Zastava?</TE>
<TE>   You probably know the Zastava. A slightly larger version of it
came to the United States some years later as the more luxurious
Yugo.</TE>
<TE>   But I had no clue. When I asked Janet, our travel agent, to check
our rental car options in Yugoslavia, we were offered a Renault or a
Zastava.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want that," she said of choice No. 2. "It's a Russian
car." Mind you, this was 1984, the Cold War hadn't thawed and
Yugoslavia was still a unified whole.</TE>
<TE>   After arriving in Dubrovnik, we went to get our Renault and were
told that only Zastavas were available. Seeing my irritation, the
rental agent asked what was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want a Russian car," I said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a Russian car! It's a Yugoslavian car!" he said with a
great deal of national pride.</TE>
<TE>   I apologized for my ignorance of fine Yugoslavian automaking and
happily accepted the pocket-sized auto. The exterior was ugly and
green. The interior gave new meaning to the idea of minimalism.</TE>
<TE>   We loaded our gear and took off. From Dubrovnik we drove to
Sarajevo, then back to the sea and up the beautiful Dalmatian coast.
North of Split, our Zastava climbed inland to Plitvice Lakes National
Park and north to Zagreb. We visited my wife's Croatian relatives on
the family farm and saw the prize of the village: a pig as wide as a
Buick. Through all of Yugoslavia the car performed flawlessly. And
now that we had crossed into a capitalist country it was rebelling
with some misplaced spirit of nationalism.</TE>
<TE>   By midafternoon I was feeling a little more optimistic about our
plight until events conspired against us. We were coming down a
gentle slope when I realized that our two-lane highway was narrowing
to one lane and then, in the equivalent of a block, becoming two
lanes again as a one-lane road merged in from the right.</TE>
<TE>   The lanes began to merge. A slow truck ahead made traffic even
slower. Cars began to decelerate. This party was over. I had no
choice but to stop on a grass-covered strip to the right of the road.</TE>
<TE>   Just before we veered off the highway we passed what appeared to
be a call box. It now stood about a hundred yards behind us. What
luck!</TE>
<TE>   A setback for the male ego</TE>
<TE>   Being the man, it was my job to seek help. I trudged through the
thick grass and approached the beacon of hope: a metal post about 4
feet tall topped by a metal rectangle, about the size of a shoe box.
Three sides of the box were solid metal, and one side included a
grate at the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   I looked at it. I looked again. I circled it like an animal sizing
up its prey. I studied it, tried to open it, looked for directions
and found nothing.</TE>
<TE>   I returned to the car and shared my analysis with Katherine. "I
don't know what it is," I said, "but it's not a call box."</TE>
<TE>   Unbelieving, she left to check it out. I waited by our car and
wondered what we would do next, secure in the knowledge that
Katherine's inspection was pointless. Sure, I had deferred to her
superior knowledge of clutch pedals, but I was smart enough to know
she was wasting our time.</TE>
<TE>   Some time later, she returned.</TE>
<TE>   "Ny eyldil in nit," she hollered as she began to approach.</TE>
<TE>   "What?" I shouted back over the passing traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "I yelled in it," she hollered again.</TE>
<TE>   "You yelled in what?"</TE>
<TE>   Within range for conversation she said, "I yelled in the grate,
and then you talk to somebody."</TE>
<TE>   I was relieved that help must be on the way, but my already
diminished roadside male ego was devastated -- squashed by my wife's
common-sense approach. If it doesn't have a receiver, yell in it.</TE>
<TE>   I'd thought about kicking it, but that was as far as my
imagination roamed.</TE>
<TE>   In about 20 minutes a roadside mechanic appeared and found a
broken clutch cable or some such culprit.</TE>
<TE>   We continued on without incident -- to Vienna, Salzburg and
finally Munich, where we turned in our Zastava.</TE>
<TE>   The rental agent eyed the car suspiciously and asked, "Are you
sure it's one of ours?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," I said, and happily left the vile little vehicle behind.</TE>
<TE>   I learned some important lessons on that trip. The first is that
my wife is an invaluable traveling companion. And the second? In a
clutch situation, always choose the automatic.</TE>

<HD>When is a dog not man's best friend? A cliffhanger tale</HD>
<DH>An Easter Island hiker falls for a lovable stray -- much to
his regret.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Wolffe</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My mind was a blank as I slipped over the edge of the cliff and fell
to my certain death on the jagged rocks below.</LD>
<LD>   If I'd been able to think rationally, perhaps I would have asked
myself a couple of questions: Who goes for a hike next to steep
cliffs on a remote Pacific island without telling anyone? And with
only a stray dog for company?</LD>
<LD>   But this bit of logic would only come later. After the fall.</LD>
<TE>   It all happened because of the dog.</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by thousands of miles of ocean in all directions,
Easter Island is said by many to be the most remote inhabited island
in the world and was the perfect destination for a traveler seeking
adventure and solitude.</TE>
<TE>   Add the allure of the island's moai -- huge anthropomorphic
statues carved from volcanic rock -- and I couldn't wait to go. I
headed there in the fall of 2000, giving myself a full week so I'd
have plenty of time to explore.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of my first day on the island, I set out on foot,
armed with a granola bar and a small bottle of water. That was my
first mistake. My goal was to circumnavigate Rano Kau, an immense,
awe-inspiring volcanic crater that forms a peninsula at the island's
southwest corner. That was my second mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, you can drive to the top of Rano Kau, but where's the effort
in that? I wanted to hike along the coast, up the crater rim and then
continue all the way around the peninsula, ending where I began. As
fate would have it, I wouldn't be entirely alone, technically.</TE>
<TE>   A stray dog began to tail me as I left the island's only town. I
was sure he would leave once he realized there was no food
forthcoming, but he kept up with me, past the town, past a toppled
moai and up the mountainside.</TE>
<TE>   As the terrain grew rough, the dog accompanied me down steep
embankments and up the other side. We crawled through heavy brush in
single file. When the occasional ranch fence blocked our way, I'd
hold up the barbed wire so he could shimmy underneath.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't exactly how I had envisioned my seaside jaunt, dodging
ranchers and assisting ownerless mutts. But I didn't turn back.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, my canine companion's loyalty inspired me, and I decided
to reward him with a name. Proud of my burgeoning Spanish vocabulary,
I dubbed him "Perro," which means dog.</TE>
<TE>   After an hour or so of climbing, clambering, huffing and puffing,
Perro and I reached Rano Kau's summit, almost a thousand feet above
sea level, where we were greeted by spectacular views of the crater
and the ocean beyond -- and a couple of tourists who had driven the
distance in five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   I was sweaty, hungry and panting. So was Perro. But our odyssey
wasn't nearly over. Still determined to stick to my plan, I descended
along the crater rim itself, following a sheer, boulder-strewn,
barely discernible trail.</TE>
<TE>   Perro, who must have been as hot as I was, continued to follow me.
Occasionally I'd hear a whimper when he couldn't find an easy way
down the rocks, but a minute later he would come bounding after me. I
couldn't believe he hadn't followed the road back home. I couldn't
believe I hadn't done the same.</TE>
<TE>   On and on we stumbled, back up the lip of the crater, along
thousand-foot-high bluffs, past a lone cross and a small pile of
stones marking someone's grave. Or did I imagine that?</TE>
<TE>   In a clear indication of my growing delirium, I began to compose
nonsense lyrics in honor of Perro, to the tune of a song I'd learned
in childhood: "I had a little perro, I carved him out of cake, and
when he's baked and ready, then moai we will make."</TE>
<TE>   Several hours, miles and verses later, Perro and I were still
tracing the coastline, dog-tired but finally nearing the end of our
journey. Here we encountered the one obstacle Perro could not
surmount: a lattice fence. I hopped over, but Perro couldn't jump
that high. He couldn't squeeze under it or through it. He was stuck.</TE>
<TE>   After all he'd endured to be with me, I couldn't leave him behind.</TE>
<TE>   Clinging to life</TE>
<TE>   On opposite sides of the fence, we followed the spiteful barrier
downhill until it ended just a foot short of the cliff's edge. The
opening was far too narrow to let cows or horses escape but just wide
enough for a dog.</TE>
<TE>   Perro refused to budge.</TE>
<TE>   To show him how easy it was to get around the fence, I swung
myself around the last post and walked up the hill to where he was,
then turned around to do it again, hoping he would follow. As I
approached the post a second time, I suddenly slipped on the damp
clay, fell on my rear and went over the cliff.</TE>
<TE>   Now, remember, I'd been hiking all day. In the sun. With little
food or water.</TE>
<TE>   I was exhausted and delirious, singing made-up songs to a dog. I
hadn't seen another human being in hours. The ocean was perhaps 50
feet below. And here I was, sliding into oblivion.</TE>
<TE>   I clawed at the ground wildly, blindly, casting about for
something, anything, to stop my fall. There was only mud. A fraction
of a second later I landed, standing up, on a ledge about 10 feet
below.</TE>
<TE>   Mentally, I was still in a panic. I was still falling. My brain
hadn't realized I was still alive. I have a vague memory of looking
up and seeing Perro's anxious face peering down at me. Somehow I
scrambled back up the cliff. I have no idea how; my body was on
autopilot. I stumbled to a patch of grass, where I sat down
unsteadily: stunned, speechless, bloody, muddy and numb.</TE>
<TE>   Perro sat nearby, quietly.</TE>
<TE>   When I could focus again, I twisted and turned to check out the
damage.</TE>
<TE>   Circular flaps of skin hung from both hands where I'd scraped them
on rocks embedded in the face of the cliff. My arms were streaked
with dirt and blood. My clothes had seen cleaner days.</TE>
<TE>   But incredibly, I was all right.</TE>
<TE>   As I stood up and the shock wore off, the magnitude of what I'd
just experienced began to sink in. I could have been killed in that
fall. I could have broken my back. No one would have come looking for
me because no one knew I was here. No one would have heard my cries
because no one comes to this part of the island. I was an absolute,
incontrovertible, irrefutable imbecile.</TE>
<TE>   But, I told myself, I had done it for Perro. Without me to guide
him past the fence, he would have been trapped. He would have starved
to death. I had saved his life.</TE>
<TE>   The bittersweet ending to this dog's tale is that on the road back
into town I was picked up by a local in a Humvee who left Perro in
the dust and dismissively informed me that the dogs on Easter Island
follow everybody everywhere until they're shooed away.</TE>
<TE>   My Perro hadn't thought I was special after all. I'd fallen for a
dog that hadn't even fallen for me.</TE>

<HD>The taxi driver</HD>
<DH>The bus in northern India was cheap but too disgusting. So
they hired a cab to the Himalayas. Boy, was that a bad decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Jones</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I can't hope to compete with hard-core journalists when it comes to
tales of front lines, terrorists, drug lords, pestilence, natural
disasters, marauding beasts and psychopathic guides. My stories are
feeble by comparison. I've only ever imperiled myself through blind
gullibility, outright stupidity or the overconsumption of alcohol --
whether it was me or someone else doing the imbibing.</LD>
<LD>   My most protracted flirtation with death took place in northern
India, when my husband, Greg, and I were young and experiencing the
developing world for the first time. Our destination on that
brazier-hot day was Simla, a cool, forested Himalayan town once
favored by the British Raj.</LD>
<LD>   I don't recall how we got to Chandigarh. By that point, India had
become an eternal journey on trains, planes, camels, bikes, rickshaws
and elephants. I do, however, clearly remember the Chandigarh bus
station. It appeared that half of India had converged on this
particular place, resulting in a scene of flawless anarchy. No ticket
booth was in evidence, but 30 decrepit, filth-streaked buses that
were parked and driverless were crammed with passive-faced locals and
topped with a motley array of luggage.</LD>
<TE>   Greg swung into action, boarding each bus to inquire about its
destination. I watched as Indian men swarmed to offer advice, swaying
their heads back and forth in that indigenous subcontinental fashion.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I found the bus," Greg said. "But I can't figure out if
it's leaving in 10 minutes or 10 hours. It seems Simla is somewhere
between three and five hours away."</TE>
<TE>   It was only 9 in the morning, and already I sensed the rising
dread that is the traveler's enemy. It foreshadows spiritual decline
and a temporary obsession with the glories of home.</TE>
<TE>   Boarding, I made the mistake of glancing down the bus. The streaks
I had noticed from afar were rivers of encrusted vomit, and no window
lacked one. Inside, the smell defied precise identification, except
to conjure a fusion of putrefied meat, patchouli and body odor.</TE>
<TE>   The only empty seats were on a hard, cracked-leather bench,
pierced by a rusted spring. My humor returned fleetingly when Greg
tried to sit down. At 6 feet 4 inches, he is a behemoth by Indian
standards. His knees drove into the forward seat, forcing him to sit
with his legs spread wide, leaving me only a few inches in which to
stow my own limbs.</TE>
<TE>   "Pardon me," I said to a trustworthy-looking mother. "How long is
the ride to Simla?"</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe six hours," she answered with a smile. "But not so great a
time if no accident."</TE>
<TE>   Accident?</TE>
<TE>   I opened the Australian guidebook we'd neglected to read and saw
that it called this particular transport the "chunder bus." (In
Aussie slang, "chunder" means vomit.) These buses, it continued,
traveled on one of India's most perilous roads, claiming hundreds of
lives every year as they hurtled off sheer cliffs to rocky,
irretrievable ends. Silently, I passed the book to Greg. He read,
unfurled his legs, stood and announced, "We're taking a taxi."</TE>
<TE>   There were no taxis. Once again Greg stalked off to investigate,
returning with a scrawny man with bare feet and a razor-thin Errol
Flynn mustache. He was radiant with shiftiness.</TE>
<TE>   "Stay here," he said. "I find you taxi driver. Oh my, Simla looong
way and only No. 1 brave man make drive."</TE>
<TE>   Again we waited, the time marked by three buses that crept off in
a foul cloud of unfiltered diesel. Finally we were led to a car,
introduced to Vandan, its mannered driver, and told to get in and
wait while he set things up. With relief we collapsed into the
antiquated Indian-made car.</TE>
<TE>   "How far to Simla?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah, three hours most. I get you there lickity-split quick. I am
No. 1 best driver," he said. Greg and I settled in for a pleasant
private ride.</TE>
<TE>   Then something happened which, to anyone in her right mind, would
have been a sign to get out of the car and run. A man stuck his head
in the window and introduced himself. J.P. Kapoor had the air of an
anxious do-gooder.</TE>
<TE>   "I see you are the passengers of Vandan," J.P. Kapoor ventured. "I
am his social worker. If there are any problems, any problems at all,
just call this number. Remember that. OK?"</TE>
<TE>   And he handed me a piece of paper printed with "Chandigarh
Department of Social Services and Restoration," and his name and
telephone number.</TE>
<TE>   I don't recall my reaction. Maybe I thought the man was ensuring
that the quality of taxi rides to Simla met international standards.
Neither Greg nor I thought to ask what sort of problems he might be
referring to.</TE>
<TE>   An oddly thirsty driver</TE>
<TE>   By the time Vandan returned, it was well past lunchtime and his
English skills had taken a turn for the worse, which I attributed to
the heat.</TE>
<TE>   Vandan drove on what Greg and I have come to refer to as the
pinball method: two points for connecting with a pedestrian, three
for causing cardiac arrest in a bicyclist, four for endangering
domesticated animals and five for passing a passing car on a hairpin
turn. The only things spared were the cows, meandering mid-road with
hallowed impunity.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of all, my magnanimity endured. Anything was better than
the chunder bus. Besides, the Himalayan foothills were approaching;
they were sure to slow Vandan down.</TE>
<TE>   By the third hour, the hills were still distant mounds and Vandan
had stopped for chai, spiced Indian tea, three times. Thirsty man, we
thought, as he disappeared into a roadside shack flung together from
corrugated tin.</TE>
<TE>   By the fourth cup his mood had darkened, and he drove with a
savagery reserved for Hong Kong action flicks. His face was twisted
into a bruised knot, he muttered in Hindi, and he no longer spoke nor
understood English. I sat rigid, waiting for the "thadump" that would
signal his first casualty.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding one precarious corner, Vandan began gesticulating
maniacally, pointing out the charred and crumpled remains of two
buses, three trucks and several cars 500 feet below. He seemed to
find the sight deeply satisfying and continued to identify wrecks as
the road grew narrower.</TE>
<TE>   "Excuse me, Vandan," Greg said. "Would you please slow down? And
are we almost there? We've been driving for nearly four hours."</TE>
<TE>   Vandan whirled around, shrieking in Hindi, spittle flying. He beat
the steering wheel with both hands and veered off the road, stopping
outside yet another chai hut. This time he left the car running while
we sat stupefied and stupidly embarrassed by our predicament.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," said Greg, my postgraduate- degreed mate, "I think our
Vandan is a psychopathic drunk. This 'chai' he's drinking is actually
more like rocket fuel."</TE>
<TE>   Well, duh. J.P. Kapoor sprang to mind. I fondled the piece of
paper and looked for a phone.</TE>
<TE>   "Amanda," Greg said. "Look where you are. Do you expect there to
be phones up here? That piece of paper is a sick joke."</TE>
<TE>   He was right, of course. Had I been older, had I been as inured as
I am now, I would have assumed the wheel and left our alcoholic taxi
driver to stagger off a cliff. When he returned, we remained very,
very still and very, very silent, staring out at the darkening sky.</TE>
<TE>   I fell into a despondent torpor, certain that life was a 50-50
deal. Vandan sped dangerously at times and proceeded at a crawl at
others, occasionally brushing the lip of the cliff.</TE>
<TE>   At the next chai stop, I remembered I had Valium in my luggage. If
I were to die, I reasoned, I might as well go out stoned. Greg took
the moral high ground, saying he preferred to remain alert. "Good for
you," I said, downing two pills.</TE>
<TE>   Slumped in a corner, I lived my death several times on that
journey. Greg sat stoically holding my hand.</TE>
<TE>   At 2 a.m., 11 hours after leaving Chandigarh, the car crawled into
Simla. Vandan was rotten drunk. Greg shouted at him to stop, telling
me to stay put while he looked for a hotel. We should have swapped
roles, but I was too drugged to move. As soon as Greg disappeared,
Vandan turned to me, leering through bloodshot eyes, pointing at my
chest and then himself. Then, to my horror, he faced the wheel and
the car lurched off up the hill.</TE>
<TE>   At that point some overdue reaction punched through my brain,
rousing me. With a samurai cry, I launched myself at the loathsome
Vandan, pummeling his head with my fists, then with the guidebook. He
grabbed for me, failed, stopped the car, opened the door, tried to
stand up and instead slumped to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   I leaped from the car just as Greg appeared, panting and furious.
He threw some money on the comatose body, and we proceeded on foot.
Stumbling through the sleeping town, we rounded a corner and faced
the final defeat -- the chunder bus, parked and empty, which had
obviously arrived long before.</TE>

<LD>Ah, Venice. Venice was magical. Venice was welcoming. And mostly,
Venice wasn't Sant' Elpidio a Mare.</LD>
<LD>   My hairdresser rents out his childhood home in Italy once or twice
a year, and after viewing his photos of the charming country cottage,
I decided to be one of those renters. Though the house was in a part
of the country I'd never heard of (Sant' Elpidio a Mare is three
miles or so inland from the Adriatic, about midway down the boot),
how bad could any part of Italy be?</LD>
<LD>   Bad. It probably wasn't Italy's fault, or even Sant' Elpidio a
Mare's.</LD>
<TE>   The house was charming, but it was, after all, a country house,
which was isolating. Realizing country life wasn't for me, I decided
to use Sant' Elpidio as a base for exploring Italy. My first foray
was to Venice.</TE>
<TE>   Seeing the city, I was amazed and dazed. It might have been the
great beauty. Or it might have been the ear infection from which I
was growing increasingly ill.</TE>
<TE>   I went to a farmacia and asked for something to clear acqua
nell'orecchio, water in the ear, which I'd had before I left
California. The woman there did not speak English, but I thought I
managed to communicate my problem, and she gave me a package.</TE>
<TE>   Inside were two little cones of what seemed to be waxed paper. You
were to stick one end in your ear and light the other end, allowing
the flame to burn down to a cylinder of metallic paper that
supposedly would stop the fire. The photo on the package showed
someone administering the treatment to a child.</TE>
<TE>   This was going to be tricky for a solo traveler.</TE>
<TE>   I put my head down and lighted the cone, but I was so unnerved as
the flame neared my hair that I threw it in a glass of water. I was
dripping with sweat, and that seemed the remedy's only effect.</TE>
<TE>   I tried the other cone the next day, but I still worried about
flames shooting out my ear. Again, it had no real effect except to
scare me senseless.</TE>
<TE>   I tried some drops from another farmacia. On the third day I
realized the problem was not going away, but I was worried that my
hearing would be. I asked the concierge to send a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   The doctor spoke no English but, seeing my dictionary, thought we
could manage. She looked into my ears and said, yes, something was
amiss. She gave me a prescription for an antibiotic and told me I was
to take it twice a day, at 8 and 8, for seven days.</TE>
<TE>   I was diligent about the medication. Soon I returned to Sant'
Elpidio. The magic of Venice was gone, and it didn't follow me.</TE>
<TE>   The problem gets bigger</TE>
<TE>   On the seventh day I called my doctor in California. He told me
the prescription was appropriate and that I should take it for a full
10 days. So I popped another pill that evening at 8, and I awoke the
next morning just in time to take the next pill.</TE>
<TE>   My lips seemed a little swollen, and I was itching a bit, but I
downed the pill to stay on schedule. I wanted to be well enough to
see Rome, my next side trip.</TE>
<TE>   By the time my train to Rome left, my lips looked like collagen
injections gone mad. As we neared Rome, I noticed little bumps on my
neck.</TE>
<TE>   Upon check-in at my hotel, I asked to see a doctor. He didn't
speak English either but told me I had an allergic reaction to
penicillin (I've never been allergic to anything), that the dosage
the doctor in Venice had given me was strong and I had taken too
much. He prescribed cortisone.</TE>
<TE>   I was feverish, and the hives were no longer dots but huge
splotches of red covering my body head to toe. And they itched. Oh,
how they itched.</TE>
<TE>   So here I was, in Rome and in misery. I stayed in my room, leaving
only for meals. The doctor had told me I should be better in three
days, but if not, to call him. I called him, and he summoned a
dermatologist, who took one look at me, shook his head and gave me a
prescription for a much stronger cortisone pill.</TE>
<TE>   He also listed food and beverages I should avoid: aged cheese,
such as Parmesan or Gorgonzola; anchovies, sardines and shellfish;
spinach and tomatoes; cured meats, such as salami, prosciutto, ham;
chocolate; and the piece de resistance, wine.</TE>
<TE>   This was some cruel joke. Here I was in Italy, unable to eat the
food, drink the wine, see the sights.</TE>
<TE>   Finally I decided I might just as well be miserable at home, so I
threw my stuff in a bag and, 30 hours later, walked into my house on
Mission Bay.</TE>
<TE>   I still have the itch to see Italy, but next time, I'll be a
little more careful about how I scratch it.</TE>

<HD>Sorry, just a little misunderstanding</HD>
<DH>A long, tiring journey from Tanzania to Kenya can do
strange things to a person.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alicia Rebensdorf</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She held her gun like a mother holding a child, the butt of the rifle
nestled against her hip. Her finger rested on the trigger, and the
barrel leaned on her shoulder. She was at ease with her power,
confident of her control. She was to be taken seriously.</LD>
<LD>   Believe me: I didn't mean to laugh. Insulting her authority as a
border guard was the furthest thing from my mind. I didn't intend to
belittle her relationship with her rifle. Quite the opposite; I was
profoundly intimidated by her threat of imprisonment. But a long bus
ride in Africa can do strange things to a person.</LD>
<LD>   My particular journey swept north from the Tanzanian capital, Dar
es Salaam, to the Kenyan coastal town of Mombasa. Like many of East
Africa's roads, this stretch of highway had accumulated several
ominous nicknames. Nevertheless, I was told it was well traveled, and
I figured what worked for thousands of Kenyans and Tanzanians would
suffice for me.</LD>
<TE>   I had been in East Africa for several months, living, studying and
traveling. I had cooked with coastal Swahili women, lived with a
rural Samburu family and partied with urban Nairobi youth. I had
endured jellyfish stings, fleas, mosquitoes, bedbugs and
god-knows-what-that-was bites. I had had food poisoning, felt the
rash of ringworm and swum in the delirium of malaria. I could handle
a one-day bus ride.</TE>
<TE>   I boarded the bus with a friend, a woman who impressed me as a
pretty tolerant traveler. She was acclimated to Africa's different
sense of time, space and smell, accepted Third World inconveniences
with humor and viewed whininess as a personality fault. Whether lost
in blacked-out alleys in Zanzibar or bathing in croc-infested rivers
in the Serengeti, she proved to be reliably thick-skinned.</TE>
<TE>   We boarded early and squeezed into a pair of seats in the rear of
the bus. Over the next hour, the vehicle gradually filled with
people, packages and pets. Livestock and limbs were crammed into,
under and on top of every seat. The aisle became a human wall. I was
lucky enough to get the window seat, so I could hang part of myself
outside it, but my less fortunate companion fell victim to the aisle
overflow, becoming a human chair for a man who smelled like a walking
latrine.</TE>
<TE>   Thus in place, our bus set off for what would prove to be one of
the longest 350 miles of my life. I had felt fortunate for sitting
next to the window, but this proved to have drawbacks. With the metal
bus conducting heat like the aluminum lid on Jiffy Pop, bodies
sweating and animals defecating, you would have expected agreement on
the benefits of ventilation. Yet any effort to crack open the window
incited a venomous response from the woman behind me: She'd mutter
and thrust the window closed. I'd reopen it and wedge a part of my
arm in it, and she'd press back. My skin growing pale, my hand
tingling and numb, I'd submit, and the window would clamp shut.
Watching our driver speed past wrecked buses littering the roadside
and pass cars on blind corners was not heartening.</TE>
<TE>   Several hours into the ride, when my companion insisted we change
seats, I welcomed the swap. My partner took on the window woman with
dogged determination, throwing her entire upper half through the
window and pushing back as if in a life-or-death game of tug of war.</TE>
<TE>   I was becoming concerned for my friend, who began complaining in
English and Swahili alike, not caring who heard or what impression
she gave.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the rules of travel dictate that only one person can
lose it at a time. My friend's cracking tolerance only made me
stiffen my resolve. I convinced myself the pressing bodies were cozy
and accepted this as a test I would soon pass.</TE>
<TE>   In no man's land</TE>
<TE>   Hours grated by. People got on, but fortunately more got off. The
toilet man found a seat in front, and the window woman relented to my
companion's determination. I was no longer so focused on the
wrenching smell, but I soon noticed that all the kids on the bus,
human and goat alike, were crying.</TE>
<TE>   The driver responded by drowning them out with blasting reggae
dance hall music, sickeningly cheerful and nauseatingly loud. My
companion curled into a fetal position and moaned. Four hours later
we were at the Tanzania-Kenya border. Out of the bus, away from the
pressing heat, smell and noise, I thought we might have a chance to
reacquaint ourselves with our sanity. Alas, after we'd waited in line
for more than an hour, for unclear reasons involving a lightbulb and
a lack of electricity, the border closed down. No more passports were
taken, no more entries allowed.</TE>
<TE>   Time skipped like a bad record caught in a tiresome groove.</TE>
<TE>   At last we were across the border, in the no man's land between
Tanzania and Kenya, when our bus got a flat tire and we were forced
to get off. The toilet man found his way back beside us. I was tired.
I was weary.</TE>
<TE>   My friend's face was caught in a horrid grimace, and she babbled
incoherently. Something deep in me ruptured at that point. I started
retelling the day's horrors with fevered energy, a diatribe streaming
from my lips like a burst dam. My companion seized on my weakness
like a lifeboat, riding its gospel with empathetic yeses and my Gods.
And then came the guard.</TE>
<TE>   Disorderly conduct, I think she said. National law, I'm sure I
heard that right. We dared sit and commiserate during the changing of
the flat? Could that warrant time in a Third World jail? In
retrospect, I don't know why I dared talk back.</TE>
<TE>   "What are you talking about?" I asked. "We knew of no such law. We
can't sit during the changing of a flat? This is absurd."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, she did not appreciate my perspective. She threw
out the words "law" and "jail."</TE>
<TE>   I spun wildly out of control. I argued. I laughed. She swung the
muzzle lower and threatened again. I said their laws were unjust.
With their roads so rutted and tire punctures so frequent, no wonder
nothing ever got done.</TE>
<TE>   Her grasp on the rifle only grew tighter. She continued using
terms like "prison" and "arrest," putting them in a context that made
them seemed less like threats than an impending condition, while I
continued using insults.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere in my tirade -- I think it was about the time she
pointed her rifle and told us to come with her -- my focus wandered
to the toilet man. His gaze was turned upward, and I followed it.</TE>
<TE>   There I saw it: a flash of green and red in the corner of my eye
as the Tanzanian flag was hoisted up a nearby pole. I looked down
from its waving nationalism and saw the small crowd that stood around
it.</TE>
<TE>   Only then did I realize that I had not only insulted her English
pronunciation but also offended her national pride. I tried to
explain I thought she said changing of the flat, not changing of the
flag. I bowed as humbly as I could and struggled to convince her of
my respect for her country and her authority. She ignored my apology
but allowed us to escape to the bus. I peeked out at her once I found
a seat, and I swear the barrel was still pointed at me.</TE>
<TE>   It was hot, and the break had not improved either the smell or the
heat. The next six hours passed much like the first -- painfully.</TE>
<TE>   When we finally reached Mombasa, I lurched off that bus like a
drunk. No, I was not as tough as I would have hoped. I could not
completely suppress the ugly American that dwelt within. But
staggering toward my hostel, I still managed a strut in my step.</TE>

<HD>Act like a kangaroo to explore Tasmania</HD>
<DH>New hop-on, hop-off bus lets backpackers crisscross the
island at a leisurely pace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lucy Izon</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It will be easier for backpackers and budget travelers to explore
Tasmania -- Australia's only island state, which was once an isolated
and notorious penal settlement -- when a hop-on, hop-off bus service
starts Dec. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Tasmania attracts visitors who want to explore the historical
ruins of Van Diemen's Land, as it used to be called, and wilderness
regions where unique wildlife evolved (such as the Tasmanian tiger,
which became extinct only in 1936, and the Tasmanian devil, which has
extraordinarily powerful jaws).</LD>
<LD>   Don't be misled by Tasmania's size. It looks small in comparison
with Australia, but it is as big as Scotland and requires more than a
couple of days to visit. And the new backpacker bus service from
Adventure Tours Australia, 011-61-8-8309-2277,
www.adventuretours.com.au, can help travelers get around the island,
especially if they have at least 10 days to spend.</LD>
<TE>   The guided hop-on, hop-off bus service, which costs about $220,
will link the main cities of Hobart, Devonport and Launceston with
wilderness areas in the north and southwest corners of the island,
including Cockle Bay (the southernmost tip of Australia) and the
Arthur River (for canoeing).</TE>
<TE>   There will be four departures of the 24-passenger minibuses each
week, with stops at budget accommodations, activities and popular
tourist sites. Passengers can get off where they choose and take up
to 30 days to complete the route.</TE>
<TE>   By taking the bus you can explore rain forests and rugged mountain
regions, and take breaks in the cities. Hobart, the state capital,
has a natural harbor so deep that it accommodates aircraft carriers.
The best time to visit is Jan. 1, so you can join the party for the
final celebrations of the Sydney-to-Hobart sailing race. At least 60
yachts are scheduled to set off from Sydney Harbor on Dec. 26 for the
630-nautical-mile race to Hobart.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular way to reach Tasmania from Melbourne is on the
400-cabin oceangoing ferry, the Spirit of Tasmania, a 14 1/2-hour
sailing. It travels four times a week (usually overnight) between
Melbourne and Devonport. Student fares are available for the
dormitory rooms. The ferry also can carry 300 vehicles. For details,
log onto www.spiritoftasmania.com.au.</TE>
<TE>   When you are back in Melbourne, you can explore the local wine
region on a tour for backpackers. Backpacker Winery Tours picks up
travelers in downtown Melbourne and takes them for a day of tastings
to four wineries in the Yarra Valley, with lunch included, for about
$44.</TE>
<TE>   For details, contact 011-61- 3-9877-8333,
www.backpackerwinerytours.com.au.</TE>
<TE>   If Sydney is your gateway to Australia, there are two new
centrally located hostels.</TE>
<TE>   Wakeup! (which belongs to the world's largest privately owned
backpacker accommodation chain) and Big offer budget lodgings. Both
are near Sydney's central railway station.</TE>
<TE>   Wakeup!, 509 Pitt St., 011-61-2-9288-7888, www.wakeup.com.au, can
house more than 500 travelers in dormitory, double and hotel-style
rooms. It offers a bar, a cafe, an Internet cafe and a movie-viewing
room. Beds in dormitory rooms start at $14 per night; double rooms
start at $44.</TE>
<TE>   Big, at 211 Elizabeth St., 011-61-2-9281-6030,
www.bigonelizabeth.com, is designed to combine the friendly
atmosphere and inexpensive pricing of hostels with some of the
comforts of a boutique hotel, such as a street-front cafe, a rooftop
terrace, free Continental breakfasts and a large kitchen in which
guests can prepare their meals.</TE>
<TE>   The hostel provides free transportation to popular Bondi Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Its 10 dormitory rooms have four to eight beds, which cost from
$16.50 per person, per night. The 27 double rooms start at $65.
Family rooms are also available.</TE>

<HD>More Than 200 Local Families Add Children on National
Adoption Day</HD>
<DH>Los Angeles was chosen as the center of this year's event.
The annual one-day affair is designed to speed up the legal process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Erika Hayasaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To teenager Thea Acker it seemed fitting that Los Angeles County was
the nation's centerpiece for National Adoption Day on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   After all, this is the place where she was adopted as a baby. It's
the place where, on Saturday, she gained a giggling 2-year-old
adopted brother. And it's the place where other dreams come true,
like the chance the 16-year-old aspiring singer had to try out for
the TV show "American Idol" last Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Acker, 16, is a proud member of a multicultural Pasadena family of
two parents, two biological and three adopted children.</LD>
<TE>   The Acker clan joined more than 200 Los Angeles County families at
the Edmund D. Edelman Children's Court in Monterey Park on Saturday
morning, as they finalized adoptions and celebrated the event with
Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson,
actor Bruce Willis and actress Rhea Perlman.</TE>
<TE>   Willis, who was appointed by President Bush as the national
spokesman on children in foster care, said he may have saved the
world numerous times on the big screen, but the real heroes are
parents who adopt.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time a child is adopted it makes a difference," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In order to speed up the legal process, which can often take
months, social workers, families, children, attorneys and judges
assemble at the courthouse on Adoption Saturday, a Los Angeles
tradition since 1998, when it was launched by the county.</TE>
<TE>   The county is home to the nation's largest foster care system,
with more than 33,000 children. In the last four years, 5,000 foster
children have found permanent families through the Saturday program.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles idea caught on and soon became the model for
National Adoption Day, which was celebrated in 34 cities Saturday.
More than 1,400 adoptions were completed. But nearly 131,000 foster
children across the country are still waiting for permanent families.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson outlined the federal government's push to boost adoption
rates. The Bush administration recently launched a $4-million
initiative to eliminate barriers to adopting children with special
needs. It also launched a Web site in July that provides photographs
and information about children who need families, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the courthouse Saturday toddlers wore two-piece suits, children
clutched donated teddy bears and anxious families anticipated court
hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Acker, along with her family, waited for the adoption proceedings
for 2-year-old Charles.</TE>
<TE>   Her now seven-member family is a mishmash of ethnic backgrounds,
ages and personalities.</TE>
<TE>   The children's father, Stephen Acker, is a Pasadena attorney and
their mother, Debbie Jones, is an ex-stockbroker who left her job a
couple of years ago to spend more time with the family.</TE>
<TE>   "It's stressful, like any family," Jones said. "It's kind of like
a factory; we make lots of lunches and do lots of laundry."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the couple encouraged other families to follow in
their path.</TE>
<TE>   They adopted Eddie, 14, as a baby. He was born to Honduran
parents, but his mother died from cancer and his father was never
around.</TE>
<TE>   They have two biological children, Stephen Jr., also 14, and
Amelia, 18, a UC Irvine student.</TE>
<TE>   Thea, adopted from Argentine parents, loves hip-hop, writing fairy
tales and listening to singer Mariah Carey.</TE>
<TE>   The latest addition, Charles, is a beefy, multiracial toddler
whose mother gave him up because her lifestyle wasn't fit for raising
a child.</TE>
<TE>   Thea said she hopes to help her younger brother understand some of
the confusion surrounding adoption. For example, peers at school may
question why he looks different from his parents, or may claim he's
not true to his ethnicity, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She knows, because it has happened to her.</TE>
<TE>   "I get made fun of because I am Latina but I grew up with white
parents," she said. "They call me 'white girl.' "</TE>
<TE>   She said she will also explain to him that parents should not be
defined by a biological relationship, but rather by who raised you.</TE>
<TE>   In the courtroom on Saturday morning, Judge Anthony Trendacosta
announced, "The name of this child should henceforth be 'Charles
Franklin Acker.' I'm signing the petition of order."</TE>
<TE>   Holding a teddy bear and sitting on his new mother's lap, little
Charles shrieked, "Mama!"</TE>

<HD>Scores Lag in Higher Grades</HD>
<DH>Some high school students see the problem as one of
priorities.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>By most measures, Dana Hills High School would be the envy of any
educator. The Dana Point campus in Orange County sends 95% of its
graduates to colleges. Many of its students are enrolled in advanced
courses, and their Scholastic Assessment Test scores are among the
highest in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   But there's one target Dana Hills failed to make this year: the
state's Academic Performance Index, the main accountability measure
that California is using for public schools.</LD>
<LD>   The school needed to improve its score by one point above last
year's to meet its state-set target. Instead, Dana Hills' API dropped
22 points to 775. That still is a respectable score, putting Dana
Hills in the top 20% of public high schools.</LD>
<TE>   Yet the drop is consistent with lackluster API performance at most
California high schools, a trend educators would like to reverse.
Only 43% of high schools met their API targets this year, compared
with 74% of elementary schools.</TE>
<TE>   But the reasons for the lower scores are complex. At Dana Hills,
students and educators say, scores dropped, not because the students
learned less but because they cared less. It's one more set of tests
for already busy high school students, and it has little bearing on
their grades or college aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   "I do enjoy high school, but [there] is so much work," said A.J.
Dronkers, 16, a Dana Hills junior. "If you were given a test at work
and it didn't really influence anything, would you care? It is just a
state test."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, API scores vary widely from high school to high school;
from the state's highest -- 964 points for Gretchen Whitney High in
Cerritos -- to the lowest -- 380 points for Oakland's McClymonds
Senior High. The maximum possible score is 1,000, the minimum 200.
And each school has a precise target to meet, depending on its scores
the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   But whether they are at the top or the bottom of the state
rankings, California high schools seem to be having a harder time
improving their scores. On average, elementary schools increased
their APIs more than 15 points this year. Middle schools increased an
average of nearly 6 points. High schools improved less than 4 points,
on average. Tests are required for students in second through 11th
grades.</TE>
<TE>   Education officials say the gap is partially the result of the
state's devoting greater resources to primary grades in recent years.
Measures have included a mandated class-size reduction that has
brought the student-teacher ratio down to 20-to-1.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that many early-grade classrooms are showing
significantly improved performance.</TE>
<TE>   Jammed classes in upper grades may be a factor. But reliance on
API scores, which are based on students' performance on standardized
tests such as the Stanford 9 and the California Standards Test, while
helpful in flagging failing schools, may not be a sufficient measure
for high school students, educators say.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much that is asked of [high school] students when it
comes to tests," said Dana Hills Assistant Principal Adam Ochwat.
"They are constantly asking themselves, 'Which ones do I gear up
for?' "</TE>
<TE>   Not API-related tests, evidently.</TE>
<TE>   A recent state analysis of scores on the Stanford 9 -- a test that
until last year was the sole component in API calculations -- showed
that performance tends to lag or even drop as students enter high
school.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, 43% of California second-graders were performing at or
above the national average in math. When those same students reached
sixth grade, 60% of them were hitting that mark. By comparison, 46%
of sixth-graders scored at or above the national average in math in
1998. By 10th grade, the same group showed no improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the problem is that, in early grades, the tests are much
more aligned with what students are learning," such as basic math and
language skills, said Paul Warren, deputy superintendent of
accountability for the state Department of Education. "But by the
time kids get to high school, their curriculums are much more varied
and it is harder to test them."</TE>
<TE>   In the spring, when principals and teachers are preparing for the
state tests, some coax their students with pep rallies and popcorn
parties to psych them up for grueling sessions that can last as long
as nine hours.</TE>
<TE>   At Dana Hills, teachers noticed that some of the brightest
students were still blowing off the tests, Ochwat said. So last
spring, school officials promised to share with the student body any
cash awards the state gave for meeting its API targets. Scores jumped
48 points.</TE>
<TE>   But with the state in a budget crisis, those awards have been
curtailed. And the once-promised cash prizes for teachers of
high-performing schools have been eliminated, along with any future
awards for the schools. Dana Hills is still waiting for about
$150,000 it earned for last year's gains.</TE>
<TE>   "It is just irresponsible to make promises that they can't keep,"
said Sarah Rodgers, 15, a sophomore. She also grumbled that some
students who raised the scores last year already have graduated and
won't see any benefit. High school administrators say they sympathize
with the students. But for the schools, the scores do matter. Many
parents see them as a measure of how schools are doing. Moreover,
campuses that consistently fall behind risk state sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   "We stress to students that the colleges are going to look at the
reputation of the schools they are applying from," said Michael
Leininger, principal at La Canada High School, which has bucked the
trend and increased its scores every year.</TE>
<TE>   "We also spread the tests over five days [instead of the typical
three days at many schools]. There is only so much their brains can
take before they start making little patterns on the test sheets."</TE>

<HD>Parley Baer, 88; 64-Year Career Spanned Radio, TV, Movies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parley Baer, a durable character actor whose six-decade career
encompassed more than 60 motion pictures, 1,600 television shows and
an amazing 15,000 radio programs including the original version of
"Gunsmoke," has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   The actor, who worked steadily from the early 1930s to the
mid-1990s, died Friday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital
in Woodland Hills of complications from a stroke suffered Nov. 11. A
resident of Tarzana, Baer had had a major stroke in 1997 that
affected his speech and ended his acting career.</LD>
<LD>   Baer's name never became a household word, but his face and voice
were familiar to millions of listeners and viewers over several
generations. A burly, balding man of substance, he played authority
figures such as judges, lawmen and mayors -- he was Mayor Stoner of
Mayberry on "The Andy Griffith Show."</LD>
<TE>   But he was also the voice of the Keebler cookie elf in television
commercials and from 1955 to 1961 appeared as Ozzie Nelson's neighbor
Darby in "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet."</TE>
<TE>   Although Baer appeared in the 1995 film "Last of the Dogmen"
starring Tom Berenger, his last memorable big-screen role was as the
Senate majority leader in the 1993 film "Dave," starring Kevin Kline
as a presidential look-alike.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, Baer began a long-running role as senior citizen
Miles Dugan on the daytime soap "The Young and the Restless." Baer
and other veterans were brought in when producers realized their
afternoon audiences included increasing numbers of elderly viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "I admire them for doing this," Baer, then 78, told The Times in
1993, "and I hope it will bring to light the fact that people who
have reached the zenith of 65 or more are not through."</TE>
<TE>   On television, Baer most recently had a role in a segment of "Star
Trek: Voyager" shown in 1996. But he was also on the small screen in
the early days in such series as "Dragnet," "Lassie," "Father Knows
Best," "I Love Lucy," "You Are There" and "Perry Mason."</TE>
<TE>   But for Baer, radio came even before films and television. He
first went on the air in 1933.</TE>
<TE>   "Radio is the most nearly perfect medium for an actor," Baer told
The Times in 1994 when he was playing Tweedledum opposite William
Windom's Tweedledee in a production of "Alice in Wonderland" by the
California Artists Radio Theatre. "It's kind of a hackneyed phrase,
'Theater of the mind,' but it really is: If you have an audience of 5
million people listening to you, you're giving 5 million
performances."</TE>
<TE>   From 1952 to 1961, Baer was the voice of Chester Proudfoot, deputy
to William Conrad's Marshal Matt Dillon on radio's "Gunsmoke." (When
the western sauntered to television in 1955, Dennis Weaver played the
deputy to James Arness' Dillon.)</TE>
<TE>   Baer was the manservant Rene to Carleton Young's Edmond Dantes on
late-1940s radio's "The Count of Monte Cristo," and among his other
credits were such radio standards as "Lux Radio Theater," "Screen
Directors' Playhouse," "Cisco Kid," "Red Ryder," "My Friend Irma" and
"My Favorite Husband," starring Lucille Ball.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Salt Lake City, Baer studied drama at the University of
Utah and began working as an actor, director and producer for local
radio station KSL.</TE>
<TE>   As a sideline, he served as publicist and ringmaster for circuses,
traveling with Circus Vargas and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. In 1946, he
met and married aerialist and bareback rider Ernestine Clarke. She
died two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Baer, who served in the Army Air Force during World War II, moved
to Los Angeles in 1947 and the next year was a founding actor in
Peggy Webber's anthology show for KFI-TV.</TE>
<TE>   The actor kept in touch with circus folk and with animals as a
participant in the Paul Eagles' Circus Luncheon Club, which raised
money to entertain patients at Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in
Downey. Baer also trained and worked with lions and tigers for a time
at the now-defunct Jungleland compound in Thousand Oaks, served on
the board of the community L.A. Circus, and was a docent at the Los
Angeles Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by two daughters, Kim Baer and Dale Sloan; and
three grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Bridge's Paint Job Loses Its Sparkle</HD>
<DH>Metallic gold was Sacramentans' choice in Caltrans voting.
Now, most see only red.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Warren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>There are times when we must pity the bureaucrats. This is one of
those times.</LD>
<LD>   In a display of civic-minded enlightenment, the folks at Caltrans
last year invited Sacramentans to pick a new paint color for their
beloved Tower Bridge, one of the capital's most visible landmarks.</LD>
<LD>   The winning hue -- topping two other choices -- was metallic gold.
It seemed fitting, locals said, given Sacramento's storied Gold Rush
past.</LD>
<TE>   But like the candidate who looks smashing on the campaign trail
and disappoints once in office, the new color is drawing less than
favorable reviews.</TE>
<TE>   "Pukey mustard," Doris Turner calls it.</TE>
<TE>   "Awful, terrible, disgusting," laments Rod Lorenzi.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Kitt had a physical reaction while driving up Interstate
5, confessing he had to "choke back lunch" when he saw the bridge.</TE>
<TE>   R.E. Graswich, a columnist at the Sacramento Bee, is leading a
crusade against the new color, which he calls an insult to the River
City's tableau. Reader mail about the bridge, Graswich says, is
running 3-to-1 against.</TE>
<TE>   "The Tower Bridge is one of the best things about Sacramento. It's
our Golden Gate; it's all we've got!" he railed in an interview. "And
now look at it. We can't let this stand."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials acknowledge the grousing, but insist they've
received lots of positive feedback as well.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the color was chosen by the people, fair and square --
the first time the transportation agency has used direct democracy to
guide their work.</TE>
<TE>   "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder," said David Anderson, a
Caltrans spokesman. "You can't please everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not, but next to the famed Capitol dome, the Tower Bridge
is Sacramento's most visible icon.</TE>
<TE>   So it's not surprising that emotions are running high.</TE>
<TE>   Stretching 737 feet across the Sacramento River, the bridge --
built during the Great Depression -- serves as the western portal to
downtown. Its 110-foot twin towers, illuminated by spotlights at
night, are among the most prominent pinnacles on the region's
pancake-flat plain.</TE>
<TE>   The bridge also makes for great theater. Locals and tourists alike
delight in watching its center span rise to allow tall-masted
sailboats and paddle-wheelers to pass underneath.</TE>
<TE>   Sensing the city's ardor for the bridge, Caltrans Director Jeff
Morales thought a public vote on a new color was in order.</TE>
<TE>   Three potential color schemes were offered up -- the metallic
gold, a green-silver-gold combination, and a burgundy-silver-gold
ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Residents within a 35-mile radius were invited to vote over the
Internet or by phone. More than 43,000 weighed in, and gold won
handily.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 10 months, crews have sandblasted the bridge and
applied primer and two coats of finish paint. It reopens to traffic
this week.</TE>
<TE>   Civic leaders are trying to be charitable, but they are not overly
enthusiastic about the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Dalldorf, chief of staff for Sacramento Mayor Heather Fargo,
calls the daytime hue "not the vibrant gold the community thought it
would be," based on the sample Caltrans supplied.</TE>
<TE>   That said, "the nighttime effect is tremendous," Dalldorf
observed. "It looks tremendous and lustrous with the lights on it,
and that was very important to the city."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the river, in West Sacramento, outgoing City
Councilman Jim Cahill calls the hue "a shade too yellow and a bit too
glittery for my taste. But I guess it was the people's choice."</TE>
<TE>   Others were less sanguine. An informal lunch-hour survey by The
Times, conducted near the bridge, yielded not one positive comment
about the color -- and several unprintable ones.</TE>
<TE>   Though most critics said the new shade was better than the tired
old ochre it replaced, few expected the final result.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be shimmery, something that glistens," said
park planner Wayne Woodroof, whose office sits at the east end of the
bridge. "This is splotchy, without much gloss."</TE>
<TE>   Juan Perez, gazing up at the span while strolling the riverfront,
said he figured he was looking at the primer.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the final coat? It's a historic structure, a place of
grandeur," Perez said glumly. "It deserves better."</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzi's office sits in the shadow of the bridge, and he would
have preferred "pink, green, neon, anything" to the hue Caltrans
applied.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a disgrace," Lorenzi said, "but I heard they're repainting
it."</TE>
<TE>   That's wishful thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans, which spent $3.5 million on the project, said the
three-coat paint job will last at least 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   At least one resident, public relations man Doug Elmets, remains
optimistic:</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it hasn't completely dried," he said hopefully. "It may
look putrid now, but over time, perhaps the patina will come
through."</TE>

<LD>Lawyers for the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. will
continue negotiations on Monday to try to end a dispute between the
organization's embattled president, Cody Cluff, and its executive
committee.</LD>
<LD>   The committee decided to put Cluff on a paid leave Friday, pending
the outcome of a criminal probe by the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Cluff is being investigated for alleged misuse of public funds.
Cluff refused to accept the committee's decision on the advice of
lawyers, who said that proper parliamentary procedures hadn't been
followed in making the decision.</LD>

<HD>Legislators Letting Davis Lead on Budget</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Three years ago, when times were good and the state budget was awash
in surplus, Gov. Gray Davis summed up the Legislature's role in
dismissive fashion. "Their job," he said then, "is to implement my
vision."</LD>
<LD>   Now, with California confronting a projected budget deficit of $21
billion and painful spending cuts unavoidable, Democratic and
Republican legislators alike seem content to honor the governor's
wish.</LD>
<LD>   Davis weighed in on the looming budget mess Thursday -- 16 days
after winning reelection to a second term -- by requesting a special
legislative session to begin Dec. 9. He promised legislators a
package of $5 billion in cuts and other savings, but offered no
specifics.</LD>
<TE>   Legislative leaders, distrustful of Davis and deeply divided along
party lines, are saying little, preferring to let the governor define
the agenda for the unpleasant work ahead. Their plan for the moment:
Let Davis take the lead and any early heat for making hard choices.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody's going to move until Gray Davis says,
'This is my cut list,' " said retiring Assemblyman Bill Leonard
(R-San Bernardino), elected to the State Board of Equalization
earlier this month. "He's under a burden to show a complete plan."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the midyear fixes in the 2002-03 budget, Davis has
until Jan. 10 to give the Legislature a balanced budget for 2003-04.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats hold commanding majorities in both houses of the
Legislature. But Davis will need at least five Republicans in the
Assembly and two in the Senate to reach the two-thirds majority
required to pass a budget -- and those votes will be hard to come by,
legislators in both parties warn.</TE>
<TE>   Ominously, there isn't a hint of common ground in the Legislature:
Republicans say spending cuts alone should solve the problem, while
Democrats say the only solution is a mix of cuts and tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not going to balance this budget on poor people, seniors
and people that are disabled," said Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson
(D-Culver City). "If the Republicans truly believe this budget can be
balanced with cuts and cuts alone, we will not go quietly into the
night on this."</TE>
<TE>   Wesson noted that former Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, addressed
a similar budget crisis in 1991 with a mix of tax increases and
spending cuts.</TE>
<TE>   But just as Democrats feel obligated to preserve programs that
benefit their core supporters, Republicans face intense pressure from
their constituents and conservative interest groups to oppose any new
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks says he and his
GOP colleagues in the lower house won't support a tax increase under
any circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard agrees, saying it's a "foregone conclusion" that Assembly
Republicans will never support a budget that raises taxes.</TE>
<TE>   That reflects a core Republican conviction -- that higher taxes
will hurt the state's economy -- as well as a hard political
calculation: that voting to raise taxes will expose Republican
legislators to possible defeat by conservative challengers in the
next GOP primary.</TE>
<TE>   If Cox is true to his word -- and this year's budget debate
suggests that his anti-tax vow is more than mere posturing -- Davis
and the Legislature face a long, bitter year ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said Thursday that he will freeze as much government
spending as possible as a first step toward addressing the budget
gap.</TE>
<TE>   He wouldn't give legislative leaders or reporters further details
on how he plans to achieve $5 billion in savings.</TE>
<TE>   But, if Davis heeds the recommendation of nonpartisan Legislative
Analyst Elizabeth Hill and others, he will ask legislators to
"recapture" $1.9 billion in education spending -- the amount by which
the 2002-03 budget exceeds the required state support to public
education under voter-approved Proposition 98.</TE>
<TE>   The expected fight over whether to pull back the $1.9 billion will
be a preview of countless conflicts in the struggle to cut billions
from the budget, legislators and other experts warn.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, a number of Democrats and Republicans say they support
such a move, but they fear the consequences when they face
reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably the easiest way to get that much money in one vote,
but I don't know whether it's doable or not," Leonard said. "I would
rather do health and welfare cuts before I do education cuts. No
elected official wants to be portrayed as anti-education."</TE>
<TE>   Legislators who might be inclined to support the move will face
opposition from powerful organizations such as the California
Teachers Assn., just one of many groups already gearing up to defend
their interests.</TE>
<TE>   "Education is the last place where we should be cutting right
now," said CTA spokeswoman Becky Zoglman.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to searching for spending cuts, Democrats are widely
expected to use the December special session to restore vehicle
license fees to 1998 levels, which could raise about $3.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   A number of other proposals for increasing taxes are popular among
Democrats, from an increase in the high-end personal income tax
bracket to new taxes on tobacco. But beyond the license fee, any
additional tax increase will require Republican support to reach the
required two-thirds margin of approval, and that isn't likely to come
anytime soon, Democrats and Republicans say.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, in fact, say Davis and the Democrats must
dramatically slash state spending before they will even consider what
experts say will be the ultimate solution needed to eliminate the
final billions in the budget gap: either short-term borrowing or a
tax increase.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats, however, are determined to make it hard for
Republicans to hold fast to that position. Specifically, they are
moving to generate political heat from the left against those who
slash popular programs.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Leader John Burton of San Francisco, an influential and
outspoken liberal, proposes holding hearings around the state to
gauge public support for the cuts being demanded by Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling is: Work with everybody who's going to be asked to
take a whack," Burton said. "We're going to be looking at anything
and everything."</TE>
<TE>   Such hearings would undoubtedly focus public attention and anger
on the pain that proposed cuts would cause, and give Democrats an
opportunity to build a case for raising taxes.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, anyway, as Davis and his staff cull through the
budget in search of savings, most legislators seem willing to let the
spotlight shine on the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his first term, Davis has prided himself on his
cautious, incremental approach to solving the state's problems, a
style that some legislators and others say will not lend itself to
conquering a budget deficit that threatens to reach historic
dimensions in the coming months.</TE>
<TE>   Davis is up to the challenge, said deputy press secretary Hilary
McLean.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is: Is he going to be joined in that challenge by
Republicans?" she said. "We're going to need the full participation
of all the elected leaders in the state, because it's just too big of
a problem. Sitting on the sidelines is not going to serve the people
of California."</TE>

<HD>Church Reopens Stronger Since '99 Fire</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With a symphony of song and splashes of holy oil, historic St. Thomas
the Apostle Catholic Church was blessed and officially reopened
Saturday after being destroyed in an arson fire more than three years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   For the congregation of mostly working-class Central American
immigrants, the Mass of dedication -- celebrated mostly in Spanish by
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony -- signaled the return of what members
described as their second home, source of strength and spiritual
refuge.</LD>
<LD>   Before an overflow crowd of more than 1,000, the cardinal and
others anointed the circular wooden altar and walls with oil and
perfumed the church with incense, marking the moment of its official
blessing.</LD>
<TE>   But the blessings showered on the venerable old church in the
Pico-Union district of Los Angeles began long before Saturday's
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   According to St. Thomas Pastor Jarlath Cunnane, they started
shortly after he woke up on that startling morning in June 1999 to
see flames leaping through the roof of the 99-year-old church, one of
the oldest in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In the long three years of rebuilding, of bureaucratic delays and
the seemingly overwhelming task of raising $2 million, unexpected
gifts of generosity appeared and reappeared like miracles to keep the
congregation's spirits high.</TE>
<TE>   The new church retains its historic twin domed towers topped with
crosses. But a wing has been added, doubling the capacity to 950. New
windows symbolizing the Holy Trinity and the Latino culture of most
of the congregants were designed by Father Donie Keohane, an artist
and pastor at St. Martin of Tours in Brentwood.</TE>
<TE>   "In many ways, we're more blessed now than when we started,"
Cunnane said. "We have a new and bigger church, and a wider circle of
friends and supporters. We've certainly realized that church is not a
building; it is us, the people."</TE>
<TE>   Contributions came from major donors like Palos Verdes Peninsula
resident Mary Centofante, whose still-cherished memories five decades
after graduating from St. Thomas Elementary School prompted her to
donate $200,000 to build a new Blessed Sacrament chapel inside the
church.</TE>
<TE>   Living the faith is not about "how often you go to Mass, but what
you do to help people," Centofante said in explaining her gift, which
she donated in memory of her husband, Albert.</TE>
<TE>   But half of the needed funds came in myriad small donations, many
from parishioners whose average annual income of $14,000 skirts the
poverty line, said St. Thomas' director of development, Joe Neeb.</TE>
<TE>   The congregation of 8,000 families comes from most of the
countries in Latin America, and also includes a sprinkling of whites,
blacks, Filipinos and Koreans.</TE>
<TE>   There was the woman who scrimped savings from housecleaning wages
and one day pressed into Cunnane's hand a napkin containing 10 crisp
$100 bills.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Antonio Arias, the church's 47-year-old custodian, said he
can't afford to eat out at restaurants or take vacations -- but he
figured he's probably given $1,000 in small bills here and there over
three years to rebuild his church.</TE>
<TE>   There was nearby Loyola High School, which offered the use of its
recently purchased warehouse to serve as the congregation's temporary
home.</TE>
<TE>   After the fire -- whose suspected perpetrator was arrested in a
mental ward and deemed unfit to stand for trial, Cunnane said --
parishioners quickly set up a tent in the parking lot and held
services there for six months beginning that evening.</TE>
<TE>   Not one Mass was missed, and when it came to events unsuitable for
a parking lot -- such as some weddings and funerals -- other parishes
and nearby St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral offered their
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The rebuilding project also touched people outside the parish in
unexpected ways.</TE>
<TE>   There was the man who repaired the church's damaged art work and
later stopped by unannounced to tell Cunnane of the blessings the
project had brought to his life.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out, Cunnane said, that the man's father had been head
of the Orange Lodge, an anti-Catholic organization in Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   "This man told me he saw the job as a labor of reconciliation for
all of the conflict of the past," Cunnane said.</TE>
<TE>   Noel Diaz, a longtime parishioner and founder of the El Sembrador
evangelical ministry, said he and others were initially challenged by
the task of mobilizing people to move beyond the shock many felt.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to live what we preach: forgiveness," he said. "There was
a lot of grief and anger."</TE>
<TE>   By early Saturday, however, the church was enveloped in a buoyant,
festive atmosphere. Along one wall, several women taped up a colorful
banner proclaiming "We give thanks to God! Demos Gracias Al Senor!"</TE>
<TE>   Colorful balloons and flags representing the homelands of the
parishioners adorned the front of the church.</TE>
<TE>   Across Pico Avenue, the church youth group had hand-painted a
portrait of the church as a backdrop for mariachi and marimba
performers scheduled for after-Mass festivities.</TE>
<TE>   Parishioners arrived hours before the 1:30 p.m. service, spilling
out of the parking lot and lining up halfway down the block.</TE>
<TE>   Among them was Gloria Vilma Franco, 45, a North Hollywood resident
and Salvadoran immigrant who trekked on foot to the United States
through the mountains of Mexico and arrived here in 1976 with only
the clothes on her back.</TE>
<TE>   She said St. Thomas parishioners welcomed her, helped her find a
job and study to become a citizen. She even met her husband, Rafael,
at church.</TE>
<TE>   "What we leave in our countries, we find here," Franco said of the
parish. "It is our faith, it is our home, it is our everything."</TE>

<LD>When workers at City Hall and businesses such as Disney Travel and
Wells Fargo Bank go home, downtown Anaheim becomes a study in
silence. Traffic is sparse, pedestrians are few.</LD>
<LD>   But city officials plan within two years to transform downtown
into a bustling, vibrant civic and cultural center, not unlike the
historic core that was knocked down decades ago, in an era some
derisively call the "bulldozer years."</LD>
<LD>   Now, with so little original architecture left, builders face the
challenge of re-creating a downtown without turning it into something
better suited to Disneyland's Main Street.</LD>
<TE>   Downtown Anaheim's rebirth is riding on a recently approved
$65-million endeavor by CIM Group, the developer that helped
revitalize Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, Old Pasadena and
downtown Brea.</TE>
<TE>   "This project is the cornerstone of making the entire downtown
plan work," said city Redevelopment Director Elisa Stipkovich. "We
have the work force down here, but we don't have the residents right
in the civic center. We don't have the critical mass we need."</TE>
<TE>   To turn things around, the city needs people living downtown who
will patronize local businesses to buy a cappuccino in the morning,
drop off their dry cleaning and maybe pick up some Chinese food after
work.</TE>
<TE>   In the six acres that line West Broadway between South Anaheim and
South Harbor boulevards, the city and CIM are planning an
80,000-square-foot library, a parking structure, about 500 one- and
two-bedroom apartments, lofts and shops.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, at 5 o'clock, that place is shut down. There's nobody
there. It's literally empty," said CIM Group principal Shaul Kuba.
"The key question for us is, how do you bring some life into it?"</TE>
<TE>   Their task won't be easy. For starters, they have almost nothing
to work with, with the exception of the Carnegie Library, one of the
last old buildings downtown.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, downtown activists have a vision of what they want
and an even clearer idea of what they don't want. These are the same
activists who use words like "rape" and "pillage" to describe the
city's approach to downtown redevelopment in the 1970s and '80s, when
dozens of buildings were knocked down.</TE>
<TE>   Cynthia Ward, vice president of the Anaheim Historical Society,
has pored over dozens of photos in an effort to document what used to
be: neo-classic revival gems like Martinette's Hardware and the
Pickwick Hotel, which was listed on the National Registry of Historic
Places when it was bulldozed in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown Anaheim "essentially looked like Colorado Boulevard in
Pasadena," Ward said.</TE>
<TE>   But in binders filled with the pictures are also snapshots of
rubble, piles of brick and facades of historic buildings -- including
the old City Hall -- that were eventually razed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have people all over town who have pieces of those buildings
as garden art," Ward said. "So CIM has a very tall order. They need
to make us forget that."</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists detest some of what the city has done already.
The new buildings, such as City Hall, are glass and metal. "City Hall
looks like a bank tower. It doesn't blend at all," said Jim Collison
of the Anaheim Historical Society.</TE>
<TE>   Stipkovich said the city has made it clear to CIM that design
needs to be sensitive to landmark structures such as the Carnegie
Library and Kraemer Building, as well as the neighboring Anaheim
Colony, a community filled with Craftsman bungalows and Colonial
Revival homes.</TE>
<TE>   Although the CIM project is the most significant, several others
are underway. The seven-story Kraemer Building, with a rooftop
penthouse, is being renovated for office space and apartments.
Residents will start moving in after Christmas. John Laing Homes is
building about 50 historic-theme homes on nearby Santa Ana Street.</TE>
<TE>   City staff has held dozens of meetings with downtown groups and
plans to continue seeking opinions on the shape of the buildings,
construction materials and other aspects of the project.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel we have to reach out to them ... and they see the project
every step of the way so that there are no surprises at the end,"
Stipkovich said.</TE>
<TE>   The first architectural renderings will be presented to the City
Council for review in 30 to 40 days.</TE>
<TE>   Kuba said he hopes they will start work on the first building in
six months, with subsequent groundbreakings every six months.</TE>
<TE>   CIM Group, which has a track record of historically sensitive
projects that also include San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter, will use
different architects for each major parcel to prevent a cookie-cutter
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think going back and copying buildings is the right
answer," Kuba said. "What you want to do is go back, look at the
stuff and what was there and try to be respectful.... Otherwise,
you're creating a theme park."</TE>

<LD>Ventura County has joined a long list of California counties that
were declared agricultural disaster areas because of damage sustained
during the current drought.</LD>
<LD>   Farmers and ranchers throughout the United States have been hard
hit, and many have been calling for federal aid.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman designated
counties in 10 states as disaster areas. The designation makes
farmers in those and neighboring counties eligible for low-interest
emergency loans and, in some cases, compensation for livestock
losses.</LD>

<HD>200 Gallons of 'Date Rape' Drug Seized</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An Anaheim man will be arraigned Monday on drug possession charges
stemming from a bust detectives believe may be one of the state's
largest seizures of GHB, known as the "date-rape" drug or "liquid
ecstasy," authorities said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Jorge Hodjers, 46, has been held on $100,000 bail at Orange County
Jail since his arrest Thursday. He has been charged with possession
of a controlled substance and possession of methamphetamine.</LD>
<LD>   Orange police detectives found 200 gallons of GHB, or gamma
hydroxybutyrate, and 1,000 yaba pills, which contain methamphetamine
and caffeine, at addresses in Orange and Santa Ana they said were
linked to Hodjers, Sgt. Bryan Meissner said.</LD>
<TE>   The GHB, found in concentrated form, had a wholesale value of
$59,000 but could have sold for as much as $500,000 on the street.
The yaba tablets had a street value of $10,000, Meissner said.</TE>
<TE>   Yaba, Thai for "crazy medicine," creates an effect similar to that
of crack cocaine. GHB lowers inhibitions and also is used as a
body-building supplement.</TE>

<HD>Needy No Strangers to New Councilman</HD>
<DH>Gabino Aguirre of Santa Paula says his campaign focus
sharpened when he met poor Latinos and recognized himself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Gabino Aguirre was on the campaign trail, there were times when
his reasons for running for office snapped into sharp focus.</LD>
<LD>   Like others in this month's Santa Paula City Council race, he
wanted to put the brakes on development, spiff up the timeworn
downtown and pump new life into the city's sagging economy.</LD>
<LD>   But it was while going door to door in the town's poorest
pockets--neighborhoods where the residents are largely Latino and
generally underrepresented--that he knew why he had to run, and run
hard.</LD>
<TE>   "When I'd see these folks just getting home from work or coming up
from the river bottom, where many of them live, to look for work, I
could see myself," said Aguirre, 56, an up-by-the-bootstraps
continuation high school principal whose farm worker family was
shaped by similar circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing about canvassing the community is that you see
the need; you see people living in hard, hard conditions," said
Aguirre, who has lived in Santa Paula for 30 years. "I thought it was
important to give those areas of our city a voice."</TE>
<TE>   Long Hours, Clear Goal</TE>
<TE>   And so he has, capturing 20% of the vote in the Nov. 5 election
and coming out on top of a field of seven candidates in his first run
for public office.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre said he did it by working long hours after finishing his
day at Moorpark Community High School, stumping in old neighborhoods
graced by stately Victorians and newer ones boasting luxury homes.</TE>
<TE>   He did it by laying out a clear vision for Santa Paula's future
and by being able to stack his academic credentials--a master's
degree from USC, a doctorate from UCLA--against all comers.</TE>
<TE>   And he did it by relying on what he calls his reality credential,
the expertise that comes from growing up poor and stooping in the
fields, life experiences he believes are meaningful to most residents
in the working-class farm town of 29,000.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a tremendous success story," said community leader Jesse
Ornelas, who urged Aguirre to run for office and worked to get him
elected. "I think people saw [that] here was someone with smarts,
someone with leadership qualities and someone who would make a fine
role model. That resonated very well in our community."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre's victory solidifies the emergence of a slow-growth bloc
on the council at a time when many were questioning the city's
development priorities.</TE>
<TE>   It also could help lift a cloud of racial tension that has plagued
the city in recent years, bubbling over two years ago in a U.S.
Department of Justice lawsuit alleging that the city's at-large
voting system had discriminated against Latino candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just really looking for a vision of what this town could be
and should be," Aguirre said. "I just thought I could be a true
hometown representative."</TE>
<TE>   School a Luxury</TE>
<TE>   Born to migrant farm worker parents in Mexico, Aguirre was the
fifth of 12 children and the first to graduate from high school,
despite having started work at an early age.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in the barrios of dusty Texas towns, he picked crops
and fed chickens to help the family survive.</TE>
<TE>   But he never had to quit school altogether, a luxury his older
siblings didn't have.</TE>
<TE>   "When you grow up in a large family like that, the older siblings
are obligated to work as a matter of survival," Aguirre said. "By the
time it came around to me, the need wasn't as great and it provided
me the opportunity to focus on schoolwork."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre made the most of it. He skipped two grades in elementary
school and graduated high school with honors in Arizona. Years later,
after stints at a Fresno business college and in the Army, he
enrolled at UCLA and worked nights as a janitor to put himself
through school.</TE>
<TE>   He graduated in 1974 with a bachelor's degree in sociology and
three years later earned a master's in education at USC. He returned
to UCLA for a doctorate in social science/comparative education. He
graduated in the spring on the day his son, Armando, 23, earned his
bachelor's degree from the same school.</TE>
<TE>   In between, Aguirre established a pair of cultural arts centers in
Santa Paula, headed a countywide farm worker education project,
launched a program to keep kids out of gangs and wrote a grant that
founded what would become Clinicas del Camino Real, a nonprofit group
of health clinics for rural families.</TE>
<TE>   He also was married, raised two children and held down a job,
first as a teacher in Moorpark and then as a principal.</TE>
<TE>   His was always so busy that he gave little thought to suggestions
that he run for office.</TE>
<TE>   Late Decision to Run</TE>
<TE>   But that changed in the summer when Councilwoman Laura Flores
Espinosa missed a filing deadline for incumbents seeking reelection,
forcing her to run as a write-in candidate. Aguirre was serving as
one of Espinosa's campaign managers but decided at the eleventh hour
to put his name on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly seemed like the right thing to do under the
circumstances," said Espinosa, whose reelection bid fell well short.
"He is going to be absolutely the best City Council person. He is
very well-grounded, sure of who he is and what his role is."</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre has been busy since election day learning his new job
while tending to his old one at the 120-student continuation high
school, which gives youngsters who have fallen behind a shot at a
high school diploma. Few of the students knew of his candidacy or his
political success.</TE>
<TE>   It is exactly the way Aguirre wants it, saying his role as an
elected official has little to do with his job of encouraging
youngsters to achieve, tapping them on the shoulder, asking how they
are doing and telling them he would be proud to one day hand them a
diploma.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes back to why we do this," Aguirre said of public service.
"It's not to toot my own horn; it's to take care of business."</TE>

<HD>Cornucopia of Donations Available to the Poor</HD>
<DH>From toothbrushes to toys, a resource bank offers excess
inventory, seized items to charities.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What to do with the cheeseheads was a real puzzler, admitted Anita
Morales -- and Morales, distribution manager for the nonprofit
Shelter Partnership, has had to contend with plenty of unusual offers
to the agency's donation center over the years.</LD>
<LD>   There were the hand-crank ice cream makers, deemed impractical for
the people -- most of them homeless and poor -- who benefit from the
center's largess. The inflatable rafts were also a no go. As was the
offer of a few tons of lumber.</LD>
<LD>   But the cheeseheads -- 12 cases of the foam headgear worn so
absurdly by Wisconsin football fans and other fashion-challenged
sportsters -- were accepted and given to an agency that helps
low-income families. They ended up as toys for needy kids.</LD>
<TE>   "That was an interesting project," said Morales, standing in the
shadows of the 80,000-square-foot warehouse in Bell that houses the
donation center. She was helping the warehouse supervisor, Jerry
Ayala, with the arrival of 74,000 hairbrushes donated by Procter &amp;
Gamble.</TE>
<TE>   The load -- about 500 cases -- would not be the largest in the
resource bank. A few yards away were 16 big-rig loads of
toothbrushes, and around the corner were 100,000 cases of personal
care items donated by Neutrogena.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, the group got about 750,000 razors from
Gillette, recalled Shelter Partnership Executive Director Ruth
Schwartz. "It was the first large-scale donation like that," she
said. "The razors were pink, but men will use pink razors if they
don't have anything else."</TE>
<TE>   The Shelter Partnership was formed in 1985 with the help of
then-Mayor Tom Bradley and the United Way to offer technical
assistance, research and resources to providers of services for
homeless and poor people in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, the partnership established the resource bank, a
clearinghouse for donated goods -- mostly excess inventory but also
confiscated merchandise and counterfeits -- that charitable agencies
can tap into without cost.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the resource bank achieved a milestone, having secured
since its opening $100 million worth of -- among other things -- new
clothing, toys, shampoo, blankets, dental floss, detergent, toilet
paper, mattresses, office supplies, bed linens, CDs, eyebrow pencils.
And, of course, the cheeseheads.</TE>
<TE>   The operation, run by donation manager Kris Ockershauser and four
warehouse employees, is daunting. The warehouse is part of a federal
complex and was constructed during World War II to store parts for
the Air Force, Schwartz said.</TE>
<TE>   A railroad line runs behind the building, but these days products
are delivered in trucks that rumble up to the large loading bays.</TE>
<TE>   Items are distributed quarterly, based on the needs of individual
agencies, which must be qualified, tax-exempt charities.</TE>
<TE>   A computerized inventory keeps track of what comes in and goes out
and the value of the merchandise. The charities must agree not to
resell or exchange the goods for money.</TE>
<TE>   This is important because the products are new, not used or
damaged castoffs.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago the group got 90,000 pairs of counterfeit Guess
jeans that could have retailed for thousands of dollars on the
street. It was able to distribute them with Guess' permission after a
tiny button with the fake label was snipped off.</TE>
<TE>   Once, the Los Angeles Police Department donated a load of quality
knock-off tuxedos, which were given to a local high school for youths
unable to afford graduation finery.</TE>
<TE>   The Shelter Partnership is talking to customs officials about more
confiscated clothing and other goods that would otherwise be
destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is also talking to port officials about items that --
because of the recent dockworker strike -- might be unloaded too late
to be sold for Christmas. Schwartz said the group had learned of a
shipment of Halloween costumes that sat on the docks and could, for
example, be stored for next year.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses that contribute inventory to the resource bank can
receive special tax benefits and free floor space for new inventory,
said Ricardo Villanueva Jr., president of G &amp; M Mattress &amp; Foam,
which donates unused mattresses each month.</TE>
<TE>   The resource bank is just across the railroad tracks from the
Commerce-based mattress company, whose founder -- Ricardo Sr. --
adopted the group and began throwing Christmas parties for homeless
kids.</TE>
<TE>   "The big deal is being able to see the face of people," said
Ricardo Jr. "You can donate as much as you want, but seeing the
reactions of people makes a big difference."</TE>
<TE>   The warehouse is like a cavernous thrift shop. Next to the stacked
mattresses are cases of blankets, boxes of stylish silver trash
canisters, children's comforters with Disney cartoon characters,
"Star Wars" action figures, even a case of Harley-Davidson motorcycle
bags.The center once got 700 sets of the Encyclopaedia Britannica
worth more than $1 million, which benefited school-age children at
several agencies.</TE>
<TE>   But for many, just a bottle of shampoo is a luxury.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to come in here and get something to keep my body
clean," said Carolyn Chappell, who was at the Downtown Women's Center
to get a bite and use the showers. She lives near skid row and
sometimes sleeps on the streets.The women get a kit of lotions, soap,
toothpaste and other items recently picked up from the resource bank.
"I especially love the shampoos and conditioners, because the make my
hair smooth and shiny," Chappell said.</TE>

<HD>Valley Teens Get Taste of Fire, Police Careers</HD>
<DH>Van Nuys graduation is held for 200 high school students
who complete 10-week programs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They could barely see from beneath the bulky helmets, and their
jacket sleeves drooped over their wrists, but these teens were too
serious to care how they looked.</LD>
<LD>   On command, they grabbed heavy hose lines and darted across the
main quad of Valley College in Valley Glen to show they had the right
stuff to be firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   The exhibition was part of a graduation ceremony Saturday for 200
San Fernando Valley high school students who completed 10-week
programs that introduced them to careers in fire and police services.</LD>
<TE>   And lest anyone think that brawn is better in those lines of work,
Los Angeles Fire Chief William Bamattre presented the trophy for the
best beginning fire cadet to Miguel Sandoval, who stands 4 feet, 11
inches and weighs 90 pounds. The 14-year-old Polytechnic High
freshman was singled out for his infectious gung-ho spirit.</TE>
<TE>   "Teamwork and cooperation are two things we teach that often are
crucial to getting the job done," Bamattre said. "Many of these kids
will not go on to careers in fire service or criminal justice, but
they learn skills they can use all their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Garcia, 17, a San Fernando High School senior who wants to
be a police officer, said self-discipline was the top skill he
learned. "Like, not to get angry with someone who's angry at me," he
said. "And to watch what I say."</TE>
<TE>   The 3-year-old program is jointly run by Valley College, the city
Fire Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the
Los Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids give up eight Saturdays to get hands-on training on
real equipment," program director John Burke said. "That alone is an
accomplishment."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said any high school student can sign up for the
academies, offered three times a year, if they're willing to commit
the time and energy. Many cadets return each year. Because the
program is still new and the participants young, Burke said, only one
previous graduate has obtained an emergency services job, which
usually requires courses beyond high school.</TE>
<TE>   As about 350 relatives and friends watched Saturday, cadets staged
a police response to a protest at an abortion clinic. While shouting,
"Stop abortion, let them live!" mock demonstrators were prodded away
from the clinic by a moving barricade of stoic cadets, marching
shoulder-to-shoulder with horizontally held plastic batons.</TE>
<TE>   Two-student teams also demonstrated how to place tall firefighting
ladders against buildings. It's not as easy as it looks, said Grigor
Konduralyan, 15, a Grant High sophomore who has long dreamed of being
a firefighter. "You have to learn to pay attention to more than one
thing going on. You can't accidentally knock someone over with a
ladder."</TE>
<TE>   San Fernando High sophomore Margarita Mariscal, 15, said learning
about the job first-hand from law officers dispelled any doubts she
had about becoming a deputy sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   "I want more than ever to keep other people safe in the
community," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bamattre noted that more than half of the 120 graduating fire
cadets were girls, though only 3% of Los Angeles city firefighters
are female. "We hope to use this to recruit more women," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Keynote speaker Caprice Young, president of the Los Angeles
Unified school board, said there are also academic benefits for the
students. "They see how things like chemistry, math and writing
really tie closely into success in our lives," she said.</TE>

<HD>Finding a Hafiz to Recite Koran Is a Godsend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sheik Hamad Ibrahim al Hadaad squeezes one eye shut, leans forward
and taps a leathery finger against his skull.</LD>
<LD>   "I am famous for my sharp memory," he says with a sly grin.
"Famous enough to be brought all the way to America."</LD>
<LD>   The 75-year-old, barefoot Egyptian rests before prayers in his
spartan bedroom at the Islamic Center of the Conejo Valley in
Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<TE>   Night after night, chapter by chapter, he recites the Koran from
memory. His voice, rich and melodious, has made the faithful go weak
in the knees and reduced grown men to tears.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no words to describe it, only feelings," he says. "It's
an act of love -- talking heart to heart with God."</TE>
<TE>   The sheik is a hafiz, someone who has memorized all 30 chapters of
the Koran and spent years perfecting its recitation. Part literature,
part poetry and part song, the haunting voice of the hafiz is the
ancient sound of Ramadan, a month celebrating the divine gift of the
Koran to Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   But locating a hafiz, which means "protector" in Arabic, is an
annual headache for American Muslims. With a relatively short history
in the U.S., mosques must fly in their hafizes from places like
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India and Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   There are only a handful of religious institutions in the country
preparing youngsters to become hafizes. One in Sacramento has just 10
students.</TE>
<TE>   At this rate, Muslim leaders say, it will be another generation
before they can readily enlist a home-grown hafiz for Ramadan.</TE>
<TE>   "We are struggling even to teach our children the rudiments of
Arabic, so turning them into a hafiz is not going to be easy," said
Mustafa Kuko, director of the Islamic Center of Riverside, which has
a Pakistani hafiz. "There is a demand for a hafiz in every mosque;
the demand is becoming greater and greater."</TE>
<TE>   A foreign hafiz gets free airfare and a small stipend along with
room and board in a mosque. Each day he leads prayers, and each night
he recites the Koran, finishing the more than 400 pages by the end of
the month. The recitations are always in Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year our hafiz was sick, so we had a guy stand in front and
read a small Koran," said Bader Iqbal of the Thousand Oaks mosque.
"We had only six people come for prayers, the rest went to other
mosques that had a hafiz."</TE>
<TE>   This year the mosque took no chances, bringing in Sheik Hamad from
Cairo and a second hafiz from South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel closer to God in your prayers when led by someone who
has attained the knowledge of the whole Koran," said Mohamed el
Shafie, who attends the mosque. "It humbles you in God's presence."</TE>
<TE>   Ramadan, which began about two weeks ago, is an intensely
spiritual time of fasting during the day and meditating at night.</TE>
<TE>   By memorizing and reciting the entire Koran, the hafiz is
following closely in the footsteps of the Prophet Muhammad and his
companions. The word Koran means "the recitation" in Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   "When you hear a hafiz with a good voice, you go into a sort of a
trance," said Amin Refaat, assistant director of the King Fahd Mosque
in Culver City. "It is hair-raising. It revives the divine part of
the human, which is the soul, and then releases it through prayer."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars say that even before the advent of Islam some 1,400 years
ago, the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula memorized songs and epic
poems, some more than 1,000 lines long. They held contests to
determine who could recite with the most eloquence and style.</TE>
<TE>   "The medium for transmitting information was memorization," said
Mohammed Abdul Aleem, who heads Islamicity.com, a Culver City-based
Web site that focuses on Muslim news and theology. "When the Koran
was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad, he was told to memorize it."</TE>
<TE>   Every year, competitions are held around the Muslim world to find
the best hafiz. Contestants are judged by memorization skills and,
more importantly, by their delivery.</TE>
<TE>   Connoisseurs of the art say each culture has its own lyrical
style. They contend that Saudis tend to recite in a faster, more
nasal voice, while Egyptians chant in slower, deeper cadences. Turks,
they maintain, recite with a calm, almost mystical serenity, while
Indonesians are somewhere between Saudis and Egyptians.</TE>
<TE>   But for most Muslims, the hafiz is most remarkable simply for
memorizing such a difficult book.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, they were treated with awe and respect," said
Khalid Abou el Fadl, a hafiz who teaches Islamic law at UCLA. "In
villages, the hafiz was often approached for blessings or asked to
pray for someone."</TE>
<TE>   He said a hafiz may earn divine favor, but memorization,
especially without comprehension, guarantees nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be a curse in the hereafter if you memorize it and are
unethical," El Fadl said. "Then you have brought dishonor to the
Koran."</TE>
<TE>   There are different methods of training a hafiz, but most start at
age 5 or 6. "Teachers sit all day with them and go over a verse at a
time or a page at a time," said Abdul Rauf Khan, director of Darul
Uloom Al Islamiya, a school for hafiz education in Sacramento. "It
takes about three years. Younger minds seem to memorize easier."</TE>
<TE>   Zaid bin Mahmood, 25, is a hafiz from South Africa who has spent
Ramadan in mosques in New Orleans, Oklahoma and now in Thousand Oaks.
He began memorizing full time when he was 14.</TE>
<TE>   "You do four or five pages a day," he said. "I worked from 8 a.m.
until noon and then 2 p.m. until 5 p.m. every day."</TE>
<TE>   Memorization is followed by tajweed or "beautification." The hafiz
learns to pronounce words properly, which syllables to stress and
which to glide over. It takes about two years.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to read it out loud and do it continuously every day,"
Mahmood said. "But one of the miracles of the Koran is, you never get
tired of it."</TE>
<TE>   Back in Thousand Oaks, as evening prayers approach, Sheik Hamad
washes his hands, face and feet. He says he recites the Koran daily.</TE>
<TE>   "I can go through the whole thing," he says. "If I am visualizing
what I'm reciting, there will be a lot of power locked in the words."</TE>
<TE>   The sheik began memorizing the Koran in Tanta, a village in the
Nile Delta. In those days, he said, it was not uncommon for children
to attend schools, whose sole function was Koran memorization. He
went on to become an imam, or leader, of a Cairo mosque.</TE>
<TE>   "The reward I get from God is that I have done a good deed," he
says. "The reward I get from people is respect."</TE>
<TE>   With that the sheik, in a flowing white gown and skull cap, walks
through the gentle arches of the mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Lines of men and women stand on the carpet behind him, facing east
toward Mecca. He looks out the window toward the full moon and begins
reciting Chapter 18 of the Koran.</TE>
<TE>   "See you not that Allah drives the clouds gently, then joins them
together, then makes them into a heap of layers, and you see the rain
comes forth from between them," he chants in Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   There is a poetic quality to his delivery, a lilting repetition
that causes some to gently rock and sway in the mosque.</TE>
<TE>   "He sends down from the sky hail, like mountains, and strikes
therewith whom He wills and averts it from whom He wills," he
recites.</TE>
<TE>   The congregation remains standing, arms folded and eyes closed. In
two hours, the hafiz finishes.</TE>
<TE>   Another chapter complete -- just 12 more to go.</TE>

the hafiz is the ancient sound of Ramadan, a month celebrating the
divine gift of the Koran to Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   But locating a hafiz, which means "protector" in Arabic, is an
annual headache for American Muslims. With a relatively short history
in the U.S., mosques must fly in their hafizes from places like
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India and Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   There are only a handful of religious institutions in the country
preparing youngsters to become hafizes. One in Sacramento has just 10
students, while individual mosques sometimes run their own programs.</TE>
<TE>   At this rate, Muslim leaders say, it will be another generation
before they can readily enlist a home-grown hafiz for Ramadan.</TE>
<TE>   "We are struggling even to teach our children the rudiments of
Arabic, so turning them into a hafiz is not going to be easy," said
Mustafa Kuko, director of the Islamic Center of Riverside, which has
a Pakistani hafiz. "There is a demand for a hafiz in every mosque;
the demand is becoming greater and greater."</TE>
<TE>   A foreign hafiz gets free airfare and a small stipend along with
room and board in a mosque. Each day he leads prayers, and each night
he recites the Koran, finishing the more than 400 pages by the end of
the month. The recitations are always in Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year our hafiz was sick, so we had a guy stand in front and
read a small Koran," said Bader Iqbal of the Thousand Oaks mosque.
"We had only six people come for prayers, the rest went to other
mosques that had a hafiz."</TE>
<TE>   This year the mosque took no chances, bringing in Sheik Hamad from
Cairo and a second hafiz from South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel closer to God in your prayers when led by someone who
has attained the knowledge of the whole Koran," said Mohamed el
Shafie, who attends the mosque. "It humbles you in God's presence."</TE>
<TE>   Ramadan, which began about two weeks ago, is an intensely
spiritual time of fasting during the day and meditating at night.</TE>
<TE>   By memorizing and reciting the entire Koran, the hafiz is
following closely in the footsteps of the Prophet Muhammad and his
companions. The word Koran means "the recitation" in Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   "When you hear a hafiz with a good voice, you go into a sort of a
trance," said Amin Refaat, assistant director of the King Fahd Mosque
in Culver City, where the hafiz is a Saudi. "It is hair-raising. It
revives the divine part of the human, which is the soul, and then
releases it through prayer."</TE>
<TE>   Scholars say that even before the advent of Islam some 1,400 years
ago, the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula memorized songs and epic
poems, some more than 1,000 lines long. They held contests to
determine who could recite with the most eloquence and style.</TE>
<TE>   "The medium for transmitting information was memorization," said
Mohammed Abdul Aleem, who heads Islamicity.com, a Culver City-based
Web site that focuses on Muslim news and theology. "When the Koran
was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad, he was told to memorize it."</TE>
<TE>   Every year, competitions are held around the Muslim world to find
the best hafiz. Contestants are judged by memorization skills and,
more importantly, by their delivery.</TE>
<TE>   Connoisseurs of the art say each culture has its own lyrical
style.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that Saudis tend to recite in a faster, more nasal
voice, while Egyptians chant in slower, deeper cadences. Turks, they
maintain, recite with a calm, almost mystical serenity, while
Indonesians are somewhere between Saudis and Egyptians.</TE>
<TE>   But for most Muslims, the hafiz is most remarkable simply for
memorizing such a difficult book.</TE>
<TE>   "Historically, they were treated with awe and respect," said
Khalid Abou el Fadl, a hafiz who teaches Islamic law at UCLA. "In
villages, the hafiz was often approached for blessings or asked to
pray for someone."</TE>
<TE>   He said a hafiz may earn divine favor, but memorization,
especially without comprehension, guarantees nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be a curse in the hereafter if you memorize it and are
unethical," El Fadl said. "Then you have brought dishonor to the
Koran."</TE>
<TE>   There are different methods of training a hafiz, but most start at
age 5 or 6.</TE>
<TE>   "Teachers sit all day with them and go over a verse at a time or a
page at a time," said Abdul Rauf Khan, director of Darul Uloom Al
Islamiya, a school for hafiz education in Sacramento. "It takes about
three years. Younger minds seem to memorize easier."</TE>
<TE>   Zaid bin Mahmood, 25, is a hafiz from South Africa who has spent
Ramadan in mosques in New Orleans, Oklahoma and now in Thousand Oaks.
He began memorizing full time when he was 14.</TE>
<TE>   "You do four or five pages a day," he said. "I worked from 8 a.m.
until noon and then 2 p.m. until 5 p.m. every day."</TE>
<TE>   Memorization is followed by tajweed or "beautification." The hafiz
learns to pronounce words properly, which syllables to stress and
which to glide over. It takes about two years.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to read it out loud and do it continuously every day,"
Mahmood said. "But one of the miracles of the Koran is, you never get
tired of it."</TE>
<TE>   Back in Thousand Oaks, as evening prayers approach, Sheik Hamad
washes his hands, face and feet. He says he recites the Koran daily.</TE>
<TE>   "I can go through the whole thing," he says. "If I am visualizing
what I'm reciting, there will be a lot of power locked in the words."</TE>
<TE>   The sheik began memorizing the Koran in Tanta, a village in the
Nile Delta. In those days, he said, it was not uncommon for children
to attend schools, whose sole function was Koran memorization. He
went on to become an imam, or leader, of a Cairo mosque.</TE>
<TE>   "The reward I get from God is that I have done a good deed," he
says. "The reward I get from people is respect."</TE>
<TE>   With that the sheik, in a flowing white gown and skull cap, walks
through the gentle arches of the mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Lines of men and women stand on the carpet behind him, facing east
toward Mecca. He looks out the window toward the full moon and begins
reciting Chapter 18 of the Koran.</TE>
<TE>   "See you not that Allah drives the clouds gently, then joins them
together, then makes them into a heap of layers, and you see the rain
comes forth from between them," he chants in Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   There is a poetic quality to his delivery, a lilting repetition
that causes some to gently rock and sway in the mosque.</TE>
<TE>   The congregation remains standing, arms folded and eyes closed. In
two hours, the hafiz finishes.</TE>
<TE>   Another chapter complete -- just 12 more to go.</TE>

<LD>The posters decorating the walls and bulletin boards in Room 18 at
Channel Islands High School extol notions of social justice and
revolution: "Problem Posing Demands Reflection and Action." "No
peace, no justice."</LD>
<LD>   But the teenage girls gathered here talk about simpler, more
personal things: educations, good jobs, nice cars, husbands, healthy
children. They're confident they'll have all that by the time they're
30. They're here under the auspices of the El Centrito Latina
Leadership Group of Oxnard, meeting for 10-week workshops meant to
prepare them to set goals for college and beyond.</LD>
<LD>   Through discussions, lectures and guest speakers, the girls are
encouraged to develop personal goals and determine ways to achieve
them. Recently, in an exercise designed to help them do so, they were
asked to make collages illustrating where they saw themselves in five
years and in 15.</LD>
<TE>   "We hope it gets them to think about how they'd like to shape
their future," said Lizeth Barreto, a workshop coordinator. "Their
parents want their daughters to go to college, but they didn't go to
school in this country and they have no idea how to direct their
children."</TE>
<TE>   The classes are sponsored by El Centrito de La Colonia in Oxnard,
a community center that provides educational services to the
low-income Latino communities of La Colonia and downtown Oxnard. The
center, which has received a $7,500 grant from the Los Angeles Times
Holiday Campaign, exists to help empower young people to use all the
educational and career opportunities at their disposal.</TE>
<TE>   El Centrito's staff hopes that giving youths tools for success and
instilling pride in their heritage will help them grow into
productive members of society. "We want them to have a purpose to
their lives," said El Centrito Executive Director Luann Rocha.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Gaeta says that in 15 years she will be a lawyer or an
international businesswoman. Unlike the rest of her classmates, she
doesn't have plans for a husband or children. The leadership class is
part of a concerted effort the 16-year-old has made to clean up her
act: Not long ago, she was being disrespectful to her parents,
drinking and smoking marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized that if I didn't help myself, nobody would," Maria
said. "I wanted to see and hear about other educated Latinas to know
that I can do this, to know that I can prove anybody who doubted me
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Latina Leadership Group, El Centrito runs
several youth groups open to boys, a family literacy program, a
school readiness program and several community technology programs.</TE>
<TE>   During this year's Holiday Campaign, The Times is highlighting
groups that serve children and youths in Southern California.</TE>

<HD>Mayor Mirrors His City, Files for Bankruptcy</HD>
<DH>Politician cites his suit against his former employer and
the stock market's nose dive. Desert Hot Springs filed for protection
last year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eleven months ago, Desert Hot Springs, crippled by a legal judgment,
became California's first government entity in seven years to file
for bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the town's mayor -- financially crippled by the
lumbering pace of a legal dispute with his former employer -- said
he's declaring bankruptcy too.</LD>
<LD>   Matt Weyuker, mayor since 1999, confirmed in an "open letter" to
the struggling desert town that he had filed for Chapter 7
bankruptcy. In the letter, the mayor said he was wrongly fired from
his position at a university. He said his lawsuit over the job and a
tough run on the stock market have sapped him and his wife of their
savings.</LD>
<TE>   "We are, of course, deeply embarrassed by this turn of events,"
Weyuker wrote. "We simply ran out of money and other assets and
literally out of options.... I am proud to be ... mayor, and I
sincerely believe that I have done a proficient, knowledgeable and
professional job in representing our community and being its elected
leader."</TE>
<TE>   In a brief interview, Weyuker, 69, said he has no plans to resign.</TE>
<TE>   His filing earlier this month in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San
Bernardino, according to legal records, comes on the heels of Desert
Hot Springs itself being forced into bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the city filed for protection under Chapter 9 of the
federal bankruptcy code. The emergency measure allows the city to
protect its assets and property -- and to recover, albeit slowly,
from legal troubles.</TE>
<TE>   The move came after a federal judge reinstated an earlier court's
ruling that Desert Hot Springs should pay a developer a $3-million
judgment in a long-simmering dispute over the city's 1990 decision to
quash plans for a mobile home park. The mobile home developer had
filed a lawsuit claiming that the city violated the Fair Housing Act
by, in effect, discriminating against low-income families.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy filing last December was the first by a government
entity in California since Orange County filed for protection in
1994, after losing more than $1.5 billion on its investments,
according to the League of California Cities.</TE>
<TE>   Desert Hot Springs is known for natural mineral water and dozens
of spas, but has always been something of a stepchild to the more
upper-crust communities in the Palm Springs area. At the time of the
city's bankruptcy filing, Weyuker said he hoped that the move would
remove a cloud of uncertainty and allow the city to better market
itself.</TE>
<TE>   Jo Lynn Slaughter, executive director of the Desert Hot Springs
Chamber of Commerce, said she does not think the mayor's bankruptcy
will hinder those efforts: "It's completely unrelated. I don't view
it as a setback. It's his personal business."</TE>
<TE>   Desert Hot Springs, Slaughter said, is seeing some interest from
developers now, as well as some redevelopment. The city of about
17,000 is expected to grow in coming years, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Weyuker said he had worked at Western University of
Health Sciences, based in Pomona, for 21 years and was serving as
director of government relations when he was elected mayor in
November 1999. He said he was fired in July 2000, then filed a
wrongful termination lawsuit, alleging age bias. The case is set for
trial in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "During the long, often delayed legal process, we paid our bills
using money we had set aside for retirement ... hoping the lawsuit
would be settled before we ran out of money," he wrote. "We had not
counted on two things happening that impacted our ability to continue
paying our bills as we had been doing for over 45 years -- the
school's lawyers' stalling tactics that delayed any positive movement
on the lawsuit for well over a year and the stock market nose dive."</TE>
<TE>   Western University spokeswoman Jean Henshaw declined to comment
about the lawsuit.</TE>

<HD>Coalition Rallies for an End to Violence</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>The trees outside Darby Park in Inglewood were ringed with ribbons:
black for loss, white for hope and yellow for goodwill. In the park,
parents of children killed by gunfire joined civic leaders and
members of the community to plead for peace.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Inglewood Peace and Fairness Coalition organized
the mid-Saturday rally -- which began with speeches and ended with
prayer -- in anticipation of the upcoming trial of former Inglewood
officer Jeremy J. Morse, accused of beating 16-year-old Donovan
Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   Khalid Shah, executive director of the Stop the Violence, Increase
the Peace Foundation and chairman of the coalition, said he hoped to
see calm prevail after a verdict. "We need to start organizing now"
to have that happen, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The Inglewood coalition was formed soon after the July 6 incident
involving police, Jackson and his father, Coby Chavis Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies were questioning Chavis at the gas station
about expired license tags when Morse and his partner, Bijan Darvish,
arrived. What happened next is in dispute, but by the time it was
over, Morse had thrown the handcuffed teenager onto the car and hit
him.</TE>
<TE>   Morse is charged with assault under the color of authority and
Darvish is charged with filing a false police report. A judge is
scheduled to hear a motion to dismiss the case Monday. That motion
was filed by Morse's lawyer earlier this month after a Los Angeles
County district attorney's investigator said Morse had not used
excessive force.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Shah said there is a fear that rioters might "burn
the city down" if the officers are found not guilty. Ordinary
citizens, he said, must prevail over that fear. "We must say to the
world that there will be peace after the verdicts, that there are
people in the community who want to see the right thing done."</TE>
<TE>   Although the rally was organized around the Inglewood beating
case, the recent spate of murders in Los Angeles served as an ominous
backdrop for the event. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) warned the
crowd that "we have a crisis in the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Kim Enix, 41, who lost her 18-year-old son in a May shooting, was
one of more than 100 people who marched from the park to Manchester
Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard after the rally.</TE>
<TE>   Enix, whose son, Derreck Howell, was killed at the corner of 92nd
Street and Western Avenue in Los Angeles and who lives in Long Beach,
said she had heard about the Inglewood rally on the radio and turned
her car toward the park.</TE>

<HD>Buddy Kaye, 84; Prolific Songwriter and Lyricist</HD>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buddy Kaye, a songwriter and lyricist whose work was recorded by
Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, Barry Manilow and Pat Boone, has died. He
was 84.</LD>
<LD>   Kaye died of a heart attack Thursday at Eisenhower Medical Center
in Rancho Mirage, according to his son Richard.</LD>
<LD>   Born Jules Leonard Kaye in New York City, Kaye played saxophone as
a young man in local clubs and on ocean cruises.</LD>
<TE>   He was also learning to become a songwriter, and began his career
in the late 1930s. Over the next six decades, he wrote more than 400
published songs.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his most popular songs were "Till the End of Time,"
recorded by Como, and "Full Moon and Empty Arms," recorded by
Sinatra. Written with collaborator Ted Mossman, the melodies were
based on themes by Chopin and Rachmaninoff.</TE>
<TE>   He also wrote " 'A' You're Adorable" for Como; "Old Songs,"
recorded by Manilow; and the novelty tune "Speedy Gonzales," recorded
by Boone, which was an international hit.</TE>
<TE>   For television, Kaye co-wrote the theme for the popular series "I
Dream of Jeannie." For films, he wrote the title songs for "Change of
Habit" and "The Trouble With Girls," two Elvis Presley films.</TE>
<TE>   He was producer and director of "The Little Prince," which was
narrated by Richard Burton and won a Grammy for best children's
recording in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   He had just completed the book and lyrics for "Garbo ... The
Musical," a work based on the life of actress Greta Garbo.</TE>
<TE>   Kaye taught songwriting at UCLA Extension for 11 years and, more
recently, at College of the Desert.</TE>
<TE>   He was also an author, with books including "The Wisdom of
Baltasar Gracian" and "The Gift of Acabar," which he wrote with Og
Mandino.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son Richard, Kaye is survived by his wife,
Lillian; two other children, Barbara and Ronald; and three
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Carole Kismaric, 60; Gave a New Look to Photo Books</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Rourke</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carole Kismaric was to the photography world of the 1970s what
Dorothy Parker was to the literary scene of the '50s. Her taste, her
sense of humor and her assurance about her taste as an editor helped
define an era.</LD>
<LD>   Photography curator Robert Sobieszek of the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art remembered Kismaric that way after her death Tuesday in
New York. She died of pancreatic cancer at her home. She was 60.</LD>
<LD>   Kismaric brought her trained eye, her eclectic experiences in
publishing and her light touch to bear as an editor of photography
books, starting in the mid-1960s -- first at Time-Life, where she
worked on a series of books about photography, among others, and
later at Aperture, the art photography book publisher.</LD>
<TE>   The newsmagazine style she developed at Time-Life had a direct
influence on her future work. She went on to reinvent art photography
layouts in ways that shook the publishing world.</TE>
<TE>   "Carole brought a popular, commercial design sense to a stodgy,
ghettoized art form," Sobieszek said.</TE>
<TE>   For Aperture, where she also edited a quarterly art journal,
Kismaric produced photography books on the work of Edward Weston,
Ansel Adams and Diane Arbus. Each one was narrowly themed: nudes for
Weston, light for Adams, newsmagazine images for Arbus.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, photography was comparatively new to the art market,
and its supporters were trying to defend its claim. Books on the
subject placed one image on each page for a framed effect. Kismaric
applied a magazine style to art-book layouts, putting as many as
three pictures or as few as one on an open, double page.</TE>
<TE>   "The technique goes back to Look and Life magazines," Sobieszek
said. "Carole used it to kick up the traditional art photography
layout a notch. It made photography a lot more exciting to look at."</TE>
<TE>   Never a professional photographer herself, Kismaric began her
career as a newspaper reporter in college but soon turned to
photographs as her preferred way of telling a story.</TE>
<TE>   As a psychology major at Pennsylvania State University in the
early 1960s, she spent summers working at the Parkersburg News in
West Virginia and United Press International in Ohio. They were
places where the only good photograph was a news photo, preferably
one that crackled with information.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation in 1964, Kismaric was a writer for Conde Nast
Publications, home of Vogue magazine and others that covet visual
panache. From then on, Kismaric seems to have been happiest when she
could edit words and pictures in ways that captured the unexpected
balance points between the two.</TE>
<TE>   She went to Time-Life in 1965, working first as a researcher,
later as a picture editor and then an associate editor. In addition
to the photography book series, she worked on a series on the Old
West and another on human behavior. Her last project for Time-Life
was a book on the U.S. bicentennial.</TE>
<TE>   In 1970 she married Charles Mikolaycak, a book designer for
Time-Life and an illustrator of children's books. Their
collaborations led to several independent projects, including
children's books that she adapted from folk tales.</TE>
<TE>   Friends remember the couple for their whirlwind social schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "They were the quintessential New Yorkers," said Dick Cravens, a
contributing editor at Time-Life and Aperture (under the byline R.H.
Cravens) and a longtime friend of Kismaric. "They saw every play and
every exhibit."</TE>
<TE>   Cravens was a regular dinner guest at their apartment in the East
90s, where the menu was always the same. Pasta with pesto and
scallops, salad, and memorable wines</TE>
<TE>   "It was the sort of meal a busy person could pick up on the way
home," Cravens said. He wasn't there for the food. "Conversation was
the best I've ever had."</TE>
<TE>   Kismaric moved to Aperture in 1976. Over the next 10 years, as
managing editor and later as editorial director, she featured
photographers who drew from an art background, including the 19th
century Frenchman Eugene Atget, and others more influenced by
journalism, such as her contemporary Danny Lyon.</TE>
<TE>   "She was extremely intelligent and absolutely encouraging, with
photographers as well as writers," said Cravens. "And she was
invariably civil."</TE>
<TE>   She left Aperture in 1986 to work on an independent project that
resulted in a book and traveling photography exhibit. "Forced Out:
The Agony of the Refugee in Our Time" grew out of a grant proposal
she made to the J. M. Kaplan fund. (She proposed Northern Ireland as
a topic; the fund countered with the global refugee crisis.)</TE>
<TE>   Four top New York publishers contributed $25,000 each to publish
the book in 1989. It came out as an oversize paperback for $19.95, a
moderate price compared with the prices for most art photography
books meant for coffee tables.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, when Kismaric founded Lookout productions with Marvin
Heiferman, they aimed for similar collaborations to package books and
exhibitions for the popular audience. Heiferman, a photography
curator and writer, said they started by brainstorming, often in his
Manhattan loft.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd sit at my computer and bang out ideas based on what is on
people's minds," he recalled in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the most popular works looked at children's books from the
1950s in their cultural context. "Growing Up With Dick and Jane" in
1996 and "The Mysterious Case of Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys" in
1998 showed what Lookout was all about.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to find cultural icons, popular images, and how they
affect our lives" Heiferman said.</TE>
<TE>   He compared their work to cultural anthropology. He curated their
projects; she did her usual. "Carole was a fantastic editor," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kismaric is survived by her sister, Susan Kismaric. Her husband
died in 1993.</TE>

<HD>Stop the Killing? LAPD Can't Do Its Job and Everyone Else's
Too</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Bill Bratton, control your cops," said a sign held by a protester
outside the LAPD's Parker Center downtown.</LD>
<LD>   The demand followed a police shooting that left two teenagers
dead.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Police Chief Bratton, never bashful, quickly
counterpunched.</LD>
<TE>   "Control your kids."</TE>
<TE>   In just four weeks on the job, Bratton has become de facto mayor,
camp counselor and provocateur. And that exchange neatly frames the
challenge for Los Angeles, which will probably have more homicides in
2002 than New York, a city with twice as many people.</TE>
<TE>   How do you stop the killing, much of which is gang-related?</TE>
<TE>   How do you restore order to the point where law-abiding folks
aren't afraid to let their children outside?</TE>
<TE>   Police can do a far better job, as Bratton has admitted. But when
he said control your kids, he was telling the city that cops alone
can't do a job that parents, teachers, ministers and politicians have
failed at. And it wasn't hard to find people who agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Where in the hell is the so-called black leadership when we need
them most?" asks Tony Wafford, a black friend who's an AIDS
prevention activist. "Those mothers were all over the media talking
about 'Barbershop,' a b.s. movie."</TE>
<TE>   Najee Ali, an activist and former gang member, said that if black
leaders are going to denounce police abuse, they ought to get just as
militant about black-on-black crime.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to give the message to the community to turn in these
killers," Ali said, "because the silence is partly to blame for the
murders."</TE>
<TE>   Easy to say. But rat out a drug dealer or murderer, and if it gets
back to the hoodlums, the price is steep.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever I hear that response, I always say the risk is greater
in not cooperating to bring the killer to justice," Ali said. "He
might target you or someone in your family next."</TE>
<TE>   Luis Rodriguez, who counsels both black and Latino gang members,
probably wouldn't disagree with that.</TE>
<TE>   He spent most of his childhood as a hoodlum, mostly in
neighborhoods east of Los Angeles, so he knows how it works.</TE>
<TE>   By age 7, he was a thief. By 11, he was running with the Lomas
gang. By 13, he was locked up. By 17, he was stabbing and shooting
people. By 18, no fewer than 25 of his friends were dead.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez barely got out with his life, and he went on to become
an accomplished writer.</TE>
<TE>   His first book, "Always Running, La Vida Loca: Gang Days in L.A.,"
was an attempt to "control" his own son, to borrow from Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   At age 27, the son is six years into a 28-year sentence, and
Rodriguez travels the city and the country as a counselor and
storyteller, trying to save gangbangers and wannabes from a fate
worse than his son's.</TE>
<TE>   If Bratton can lock up every last gangbanger standing on a corner,
good for him, Rodriguez said when I drove up to Sylmar to see him.
But then what?</TE>
<TE>   Going to prison doesn't mean they're out of business, said
Rodriguez, now 48. From behind bars, they might still be calling
shots on the streets, where armies of kids will step in to replace
them in the drug and turf wars.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez didn't give me a song about economic and racial
isolation, both of which put kids on the streets with nothing to
lose.</TE>
<TE>   He touched on the lousy schools and lousy jobs, but said no one is
more inept at keeping kids out of trouble than the people who know
them best.</TE>
<TE>   The people of their own community.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are parents all fearing the same things for their children,
and never talking about it together?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   About a year ago, Rodriguez scanned the gang-ridden landscape of
the northeast San Fernando Valley, and couldn't find a bookstore or a
theater. So he opened Tia Chucha's Cafe Cultural on Glenoaks
Boulevard, next to a Pizza Hut.</TE>
<TE>   The day I met with him, he was expecting as many as 100 kids for
weekly film night, a documentary on the Gulf War, with discussion to
follow.</TE>
<TE>   Six days a week, he serves up art, history, music and an open-mike
discussion of books, current events and community concerns.</TE>
<TE>   There's an obvious hunger for it, he says, because he gets
good-size crowds of adults and even more kids.</TE>
<TE>   "If you could put something like this in every neighborhood of the
city, I think you could make a difference," says Rodriguez. He took
issue with Bratton for telling the city to get angry about the dead
and dying.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need more anger -- there's anger enough. We need
imagination. Intense dialogues. ... Meaningful relationships between
adults, teachers, mentors and youth. More art and creative means of
pulling out of the crises we are in.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just work the back end. Bratton is looking from there
and surmising the problem is lack of emotion. He's wrong. Plenty of
emotion to go around. Not enough thinking. Sharing. Risking.
Dreaming. Building. Loving. You name it."</TE>
<TE>   I disagree in part. Bratton is a cop, not a social worker. His job
is to put troublemakers in jail, not enroll them in an arts and
crafts program, and when he asked the city to get angry about all the
bodies in the streets, he was only trying to stir people to action.</TE>
<TE>   If Rodriguez could open a dozen more centers like the one in
Sylmar, I bet Bratton would gladly cut the ribbons. The chief has
been tapping celebrities for cash to fight crime and save kids'
lives, and if he can point to a success like Rodriguez's, it might be
easier to shake that money loose.</TE>
<TE>   We can control them, we can cuff them.</TE>
<TE>   Or we can bury them.</TE>

<HD>Making Noise Over Gliders</HD>
<DH>A Laguna Niguel man sues over the silent model planes,
which at times crash in his yard. Council votes next month on new
rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remote-control gliders are a familiar sight over Aliso Creek Valley,
soaring silently as they float and dip on thermal currents along a
300-foot slope. But much like golf balls and baseballs, the model
planes sometimes veer off course.</LD>
<LD>   That's where Stephen Valbuena and the country's strongest law
regulating the model gliders come in. Some see the lightweight craft
as things of beauty. Valbuena, who lives a few yards from the tiny
Lilly Shapell Park in Laguna Niguel that has been claimed as a sort
of glider enthusiasts' airfield, sees them only as a nuisance.</LD>
<LD>   Valbuena grew so irked at the model planes crash-landing in his
yard and clipping his roof that he took Laguna Niguel to court --
seeking a ban on the fliers. He says gliders flying near his house
pose a danger.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm really concerned about my wife or myself getting injured or
killed," he said. "I'm also concerned about neighbors and the little
kids that use the park."</TE>
<TE>   Valbuena's lawsuit against the city was the fourth he filed. The
others were harassment complaints against individual glider pilots.
Valbuena himself was cited for misdemeanor vandalism in April after a
pilot told police that Valbuena was seen shooting planes out of the
sky with a BB gun. The district attorney's office later dropped the
charges, saying evidence was insufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Sensing the dispute could get even uglier, the city has
reluctantly stepped in and drawn up an ordinance requiring glider
pilots to obtain a permit.</TE>
<TE>   The new regulations say gliders can be flown only over the back
slope of the park and the valley to the west. They may not be flown
over residences and only seven gliders may be flown at one time. If a
pilot abuses the new laws, his permit can be revoked or suspended by
the city's parks and recreation director.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council approved the ordinance on a first reading Tuesday
and is expected to take a final vote Dec. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots who have used this public park for 25 years would seem to
be natural opponents to such stringent rules. But even before
Valbuena moved into the Hillcrest Estates gated neighborhood two
years ago, hobbyist Mike Lance's flying club -- the Laguna Niguel
Soaring Guild -- was seeking to rein in reckless pilots who didn't
measure up to club standards.</TE>
<TE>   In the past year, the guild has posted a series of rules and
safety regulations for those using the site, which isn't even as long
as a football field.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the homes were built there in 1998, I thought we needed to
have more control over who was flying out there," said Lance, 56,
president of the guild.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the best flying sites in the United States, and we
wanted to protect it."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Academy of Model Aeronautics, the
175,000-member national organization that oversees remote-control
gliders, say the ordinance is unique.</TE>
<TE>   "I give a great deal of credit to the city for realizing the
importance of this activity," said Jay Mealy, the academy's programs
director. "This law covers all the bases and creates a very
acceptable flying environment in that community."</TE>
<TE>   But Valbuena doesn't believe the ordinance will make much
difference.</TE>
<TE>   "They are calling it an ordinance, but it's the same thing they've
had at the park here for a few years," he said. "The ordinance is
almost exactly the same as the rules. You're dealing with currents
and thermal winds. It has nothing to do with experience. It's not
about training. These planes can drop out of the sky at any time."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Valbuena's suit is pending. A preliminary injunction
was denied this summer, but his request for a permanent injunction
has yet to be heard. According to court records, Valbuena said the
planes have crashed into his two-story home and his backyard at least
10 times since early 2000. He contends that one of the planes damaged
his roof tiles, causing hundreds of dollars' damage.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots say they have gone out of their way to accommodate
Valbuena, who apparently is on his own in his clash with the glider
pilots. Terry Dixon, Laguna Niguel's city attorney, said Valbuena is
the only homeowner in the 180-home gated neighborhood who has
complained about the gliders.</TE>
<TE>   "The other neighbors are real amenable and understanding," said
Yani Hasircoglu, who says his plane was confiscated when it landed in
Valbuena's yard.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy [Valbuena] is out to change the world. This situation is
the same as someone buying a home near a golf course. Occasionally,
an accident is going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   If the conditions weren't perfect at Shapell Park and model
aircraft flying sites weren't becoming so limited, the hobbyists
might be willing to go elsewhere. But the park, they say, is a
magical place, where the wind is funneled through the canyon,
creating rising air and a bowl-like effect.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what makes this place so unique," Hasircoglu said. "And if
you lose your plane, it's easily accessible on the slope, because the
shrubs are so low."</TE>
<TE>   If the new regulation takes effect in early March as expected,
Lance believes fewer pilots will be veering off their flight path.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost everything that's happened out there is because of
inexperienced pilots," Lance said. "They don't have good equipment,
knowledge, experience or the skill."</TE>
<TE>   The city plans to move cautiously, so that if someone's glider is
caught flying over a house, he won't be immediately prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   "We want these regulations to be reasonable," said Tim Casey,
Laguna Niguel city manager. "We don't want people calling 911 every
time they see a model plane flying over their house."</TE>

<HD>MTA Review Finds Safety Problems</HD>
<DH>Audit of rail system uncovers inadequate maintenance,
operators with expired licenses and potential hazards for riders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kurt Streeter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's rail system, the scene of
64 deaths since 1990, including one on Friday, is troubled by
maintenance, safety and oversight problems that could endanger
passengers, according to a new audit by state inspectors.</LD>
<LD>   The 111-page review was completed by the Public Utilities
Commission this month and is based on repeated PUC inspections of the
MTA's network of roughly 60 miles of track and operations during the
summer of 2001. The PUC judged a dozen departments, including
maintenance facilities, record-keeping, operations and safety.</LD>
<LD>   The PUC's consumer protection and rail safety division,
responsible for oversight of California's train network, found that
the MTA failed to meet standards or needed significant improvements
in 29 areas. The MTA has until early January to show that it is
complying with the PUC's ordered remedies.</LD>
<TE>   MTA officials contest the audit's findings, saying the review is
flawed in being based on inspections made a year ago. Anticipating
the PUC's authorization of the audit, the general manager of the
MTA's rail operations, Gerald Francis, wrote last month to the PUC to
say that most of the problems brought up in the review have either
been fixed or are being swiftly dealt with.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent interview, Francis said that riders need not worry.
"In no way does this affect our public safety with our passengers on
the rail system," he said. There's nothing the MTA is doing that is
threatening "the day-to-day safety of our customers."</TE>
<TE>   PUC auditors agree that the MTA appears to be taking steps toward
remedying the problems. But they say the volume of violations raises
questions about the MTA's commitment to safety.</TE>
<TE>   PUC's director of rail safety, Richard Clark, said he was
concerned that the MTA, the nation's second largest transit agency,
is not "making safety enough of a priority."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Rubin, a transit expert and former MTA official, agreed.
"These findings are not good at all," he said after reading the
audit. "The sheer number of inconsistencies is very much a concern."</TE>
<TE>   The audit shows vehicle maintenance to be one of the biggest areas
of concern. The 17-mile Red Line subway's maintenance facility was
found to have "unacceptable problems." A random check of eight Metro
Red Line subway cars found three with maintenance problems such as
loose, wobbly or misplaced train parts.</TE>
<TE>   In another check, auditors found that four of six Red Line cars
they looked at had exceeded by more than 20% the maximum number of
miles driven before getting maintenance inspections.</TE>
<TE>   A check of several rail cars on the 20-mile Green Line found one
train with brake problems.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance, a worker without clearance to operate a train
piloted a car and damaged a switching system, the audit found, adding
that the MTA's rail operations division had failed to investigate
that incident. Time and again, the MTA failed to train and certify
workers correctly, the audit found. Most maintenance workers examined
by auditors "had not been retrained or recertified for the last two
to four years," or had expired certifications, a problem that also
extended to rail controllers.</TE>
<TE>   On the MTA's rail system, the responsibility of these workers is
akin to that of air traffic controllers, only it involves guiding
trains across a system that snakes through streets and underground
tunnels.</TE>
<TE>   The review found that, of the five controllers reviewed, four did
not have up-to-date certifications.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA's fatal-accident rate has long been of concern to PUC
regulators. On Friday, a 16-year-old girl was killed by a train in
South Los Angeles. Sixty-two accidents occurred on the 22-mile Long
Beach-to-Los Angeles Blue Line, most of them involving cars or
pedestrians hit by trains at or near intersections, according to the
MTA. A PUC report used 1998 as a benchmark and found that, in that
year, more people had died on the Blue Line than on California's four
other light rail systems combined.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also found fault with the way the MTA investigates
its accidents.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the rail auditors criticized the MTA for not
performing timely follow-up inspections, also known as "ride checks,"
of train operators who have been involved in accidents. Such
follow-ups, which are to be done two weeks after accidents, are seen
as a crucial way of finding out if an operator is driving the trains
safely.</TE>
<TE>   After looking at the Blue and Green Line light railways, the
auditors said: "The records showed that 37 light rail train
operators, with one or more accidents, did not have the post-accident
ride checks within the specified time periods.... "</TE>
<TE>   Some operators involved in accidents as far back as January 1998
had never received such checks, the audit added.</TE>
<TE>   Turning its attention to a similar audit of the MTA's rail network
produced in 1998, the PUC noted that it had told the transit agency
to address 20 safety issues.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC said the MTA had failed to remedy seven of the issues,
including a demand that PUC staff play a larger part in
investigations and that evaluations of rail workers be "expanded and
strengthened."</TE>
<TE>   Transit experts said the audit needs to get the highest order of
attention from the MTA for several reasons.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the potential risk to passengers, safety questions
could damage the MTA's efforts to persuade state and national
politicians to approve multimillion-dollar funding packages that the
agency needs to pay for several big-ticket transit projects.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA is still fighting the lingering effects of construction
mishaps and cost overruns that plagued the agency as it created its
rail system in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the MTA plans next July to start running the 14-mile Gold
Line light railway, connecting Los Angeles and Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   After community groups voiced concerns over safety, the PUC in May
narrowly granted final approval to the line's construction.</TE>
<TE>   But the PUC said it would closely monitor the Gold Line and could
order changes, such as requiring that parts of the line be rebuilt,
if there are repeated serious accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Clark, the head of the PUC's rail safety division, said his
commission hopes that the MTA will take the findings seriously.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly have [the MTA's] attention with this report, and we
should have ... because these are very serious concerns," he said.
"They say they have in many cases directed staff to make changes. But
we will see. We need to see where the rubber meets the road as to
what the future compliance is."</TE>

<HD>Life in the Fast Lane Shouldn't Start at 11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Girls grow up fast. They're a force of nature not easily stopped.
They spend a lot of time unattended. Their parents can't watch them
every second. Internet or telephone chat rooms are difficult to
monitor. You can't be sure who's on the other end of the line.</LD>
<LD>   So what else is new?</LD>
<LD>   Does any of that address how or why an 11-year-old girl can spend
48 hours away from home with a "boyfriend"? After leaving with him
Tuesday, the girl was found at a motel Thursday night by sheriff's
investigators.</LD>
<TE>   I'm not sure I want to ponder a scenario where that's possible.
Unfortunately, it is -- and as a result, the boyfriend and mom both
went to jail and the girl is in protective custody.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like a good place for all of them.</TE>
<TE>   The young girl was gone for 28 hours before her mother alerted the
police, says Jim Amormino, the Orange County Sheriff's Department
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother would have waited about 28 seconds," Amormino says.</TE>
<TE>   The girl is alive. Her companion apparently picked her up at her
apartment complex in Stanton and took her at least as far as Long
Beach. Authorities have accused him of various sex-related crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's mother, Amormino says, was arrested on suspicion of
child endangerment. Just doing the arithmetic tells me there's a sad
cycle of dysfunction here: The girl is 11, her mother is only 28, and
Mom has another child who's 14.</TE>
<TE>   Children raising babies is not a formula for success. Mom may well
have a legitimately woeful story to tell, but it'll be hard to come
up with anything that justifies not knowing where your 11-year-old is
overnight.</TE>
<TE>   The other blanks probably aren't that hard to fill in. The young
girl, exposed to TV and magazines and chat lines or Internet sites
that from time to time trade in sex, was too immature to separate
reality from fantasy.</TE>
<TE>   The Parents' Place</TE>
<TE>   Eleven-year-old girls always want to be older than 11. They want
to talk older, act older, look older. That's where parents enter the
picture -- to maintain the balance in a child's life between the
normal act of playing grown-up and the very real need to grow up at
the right speed.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody says it's easy, but it's not impossible. Parents by the
millions do it every day.</TE>
<TE>   And then, added to a world where preteen girls check out the sexy
charms of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera come the telephone
chat lines -- yet another way to help them age much faster than they
should.</TE>
<TE>   "They are dangerous," Amormino says of the party lines, which also
can be completely harmless. "You never know who or what type of
person you're going to meet. It sometimes is a haven for sexual
predators."</TE>
<TE>   I ask Amormino how common it is for youngsters to meet bad guys
online.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say, as far as meeting up with them, there's a lot more than
we'd like to see," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "To meet older men on the chat line, that's not unusual. But it's
very unusual -- it's the first time I've ever heard -- for an
11-year-old."</TE>
<TE>   In this case, Amormino says, the girl's mother had "prior
knowledge" that her daughter had met older men (who wouldn't qualify
as an older man?) on the phone. He says she took no "corrective
action."</TE>
<TE>   This situation is so crazy that we're all breathing easier that
the girl was returned, alive, to her home.</TE>
<TE>   Some happy ending: just your average 11-year-old girl spending a
couple nights away from home, thinking she's growing up at warp speed
but not realizing she's been set way, way back.</TE>

<LD>Outspoken in their opposition to war, Branimir and Marilyn Radenovic
had always assumed they were the lone peaceniks in their conservative
Laguna Niguel neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   But at a peace march Saturday in south Orange County, the couple
were amazed that nearly 150 other people demonstrated that they felt
the same way.</LD>
<LD>   Protesters marched from Aliso Viejo's Soka University, where a
student activist group organized the event, to the Chet Holifield
Federal Building in Laguna Niguel to show their opposition to a war
in Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Snaking past gated neighborhoods Saturday morning, the group
attracted supportive honks from passing cars, heckling from soccer
dads telling them to take their protest to Berkeley, and nearly
universal shock from bystanders amazed that an antiwar campaign was
being waged in conservative south Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a lot less isolated after today, because we obviously
aren't the only ones who are against this war," said Marilyn
Radenovic, 53, a secretary for a local college district.</TE>
<TE>   Aliso Viejo City Councilman Karl P. Warkomski, the county's first
elected Green Party politician, said he had predicted a turnout of
fewer than 25.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew there were other people out there like myself who don't
see the logic of this war," he said. "It's great that there is
finally a forum for them to have a voice."</TE>
<TE>   Warkomski and Soka students gave speeches and performed songs and
dances at a rally before the march.</TE>
<TE>   Laughter rocked the crowd when four Soka students recited a
mocking verse set to the tune of "If You're Happy and You Know It":</TE>
<TE>   ... If we cannot find Bin Laden, bomb Iraq/Even if we have no
allies, bomb Iraq....</TE>
<TE>   Toting signs and flags emblazoned with peace signs, the group
remained upbeat during the three-mile walk. A Sheriff's Department
escort ensured they didn't walk into the street.</TE>
<TE>   Although a handful of demonstrators had long hair and beards that
made them seem throwbacks to the Vietnam War protests, the rest were
a mixed crowd that included retirees and university students.</TE>
<TE>   Soka sophomore Nira Sheppard, 18, attended various demonstrations
while growing up in Philadelphia and went to Los Angeles for an
antiwar protest last month. She said it's more important to hold
protests in a conservative stronghold like Orange County than in
urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   "People down here have it really good," she said. "They need to be
woken up from their complacency."</TE>

<LD>The Berkeley Daily Planet has abruptly closed its doors after more
than three years of trying to make it in a market that's tough for
new papers to crack.</LD>
<LD>   Publisher Arnold Lee told the staff Friday that the newspaper was
closing, and Friday's edition was its last. The paper still carried
ads seeking a copy editor and a sales representative, and encouraged
readers to send letters to the editor.</LD>
<LD>   Low ad revenues were the cause, said editor Kurtis Alexander, who
estimated that the paper had a circulation of 15,000 to 20,000 just
before it closed.</LD>
<TE>   The newspaper was launched in April 1999 by three Stanford
University business school graduates and two Turlock journalists. It
had three editors and three reporters, 10 regular contributors, some
interns, and a small business staff.</TE>

<HD>City's 1st African American Firefighter to Get His Due</HD>

<LD>For 107 years, the remains of volunteer firefighter Sam Haskins have
lain in an unmarked grave, his sacrifice to the city forgotten, his
place in Los Angeles Fire Department history unnoticed.</LD>
<LD>   Soon, that will all change.</LD>
<LD>   A ceremony will be scheduled to commemorate Haskins' death. A
headstone will be placed on his grave at Evergreen Cemetery in Boyle
Heights, where he was buried in 1895 after losing his life in the
line of duty.</LD>
<TE>   That marker will do more than give a long-dead firefighter his
due; it will rewrite the history of the LAFD.</TE>
<TE>   Fire Department documents have long recorded George Washington
Bright as the first black member of the department. Bright was
appointed as a volunteer in 1897 and, a month later, promoted to a
full-time firefighter.</TE>
<TE>   The records don't mention Haskins. Recently, however, a persistent
crime analyst, Joe Walker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department, began combing through birth and death certificates at the
county registrar-recorder/county clerk's office in Norwalk.</TE>
<TE>   "I stumbled across Haskins while doing genealogy research for
someone else who died that same year, and he caught my attention,"
Walker said. The evidence he found includes 1895 newspaper stories
about Haskins' death, but no photograph; none is known to exist.</TE>
<TE>   Two years before Bright joined the department, Haskins was already
a volunteer firefighter at Engine Co. No. 2, on East 1st Street near
Chicago Street in Boyle Heights. He was a 40-year-old single man and
a "well-known colored politician" the 19th century newspapers
reported.</TE>
<TE>   An Unknown Life</TE>
<TE>   Born a slave in Virginia in 1855, Haskins had arrived in Los
Angeles about 1880 with a friend, George Warner, who was also a freed
Virginia slave, Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   Haskins' existence had been unknown, both to the LAFD and to a
firefighting historian, Arnett Hartsfield Jr., who was himself a
pioneer in integrating the department.</TE>
<TE>   Hartsfield, 84, a retired firefighter, attorney and civil service
commissioner, led the fight for integration during his 20-year
firefighting career.</TE>
<TE>   "I doubted that Haskins could have been an early volunteer
firefighter," he said before seeing Walker's findings. "I've been the
historian for 62 years, and I would have recognized his name."</TE>
<TE>   Hartsfield was also surprised that an African American would have
had the means to join the department back then. "Being a volunteer
firefighter was very prestigious," he said. "They had to buy their
own equipment and clothes. I didn't think a black man could afford
it."</TE>
<TE>   Although Deputy Fire Chief Jimmy Hill, the highest-ranking African
American in the department, has not seen Walker's evidence yet, he
said he was amazed at the revelation. "If we find any more
information on Haskins, we will most certainly add him to the
line-of-duty deaths," Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   How Haskins came to join the force remains a mystery, but the way
he died is well documented in the newspaper articles.</TE>
<TE>   On the cool evening of Nov. 19, 1895, Haskins responded to a 6
p.m. alarm, taking his position on the back of the wagon hauling the
steam pump.</TE>
<TE>   With the station's mascot, Chief the dog, in the lead, the
horse-drawn wagons raced along 1st Street, which was riddled with
potholes and streetcar tracks, toward Main.</TE>
<TE>   When the wagon Haskins was standing on hit a bump, he lost his
balance and fell between the wheel and the pump. It took firefighters
and passersby more than 10 minutes to take off the wheel to free him.
They took him back to the firehouse, where he died a few minutes
later.</TE>
<TE>   Haskins was known for his willingness to help, newspapers
reported, adding that he was never late when a fire alarm rang and
that he had as many white friends as he did black.</TE>
<TE>   "But for all his courage and sacrifices, Haskins has been all but
forgotten," Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   Not for much longer, Hartsfield said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've talked to most of the members of the Stentorians [a black
firefighters organization] and they've agreed to pay for a [grave]
marker," he said. "And if they don't, I will. Hopefully, a descendant
of Haskins will come forth and fill in the gaps for us."</TE>
<TE>   Hartsfield is the caretaker of the African American Firefighters
Museum and author of "The Old Stentorians," the history of the city
Fire Department's integration. The museum, believed to be the first
of its kind in the nation, is in the renovated 1913 Fire Station No.
30 at 14th Street and Central Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   It All Began in 1886</TE>
<TE>   The Fire Department officially went into service in 1886, with 31
paid firefighters and 24 reserve volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Bright, the man who was thought to have been the department's
first black member, was promoted to lieutenant in 1902, five years
after his hiring. He was not allowed to command whites, however.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the department gathered all the black and Latino
firefighters under Bright's command at "The Hill," a fire station in
what was then an all-white neighborhood. Now it's a parking lot
across from Belmont High School.</TE>
<TE>   In 1924, seven years after Bright retired, all the black
firefighters were moved again, this time to Fire Station No. 30. More
than a decade later, they were sent to Fire Station No. 14. Both
stations, on Central Avenue, were in an emerging mixed-race
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   As time passed, circumstances didn't get much easier for blacks in
the department. With only two stations open to minorities in the
1950s, promotions were virtually nonexistent. A black firefighter
could become a captain only when another black captain retired or
died.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure to integrate came from inside and outside the department.
The U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education
decision, which struck down the "separate but equal" doctrine in
public schools, marked the beginning of the end for segregation: The
city attorney advised officials that the ruling also could be applied
to fire stations.</TE>
<TE>   In 1955, the Fire Commission ordered the department to integrate.
Chief John Alderson, who was from the South, objected, calling it
"sociological experimentation." The commission accused him of
insubordination and relieved him of his duties.</TE>
<TE>   Hartsfield remembers Alderson as a "great chief." But he also
remembers that putting out fires of bigotry was a lot harder than
fighting real fires.</TE>
<TE>   By 1955, Hartsfield had graduated from USC Law School, passed the
bar exam, fought in a segregated unit in the Army during World War II
and put in 15 years with the Fire Department. Then he and about 80
other blacks were sent to integrate all-white fire stations.</TE>
<TE>   Racist Orders</TE>
<TE>   "The captain met me at the door and gave me a direct order never
to enter the kitchen when the white firemen were eating, to use my
own pots and pans and to shower only when no whites were using the
washroom," Hartsfield said. "I was already an attorney, and every day
I came to work and scrubbed toilets."</TE>
<TE>   The orders infuriated him; he wrestled with his conscience about
whether to comply.</TE>
<TE>   "Then one night, the Lord whispered into my ear, 'You dumb
rookie,' and I swallowed my pride, [scrubbed toilets] and ate alone
for the next six years, until I retired in 1961," Hartsfield said. He
had decided that humbling himself would pave the way for progress.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters learned to sidestep obstacles, each handling bias in
his own way. Hartsfield recalled how Reynaldo Lopez kept his cool
when a "White Adults" sign was posted at the kitchen door. Wallace
DeCuir greeted his colleagues with a "good morning" every day, even
though each day he was ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Earnest Roberts had a nervous breakdown after someone smeared
excrement on his pillow. Within a few months his hair had turned
white from stress. But he stuck it out, putting in 34 years with the
department.</TE>
<TE>   Hartsfield recorded details of the injustices, saved newspaper
clippings and filled photo albums with the record of these proud men
who fought fires, saved lives and slept under the same roof as white
colleagues who didn't want them there. He also kept track of the
stories of courageous white firefighters who broke with their
comrades and befriended black colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   It was during this period, in the late 1950s, that the Stentorians
-- a Greek term for one who speaks out -- formed to increase the
hiring and promotion of African Americans in the fire service.</TE>
<TE>   By 1974, when the department was forced to comply with a
court-imposed consent degree to increase the number of minority
firefighters in its ranks, only 45 of the department's approximately
3,400 firefighters were African American. Today, 388 of the LAFD's
3,346-member roster are black.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Old Stentorians, Sam Haskins' pioneering work eventually
opened doors for others.</TE>
<TE>   He was buried in what appears to have been a segregated section of
Evergreen Cemetery. Newspaper accounts of the funeral said it was
well attended by city officials, including Fire Chief Walter S.
Moore, who eulogized him; several police officers; and "30 permanent
firemen."</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD gave Haskins' relatives a police badge in the form of a
star. The burial service was conducted by the Rev. John A.B. Wilson,
pastor of First Methodist Church. The pallbearers included Haskins'
boyhood friend, Warner; black police officer Robert Stewart; and four
white friends.</TE>
<TE>   In the record of its 116-year history, the LAFD has listed 60
firefighters lost in the line of duty. Haskins makes it 61.</TE>

<HD>2 Injured When Car Hits Train</HD>
<DH>Car Driver and Passenger Injured in Crash With Train</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 21-year-old driver and her passenger were injured Saturday when she
drove through a lowered railroad crossing barrier and into the path
of a Metro Blue Line train in Long Beach, police said.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second serious incident in as many days involving a
Blue Line train.</LD>
<LD>   Three people on board the train, including the operator, received
minor injuries in the 6:30 a.m. incident.</LD>
<TE>   Police identified the driver as Elena Taofi of Long Beach. She was
reported in fair condition Saturday night at Long Beach Memorial
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Her passenger, Faamu Lufi Sao, also of Long Beach, was in fair
condition at the same hospital, where he was being treated for severe
head injuries and a broken pelvis.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach officers investigating the incident said Taofi was
driving a 1997 Nissan Altima west on Wardlow Road when she smashed
through the lowered railroad crossing arm at Pacific Avenue, breaking
it off its base.</TE>
<TE>   A southbound train entering the crossing struck the car.</TE>
<TE>   Train operator Rosie Haynes, 51, was treated at a local hospital
clinic for a shoulder injury.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the roughly 50 train passengers also sustained minor
injuries and were treated at the scene, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Just one day before, a 16-year-old girl was struck and killed by a
Blue Line train south of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County coroner's office on Saturday identified her
as Angela Barahona of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told Los Angeles police that the girl was walking across
the street against a red light when she was hit by a southbound train
on East Washington Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   She died at the scene.</TE>

<HD>Austria's Far Right Loses Ground in Polls</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>The far-right surge that catapulted the Freedom Party into Austria's
governing coalition in 1999 and sparked consternation throughout the
European Union appears to be over, according to polls ahead of
today's parliamentary elections.</LD>
<LD>   Damaged by feuds and defections, many of them fueled by the
backroom machinations of its mercurial unofficial leader, Joerg
Haider, the Freedom Party has seen its support plummet, and it seems
likely to return to an opposition role.</LD>
<LD>   Polls predict the party will win 11% to 13%, a sharp drop from
1999, when it finished second with 27% and formed a coalition with
the business-friendly People's Party of Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel, which had finished third.</LD>
<TE>   Alarmed by Haider's anti-foreigner stance, veiled slights of Jews
and open admiration for some of Adolf Hitler's policies, the EU
imposed seven months of diplomatic sanctions. Israel recalled its
ambassador and hasn't returned him.</TE>
<TE>   Polls on Friday showed Schuessel's party and the opposition Social
Democrats running neck and neck with about 37% each. That means the
winner will need a coalition partner.</TE>
<TE>   For the Social Democrats, it probably would be the environmentally
focused Greens party, which is running third in the polls, meaning a
government similar to Germany's. If Schuessel's party tries to form a
coalition, its most likely partner would be the Freedom Party.</TE>

<LD>   In a statement, BNP Paribas said buying the government's holding
will allow for "the possibilities for cooperation between the two
groups" in consumer banking, investment banking and fund management.</LD>
<TE>   BNP Paribas Chairman Michel Pebereau said in May that the company
plans to spend as much as $9 billion in the next four years for
acquisitions in Europe and the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   It already has spent more than $10 billion on takeovers since
1999, including the purchases of French securities firm Paribas and
two banks in California, including Los Angeles-based United
California Bank.</TE>
<TE>   BNP Paribas has said it wants to "reinforce" its consumer banking
business on the U.S. West Coast, where it ranks as California's No. 4
lender. "In no case will we sacrifice profitability just for the
desire to be bigger," Pebereau said in May.</TE>
<TE>   Paris-based BNP Paribas will pay $58 a share for the Credit
Lyonnais stake, 49% above where the bank's stock closed Friday. The
transaction needs approval from banking regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Credit Agricole spokeswoman Marie-Aude Dubanchet declined to say
whether the bank made a bid for the Credit Lyonnais stake. But the
Finance Ministry said in a statement that BNP Paribas' offer was
"much better than the other candidates."</TE>

<LD>   "Prince Philip wishes to make it clear that at no point did he

<LD>About a dozen girls schools in Iran's capital have allowed students

first time since 1979, a high school principal said.</LD>
<LD>   Tahereh Ebadi said the Education Ministry approved the change as
long as schools put up decorative walls to guard against "lascivious
looks" from men.</LD>
<LD>   Ebadi said the idea was tested at her school, Maktab-ol-Ahrar, for
several years before being applied to other schools. Ebadi said 80%
of students have chosen to go unveiled.</LD>

<HD>Bush Presses Point on Iraq Plans</HD>
<DH>The president extends his campaign against Saddam Hussein
to future NATO members.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Edwin Chen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BUCHAREST, Romania</DL>
<LD>Braving a steady rain, tens of thousands of Romanians gave President
Bush a thunderous welcome Saturday as he paid tribute to their
triumph over a brutal dictatorship -- and warned of the continuing
threat from "fanatics who seek to impose their will through fear and
murder."</LD>
<LD>   Continuing his drumbeat against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
Bush said, "The people of Romania understand that aggressive
dictators cannot be appeased or ignored; they must be opposed."</LD>
<LD>   Speaking to a sea of umbrellas that filled Revolution Square,
where the 1989 uprising against dictator Nicolae Ceausescu began in
the Romanian capital, he welcomed this nation into the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.</LD>
<TE>   "Should any danger threaten Romania, the United States of America
and NATO will be by your side," Bush said. "No one will be able to
take away the freedom of your country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But as in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, earlier in the day, the
president made use of the bully pulpit to press his case against
Iraq, telling his listeners that NATO membership also brings with it
an obligation to fight terrorism -- namely, Iraq's "aggressive
dictator," Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "Every free nation has a responsibility to play its full and
responsible role. And together we will preserve our freedoms," Bush
said in an address before the crowd, which, though gigantic, was
smaller than the White House had expected.</TE>
<TE>   Just before he began to speak, the rain let up briefly and a
rainbow arched across the plaza, prompting Bush to declare: "God is
smiling on us today."</TE>
<TE>   His two public speeches Saturday capped a weeklong visit to
Europe, his fourth as president. Bush returned to the White House
late Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, Bush attended a NATO summit in Prague, the
Czech capital, where the alliance voted to admit seven states once
part of the formerly communist East: Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria,
Romania, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.</TE>
<TE>   From Prague, Bush flew to St. Petersburg to meet with Russian
President Vladimir V. Putin, who served up the week's only discordant
note when he publicly warned Bush not to lose sight of the war on
terrorism as a showdown with Iraq looms.</TE>
<TE>   Bush plans to spend only a portion of this week in Washington. On
Wednesday, he is scheduled to head out for a long Thanksgiving
weekend at his ranch near Crawford, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   In Vilnius, Bush met with the presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia -- the three Baltic states that once were under the yoke of
the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   "I love freedom. That's why I'm so happy to be here," Bush told
them, according to White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   On a chilly gray morning, several thousand Lithuanians showed up
to hear Bush in City Hall Square, a picturesque plaza at the
convergence of a labyrinth of narrow, twisting streets, ancient
churches and pastel-colored bell towers.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the president invoked the memories of Hitler and
Stalin.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew that this continent would not remain divided. We knew
that arbitrary lines drawn by dictators would be erased, and those
lines are now gone," Bush said. "The long night of fear, uncertainty
and loneliness is over."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "In the face of aggression, the brave people of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia will never again stand alone."</TE>
<TE>   At that, the crowd broke into a chant that meant "thank you."</TE>
<TE>   Here in Bucharest, Bush referred to Ceausescu, whose execution on
Christmas Day 1989 ended two decades of a bloody tyranny. Speaking in
the rain without head cover, the president recalled the dramatic
events in Revolution Square that led to Ceausescu's death.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 21 of that year, about 80,000 Romanians jammed the square
for what was thought to be a rally to support Ceausescu, after riots
broke out in the city of Timisoara over the arrest of an outspoken
anti-government priest.</TE>
<TE>   But as Ceausescu appeared on the balcony of the Communist Central
Committee Building, the crowd began chanting "Ti-mi-soa-ra" to
protest the government's actions.</TE>
<TE>   Within 24 hours, the demonstrators stormed the building, and
Ceausescu and his wife fled. Soon after, they were captured and then
shot to death.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks, Bush pointed to the building and said:</TE>
<TE>   "From that balcony, the dictator heard your voices and faltered --
and fled. Two generations of bitter tyranny ended, and all the world
witnessed the courage of Romania, the courage that set you free."</TE>
<TE>   As he segued into his standard anti-Hussein rhetoric, Bush said,
"The world has suffered enough from fanatics who seek to impose their
will through fear and murder."</TE>
<TE>   In his weekly Saturday radio address, the president said that a
new Department of Homeland Security, approved by Congress last week,
along with NATO's expansion will bolster the U.S.-declared war on
terrorism at home and abroad. Bush plans to sign the legislation
Monday.</TE>

<HD>Ecuadoreans Face a Stark Choice in Presidential Election</HD>

<DL>GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador</DL>
<LD>GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador -- The giant Quaker Oats man smiled gently down
from a wall at the political debauchery beneath him.</LD>
<LD>   At an enormous industrial grain mill owned by the country's
richest man, a candidate for president, thousands of partisans
gathered last week to celebrate the close of the political campaign.</LD>
<LD>   In the shadow of 15-story-high grain elevators and flammable-gas
warning signs, supporters of Alvaro Noboa danced, drummed and waved
bright yellow flags. There were scantily clad dancers, men on
horseback and a mariachi band blaring into the humid night in this
sweaty port city.</LD>
<TE>   It was only a taste of the spectacle that has been this year's
presidential race in Ecuador, where voters head to the polls today to
choose the country's sixth president in six years.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever wins will confront a long list of economic and social
problems. The oil-rich country has one of the highest per-capita debt
loads in Latin America, with more than 40% of the budget going to
service external loans.</TE>
<TE>   Voters could not have a more stark choice of candidates. Lucio
Gutierrez, 45, is a former army colonel and coup leader who grew up
in the impoverished highlands. Noboa, 52, is a banana magnate worth
nearly $1 billion who has an apartment on New York's Park Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   The contrast has left many voters cold and the contest in a near
deadlock, according to the latest opinion poll. Gutierrez maintained
a slight lead over Noboa -- 39% to 38% -- in a poll by Informe
Confidencial released late Saturday. The poll had a
3-percentage-point margin of error.</TE>
<TE>   The latest numbers came as a surprise, because Gutierrez had been
comfortably ahead in the weeks leading up to today's vote. Poll
director Santiago Nieto said the dramatic shift reflected a media
onslaught by Noboa, who outspent Gutierrez in the final week,
saturating the air with negative ads. Gutierrez lost the most ground
with women, a seeming result of Noboa's contention that Gutierrez
once beat his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a shock," Nieto said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a quarter of voters have said they plan to rip up their
ballots or leave them blank. Voting is mandatory in Ecuador.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea who I'm going to choose," said Fernando Bravo, a
32-year-old engineer, as he sat at a riverside walkway here last
week. "It will have to be the lesser of two evils."</TE>
<TE>   Uncertainty surrounds both men, neither of whom has held elected
political office.</TE>
<TE>   Many voters fear that Gutierrez could be another Hugo Chavez, the
left-leaning Venezuelan president whose divisive leadership has
plunged his country into chaos.</TE>
<TE>   But voters seem equally uncertain about Noboa, whose inherited
wealth has drawn comparisons to Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi, a media magnate.</TE>
<TE>   "The big problem with Noboa is that he brings together economic
and political power," said Simon Pachano, head of the political
science program at FLACSO, an Ecuadorean think tank. "How he keeps
those two apart will be difficult."</TE>
<TE>   The candidate is not related to current President Gustavo Noboa.</TE>
<TE>   Fears about Gutierrez's extremism seem overblown. He has moderated
his tone since the primaries, when he depended upon an alliance of
left-leaning indigenous parties, unions and a small Marxist party to
reach the second round of voting.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts here rejected the idea that Ecuador is joining Venezuela
and Brazil as the latest Latin American country to swing left after
nearly a decade's embrace of open markets and conservative
governments.</TE>
<TE>   "People here haven't been satisfied by the past governments. It's
as simple as that," said Nieto, the polling-firm director. "They're
asking: 'Where is my bread, where is my car, where is my house?' "</TE>
<TE>   While neither candidate has been particularly explicit about his
political program, their tone in recent days has been surprisingly
centrist and similar.</TE>
<TE>   Both remain committed to entering an Americas-wide free trade
agreement and to the process of dollarization, begun two years ago
when Ecuadoreans traded in their national currency for U.S. dollars
to stabilize the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Since both lack strong support in Congress, either might find
himself forced to rule by consensus rather than popular mandate.</TE>
<TE>   On the campaign trail, both have made a series of populist
promises.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez says he will tackle corruption. He regularly appears in
an ersatz, olive-green army uniform to remind voters of his role in
the popular coup in January 2000, which deposed President Jamil
Mahuad amid an economic crisis and accusations of corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Noboa appears in television commercials with a gaily colored model
home, promising to build 200,000 of them for the poor at a cost to
residents of $48 a month. He promises more jobs, better health care
and more schools to make an "empire" of Ecuador, one of Latin
America's poorer countries.</TE>
<TE>   Each candidate, in interviews with The Times, strove to portray
himself as a forward-looking progressive, equally attuned to the
needs of the 70% of the population living in poverty and the demands
of international markets.</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez, who donned a blue suit and journeyed to New York and
Washington to calm investors after his first-round victory last
month, said he would pursue close relations with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to do everything possible ... to strengthen the ties
of friendship, commerce and support with the U.S.," he said during
the interview here as he sped home in an SUV after a 14-hour campaign
day. "It's important for us to have good relations."</TE>
<TE>   Gutierrez, who is married and has two children, said he is an
independent leader who would seek a consensus to carry out his plans.</TE>
<TE>   "Our societies [in Latin America] are tired of the incomplete
promises of the old political parties, and they are looking for a new
alternative," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Noboa gushed about his close relations to the U.S.,
noting that Robert Kennedy Jr. is a godfather of one of his three
children, all of whom were born in the U.S. Noboa's wife is a doctor
who heads the medical brigades he sends to impoverished
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Noboa, who is fluent in English, said his business contacts would
allow him to attract foreign investment to Ecuador. He promised to
eliminate customs duties.</TE>
<TE>   "With this lure, I will bring investors, industrialists, oil
companies, farm companies and fishermen that want to invest in
Ecuador," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Noboa, who has been accused by human rights groups of having child
laborers on his vast plantations, denied the charge and says he
prohibited any workers under the age of 21.</TE>
<TE>   He also said his wealth did not prevent him from understanding the
needs of the country's poor. On Thursday, Noboa got the good news
that his hold on his fortune was secure after winning a lawsuit filed
by two of his sisters, who accused him of fraud in winning control of
the company after their father's death in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a rich guy who is for the poor," he shouted into a
microphone at his closing campaign rally. "I'm not a poor guy who is
for the rich."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>A land mine blast and clashes left 22 people dead in the Indian-held
portion of Kashmir on Saturday, the bloodiest day since a new state
government took office this month calling for an end to the violence.</LD>
<LD>   The land mine, planted by suspected separatist militants, blew up
when a bus and a truck passed over it on a busy road about 45 miles
south of Srinagar, a local police official said on condition of
anonymity. Both vehicles plunged 30 feet into a gully. Twelve people,
including six soldiers, were killed and 23 injured, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Police said 10 people died in clashes across the region, which is
at the heart of a dispute between India and Pakistan.</LD>
<TE>   Two militant groups, Jamayet-ul-Moujahedeen and
Harkat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami, claimed responsibility for the explosion in
messages to the Kashmiri news agency. A third group,
Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen, told Associated Press that it had carried out
the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrilla groups have been fighting for Kashmir's independence or
merger with Pakistan since late 1989. The violence has killed about
60,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Syed, who was sworn in Nov. 2, says
he favors peace talks and has moved to free political prisoners. But
the violence has raged unabated in Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority
state in Hindu-dominated India.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Troops Blamed in U.N. Aide's Death</HD>
<DH>An early army probe finds soldiers mistook an object in
Iain Hook's hand for a gun. Off Gaza, a suicide bombing is diverted
by the navy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alissa J. Rubin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- The Israeli army said Saturday that the preliminary
results of an investigation into the West Bank killing of a U.N. aid
worker had found that Israeli forces fired the shots after mistaking
an object in the man's hand for a gun.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli radio stations reported that the relief worker was holding
a cell phone.</LD>
<LD>   Two soldiers spotted Iain Hook, an official with the U.N. Relief
and Works Agency, during a heated gun battle in the Jenin refugee
camp between armed Palestinians and Israeli forces, according to a
statement from the Israel Defense Forces.</LD>
<TE>   The statement said that at the time, the U.N. agency's
headquarters were being used by Palestinian gunmen to fire on Israeli
forces. "The initial inquiry shows that two soldiers identified in
the UNRWA headquarters, from which Palestinians fired at the IDF
forces, a man with an object which resembles a pistol -- leading the
force to fire in his direction and hitting him."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces had reoccupied most of the Palestinian towns in the
West Bank early Friday in retaliation for a suicide bombing Thursday
morning in Jerusalem that killed 11 people, including four children.
It is the first wide-scale occupation since June and has increased
the already escalating tensions in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Army spokesmen say the soldiers are trying to hunt down 30
suspected terrorists and that the incident in Jenin came as Israeli
soldiers were trying to force Abdullah Wahsh, a member of the
extremist group Islamic Jihad, to surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians say the incursions are having severe repercussions
for the civilian population, especially in the Bethlehem area and in
the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   In Gaza, a Palestinian suicide bombing was foiled late Friday when
a naval vessel in the buffer waters near the area intercepted a small
fishing boat that apparently was headed for Israeli waters, the army
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli crew spotted the fishing boat, which carried two men,
at about 10:30 Friday night. The Israelis tried to contact the men
and warned them to leave the area. When the fishing boat failed to
respond to warning signals, the army fired at the vessel. Soon after,
the boat exploded.</TE>
<TE>   Both Palestinians died, and four Israelis suffered light to
moderate injuries. Sea-based suicide attacks are relatively rare.
Only one had previously occurred in the more than two years of
Israeli-Palestinian fighting, according to an IDF spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The episode was reminiscent of the attack, believed to have been
coordinated by the Al Qaeda terrorist network, on the U.S. destroyer
Cole off the coast of Yemen in 2000, in which a small boat rammed the
military ship, killing 17 American sailors.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli military officials, however, said they couldn't tell
whether the fishing boat was aiming to destroy the Israeli ship or
was headed to attack southern Israeli beaches.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic Jihad's military wing, known as Al Quds, claimed
responsibility for Friday's attack in a statement released in Gaza.
It said that the two men, Mohammed Almasri, 19, and Jamal Ismail, 21,
both from Gaza, were the "martyrs" involved. They vowed to continue
jihad, or holy war, against Israel until Israelis leave Palestinian
territories and Palestinians reclaim their rights.</TE>
<TE>   Retaliation was swift. Israel banned all Palestinian fishermen in
Gaza from plying the coastal waters. About 3,000 men make their
living from the sea and will lose their livelihood because of the
ban, according to Palestinian sources.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the army continued its intensive security sweep in the
West Bank. Particularly targeted was Bethlehem; the suicide bomber
responsible for Thursday's bus attack came from the area.</TE>
<TE>   Three more homes of Palestinian militants were destroyed in
Bethlehem on Saturday, bringing the total to six. The home of Ibrahim
Abayat, one of the militants who took refuge in the Church of the
Nativity during a 39-day standoff with Israeli forces last spring,
was damaged. Abayat has been sent into exile.</TE>
<TE>   Although few Israeli forces could be seen on the street in
Bethlehem on Saturday, the town was under a curfew. Shops, schools
and businesses were closed.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli forces entered the offices of Mohammed Madani, Bethlehem's
governor, breaking down the doors, damaging furniture and removing
computers.</TE>
<TE>   "They are targeting everything that is related to the sovereignty
of the Palestinian Authority," Madani said. "They are bringing down
all the pictures of [Palestinian Authority President Yasser] Arafat,
taking away the Palestinian flags and replacing them with Israeli
ones."</TE>
<TE>   Bethlehem's chief of police, Gen. Alaa Husni, charged that he and
his officers had been stripped of everything they needed to do their
job: cars, walkie-talkies, uniforms, fax machines. His officers were
taken in for questioning but released.</TE>
<TE>   "We had difficulties before, but we were functioning," he said.
"Now we cannot function at all."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli army sources did not comment on the accounts.</TE>

<HD>Miss World Contestants Leave Nigeria</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ABUJA, Nigeria</DL>
<LD>Miss World contestants in bright summer dresses and tank tops left
Nigeria for London early today after four days of sectarian violence
left more than 100 people dead and forced the pageant to move.</LD>
<LD>   Red Cross workers had recovered more than 100 bodies in Kaduna, a
northern city of several million people with a history of
Muslim-Christian violence. Nigerian Red Cross President Emmanuel
Ijewere declined Saturday to give a precise death toll for fear of
"inflaming the situation further."</LD>
<LD>   Although Abuja, the capital, appeared calm Saturday, more than 400
people were hospitalized in Kaduna, about 100 miles to the north,
with injuries suffered in the fighting, Ijewere said. At least 4,000
people were left homeless.</LD>
<TE>   Pageant officials announced Friday that they were moving the
contest to London, where it will be held Dec. 7, the same day it had
been planned for Nigeria.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was made "for the sake of the nation," pageant
publicist Stella Din said. "Even though we believe this violence is
not connected to us ... we didn't want any more bloodshed."</TE>
<TE>   The clashes started Wednesday in Kaduna and spread Friday to
Abuja, where the beauty contest was to have been held.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, mobs of Christians attacked Muslims in southern
neighborhoods of Kaduna "with new bitterness" because they viewed the
pageant's cancellation as a "Muslim victory," Ijewere said.</TE>
<TE>   In one neighborhood, Muslim and Christian mobs pursued each other
with sticks and knives. As police tried to disperse the rioters with
tear gas, gunshots also were heard.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, dozens of buildings were burning, blazes apparently
set by the mobs. A man's body lay in a gutter. Women fled the area
carrying baggage.</TE>
<TE>   Many other parts of Kaduna, however, were calm. Some residents who
took refuge in police stations and army bases began returning to
their shattered homes.</TE>
<TE>   For months, Islamic groups had complained that the beauty pageant
would promote promiscuity. Organizers insisted that the women never
intended to offend anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions boiled over after a national newspaper suggested that the
Islamic prophet Muhammad would have approved of the event. The paper
published several apologies over the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   But Muslims were deeply offended and riots erupted. President
Olusegun Obasanjo said "irresponsible journalism" set off the
turmoil.</TE>

<HD>Mexico's Plastic Pesos Fit the Bill</HD>
<DH>New currency note made with polymer film repels water, is
tough to counterfeit and lasts four times as long.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>TIJUANA -- Cash has taken on a shiny new face in Mexico, where the
government has introduced currency that is supposed to outperform the
standard peso -- lasting longer, staying drier and even helping
prevent the spread of bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico recently debuted the plastic 20-peso note, designed to be
more durable than paper money. The bills cost more to produce but are
expected to last four times longer than ordinary pesos, which often
became ragged and ripped after nine months.</LD>
<LD>   The move toward plastic currency began in Australia in 1988 and
has spread to more than 20 countries, mostly those -- such as
Bangladesh, Thailand and Indonesia -- where high humidity can turn
bills into a soggy mess.</LD>
<TE>   Australia prints the currency for several nations and was hired to
make Mexico's first batch of bills. Bruno Garoffolo, marketing
manager for Securency, the Australian company that produces the
polymer film, said the new bills repel moisture.</TE>
<TE>   "In those countries, paper bank notes will get very smelly and
very worn in a short period of time," he said. "That's where the
polymer note really jumps ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico is the first country in North America to experiment with
the innovative currency, which is slippery to the touch.</TE>
<TE>   The 20-peso notes, worth about $2, look the same as paper bills,
with a blue background and a portrait of revered 19th century
President Benito Juarez. They are flexible enough to fit into a
wallet, but they are hard to crumple and nearly impossible to tear by
hand. They also have added protections to discourage counterfeiting,
including a transparent window engraved with the number 20 and an
image formed with two 20s that can be seen only against a light.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the new currency, hair salon manager Noel Valdez
of Tijuana pulled out an old and a new bill and sprayed both with
water to demonstrate his point. The drops soaked the paper peso and
rolled off the plastic bill.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't get wet, they don't get dirty and they don't rip,"
Valdez said, as a co-worker at Filenes salon teased that he should do
a commercial for the bank. "They're not so fragile."</TE>
<TE>   Marisela Hernandez said the new security features will come in
handy at her bakery along Avenida Revolucion in Tijuana, where she is
already seeing more customers pulling out the plastic cash. To check
for fake paper money, she has to draw a line on the bill and wait to
see what color it turns. But to determine if the polymer money is
counterfeit, all she has to do is hold it up, peer through the clear
window and look for the engraved 20.</TE>
<TE>   David Mendoza, who sells newspapers and magazines at a stand
nearby, predicted that other countries will follow the trend. "It's
more practical," he said. "If they can do it, why not?"</TE>
<TE>   The United States has studied the currency but doesn't plan to
make the switch, said Claudia Dickens, spokeswoman for the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing. Dickens pointed to the increased cost as a
deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   "For right now, we are staying with the cotton and linen blend,"
she said. "But that's not to say we won't consider a polymer material
in the future."</TE>
<TE>   The Bank of Mexico may replace all of its paper currency,
depending on how the new bills fare, according to Jaime Pacreu,
director of note issue. The old 20-peso bills change hands frequently
and deteriorate quickly, causing the bank to be constantly printing
new cash.</TE>
<TE>   The bank's Web site highlights the plastic pesos, showing an
enlarged picture, describing the benefits and warning users not to
staple or burn them. In addition to durability, bank officials said,
the bills are more hygienic because they don't attract as much
bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the cost of production is 50% higher, Pacreu said he's
sure the bank will get its money's worth. It has already issued 178
million new notes and is beginning to collect paper bills.</TE>
<TE>   Just steps from the border in Tijuana, Graciela Reyes sells
blankets, statuettes and jewelry to visitors. She doesn't care if the
bills are plastic or paper, just as long as they're in her hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Money is money, it doesn't matter," she said. "I just want the
tourists to bring more of it."</TE>

<DL>AMSTERDAM</DL>
<LD>The animal rights activist charged with killing Dutch politician Pim
Fortuyn has confessed, saying he believed the anti-immigration
populist was a danger to society, prosecutors said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   In his first statement since his arrest minutes after the shooting
in May, Volkert van der Graaf, 33, said he had been concerned that
Fortuyn was gaining too much power and posed a threat to "vulnerable
members of society," the Amsterdam district attorney's office said.</LD>
<LD>   Van der Graaf also said he was worried about Fortuyn's "prejudiced
political ideas" and their possible polarizing effect, prosecutors
reported.</LD>
<TE>   He said that he had acted alone and that no one else knew he
intended to kill Fortuyn, who was a leading candidate in national
elections.</TE>
<TE>   He faces possible life imprisonment for premeditated murder, a
sentence rarely handed down here.</TE>
<TE>   Under Dutch law, prosecutors still need to prove their case in
court even when a suspect confesses. Hearings are expected to begin
early next year.</TE>
<TE>   The openly gay Fortuyn, 54, sent shockwaves through the
Netherlands' political system by calling for a halt to immigration
and branding Islam "backward."</TE>

<HD>Spain Rebuffs Allegations of Inadequate Response to Oil
Spill</HD>
<DH>Deputy prime minister tells critics that government
decisions have been timely.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LA CORUNA, Spain</DL>
<LD>Government officials rejected allegations Saturday that they have
responded slowly and clumsily to an oil spill from a sunken tanker
that has polluted hundreds of miles of coastline.</LD>
<LD>   At a stormy news conference in the northern port of La Coruna,
Deputy Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said government decisions have
been timely and resources adequate.</LD>
<LD>   When one journalist said critics were calling Spain's handling of
the crisis incompetent, Rajoy, the minister in charge of dealing with
the spill, replied, "I don't agree."</LD>
<TE>   In the week since thick fuel oil from the tanker Prestige began
hitting beaches in northwestern Spain, the government has faced
growing criticism from environmental groups and the media that
efforts to protect the coast have been inadequate and the cleanup
slow and disorganized.</TE>
<TE>   The 26-year-old single-hulled tanker, ruptured in a storm Nov. 13,
left a trail of oil while being towed out to sea before sinking
Tuesday in deep waters. The oil has washed up on beaches and rocks
over a 250-mile stretch of the Galician coast, coating seabirds and
endangering shellfish stocks vital to the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoy blamed several days of storms off northwestern Spain for
some problems. He said a French and a Dutch ship able to scoop oil
from the sea were confined to port because they could not operate in
high waves.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a question of us not having ships available," he said,
expressing the hope that the weather would improve enough for ships
to leave port Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Brushing aside questions over whether Madrid was too slow to seek
outside help, Rajoy said a German cleanup ship was due Monday and
ships from Britain and Belgium on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have complained that volunteers have not been
allowed to take part in the cleanup. Rajoy announced that cleanup
teams would be doubled to nearly 900 people and that volunteers would
be given work.</TE>
<TE>   About 900 tons of oil have been scraped off the beaches, and Spain
has 15 miles of barriers ready to try to protect the coast, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the news conference, activists from the environmental
group Greenpeace held up a banner with "Oil Kills" daubed on it in
oil, next to buckets of fuel oil recovered from the beaches. "They
should be working more quickly, with more resources, and they should
remove the slick at sea before it gets to the coast," said Juan
Lopez, director of Greenpeace Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoy said the government estimated that the Prestige had spilled
about 11,000 tons of fuel oil, far less than the 20,000 tons
estimated by Greenpeace. He said the spill could not be described as
a "black tide," the Spanish phrase for a large oil slick, but only as
"very localized" patches.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoy said experts believed that the rest of the Prestige's
77,000-ton cargo of fuel oil, which went down with the ship, turned
into a nearly solid mass in the chilly ocean depths -- meaning it is
unlikely to bubble to the surface.</TE>
<TE>   A French mini-submarine will arrive in the "coming days" to
investigate whether oil is still leaking from the ship, he said.</TE>

<HD>Waiting to Die on Banks of a River of Salvation</HD>
<DH>Indian society is harsh on widows. Many come to Varanasi on
the Ganges, a waterway they say has the power to end their torment
forever.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Watson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>VARANASI, India</DL>
<LD>Scissors snip, and the widow tears a strip of old dress cloth. Then
she snips and rips again, repeating a tedious ritual with only one
salvation in sight. Maybe this will be the day she dies. In a long
lifetime of torment, each day that she stays alive allows death to
punish her a little more by making her wait.</LD>
<LD>   Kamala Devi Mukherjee, 70, sits barefoot in the doorway of a dark
sweatshop where there is just enough room for two rickety looms and
stacks of sari cloth waiting to be torn and weaved into bedcovers.
The piecework pays less than a dollar a day. With the few cents she
earns daily cleaning three families' homes, Mukherjee has enough to
rent a room where she sleeps on the floor.</LD>
<LD>   Indian society can be especially harsh on widows. Barred by their
Hindu faith from remarrying, many are left with little education, few
skills and no one to support them.</LD>
<TE>   Although some progressive families shrug off the customary ban on
remarrying, which only applies to women, the majority of Hindus still
uphold it. That leaves many widows with a painful choice: suffer in
silence or, like Mukherjee, strike out on your own.</TE>
<TE>   Like many widows before her, Mukherjee left her village home 15
years ago to live alone here in the holy city of Varanasi. The widows
believe that by dying here, on the banks of the mother Ganges River,
they will be reunited with their creator and the recurring cycle of
birth, death and reincarnation will cease. This moment of liberation
is called moksha, and with it, an infinite pain passes.</TE>
<TE>   "I now want to die quickly," Mukherjee said through an
interpreter, pulling on another strip of cloth. "I've had enough
suffering in my life."</TE>
<TE>   She can find no comfort in childhood memories. Mukherjee's parents
sold her in marriage to a farmer from Diamond Harbor, in West Bengal
state, when she was 7. Her newlywed husband, Bijoy, was a widower
with four children. The child bride visited his home only once, then
returned to her parents after Mukherjee's father had second thoughts
about the groom, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after they were married, Bijoy died. At 9, Mukherjee was
a widow, bound by ancient tradition to remain faithful to a man she
had never really known, let alone loved.</TE>
<TE>   She lived with her parents in the West Bengal city of Navadwip and
learned the harsh lessons of survival as a social outcast. Before
long, her parents were dead too, and Mukherjee lost her last refuge.</TE>
<TE>   "My brother, together with his wife, stopped giving me food and
fought regularly," she said. "I tolerated it for a long time and when
I could not take it any more, I came here."</TE>
<TE>   A recent study by Varanasi social workers Rolee Singh and her
husband, Rajeev, concluded that between 2,000 and 5,000 impoverished
widows from other parts of India are in Varanasi waiting to die.
There is just one government-run shelter for them. It has room for
only 16 women.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the city's widows have fled physical and emotional abuse,
and fall victim to more in Varanasi. Rolee Singh says that
mistreatment of widows is common in Indian society, especially in
rural areas where most of the country's 1 billion people live.</TE>
<TE>   Singh took in a widow whose son beat her so badly that she was
paralyzed in one arm. It was punishment for shaming the family by
working as a maid, the social worker said.</TE>
<TE>   Varanasi's widows are easy prey for merchants or charlatan sadhus,
or holy men, who roam the steps leading to the Ganges in search of
naive pilgrims or gullible tourists.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some fake sadhus who wear [holy] saffron dress but who
are criminals at heart and who exploit these women sexually," Singh
said. "Once it happens to them, they stay quiet because it is a big
shame here in India to be raped or sexually exploited."</TE>
<TE>   Widows are expected to live by often humiliating social rules. The
worst rituals of the past -- such as shaving their heads or
committing suicide on their husbands' funeral pyres -- are rare
nowadays.</TE>
<TE>   But the women still are supposed to sleep on the floor, eat a
bland vegetarian diet that excludes onions or garlic, dress plainly
without makeup, and stay away from public celebrations such as
weddings.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions are rationalized, in part, as essential to
suppressing a widow's sexual desires so that she will not be tempted
to betray her late husband, said Singh, whose charity has begun
aiding some of the destitute widows in Varanasi.</TE>
<TE>   "As a child, a girl is taught that when she marries, her husband
is God," Singh said. "She has to bow and touch her husband's feet in
respect. When he dies, she is left blank and doesn't know what to do
or where to go."</TE>
<TE>   Even in their desperation, the widows often feel better off in
Varanasi because they are free for the first time in their lives,
Singh said.</TE>
<TE>   "In India, the day a girl-child is born in a house she has to take
orders from her father," she said. "When she gets married, she has to
take orders from her husband. And in the last stage of life, she must
take orders from her son.</TE>
<TE>   "So it is infused in a woman's blood that she has to take orders
from somebody. They get used to exploitation by men. For these
widows, their strength comes from realizing enough is enough. And
then they come here to fend for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   In a society at times so cruel to its women, the river Ganges is a
mythological mother treated with the utmost reverence. It flows about
1,600 miles from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, but it is much
more than a mighty river to Hindus; she is a goddess linking Heaven
and Earth, and a sprinkling of her water can purify an unclean soul
and heal an afflicted body.</TE>
<TE>   More than 38,000 corpses are cremated each year in pyres that
blaze at the riverbanks, day and night. The ashes are poured into the
river, which carries them to Heaven. In time, they will be
reincarnated and return to Earth to suffer again.</TE>
<TE>   Only those who die in the waters of the Ganges, or are sprinkled
with them as they breathe their last breaths, achieve absolute
salvation.</TE>
<TE>   It takes conviction to believe in the purity of the Ganges, where
thousands of Hindu pilgrims gather each morning to pray and dip in a
river filthy with raw sewage, partially cremated body parts and even
the odd complete, if slightly charred, corpse.</TE>
<TE>   Every morning, Mukherjee joins thousands of Hindus who gather on
the steps, or ghats, that line the riverbank. She immerses herself in
the holy water, prays for liberation from this world, and then walks
to the small weaving factory to tear more dress cloth.</TE>
<TE>   She passes beggars in the streets, many of them widows like her,
and is determined not to join them. Mukherjee, a high-caste Brahmin,
insists that she will survive on her own sweat and toil, or not at
all.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, I've had to go through various hardships because of
this decision," she said. "There were times when I went without food
for three to four days at a stretch. But even then, I never begged."</TE>
<TE>   The rhythm of each workday is set by the gentle slip and clack of
the loom as another widow, Shobha Rani Debnath, 65, passes a
rough-hewn shuttle back and forth, pressing the loom's pedals with
her big toe. Mukherjee has a lot of time to think as she works, but
the death she so anxiously awaits rarely disturbs her mind, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell me, is there any point?" she asked. "Here, I have to work
and earn my living. Death will come in its own time, and when it
takes me away, I will be happy that I have been released from this
world and its suffering."</TE>
<TE>   Reena Roy, 51, doesn't have far to go from morning prayers in the
Ganges to the place where she earns her living. It is a spot on a
busy sidewalk where thousands of pilgrims pass each day, sometimes
dropping a coin into her tin bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Roy has staked out a prime position in a line of begging widows
beside one of the oldest and most popular ritual sites on the Ganges,
called Dasaswamedh Ghat. She is a woman of solemn dignity, sitting on
a piece of plastic sacking, anchored by two bricks and a rock.</TE>
<TE>   She has nothing more than a bottle of river water, a few
belongings and her faith.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Sudhir, a grocery shop owner, died 12 years ago of
lung cancer. Without children to support her, Roy got by as best she
could on the little money left over after a long struggle to keep her
husband alive.</TE>
<TE>   "Even after selling all our property, I could not save him, and
now I have been reduced to this state," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the day, Roy rarely has more than 40 cents. It's
been a year since she left the village of Bokultala in West Bengal
and made this stretch of walkway her home. She has only strayed from
the riverside once, when a pilgrim offered a place in a shelter for
widows run by a Hindu charity.</TE>
<TE>   "I found it very crowded after staying for two days, and later
even the kind gentleman who had taken me there told me that it was
actually meant for widows older than me," she said. "I returned and
have never gone back there again."</TE>
<TE>   For all of her troubles, Roy says she is happy because as she
waits for this life to end, in hope that she will never have to live
again, she has peace of mind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only the rains that cause a bit of a problem, given the kind
of place I stay," she said. "But I have learned to live with these
minor problems."</TE>
<TE>   At night, she lies down just across from where she begs, sleeping
next to two small temples, whose idols watch over her.</TE>
<TE>   One is Kali, a black-skinned goddess wearing a necklace of severed
heads, earrings fashioned out of children's corpses, and serpent
bracelets. Blood drips from her lips. She is death itself. Nearby
stands a more reassuring idol to the river goddess Ganga Ma, or
Mother Ganges, who nourishes and restores. It is her blessing that
Roy seeks.</TE>
<TE>   And as the widow sleeps, just steps from the river, she is not far
from salvation.</TE>

identification. But Montes, 23, had lost his identity card years ago
and didn't want to pay the $15 replacement fee.</LD>
<LD>   That's how Montes and two dozen other men wound up in a temporary
pen in a parking lot outside the police station one hot morning last
month.</LD>
<TE>   "My wife and my child depend on my work for food," he said as he
lolled against the metal barricade. "What am I going to do? The
government isn't going to do anything for them."</TE>
<TE>   Montes was caught in the middle of Colombia's newest effort
against leftist rebels who have waged war against the government for
nearly four decades.</TE>
<TE>   In September, President Alvaro Uribe declared two regions of
Colombia "rehabilitation zones," giving the police and military
sweeping powers of arrest and detention in those areas.</TE>
<TE>   One zone covers the northern half of Arauca province, where Los
Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. operates a key oil pipeline
that is a target for the rebels. The second covers parts of Sucre and
Bolivar, two provinces in northern Colombia surrounding this regional
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Police and military officials can now stop and detain for up to 24
hours anyone not carrying state-issued identification. They can
conduct searches and seizures without judicial warrants. And they
have the right to restrict the entry of foreigners, including
journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Other parts of the country may be designated as rehabilitation
zones in the future, after the government determines whether the new
powers are effective in shutting down guerrilla operations. The
government has implemented areas of increased military control
before, but the zones mark the first time that such powers have been
declared since peace talks with the guerrillas collapsed in February.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups are concerned that the new controls will be
abused, especially by the military. In the past, the Colombian army
has been linked to human rights violations, including cooperation
with right-wing paramilitary groups that commit massacres, although
in recent years complaints have dropped dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in favor of the zone, but my worry is this: In the rush to
show results, the military or police may commit excesses," said
Rodrigo Torres, citizen ombudsman for Carmen de Bolivar, a dusty
crossroads in Bolivar province recently shaken by a series of
guerrilla bombings.</TE>
<TE>   The sweeping powers also have concerned journalists, who worry
that the government will be able to control coverage. The Los Angeles
Times and other media groups filed a letter of protest over the
restrictions. The office of the president responded by imposing
further restrictions on the press, demanding that even Colombian-born
workers for foreign media request special permission to travel to the
zones.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian military officials, however, say that protecting human
rights and the rule of law is a top priority. They have vowed to use
their special privileges only in extreme cases. So far, all arrests
and searches performed since the zones took effect Sept. 21 have had
judicial approval.</TE>
<TE>   The most hard-hitting measure to date came late last month when
the military prohibited all traffic on regional roads between 10 p.m.
and 5 a.m. Rural roads are closed after 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to make it harder for the criminal elements here to
operate," said navy Capt. Alejandro Parra, the top military commander
for the zone for Sucre and Bolivar. "For ordinary citizens, we want
to maintain a normal life without disrupting economic or individual
liberties."</TE>
<TE>   A tour through the rehabilitation zone established in this hilly,
hot country in north-central Colombia revealed both the dangers and
benefits of the new policy, which by and large has been welcomed by
residents. The Times had to obtain government permission for the
tour.</TE>
<TE>   About 24 counties with a total of about half a million people make
up the rehabilitation zone in Sucre and Bolivar, mostly poor,
forgotten places where residents cling to a precarious existence as
small farmers or cattle ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   Running through the middle of the counties are the hills and
valleys of the Maria Mountains that have long sheltered rebels. The
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and the smaller
National Liberation Army, or ELN, operate here, as does a third
leftist army that is smaller still.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that, the region is far from being the center of
Colombia's bloody internal conflict. Nearly three years ago,
paramilitary fighters from the United Self-Defense Forces of
Colombia, an illegal right-wing army dedicated to defeating the
guerrillas, began a vicious campaign against the rebels here.</TE>
<TE>   The fighters committed massacre after massacre in the hills,
killing as many as 36 people at a time, sometimes with rocks.</TE>
<TE>   In at least two cases, the military unit that now controls the
region -- the navy's 1st Brigade Marine Corps -- was investigated for
allegedly helping the paramilitaries. The former commander, Adm.
Rodrigo Quinonez, is still under investigation by government
prosecutors for allegedly having ignored warnings of an impending
massacre in the town of Chengue.</TE>
<TE>   "That whole area has been horrible for a long time," said Robin
Kirk, New York-based Human Rights Watch's Colombia specialist.
Politicians and the military were always "overlooking things."</TE>
<TE>   The repeated attacks had the effect, however, of depriving the
guerrillas of support in small towns as villagers rushed to urban
centers to flee the violence. And combat among the rebels,
paramilitaries and army over the last several years has significantly
weakened the guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Military and government officials believe that the tougher laws
will allow them to better attack the rebels -- perhaps even clear
them from the region.</TE>
<TE>   Such an accomplishment would be a public relations coup just as
Washington is demanding more results from Colombia's armed forces
before providing more military aid. Over the last decade, the rebels
have relentlessly expanded their reach to every province, save an
island off the nation's Caribbean coast.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get rid of all the outlaw groups, the guerrillas, the
paramilitaries, whoever," said Aida Luz Gonzalez, interior secretary
for Sucre province, who is the chief point of contact between the
civilian and military forces in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Military and police officials have stopped and reviewed the
identification cards of 10% of the population since the zone was
declared, Parra told reporters last month, resulting in 83 arrests --
45 for allegedly belonging to rebel groups and the rest on standard
criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   Civilian officials, meanwhile, are hoping to step up social
spending. Uribe's government has told provincial leaders that the new
zones will have priority over other provinces when it comes to
projects such as paving roads and building new schools.</TE>
<TE>   "These are poor people, 100% of them dirt farmers," said Alvaro
Martinez, mayor of Chalan, a small town near the site of a massacre
in 2001. "Along with the military aid, there also must be social
investment."</TE>
<TE>   Local human rights officials have received complaints of police
abuse. In one case, police arrested a man for having too much food in
his house, accusing him of acting as a quartermaster for the
guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   The family, which had been displaced after fleeing paramilitary
violence, protested, saying the Red Cross had visited recently to
supply them with staples for a month. The man has yet to be released.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, police detained a man suspected of working with
the guerrillas. They released him, but rearrested him three days
later after an explosion blew out the windows of a city councilman's
home.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they found dynamite in the man's home during a
warrantless search. The man's wife said police had planted the
dynamite, and one municipal official who has reviewed files in the
case said he is inclined to believe her. The man remains in
detention. Human rights officials are investigating the complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "They had just arrested this guy three days earlier. What is the
chance he would go back home and store dynamite in his house?" the
municipal official said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, nearly all residents interviewed in the region over several
days last month welcomed the new security measures.</TE>
<TE>   Police stopped a bus on a roadblock outside Carmen de Bolivar one
recent weekday afternoon. All the passengers were forced off and
searched before continuing on their way. None complained. "This is
the price we pay for security," said Javier Lombana, 30, a teacher.
"We need this kind of security."</TE>
<TE>   Even some of those held in the temporary pen outside the police
station with Montes said they didn't mind being dragged in off the
street.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good thing in my case," said Eder Contreras, 42, caught
up in the sweep and detained after police learned that he had an
outstanding child-support warrant. "I deserved it."</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear what happened to Montes and Contreras afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the welcome from locals, challenges abound. The 1st
Brigade Marine Corps lacks equipment and manpower. The brigade has
only a single aging Huey helicopter, which has an improvised
machine-gun mount welded to the side. Local troops are transported
across terrible roads in unarmored trucks. Intelligence and
communications are limited. And the same privations apply to the
local police. A police intelligence official in Sincelejo could not
track down a squad of his men breaking into a home to conduct a
search last month because he could not establish radio contact.</TE>
<TE>   But even with the renewed military determination, it is clear that
the guerrillas will not go quietly into the Colombian night. One FARC
front declared all foreigners in the zone military targets the day
that two foreign journalists visited recently.</TE>
<TE>   Early last month, militia groups linked to FARC set off four bombs
at homes around Carmen de Bolivar, the first attacks the rebels have
launched since the zones were declared.</TE>
<TE>   One of the targets, Erlando del Valle, 48, a city councilman,
marveled that he escaped harm from the blast that blew out the
windows in his house as he slept.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is a zone of rehabilitation," he asked, "why do we have
so little protection?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miller was recently on assignment in Sincelejo.</TE>

<HD>Port Labor Deal Struck</HD>
<DH>Longshore union and shipping lines agree on a six-year
contract. Bush hails accord as good for workers, employers and the
American economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After months of acrimony and costly showdowns that rippled through
the national economy, the longshore union and shipping companies
reached a deal late Saturday on a labor contract covering all U.S.
commercial ports on the West Coast.</LD>
<LD>   Details of the six-year contract were sketchy, but it was clear
that both sides gave deeply while winning important concessions.
Talks had intensified over the last week as senior federal mediator
Peter J. Hurtgen pushed for a deal before the Thanksgiving holiday.</LD>
<LD>   "I am very pleased that labor and management have reached an
agreement concerning the West Coast ports," President Bush said in a
statement, which was released by the White House as negotiators
signed the deal in San Francisco. "This agreement is good for
workers, good for employers and it's good for America's economy."</LD>
<TE>   The agreement, which must be ratified by union members, was
reached about one month before the expiration of a federal injunction
that kept the ports open and operating normally.</TE>
<TE>   Bush sought the court order last month under the Taft-Hartley Act
after alleged union slowdowns and a 10-day management lockout created
chaos on the waterfront and beyond.</TE>
<TE>   The Taft-Hartley Act, which was last invoked in 1978, has rarely
led to successful contracts, and instead often antagonizes both
parties in the dispute, according to labor historians.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, however, Hurtgen and two other federal mediators,
along with AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard Trumka, were credited
with being moderating forces at the table.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents about 80 shipping
lines and terminal operators, came away with the right to implement
labor-saving technology, such as computer systems that allow cargo
lists to flow directly into terminals rather than being retyped by
union clerks.</TE>
<TE>   Those systems and other new equipment, such as optical scanners
and remote cameras, will speed cargo movements while eliminating
hundreds of high-wage clerical jobs. The industry had unsuccessfully
sought such an agreement in the previous two contracts.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union's 10,500
dockworkers won substantial increases in their pensions and held on
to fully paid family health insurance, with large premium increases
being absorbed completely by the employers.</TE>
<TE>   The shipping group last month offered a pension that would have
put maximum benefits at $50,000 a year. The union insisted on far
more, up to $70,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The final amount was not released Saturday, but was said to fall
between the two proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Wages increased moderately overall, although some skilled
equipment operators will see large gains.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiators for the union and shipping association signed the full
contract in San Francisco about 10:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Hurtgen declined to discuss details of the plan until it is
ratified by union members, but said it "provides substantial
improvement in wages and benefits for the union's members."</TE>
<TE>   "It also provides necessary technology and dispute resolution
improvements needed to ensure that America's West Coast ports
continue to modernize and increase in both efficiency and
productivity," Hurtgen said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The chief adversaries during the talks were James Spinosa,
president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, and
Joseph Miniace, president of the Pacific Maritime Assn.</TE>
<TE>   At the first meeting with Hurtgen last summer, Spinosa stormed out
of the federal building, incensed that Miniace had arrived with a
pair of armed bodyguards. Miniace insisted that the bodyguards were
warranted because he had received death threats.</TE>
<TE>   Miniace, a seasoned and tough contract negotiator, had no maritime
experience before being tapped for the maritime association's top job
in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Union negotiators often complained that his hard-line approach in
talks upset a long-standing friendly relationship between the union
and management.</TE>
<TE>   Several shipping company executives, however, said they had grown
resentful of what they described as the union's sense of entitlement
and refusal to accept new technology. They said they hired Miniace
specifically to change the dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement issued as the contract was signed, Miniace
indirectly addressed those frictions.</TE>
<TE>   "With this contract, we are ushering in a new era of
modernization," he said. "It's also time to usher in a new era of
mutual respect and trust between the PMA and ILWU."</TE>
<TE>   Union officials could not be immediately reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The contract represents a milestone that some compare to the 1960
Mechanization and Modernization Agreement, which was forged by the
union's iconic longtime president, Harry Bridges.</TE>
<TE>   That agreement allowed the industry to ship cargo in truck-sized
containers that were loaded and unloaded by cranes, rather than the
old, inefficient method of piling goods onto pallets.</TE>
<TE>   Containerization eliminated thousands of union jobs and led to
huge increases in productivity on the docks.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, Bridges wanted guarantees that all remaining jobs
stayed in the union, and that union members shared in the new wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Longshore wages increased dramatically as a result, and now ILWU
members are among the highest-paid blue-collar workers in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   According to the shipping association, annual wages range from
about $80,000 to more than $150,000.</TE>

<HD>Regulators Face a Bilingual Conundrum</HD>
<DH>A proposed merger poses a question: Are Spanish-language
media their own market?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Meg James and Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years ago when millions of viewers tuned in to the planet's
premier sporting event -- World Cup soccer -- they heard pop
sensation Ricky Martin belting out the tournament's theme song, "Cup
of Life."</LD>
<LD>   But when the matches returned to TV last spring, the voice they
heard woven through the coverage was of a virtual unknown,
18-year-old Jennifer Pena. She had an inside track: Univision
Communications Inc., which owns the U.S. broadcast rights to the
games, had just signed her to a record deal. Not coincidentally,
Pena's album was released during the June tournament.</LD>
<LD>   Univision's choice of singers illustrates the growing moxie of a
media behemoth that has far grander plans for itself. Univision
already is the king of Spanish-language TV. Last year, it created its
own record label. And now the company wants to spend more than $2
billion to take over the nation's largest Spanish-language radio
chain, Hispanic Broadcasting Corp.</LD>
<TE>   If the merger is approved by federal regulators, Univision will
obtain a lock on two-thirds of all Spanish-language advertising in
the U.S., while gaining an unmatched platform for its talent -- a
prospect that raises concerns about conflicts of interests.</TE>
<TE>   "The only reason Jennifer Pena got to sing the song was because
she was on Univision's label," said Roland Garcia, founder of small,
Texas-based Hacienda Records. "They can make their own hits, and they
will put us out of business."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the proposed merger has churned up turbulence among many
players who once were consigned to the sidelines of the
multibillion-dollar English-language broadcast industry but now find
themselves battling for the riches of an exploding Latino market.</TE>
<TE>   Protests have been voiced to the Federal Communications
Commission, including one from Hispanic Broadcasting's chief
competitor and another from a Latino advocacy group headed by New
York state Sen. Efrain Gonzalez Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not in our best interests for Univision to control the
Hispanic market in the United States," he said. "No one else will be
able to compete.... You create Shamu and guess what? It eats all the
little fish."</TE>
<TE>   Univision executives argue that the merger would strengthen the
overall economics of a traditionally underserved sector of the market
and that they expect regulators will bless the deal in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   But the antitrust review will be unlike any other undertaken by
regulators during the past decade of media mergers, legal experts
say. The government must decide whether Spanish-language media are a
distinct market or a small slice of the nation's overall advertising
and broadcasting pie.</TE>
<TE>   "The commission is being called upon to make a decision which
could have extraordinary consequences," said Washington
communications attorney Vince Pepper, who has argued many cases
before the FCC. "If you start recognizing a foreign language as a
subgroup of the market, then you are involving the government in
waters in which it has never stuck its toes."</TE>
<TE>   Univision contends that it is part of the overall media market
because it competes for advertising dollars alongside such giants as
Viacom Inc. and Walt Disney Co., each of which owns television
networks, radio stations and other assets.</TE>
<TE>   A ruling that Spanish-language broadcasting stands alone would
probably sink the Univision merger because the combined company would
amount to a monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   Univision was bought in 1992 by reclusive Los Angeles billionaire
A. Jerrold Perenchio, who recognized the immense growth potential in
the Latino market. In the last decade, he has guided the company from
annual sales of about $200 million to a projected $1.2 billion this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Corporate America has caught on.</TE>
<TE>   Companies ranging from the Krispy Kreme doughnut chain to the
distillers of Dom Perignon have increased their marketing budgets in
an effort to woo Latino consumers, who spend an estimated $580
billion a year. In April, General Electric Co.'s NBC spent $2 billion
to acquire Telemundo, the second-largest Spanish-language TV network
in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is the market hotter than in Los Angeles, the nation's
largest -- and most competitive -- Latino media center. Univision's
evening newscast on KMEX-TV Channel 34 often outdraws such
English-language counterparts as KABC Channel 7, KNBC Channel 4 and
KCBS Channel 2 for viewers.</TE>
<TE>   With the acquisition of Hispanic Broadcasting, Univision's reach
would extend to 55 radio stations, including five in Los Angeles. One
of them, KSCA-FM (101.9), has ranked as the region's No. 1 station
for most of the last five years among listeners ages 25 to 54, a
group coveted by advertisers.</TE>
<TE>   Since Univision created its new record label, it has quickly
captured nearly a quarter of the U.S. Latin music market, according
to Nielsen SoundScan. Univision plans to launch a cable channel next
month devoted to music videos.</TE>
<TE>   Because Univision already is so dominant, the possible addition of
a huge radio chain has presented a minefield for regulators as they
try to determine the impact on specific markets and advertisers who
are worried about getting squeezed for higher rates.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Justice Department antitrust investigators have
been gathering documents on ad rates and audience size from
Univision's competitors and advertisers. They also are examining
whether Univision controls radio stations in Latino markets where it
is seeking an even stronger hold.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators specifically are interested in the long-standing
relationship between Univision and Santa Monica-based Entravision
Communications Corp., which owns Spanish-language TV and radio
stations.</TE>
<TE>   Government rules prohibit a company from owning more than eight
stations in any market. The question being pursued by regulators is
whether Univision essentially is controlling Entravision through its
31% ownership. If so, then the proposed merger might put Univision
over the government limits.</TE>
<TE>   To try to assuage regulators, two senior Univision executives
resigned in August from Entravision's board. Univision also has vowed
to convert its interest in Entravision into nonvoting stock if the
merger is approved.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Univision passes that test, another awaits: Regulators
must be convinced that Univision's new stations would remain truly
competitive with those in which it already has an interest.</TE>
<TE>   And if that isn't enough to keep regulators busy, then there's
this question: Are television and radio separate markets, or do they
compete with each other for the same advertising dollars? Univision
is arguing that they are distinct markets, meaning the company could
own a big piece of both without monopolizing either one.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the merger, however, are not content to wait for the
resolution of those technical issues. They recently stepped up a
behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign to muddy the merger by targeting
the role of Hispanic Broadcasting's biggest shareholder, Clear
Channel Communications, which already is embroiled in a number of
controversies involving alleged anti-competitive tactics in its radio
and concert divisions.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the proposed union accuse Clear Channel of secretly
masterminding the deal in possible violation of an agreement with the
FCC. The radio chain, by far the largest in the U.S., obtained the
agency's approval for its stake in Hispanic Broadcasting only after
vowing to be a "passive" investor with nonvoting stock.</TE>
<TE>   That assurance was necessary to avoid monopoly problems because of
the high number of stations Clear Channel controls in various
markets.</TE>
<TE>   But documents submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission
detailing the proposed merger suggest that Clear Channel instigated
the talks that led to the deal. Here, according to the documents, is
what transpired:</TE>
<TE>   The first overture came in an e-mail from Clear Channel's chief
financial officer, Randall Mays, to Univision's senior vice
president. Mays told the executive that another company was making a
play for its 26% share of Hispanic Broadcasting. Mays said that if
Univision executives wanted in the game, they should contact him.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Univision officials got a call from Clear
Channel's outside financial advisor, again asking whether Univision
was interested in its piece of the broadcaster. Univision said it
would only if a deal could be made for full control of the radio
chain.</TE>
<TE>   A third contact came two weeks later, when Clear Channel's Mays
saw Univision's senior vice president at a broadcasters' convention
in Las Vegas and pitched his plan face-to-face.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks, it became clear to Univision that it could, in fact,
purchase not only Clear Channel's holding but all of Hispanic
Broadcasting, whose executives were fielding offers from other
suitors. One of those was archrival Spanish Broadcasting System Inc.,
which owns 24 stations nationwide and has become the most vocal
critic of the proposed merger.</TE>
<TE>   Mays declined to discuss his company's role in the talks except to
say, "We have nothing to do with the operations of Hispanic
[Broadcasting]."</TE>
<TE>   But critics argue that if FCC regulators believe there is evidence
that Clear Channel was more than a passive bystander in Hispanic
Broadcasting strategy, there could be grounds to delay or even reject
the merger.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the controversy, U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los
Angeles) said critics of the deal should keep Univision's size in
perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "As big as Univision is, it hasn't been able to get its fair share
from the advertising pie," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe a stronger player [in Spanish-language broadcasting] will
be what it takes to get advertisers up to the table and willing to
pay more."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two Spanish-language powerhouses seek to marry:</TE>
<TE>   Spanish-language TV giant Univision Communications Inc. is seeking
to buy the nation's largest Spanish-language radio chain, Hispanic
Broadcasting Corp., for more than $2 billion. If the deal is approved
by federal regulators, Univision will capture an estimated two-thirds
of all Spanish-language advertising in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Univision plunged into the record business last year, financing
its own Univision Music Group and then purchasing independent
Fonovisa Records for about $230 million. Univision Music Group, with
such artists as singer Jennifer Pena, left, now accounts for about
22% of the U.S. Latin music market, according to Nielsen SoundScan.</TE>
<TE>   Univision owns 53 TV stations. In Los Angeles, Univision's evening
newscast on KMEX-TV Channel 34, featuring Eduardo Quezada, left, as
news anchor, often outdraws such English-language counterparts as
KABC Channel 7, KNBC Channel 4 and KCBS Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   Hispanic Broadcasting Corp. owns 55 radio stations, including five
in Los Angeles. One of them, KSCA-FM (101.9), has ranked as the
region's No. 1 station for most of the last five years among
listeners ages 25 to 54, a demographic group coveted by advertisers.
It features the nationally syndicated show of Renan Almendarez
Coello, below, who is Los Angeles' top-rated morning host.</TE>

<HD>Back From Political Exile, Gary Hart Brings a Warning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.R. Moehringer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Gary Hart wants to scare you.</LD>
<LD>   The former Democratic senator from Colorado has emerged from
political exile to become the Cassandra of terrorism, issuing bleak
predictions about the next attack on American soil.</LD>
<LD>   He made national news last month when a task force he co-chaired
issued a chilling report on terrorism in the U.S. "In all
likelihood," the report warned, "the next attack will result in even
greater casualties and widespread disruption to American lives and
the economy."</LD>
<TE>   But the report didn't generate enough urgency to suit Hart, so he
has been crusading to keep it alive -- appearing on talk shows,
giving speeches and writing newspaper editorials.</TE>
<TE>   "We are scarcely safer today than when we were first attacked," he
wrote in last Sunday's Denver Post. "And now we face the real
prospect of a major war and the trigger that war will provide to
those waiting for motivation and occasion to kill Americans in their
homes."</TE>
<TE>   While trying to scare Americans out of their complacency, Hart
seems to have given himself a jolt. He has rediscovered his voice and
rekindled his passion for public service. In the process, he has
stirred rumors of another presidential run -- rumors Hart has done
nothing to discourage.</TE>
<TE>   Days after the release of the terrorism report, he addressed
Colorado business and academic leaders at a lunch sponsored by
PricewaterhouseCoopers and the University of Colorado at Denver
Business School. Stepping to the lectern, Hart declared: "Today I am
announcing my candidacy for the pres -- ooh, sorry, wrong speech."</TE>
<TE>   There was a burst of nervous laughter, followed by enthusiastic
applause, which Hart visibly enjoyed.</TE>
<TE>   Given the rout of Democrats in the midterm elections this month,
and the subsequent scramble for new leadership, Hart's reemergence
has intrigued voters and political observers here. And their reaction
has intrigued Hart. In an interview at Coudert Bros., the
high-powered international law firm where he has a corner office,
Hart admits that he has grown restless in exile. "There are only two
positions in politics in America: on the field or on the sidelines.
And on the sidelines," he says, "you are not heard."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he won't say just how he intends to make himself heard. Nor
will he reveal specific plans he's making. "It's not about politics,"
he says. "It's about public service. I've tried to find a way to help
my country. And I'll continue to do that."</TE>
<TE>   He laments the lack of options for seasoned politicians who want
to keep contributing.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no ground for statesmanship in this country," he says.
"Most people, after they've been in politics, disappear. One didn't
hear much from Fritz Mondale until two weeks ago. One has heard very
little from Mike Dukakis."</TE>
<TE>   In the nearly 15 years since his presidential campaign was
derailed by a sex scandal, Hart says he has tried not to disappear.
He has written six books. He has earned a doctorate from Oxford
University. He has offered advice to politicians willing to listen.
"I gave Bill Clinton all kinds of ideas," he says, "including to
intervene in Ireland, which he took and ran with."</TE>
<TE>   Hart, 64, looks fit and well rested. Married to Lee, his wife of
44 years, he still lives in Troublesome Gulch, a community in the
foothills of the Rocky Mountains. His wild Beethoven hair has grown
more unruly and more gray, but his voice has deepened to a
professorial timbre.</TE>
<TE>   The first time he helped assemble a report on terrorism was in
January 2001. Appointed by Clinton to co-chair a commission on
national security, Hart and former GOP Sen. Warren B. Rudman of New
Hampshire, plus experts from both major parties, issued an
unequivocal prediction: The U.S. will be attacked on its own soil,
and the loss of life will be catastrophic.</TE>
<TE>   The prediction went largely ignored -- until terrorists attacked
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon last year. Then Hart found
himself hailed as a prophet.</TE>
<TE>   The Council on Foreign Relations recently asked Hart and Rudman to
tackle the same topic again. The Hart-Rudman task force issued its
report Oct. 25 with an ominously familiar finding: More than one year
after Sept. 11, 2001, the report asserts, the country still is
unprepared.</TE>
<TE>   The report catalogs many gaping holes in homeland defense:
Security at ports remains lax; water and food supplies continue to be
vulnerable; energy distribution centers provide easy targets; and
local law enforcement officials receive scant funding, inadequate
training and no intelligence about terrorists on "watch lists."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from governmental vigilance, Hart stresses the need for an
alert citizenry. "The tag line of every speech I've given over the
last two years on this subject is: 'You in this audience are now
front-line soldiers.'</TE>
<TE>   "This war's being fought in our streets and cities. Nobody's going
to ride in. The 82d Airborne isn't coming. The 1st Marine Division
isn't going to be here. It'll be the Colorado National Guard. The
cops on the beat. The fire and emergency management people. We're all
going to have to get into this. Now, why can't the president say
that?"</TE>
<TE>   While the Hart-Rudman report stops short of criticizing President
Bush by name, Hart doesn't. He decries Bush's readiness to invade
Iraq, saying the nation isn't ready: "It's imprudent and it's folly.
The threats to this country are going to skyrocket the minute the
first U.S. soldier crosses the Iraqi border."</TE>
<TE>   Hart accepts every speaking invitation offered these days, he
says, no matter what size the group, "not because I get my kicks out
of this -- it's not my nature to want to scare people." Rather, he
hopes to avoid the self-doubts that plagued him after Sept. 11, the
sense that he should have done more. "When it happens again -- and it
is going to happen again -- I want at least to know I did my best."</TE>
<TE>   But it's also clear that his time in the public eye has revived
old ambitions. When the Denver Post reported last month that Hart was
speaking with friends about another run for president, Hart says he
was deluged with support. "I've gotten a lot of e-mails," he says, a
gleam in his eye. "Not one of them negative."</TE>
<TE>   But even some of his greatest admirers see his political
resurrection as a remote possibility. Though he has gained new
credibility in the war on terrorism, friends say, he would still have
trouble shaking questions about character, given the extramarital
affair that undermined his career and similar scandals that dogged
Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the tragedy of his life," says former Colorado Gov. Richard
D. Lamm. "I'm sure it must be tough shaving every morning if you're
Gary Hart. You can't blame anybody else but yourself.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm pointing out that it's also a public policy tragedy,
because I think we need his talents."</TE>

<SE>Editor's Note: This is one in an occasional series of
columns from across America as it prepares for a possible war in
Iraq.</SE>
<AU>PETER H. KING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MIDLAND, Texas</DL>
<LD>As they do most days, the oilmen met in the Petroleum Club for coffee
at 9:30 a.m. -- not exactly dawn's earliest light, but then, as the
official from the Permian Basin Petroleum Assn. put it, "These aren't
the guys who get their boots muddy. These are the guys who pay the
guys who get their boots muddy."</LD>
<LD>   Eight or nine of these heavy hitters -- producers, drilling
contractors, consultants -- were seated around an octagonal poker
table in the private club. Most wore windbreakers, slacks and no
neckties. Two sported cowboy boots. One chewed an unlit cigar.</LD>
<LD>   "They'll tell you more than they know about anything," Morris
Burns, executive vice president of the association, said with a
chuckle as he led the way to the table.</LD>
<TE>   The daily conversation, it was explained to a visitor, tends to be
freewheeling, with topics bouncing from football coaches to school
board politics to memories of old Texas, from the weather (dry) to
the Permian Basin oil business (slow).</TE>
<TE>   But on this morning -- after first making it clear they didn't
want their names in the newspaper, no sir -- the assembled agreed to
address the possible war with Iraq. Since the most cynical critics
contend that the war, if it comes, will be waged more than anything
for oil, it seemed sensible to see what the sages of the Texas oil
patch made of the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Burns had predicted unqualified support. "I think you'll find
there's a pretty strong consensus around here that it has to happen,"
he said on the short walk over to the club, in a squat, sand-colored
building on the edge of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   Midland, after all, is Bush country, the place where the president
spent a good chunk of his boyhood, where he cut his teeth in the oil
business. This wood-paneled sanctuary had been one of his hangouts.
The fellows at this green felt table all knew Bush in one way or
another.</TE>
<TE>   Given all this, the conversation took a surprising turn right out
of the gate. Across the table sat a balding bear of a man, arms
folded over his chest. He was the first to speak. It seemed, he said,
"that we might ultimately have to go." But he had doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "What bothers me," he said, speaking slowly with a West Texas
twang, "is that it's a never-ending situation in the Middle East.
It's kind of like stirring up those damn fire ants. They go
underground for a while and then they come back and eat you up.</TE>
<TE>   "And I've got a lot of mixed feelings about where we might be at
the end of it. Who will be next after Iraq? How much will it cost to
rebuild the country? And how will we pay for that?"</TE>
<TE>   So Bush hadn't made the case?</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I'm concerned, the case has not been made. It's
probably been made to the people in charge. I don't know all what
they know. I can only go by what's on the table."</TE>
<TE>   A silver-haired man in an Indian print sweater cleared his throat.
He'd served in Korea -- "they called it a 'police action,' but it
seemed like a war to me" -- and a half-century later, he pointed out,
U.S. troops remain there, enforcing the peace.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd just hate to suck up a lot of young people," he said, "send
them into something where we're not sure what's at the end of it."</TE>
<TE>   Before anyone began singing "Kumbaya," however, others jumped into
the fray. They spoke of weapons of mass destruction -- "the bad
stuff," one called it -- and a rogue leader willing to "gas his own
people," and the implications of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the administration knows exactly what it's doing," said a
slight, older gentleman in a bright red windbreaker. "It's a
dangerous situation. And if we don't do something now, we are going
to suffer the consequences later."</TE>
<TE>   "We are dealing with a blooming idiot," said another, "and he is
not going to go away on his own."</TE>
<TE>   They seemed to regard the late diplomatic moves, the advent of
inspections and so forth, as prelude to the inevitable: "We are going
to take him out," one said grimly, "one way or another."</TE>
<TE>   Hope was expressed that the conflict might not be all that big and
bloody. Hadn't a few well-aimed missiles done the trick with [Libya's
Moammar] Kadafi back in 1986? At the same time, Burns said, it's
tough fighting people who are more than willing to die for their
beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of like trying to buy location from somebody who
doesn't need any money," the man in the sweater agreed. "It takes
away all your arguments."</TE>
<TE>   As for what war might mean for their business, the consensus was
expressed by the man chewing the cigar: "Probably not much." The
Permian Basin, which produces about 70% of the oil flow from Texas,
is considered a "mature" region, meaning it costs more and more to
coax oil out of the ground. A consultant at the table said a client
just spent $27 million exploring the basin, "and he didn't get enough
oil to grease a shotgun."</TE>
<TE>   If a conflict started in Iraq, prices might climb a bit at first,
but these oilmen weren't expecting any long-term windfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, should the war engulf the entire Middle East region ...</TE>
<TE>   "You shut off the Saudi flow to us," the consultant said, "and we
have got an immediate problem."</TE>
<TE>   If more Americans, he went on, understood "just how far down the
road the domestic energy situation is ... they might see the need to
go."</TE>
<TE>   "That implies it's about greed," protested the fellow with the
cigar. "You might as well talk about religion, about Christians
versus Muslims, if you are going to go that far out."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's not about greed," one of the older men said softly,
"so much as it is about need."</TE>
<TE>   In this way an hour passed. Before the coffee klatch broke up, all
the familiar rhetorical points would be made, and perhaps the only
striking thing was to discover that here, in the innermost chamber of
the heart of Bush country, it was possible to discover a few pockets
of doubt.</TE>
<TE>   And now, as the oilmen began to drift away, one to hunt grouse,
another to take a call on his cell phone, the big man who seemed most
skeptical about the prospects gave it one last shot.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," he said, "I'd kind of like to see the economy in better
shape before we take on more spending. Afghanistan is already turning
out to be a bleeder. Iraq will be a bleeder too. When it's all over,
we are the ones who are going to have to feed them."</TE>
<TE>   Is there a better option?</TE>
<TE>   He was quiet for a moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," he said.</TE>
<TE>   All things considered, it wasn't a bad note to end on.</TE>

<HD>High Court to Hear Miranda Challenge</HD>
<DH>Ruling in Oxnard case could reinterpret landmark decision
on rights during police questioning. White House backs a change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OXNARD</DL>
<LD>Maybe you don't have a right to remain silent after all.</LD>
<LD>   The Supreme Court in its landmark Miranda opinion ruled that
police must respect the rights of people who are held for
questioning. Officers must warn them of their right to remain silent,
and, equally important, honor their refusal to talk further.</LD>
<LD>   But that widely known rule is about to be reconsidered in the high
court in the case of a farm worker here who was shot five times after
a brief encounter with police. Legal experts say the case has the
potential to reshape the law governing everyday encounters between
police and the public.</LD>
<TE>   While the farm worker lay gravely wounded, a police supervisor
pressed him to talk, to explain his version of the events. He
survived, paralyzed and blinded, and sued the police for, among other
things, coercive interrogation.</TE>
<TE>   But Oxnard police assert that the Miranda ruling does not include
a "constitutional right to be free of coercive interrogation," but
only a right not to have forced confessions used at trial.</TE>
<TE>   Bush administration lawyers have sided with the police in the
case. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on Dec. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Police can hold people in custody and force them to talk, so long
as their incriminating statements are not used to prosecute them,
U.S. Solicitor Gen. Theodore B. Olson and Michael Chertoff, the chief
of the Justice Department's criminal division, say in their brief to
the court.</TE>
<TE>   It "will chill legitimate law enforcement efforts to obtain
potentially life-saving information during emergencies," including
terrorism alerts, if police and FBI agents can be sued for coercive
questioning, they add.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts on the other side of the case foresee far-reaching
effects if the police prevail.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be, in essence, a reversal of Miranda," said University
of Texas law professor Susan Klein.</TE>
<TE>   "Officers will be told Miranda is not a constitutional right. If
there is no right, and you are not liable, why should you honor the
right to silence?" she asked. "I think it means you will see more
police using threats and violence to get people to talk. Innocent
people will be subjected to very unpleasant experiences."</TE>
<TE>   It was early evening on a November day five years ago when
Oliverio Martinez, 29, rode his bicycle down a path and across a
vacant lot toward a row of small homes.</TE>
<TE>   Two officers, Andrew Salinas and Maria Pena, had stopped to
question a man they suspected, wrongly it turned out, of selling
drugs. When they heard a squeaky bike approach in the dark, they
called for the rider to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez dismounted and put his hands over his head. In a leather
sheath on a waist band, he carried a long knife that he used to cut
strawberries.</TE>
<TE>   When the officer patted him down and grabbed for the knife,
Martinez tried to run. Salinas tackled him and tried to handcuff him.
As they struggled on the ground, the officer called out that the man
had a huge knife. Pena moved closer and fired.</TE>
<TE>   One bullet struck Martinez near the left eye and exited behind his
right eye. A second hit his spine. Three more shots hit his legs.</TE>
<TE>   When patrol supervisor Sgt. Ben Chavez arrived, a handcuffed
Martinez lay bleeding on the ground. Once Martinez was loaded into an
ambulance, Chavez climbed in with a tape recorder in hand.</TE>
<TE>   On and off for the next 45 minutes in the ambulance and at the
hospital, he repeatedly asked the gravely wounded man to admit he had
grabbed the officer's gun and provoked the struggle. In agony,
Martinez is heard screaming in pain and saying he is choking and
dying.</TE>
<TE>   "OK. You're dying. But tell me why you were fighting with the
police?" Chavez asks. "Did you want to kill the police or what?" he
continues. One officer had said Martinez tried to grab his gun.</TE>
<TE>   In the emergency room, Chavez continued to press Martinez to tell
him what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did you run from the police?" Chavez is heard to say over the
sounds of nurses and doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you get his gun? ... Did you to try to shoot the police?"</TE>
<TE>   Martinez in a low voice responds: "I don't know.... I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Martinez say he panicked when the officer tried to
tackle him, but they say he did not grab the officer's gun.</TE>
<TE>   In the emergency room, he is heard asking Chavez several times to
leave him alone. "I don't want to say anything anymore."</TE>
<TE>   "No? You don't want to say what happened?" the sergeant continues.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hurting a lot. Please!" Martinez implores, his words
trailing off into agonized screams. Undaunted, Chavez resumes. "Well,
if you're going to die, tell me what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Silence came only when pain medication took hold, and Martinez
faded into unconsciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez survived, although he would not see or walk again. He
sued Oxnard police for illegal arrest, the use of excessive force and
coercive interrogation in police custody.</TE>
<TE>   Under a post-Civil War law, city and state officials, including
police officers, can be sued in federal court if they violate a
person's rights under the U.S. Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge in Los Angeles cleared Martinez's case to go
before a jury.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard's lawyers said the allegations against Chavez should be
dismissed because the patrol supervisor was merely trying to learn
what had happened. U.S. District Judge Florence Cooper disagreed and
said his questioning suggested he had sought to obtain an admission
from Martinez that would clear the two officers.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the Supreme Court has said police cannot be sued
unless they violate "clearly established" rights.</TE>
<TE>   Before the case could be tried, Oxnard's lawyers appealed on
behalf of Chavez saying he had violated no clearly established right.
(Under California law, cities and counties are responsible for paying
money verdicts against their officers.)</TE>
<TE>   But the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Oxnard's appeal
and said the facts as alleged, if proved at a trial, would justify
holding Chavez and the city liable.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit judges said the rule against coercive police
interrogation had been established decades before the Miranda
decision of 1966.</TE>
<TE>   "Sgt. Chavez doggedly pursued a statement by Martinez despite
being asked to leave the emergency room several times," wrote Judge
Richard Tallman. "A reasonable officer, questioning a suspect who had
been shot five times by the police and then arrested, who had not
received Miranda warnings and who was receiving medical treatment for
excruciating, life-threatening injuries ... would have known that
persistent interrogation of the suspect despite repeated requests to
stop violated the suspect's 5th and 14th Amendment right to be free
from coercive interrogation."</TE>
<TE>   The Miranda decision grew out of the 5th Amendment, which says no
person "shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness
against himself." This has long been known as the right against
self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court in the 1950s and '60s struggled in a series of
cases to decide whether a person's confessions to the police had been
voluntary or compelled. Often, a suspect claimed to have been beaten,
but the police denied it. In one case, five members of a Los Angeles
family had been held in jail for more than a week before one of them
talked.</TE>
<TE>   In frustration, Chief Justice Earl Warren announced a broad new
rule in Miranda vs. Arizona. He said that because police questioning
is inherently coercive, officers must warn suspects of their rights
before questioning begins. His opinion and others that followed it
described the so-called Miranda warnings as limitations on the
police.</TE>
<TE>   But all along, some lawyers and law professors have questioned
whether the Miranda warnings themselves are a constitutional
requirement.</TE>
<TE>   When Oxnard's lawyers appealed the case of Chavez vs. Martinez to
the Supreme Court, they asked a basic question. Is there a
constitutional right to be free of coercive police interrogation?</TE>
<TE>   The answer to that question should be no, they said. And they
cited a reliable source for their view: Current Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist, a frequent critic of Warren's opinion in the Miranda
case.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1990 ruling, Rehnquist commented that the right against
self-incrimination in the 5th Amendment was a "trial right." Police
cannot violate this right when they force someone to talk, since "a
constitutional violation occurs only at trial," the chief justice
said.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Police Organizations, the California
attorney general's office and the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation
in Sacramento all have urged the court to use the Martinez case to
make clear that the Constitution does not limit forceful police
questioning.</TE>
<TE>   "Contrary to the 9th Circuit's conclusion, there is no 'right to
silence,' " said Oxnard's lawyer Alan E. Wisotsky. Since Martinez was
not prosecuted for anything he said, his rights were not violated by
Sgt. Chavez, he concludes.</TE>
<TE>   The pro-police advocates say that torturing a suspect, or perhaps
denying him food and water for an extended period of time, would be
unconstitutional. They say that "shocking" or "brutal" police conduct
could be punished.</TE>
<TE>   However, "the fact that a federal appellate court has allowed [a
lawsuit] for Sgt. Chavez's brief, comparatively benign questioning
demonstrates the need to clarify the law," said Charles Hobson of
Criminal Justice Legal Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Klein, of the University of Texas, filed a friend-of-the-court
brief on behalf of the National Police Accountability Project.</TE>
<TE>   She argued that innocent people will be particularly vulnerable if
the court rules the Constitution does not forbid coercive police
questioning. Criminal suspects still can insist their incriminating
statements not be used against them at trial.</TE>
<TE>   But an innocent person who is held for questioning would have no
right and no remedy, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the high court took up a well-publicized challenge
to the Miranda decision and ultimately refused to overturn it.
Rehnquist, a longtime critic of Miranda, surprised many by writing
the decision for the 7-2 majority.</TE>
<TE>   But his opinion did not describe the Miranda decision as limiting
the police. Instead, he said it means that some incriminating
statements "may not be used as evidence in the prosecution's case."</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles prosecutor Steven Clymer, now a Cornell
University law professor, said the Martinez case will decide "what
Miranda really means on the street. I think the court will say it is
OK for the police to violate Miranda. You are not violating the
Constitution when you ignore Miranda," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That will affect how police behave, he said. "If the guy says,
'Stop, I don't want to talk,' or he says, 'I want to see a lawyer,'
you [as a police officer] aren't going to get anything out of him,"
he explained. If the officer continues the questioning and pressures
the suspect, he or she may learn valuable information, such as facts
about the crime, the location of a weapon or the names of other
suspects or witnesses. All this information can be used against the
suspect, even if incriminating statements cannot be used at a trial.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're the officer, you look at the costs and the benefits,"
Clymer said. And many police officers will decide it is better to
ignore the suspect's right to remain silent than to respect it, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Clymer, who has an article in the Yale Law Review next month
titled "Are Police Free to Disregard Miranda?" said the Supreme Court
would be "more honest if it just overruled Miranda."</TE>
<TE>   Such an outcome would surprise many.</TE>
<TE>   "A generation of Americans have been brought up with the belief
that we have a right to remain silent," said Ben Wizner of the ACLU
of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles lawyer R. Samuel Paz, who is representing Martinez,
said he is surprised by the strange turn in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "They are taking a radical position," Paz said of Oxnard's
lawyers. If they are right, it "would permit officers to engage in
the most egregious and abusive conduct in violation of decades of 5th
Amendment jurisprudence," he wrote in his brief to the court.</TE>
<TE>   Although most lawyers who have followed the case think the
Rehnquist court will overrule the 9th Circuit and side with Oxnard,
some think the brutal shooting will cause several justices to
hesitate.</TE>
<TE>   The court could decide the case narrowly by focusing on whether
Martinez was in police custody at the hospital or whether the law
regulating Chavez was clearly established. But the justices agreed to
take up Oxnard's appeal posing the broad question of whether the
Constitution regulates police questioning that does not lead to an
incriminating statement in court.</TE>
<TE>   For Martinez, the slow-moving legal battle has proved to be a new
type of agony. Now 34, he lives with his father in a one-room trailer
on a farm field in Oxnard. He is in a wheelchair and wears dark
glasses, covering his missing eye.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything has changed. I can't do anything for myself," he said
in an interview. His father leaves food on the stove each day before
leaving so his son can warm his lunch.</TE>
<TE>   "I depend on my dad. It's very difficult for me," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard's lawyers have refused requests to pay for any therapy for
him.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of what happens in the Supreme Court, Martinez and his
lawyers say they will continue to press their claims for illegal
arrests and excessive force against the Oxnard police.</TE>
<TE>   The city's lawyers say they are not willing to make payments or a
temporary settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The three officers involved in the Martinez shooting remain on the
Oxnard police force and suffered no disciplinary action as a result
of it, city lawyers said.</TE>

<HD>Saudis Call Any Aid to Terrorists Unwitting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard A. Serrano, Doyle McManus and Greg Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Saudi officials acknowledged Saturday that the wife of their
ambassador to the United States may have unwittingly provided money
that eventually helped support two of the Sept. 11 hijackers, but
they insisted that Princess Haifa al Faisal never purposely meant to
assist the terrorist conspiracy.</LD>
<LD>   Nail al Jubeir, chief spokesman for the Saudi Embassy here,
stressed that "the assertion that the princess has supported
terrorism is simply untrue and irresponsible."</LD>
<LD>   He added, "She has provided general assistance to people in need
only."</LD>
<TE>   Justice Department officials here and in Southern California said
Saturday that they have not uncovered any evidence suggesting that
the princess or any Saudi government officials knowingly provided
financial help to the Sept. 11 hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, a California official said, the 19 hijackers were the
beneficiaries of money wired directly to them from abroad. "These
guys had access to hundreds of thousands of dollars from overseas,"
the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The question of what role, if any, the Saudi government may have
played in the events leading up to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks,
surfaced Friday in a draft report of a congressional investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi citizens, and two of those
hijackers who lived in San Diego received money from two other Saudis
in San Diego whose families received financial assistance from Haifa.</TE>
<TE>   The report by the joint House-Senate Intelligence Committee
suggests the FBI and CIA did not probe the matter vigorously enough.
But law enforcement officials responded by saying the matter was
thoroughly reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, one high-placed Justice Department official noted
that while the two hijackers received money to pay their rent from
the Saudis who had received money from the princess, the hijackers
repaid them in cash the same day.</TE>
<TE>   From a strategic standpoint, the official said, the FBI concluded
that it just seemed illogical that a Saudi agent -- or the government
of Saudi Arabia itself -- would assist the plans of the Sept. 11
hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would the Saudi government knowingly support a terrorist
organization that would attack the U.S.?" the official said. "It
would just destabilize their own government even more. It just
doesn't make any sense."</TE>
<TE>   Haifa is the youngest daughter of the late King Faisal and is
married to Prince Bandar bin Sultan. Al Jubeir, along with an advisor
to Prince Bandar, said the embassy has been scrambling since Friday
night to try to reconstruct the princess' records of payments to
needy Saudis in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, embassy officials were trying to explain how money
from the princess went to Saudi nationals Omar al Bayoumi and Osama
Bassnan, and how they in turn gave financial assistance to two of the
hijackers: Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi officials said the princess maintains an account at Riggs
National Bank, the old-line Washington financial institution that has
long maintained a special VIP division to handle discreet money
transfers for diplomats and aristocrats.</TE>
<TE>   Her office provides Riggs with a list of beneficiaries, some of
whom receive monthly stipends. The list includes both individuals and
charitable organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jubeir said Haifa has given out college tuition to some 12
students and medical assistance to another half a dozen Saudi
immigrants, and she has helped 25 needy people "on a regular monthly
basis for various things."</TE>
<TE>   The applicants submit requests, and if they are approved, Riggs
sends cashier checks based on the princess' list.</TE>
<TE>   A Request for Aid</TE>
<TE>   In April 1998, Bandar and the princess received a letter from
Bassnan saying he was in deep trouble and needed money. He wrote that
his family was living in Virginia and had four children, and his wife
was pregnant and needed thyroid surgery.</TE>
<TE>   The embassy sent them $15,000 and paid the surgical bill.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1998, Bassnan's wife wrote a letter asking for more
help. Soon thereafter, the princess authorized a monthly payment by
Riggs bank of $2,000 a month to the wife. The checks were apparently
made out to her as Majeda Ibrahim Ahmed. Her full name appears to be
Majeda Ibrahim Ahmed al Dweikat. She is a Jordanian citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those checks were then endorsed to Osama Bassnan. Some
were endorsed to Janet Bassnan, who is believed to be his daughter.
Some were endorsed to a woman named Manal Bajadr, who is believed to
be Al Bayoumi's wife. The families were apparently neighbors in San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jubeir said Ahmed was treated at UC San Diego beginning in
April 2000 and most recently in March, but he would not say what for.</TE>
<TE>   The advisor said of the princess that "it's not clear how much
personal knowledge she had of this case."</TE>
<TE>   "She personally reads the letters that come in appealing for help,
but she asks the staff to check the cases out," the advisor said.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jubeir said the princess and prince are often flooded with
requests for assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tradition in Saudi Arabia that the wealthy and the
well-off help those who are less fortunate," he said. "It's been
going on for a long time. The king does it himself.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes an entire staff to go through the whole thing. Every
request gets reviewed and checked. And then we get the nutty case
like the guy who wants a new car. And yet we have children who are
burned or children with a single parent in this country, all who need
help. The cases are really enormous. But assistance goes out to those
in need.</TE>
<TE>   "But to link Princess Haifa to terrorism is simply irresponsible."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI discovered the potential connection soon after the
terrorist attacks, when the FBI field office was following up
hundreds of leads in the San Diego area.</TE>
<TE>   While living in the San Diego area, Al Bayoumi and Bassnan were
heavily involved in relocating and offering financial support to
Saudi immigrants in the community.</TE>
<TE>   The men helped Almihdhar and Alhazmi when they turned up in
Southern California in late 1999. Al Bayoumi initially met them at a
Los Angeles restaurant and later brought them to San Diego's large
Muslim community.</TE>
<TE>   There, he paid their first two months' rent at an apartment and,
apparently, was reimbursed that same day.</TE>
<TE>   Al Bayoumi and Bassnan have both left the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Interest in Al Bayoumi</TE>
<TE>   Al Bayoumi left San Diego in April 2001, about six months before
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked. He turned up
in Birmingham, England, where he was enrolled at Aston University. At
the request of the FBI, Al Bayoumi was detained by British
authorities about 10 days after the Sept. 11 attack. He was held for
about a week, and then let go.</TE>
<TE>   He was set free because U.S. officials had only one criminal
complaint against him, visa fraud, according to law enforcement
sources. That crime is not an extraditable offense, they noted.</TE>
<TE>   Al Bayoumi has not resurfaced, and even Al Jubeir said that "where
he is at this moment, we don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Al Bayoumi has been of deep interest to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   A top Justice Department official in San Diego said in a recent
interview that the FBI served a search warrant on a mosque in the San
Diego area, hunting for material belonging to Al Bayoumi.</TE>
<TE>   "They searched a room at the mosque looking for things related to
him," the official said. "It was his private office there. That
mosque was a Saudi Arabian-financed venture."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI found the names of two Saudi embassy employees in Al
Bayoumi's San Diego apartment. Al Jubeir said the employees worked in
the embassy's Islamic Affairs Department.</TE>
<TE>   "Al Bayoumi called the embassy a number of times, and there was a
link there," he said. "The FBI called us and we allowed the employees
to be interviewed by the FBI. And that was the end of that, in
October or November of 2001."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "I don't know why he had those names."</TE>
<TE>   "He called them constantly," Al Jubeir said. "But I wouldn't be
too surprised about that. Every Saudi student has a number for the
people in charge of my public affairs section for information,
literature and pamphlets. We also get about 2,000 e-mails a day."</TE>
<TE>   Bassnan and his wife were arrested on Aug. 22 in Southern
California on visa fraud violations, according to Al Jubeir. She was
deported earlier this month, and he was returned to Saudi Arabia a
week ago.</TE>
<TE>   "But we have had no requests from anyone in the FBI to interview
him," Al Jubeir said.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, some congressional sources said that members of the
joint intelligence committee continue to doubt whether the FBI worked
hard enough to resolve the matter of how Saudi money got to the San
Diego hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   That issue is described as a key remaining question in the panel's
draft report. But the Justice Department quickly responded that
hundreds of leads were properly and thoroughly followed in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Four people were arrested on material witness warrants alleging
that they had crucial information about the Sept. 11 attacks, and
three of them testified before a federal grand jury in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Gore, special agent-in-charge of the FBI's San Diego field
office, said in a recent interview that agents did not find concrete
links between the San Diego hijackers and other people in the U.S. to
suggest that others here were aware of the terrorist plot and were
assisting the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a pretty good feel for what and who we considered threats
in the community, and who were associated with terrorist
organizations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, the hijackers "didn't associate with people we
suspected of being involved in terrorist organizations. They were
self-controlled. They were funded from abroad. They didn't come up in
our normal intelligence investigations."</TE>
<TE>   'A Lot of Half-Truths'</TE>
<TE>   Several Justice Department officials, in Washington and Southern
California, suggested Saturday that the congressional committee is
overreacting by suggesting that the FBI or the CIA did not properly
investigate any Saudi government link to the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   The officials said the committee learned about Al Bayoumi and
Bassnan during briefings with agents, but apparently was not
satisfied that agents had done enough to pursue the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Said one Justice official: "There are a lot of half-truths
floating around right now. But when you get to the facts, you will
see the people [raising questions] are either wrong or they are
making theories into conclusions."</TE>
<TE>   Another official said the committee "thinks they are expert
investigators." But, he added, "they assume too much."</TE>

<HD>Shuttle Endeavour Launches to Relieve Space Station Crew</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Space shuttle Endeavour streaked into orbit Saturday night after
weeks of delay, carrying a new set of residents and another massive
building block for the international space station.</LD>
<LD>   NASA had feared storms in Spain might postpone the flight for the
second day. But in the end, the rain held off at one of the two
overseas emergency landing strips and managers cleared Endeavour and
its crew of seven for takeoff.</LD>
<LD>   "Looks like we've got a good vehicle and good weather tonight for
you," launch director Mike Leinbach said. "Have a great flight. I
hope you have a good turkey dinner packed for Thanksgiving."</LD>
<TE>   Endeavour roared to life and lighted up the clear night sky for
miles around. The ship was visible for seven minutes, resembling a
bright star as it arced over the Atlantic Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The space station's three residents, on board since June, were
soaring over Austria when Endeavour blasted off at 7:49 p.m. EST.</TE>
<TE>   The delays were starting to pile up for NASA's latest trip to the
space station, in need of a fresh crew, a new girder and spare parts
for a balky air cleaning system.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour should have flown in October, but was grounded because
of cracked fuel lines found throughout the shuttle fleet. Then during
a Nov. 11 launch attempt, oxygen leaked from a cracked hose in the
astronauts' supply line. While trying to fix that, workers damaged
the shuttle's robot arm; fortunately, no repairs were needed.</TE>
<TE>   Then the weather interfered.</TE>
<TE>   Both Spanish air bases were hit Friday night by the same storm
system that sank an oil tanker last week. Only one had to be
available for use by Endeavour in the rare event of engine failure or
some other emergency during liftoff.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy Space Center's director, Roy Bridges, congratulated the
launch team for getting the job done safely.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem during liftoff was a valve stuck open in
Endeavour's right orbital-maneuvering engine.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour is loaded with a $390-million space station girder
almost identical to one launched last month. Two crew members --
including the first American Indian to go into space, John Herrington
-- will hook it up during three spacewalks this week.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour is the ride home for U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson and
Russian cosmonauts Valery Korzun and Sergei Treschev. They marked
their 171st day in orbit Saturday. By the time the shuttle returns to
Earth on Dec. 4, they will have spent 182 days aloft.</TE>
<TE>   They will be replaced by Americans Kenneth Bowersox and Donald
Pettit and Russian Nikolai Budarin, who will stay at the outpost at
least four months.</TE>
<TE>   Whitson, 42, has mixed feelings about leaving. The biochemist
spent her adult life aiming to become an astronaut. Her goal was a
long spaceflight.</TE>
<TE>   Even though she has enjoyed working on the space station, Whitson
has expressed a growing weariness of the canned food and
just-add-water meals. She stockpiled rehydrated shrimp cocktails
before she left Earth.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The would-be assassin of Defense Minister Mohammed Qassim Fahim has
links with extremist Islamic groups in Pakistan and members of
Afghanistan's ousted Taliban movement, an Afghan intelligence
official said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Intelligence services reported Friday that they had foiled an
attempt by Akram Taufiq Muramy to kill Fahim near the defense
minister's residence when they found the Iraqi national with 22
pounds of explosives tied to his body.</LD>
<LD>   He "has very clear links with Taliban leaders and some Pakistani
extremist groups," said Amrullah Salihi, an intelligence chief.</LD>
<TE>   Salihi didn't specify which Pakistani groups.</TE>
<TE>   Salihi said that the detainee, an Iraqi Kurd, had entered
Afghanistan from neighboring Pakistan.</TE>

<DL> MARDIN, Turkey</DL>
<LD>MARDIN, Turkey -- Chalk from the chisels of stonecutters dusts the
black robes of the old cleric. He isn't in the mood to talk. "See
Father Gabriel," he says, sweeping the stairs beneath the church. A
bell chimes. The stonecutters put away their tools as dusk settles
over the brown rock hills and the plains that stretch to Syria.</LD>
<LD>   Shoes scrape across the courtyard, like an echo from centuries
past. Father Gabriel, a slight man with a beard, appears, clicking
his beads. He is late for evening prayers. But, yes, he will talk to
a visitor about the whisper of war -- as in the pages of the Bible --
coming again to the fertile land between the Tigris and Euphrates.</LD>
<LD>   He lights a cigarette, brushes a fly away.</LD>
<TE>   Iraq is to the east. Closer, below the monastery walls, the tanks
and young soldiers of the Turkish army have finished maneuvers. If
there is war, they will march to the border, cross the mountains.
Father Gabriel suggests that war -- like the wheat harvest -- moves
in cycles and rhythms. It consumes. He saw it throughout the 1990s as
the Turkish military battled Kurdish separatists. Hundreds of
villages were destroyed; 37,000 lives were lost, bodies scattered on
hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   A new war in nearby Iraq will bring the same.</TE>
<TE>   "War is 4,000 years old," he says. "I've come to the conclusion
there will always be war, from Adam and Eve until Judgment Day."</TE>
<TE>   Father Gabriel sits back. He crosses his legs. His Syrian Jacobite
monastery, known as Deyr-ul Zaferan, was built in the 4th century on
the ruins of a pagan temple. The stone is the color of honey.
Christian Orthodox Syrians once thrived on this land. They are mostly
gone, chased away by war and atrocity and borders -- drawn and
redrawn -- throughout the centuries. Tens of thousands vanished,
persecuted or murdered through the messy arc of time stretching from
the Islamic Ottoman Empire through World War I and to the founding of
the Turkish republic in the early 1920s.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of Father Gabriel's flock is left. They attend church at
the monastery. They pick olives and sweep stones and guard the graves
of 52 patriarchs. From here, along mountains carved with caves, they
have viewed -- and thought about -- the region's many violent
conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Father Gabriel scratches his beard. He knows the history of the
region; the present is more vexing. Safe in his cloistered perch, he
ruminates over the world's problems, mixing biblical parables with
newspaper headlines and searching for some unwritten thing between
the two. He seems nervous.</TE>
<TE>   "I think things will become worse," he says. "The unity of
countries is only temporary. One day all these countries will fight
one another. Sodom and Gomorrah. They believed in God, but then they
turned away from God and received their punishment."</TE>
<TE>   He sighs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a world of atheists and fanatics."</TE>
<TE>   Finished with his sweeping, the old cleric with the dusted robes
sits in the courtyard. His silver cross flickers. He nods to Father
Gabriel. Soon it will be dinner. Then more prayers. A rhythm like the
wheat harvest.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. is the only country ruling the whole world," Father
Gabriel says.</TE>
<TE>   "America has on its money, 'In God We Trust.' Let's hope so." He
smiles. "But tell me, why hasn't America found the Sept. 11
terrorists? Where is Osama bin Laden? The FBI. The CIA. With all this
intelligence, why can't they find them?"</TE>
<TE>   He thinks for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "Power."</TE>
<TE>   Power?</TE>
<TE>   "It's in man's nature. We are weak, so when we get power, we want
to use it. That's the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Father Gabriel is content with this assessment. He lets the
sentence linger. He is tired and doesn't want to talk anymore. He
stands.</TE>
<TE>   "I do have hope, you know," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you solve things with dialogue. If you build a strong
bridge, it will stand. We must be against injustice. God is capable
of changing everything in an instant."</TE>
<TE>   He smiles. Dispensing solace is what clerics do.</TE>
<TE>   The visitor rises and collects his things. The light from the
church softens the courtyard darkness. Father Gabriel's Turkish
translator says goodbye. Father Gabriel keeps his eye on him. The
visitor also turns to leave. Father Gabriel, his shoes whisking over
the stones, sidles close to the visitor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry I couldn't speak freely," he whispers in perfect
English.</TE>
<TE>   "But the translator is a Kurd. A Muslim."</TE>
<TE>   Language is a weapon, Father Gabriel says, a ploy to unmask the
enemy. In this part of the world, there are many enemies; syllables
and syntax are dangerous things. Christians. Muslims. Jews. They have
fought here for centuries, almost as long as wheat has been harvested
or bridges have been built. It's best to be suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope you understand," Father Gabriel says. "You cannot trust
the Muslims. America says that, even after Sept. 11, Muslims are just
like anyone else. This is not true. I don't trust them. Iraq. Iran.
America should kill Bin Laden. Yes, Hussein too."</TE>
<TE>   Father Gabriel's cell phone rings. He fishes for it in his robes
but misses the call. He checks the redial button.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to go," he says and scurries up the monastery steps,
closing the big wooden door behind him.</TE>

<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>A backer of President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in Saturday as head
of a new civilian government that is seen as sympathetic to the
president's support for the U.S.-declared war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali's key role in the government is
expected to ease concerns in the West about the rise of Pakistan's
ultraconservative religious parties, who came in a surprising third
in Oct. 10 elections and have called for greater distance from the
United States. They had pushed to become part of a coalition
government but will sit in opposition.</LD>
<LD>   Jamali's team will be the first elected civilian government to
oversee the day-to-day running of the country since Musharraf took
control in a 1999 coup. The 21-member Cabinet and a small group of
special advisors were also sworn in Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Musharraf will remain president for the next five years and has
pushed through a series of constitutional decrees giving himself the
power to dissolve parliament and sack the prime minister if he sees
fit.</TE>
<TE>   Jamali, from a breakaway faction of the Pakistan Muslim League
party, has promised to continue the military ruler's policies,
especially his strong support of U.S. efforts to hunt down Al Qaeda
members and remnants of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   His greatest challenge will be satisfying the demands of
Pakistan's extremely powerful pro-U.S. military while appeasing the
resurgent religious parties and their supporters in the street, where
many are angry at their government's support for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "The opposition will not allow him to blindly follow and continue
Musharraf's policies," said Malik Miraj Khalid, a former caretaker
prime minister and senior political commentator. Khalid said the
opposition, especially the religious parties, would be a formidable
foe.</TE>
<TE>   "Jamali will have to satisfy a majority of the parliament to
remain in power," Khalid said, adding that it will not be easy. "By
becoming prime minister, he has selected a crown of thorns for
himself."</TE>
<TE>   Jamali's first test will come within two months. Under Pakistani
law, he must win a vote of confidence in the National Assembly within
60 days.</TE>
<TE>   Shaukat Aziz, the much-respected finance minister under Musharraf,
was sworn in as a special advisor to Jamali, an indication that
economic policy will be unchanged. Mian Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri, the
new foreign minister, is a liberal with a long history of close ties
to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Faisal Saleh Hayyat, a dissident leader of former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party, was named interior minister
as a reward for breaking ranks with Bhutto's party and voting for
Jamali over the party's own prime ministerial candidate. Several
other ministers were drawn from the ranks of Pakistan People's Party
deserters.</TE>
<TE>   "The team is good," Musharraf said of the new Cabinet.</TE>

<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>German officials believe the Al Qaeda terror network has appointed a
Jordanian man as a combat commander to orchestrate attacks on Europe,
according to a news report Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Abu Musab Zarqawi is in charge of bringing jihad, or holy war, to
Western Europe, Hans-Josef Beth, the head of the intelligence section
of Germany's Federal Intelligence Service, was quoted as saying in
Der Spiegel newsweekly.</LD>
<LD>   Zarqawi is believed to be among the top two dozen leaders of the
terrorist organization.</LD>
<TE>   "He is the man to take note of if it concerns Germany and Europe,"
Beth told the magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The magazine reported that U.S. authorities believe there are six
"combat commanders" in total, but it did not cite sources.</TE>
<TE>   Spiegel said Abd al Rahim al Nashiri, recently taken into U.S.
custody, was one of the six, in charge of Al Qaeda's Persian Gulf
operations, but it did not identify any others.</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Nitz, spokeswoman for the Federal Intelligence Service,
which is Germany's equivalent of the CIA, said the agency would not
comment on the report.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have said Zarqawi was in Afghanistan when the
United States began bombing Taliban and Al Qaeda targets last year.
During the military action, he reportedly fled to Iran, then to
Baghdad for medical treatment, and then on to Syria.</TE>

<HD>A Milestone for Afghan Justice -- or Lack of It</HD>
<DH>Abdullah Shah could become the first person executed in the
post- Taliban country. But there was no real investigation of his
case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>KABUL, Afghanistan -- In his last days of freedom, Abdullah Shah -- a
brutal moujahedeen with many enemies -- was living like a fugitive in
two squalid rooms in the poorest part of Kabul with Gul Makai, the
woman unfortunate enough to be his fifth wife.</LD>
<LD>   Ten days after their wedding, the 20-year-old bride fled the house
into a narrow, stinking lane, screaming that her husband had killed
other wives and was trying to kill her.</LD>
<LD>   Abdullah Shah, 37, was arrested. He was later tried and convicted,
not for the alleged slayings of wives but for the murders of 13
civilians in the early 1990s, during the country's vicious civil war.
Sentenced to death Oct. 15, he could become the first person executed
by the state in post-Taliban Afghanistan. His case is under appeal,
but the former moujahedeen commander seems to have run out of friends
powerful enough to save him from hanging.</LD>
<TE>   Amrudin Qate, chief prosecutor of Afghanistan's secondary national
security court, claims that Abdullah Shah is a psychopathic fiend who
killed dozens or even hundreds of people, including three wives and
three children, one a baby whom he tore limb from limb.</TE>
<TE>   Villagers about 10 miles north of here in the Qargha area, where
Abdullah Shah had his military base, allege that he killed hundreds
of civilians in the early 1990s after the moujahedeen defeated the
nation's communist regime and took power, unleashing civil war and a
reign of terror in the Kabul region.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the worst criminal we have. No one even knows how many
people he killed," said Qate, adding that 30 people signed complaints
against Abdullah Shah.</TE>
<TE>   The case is the first against an Afghan moujahedeen commander for
war crimes. However, authorities have shown a marked reluctance to
investigate the full scope of Abdullah Shah's actions and find out
whether the allegations of widespread killings are true.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Was Sacked</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah Shah's trial was a shoddy process that highlighted the
failures of Afghanistan's court system. One judge was sacked for
bribery after the first court imposed a 20-year sentence. A second
trial hastily sentenced Abdullah Shah to death. As is common here,
the defendant had no lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   International human rights monitors have criticized the
proceedings, and a U.N. representative called for a halt to the death
penalty in Afghanistan until international standards for imposing
capital punishment could be met.</TE>
<TE>   The many war crimes committed during the long and brutal civil
conflict still haunt this country, but the lack of a thorough
investigation into the many allegations against Abdullah Shah
suggests that Afghanistan is not yet ready for an effective war
crimes tribunal or a truth and reconciliation commission.</TE>
<TE>   The worst accusation against Abdullah Shah is that he was
responsible for an alleged massacre of 40 to 50 ethnic Hazara
civilians in 1994. Abdul Razaq, 37, an unemployed clerk from Qalai
Kashef village, where the commander was based, claims that in one
instance, he saw Abdullah Shah line up 15 or 16 Hazaras and order a
soldier to fire a rocket-propelled grenade to see how many of them
would fall.</TE>
<TE>   But the accusation of a massacre was neither included in his trial
nor fully investigated. Asked why, Qate replied that in a country
like Afghanistan, witnesses lacked the courage to testify.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't need any more evidence," he said. "We have 13 people
who said he killed their relatives. We have enough stuff."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview before his trial, Abdullah Shah, shackled in leg
irons, denied all allegations against him, insisting that they were
trumped up by enemies in a feud over water and land.</TE>
<TE>   There is a simple key to unlock the main accusation against
Abdullah Shah: It would take spades and some diggers to uncover the
truth. In dusty Deh Araban village, near his base, lies a well 5
yards wide and 25 yards deep, filled in with dirt. Villagers claim
that Abdullah Shah buried dozens of bodies there, including those of
the Hazaras. Villagers petitioned authorities last month to dig up
the well, fearful that they would face retribution if they did so
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   But criminal investigators have no plans for exhumation, saying it
would cost too much.</TE>
<TE>   According to villagers, Abdullah Shah massacred civilians largely
because of their ethnicity or the fact that they worked for the
communist regime. If that is true, he was like many other commanders
in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   They also say he kidnapped people to extort money and was violent
toward his wives. That contributes to the depiction of him now as a
monster far more brutal than other commanders, many of whom still
hold powerful positions.</TE>
<TE>   Gul Makai wrapped herself in a long blue shawl with white flowers
as she told the story of her marriage to Abdullah Shah, a man who
still terrifies her.</TE>
<TE>   She said Abdullah Shah took her by force, threatening her family
if they did not turn her over.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he was a killer," she said. "I didn't want to lose any of
my brothers, so I agreed to marry him."</TE>
<TE>   Five days after the wedding, her husband smoked hashish and became
violent, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Then he beat me and knocked my two front teeth out," she said.
"He would hit me with anything that came to hand. If he caught you
when he was angry, he would take your flesh in his teeth and bite
you. He's a sick man. I think he's crazy."</TE>
<TE>   Gul Makai fled in such terror and panic that she had no time to
grab a head-to-toe burka or an Islamic head scarf, so her neighbors
blocked her from running down the street to the police. She went into
a neighbor's house and begged, weeping, to borrow a burka.</TE>
<TE>   Another wife, Sohaila, 30, who was married to Abdullah Shah for
six months, has more harrowing stories. A shrunken, frail and
defeated figure who lies on her bed under a blanket all day, she
shows photos of the strong, plump widow she says she was before
marrying the commander.</TE>
<TE>   She alleges that he bit her shoulders, beat her repeatedly with a
metal pipe and threw a kettle of boiling water on her as she lay in
bed. Her body is pitted with horrific scars, but her psyche seems
even more damaged as she weeps and wishes for her life to be over.</TE>
<TE>   Investigation Lacking</TE>
<TE>   The fate of three earlier wives is a mystery. Abdullah Shah says
they died of illness. Qate alleges that the commander strangled one
in Iran and killed another in Pakistan with boiling water. The
prosecutor also says that Abdullah Shah smashed two children against
a wall as they cried and that he ripped one baby apart.</TE>
<TE>   But little investigation was conducted into the allegations, which
were outside Afghan jurisdiction and not part of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   One of the wives, Bibi Asea, died in 1999 in Pakistan. Her
brother, Sahar Gul, 29, a farmer and former moujahedeen, described
how she came to him begging for refuge from her violent husband about
seven years ago, but he sent her back to him.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her: 'He's your husband. He did well. While you are alive,
you belong to him. When you die, your body belongs to us,' " Sahar
Gul said.</TE>
<TE>   After her death, the local mullah told the woman's brothers that
she had burns and a gunshot wound in her head, her brother said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Abdullah Shah at different times killed two babies born to
his sister, a 1-month-old son and a 6-week-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Aman, 53, is a teacher who trained in the Soviet Union
and was labeled a communist by Abdullah Shah. Aman's son was shot
eight years ago by gunmen on his wedding night, and he named Abdullah
Shah as his attacker while he lay bleeding to death.</TE>
<TE>   "My son said, 'You must take vengeance on him.' Five minutes
later, he died," said Aman, struggling to speak through tears.</TE>
<TE>   There are inconsistencies in accounts of the massacre of Hazaras,
an ethnic minority in Afghanistan. Some say about 50 refugees were
arrested in a bus and taken to Abdullah Shah's base, then later shot
in groups of 12 or so. Other accounts claim that the commander
incinerated the bus.</TE>
<TE>   Qate says his investigators found witnesses, but they "didn't want
to make problems for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not so crazy as to be a witness in court," said Razaq, the
man who said he saw Abdullah Shah order a soldier to fire a grenade
at a line of Hazaras. "I don't want my face on television so his
soldiers can come and kill me."</TE>
<TE>   Another villager, Gul Mohammed, 36, who said he saw Abdullah
Shah's soldiers shoot 12 Hazaras and dump their bodies in the well,
also refused to testify.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not as brave as that," he said. "He didn't kill anyone from
my family, so I don't need to be a witness against him in court."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also made little effort to investigate which commander
Abdullah Shah answered to, perhaps to avoid stirring up difficulties
with one possible associate: Abdulrab Rasul Sayyaf, a Northern
Alliance commander who retains power.</TE>
<TE>   Qate, the prosecutor, asserts that Abdullah Shah was a Taliban
member and also had ties to warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, of the
Hezb-i-Islami party, who fought against the nation's moujahedeen
leaders in the early 1990s and is opposed to the current government.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah Shah says he fled Afghanistan for Pakistan and Iran
during the Taliban era. He also says he was initially under Sayyaf's
command, but later fell out with him. Sayyaf has denied any ties to
Abdullah Shah.</TE>
<TE>   At the time the Hazaras allegedly were killed, the moujahedeen
group associated with Sayyaf was fighting the Hazaras in Kabul, the
Afghan capital.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I am friendless," Abdullah Shah said. The former commander's
isolation might help explain why he faces the death penalty and other
commanders do not.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Abdul Sabor Mohamedi, 50, who works at a government hospital
in Kabul, alleges that Abdullah Shah dragged the physician's
16-year-old brother from a car in 1992, took him to a forest, shot
him dead, then cut off his nose and ears.</TE>
<TE>   He said Afghanistan's fragile stability and the frictions between
competing commanders make it difficult to investigate the crimes of
the past and punish those responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "All Afghans hate the moujahedeen. They're enemies of the people.
They were all inhuman. All of them should be investigated and tried,"
he said. "But now the whole government is associated with the jihadi
commanders, so it's impossible to do it now."</TE>

<HD>At A&amp;M, Tradition Can't Be Extinguished</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lianne Hart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COLLEGE STATION, Texas</DL>
<LD>In a clearing off a country road near Texas A&amp;M University stands a
giant pile of logs and shrubs, twigs jutting out at crazy angles. For
weeks, students hefting chain saws have added kindling to this stack,
determined to rescue a quickly fading tradition -- the annual Aggie
bonfire. Or Bonfire, as it is known here.</LD>
<LD>   "If we don't do this, the students coming after us will miss a
great experience," senior Luke Cheatham said. "Bonfire is a tradition
that stands for working together for a common goal, and we need to
pass that on."</LD>
<LD>   For 90 years the annual bonfire blazed on campus, the focus of a
frenzied rally on the eve of A&amp;M's football game against archrival
University of Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Each year, the tower grew higher, a symbol of "every Aggie's
burning desire to beat t.u.," as the school saying goes, altering
UT's initials as a sign of disrespect.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the bonfire's glory days ended with a horrific crash. A
59-foot tower of logs collapsed, killing 12 students and injuring 27.
Accusations of poor supervision followed claims of faulty
engineering. Lawsuits were filed against the university, a crane
operator and student supervisors, among others. School officials
banned the bonfire from campus, forcing students to find alternate
venues, such as this remote field on loan from a sympathetic
landowner.</TE>
<TE>   The tradition will continue here tonight, in anticipation of
Friday's game, and the university administration is not pleased.</TE>
<TE>   "We continue to discourage construction of any unauthorized
bonfire, even if built off campus," A&amp;M spokeswoman Cindy Lawson
said. "Our concern is primarily one of safety -- safety of our
students and for anyone else who might be involved."</TE>
<TE>   Cheatham, who was a freshman when the tower fell, wants to prove
that a safe bonfire can be built, and he co-founded a student group
called the Unity Project that seeks to keep the tradition alive.</TE>
<TE>   A safety engineer consulted on this year's design, Cheatham said.
The logs will be stacked horizontally, and only 15 feet high. Alcohol
has been forbidden during its construction -- there was a
breathalyzer on site -- and gas pipelines have been marked to meet
the local fire code. "We've done everything the authorities have
asked," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Though other off-campus bonfires have burned since 1999,
attendance was by invitation only, Cheatham said. This one is open to
the public. About a dozen Unity Project leaders have kicked in $1,000
each to cover costs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not really a sacrifice," graduate student Seth Ward said. He
reverently recited an old Aggie saying (and there are many sayings
here at A&amp;M): "From the outside looking in, you can't understand it.
From the inside looking out, you can't explain it."</TE>
<TE>   The adage is meant to show why the school inspires a fierce,
sometimes fanatic, loyalty. Why students flock to midnight pep
rallies and stand during the entire football game to support their
team.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was younger, I had cancer," Ward said. "All I wanted to do
was live and go to Texas A&amp;M. It represented everything I believed
in.... I want the students coming behind us to feel the same way
about this school and its traditions."</TE>
<TE>   But with every mile between this old farmer's field and the A&amp;M
campus, Bonfire fever seems to wane. Younger students tend to view it
more as a curiosity than as a sacred rite of passage.</TE>
<TE>   "The spirit with the bonfire thing is mainly with the
upperclassmen," sophomore Casey Bell said. "People are kind of giving
up on it now. The ones who were enthusiastic about it have mostly
graduated. I think people are moving on."</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Shelton, 19, agreed. "I think the older people are having a
hard time letting go because they knew what it was like. We don't, so
it doesn't affect us as much."</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's more a memorial to the people who died than a fun
party," junior Laura Remias said. "But I might go over to see what it
looks like because I'm curious. Traditions in general are a big deal
at this school."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, when the diesel-soaked logs are torched, this bonfire
will light up the country skies. Yes, the football team will be
absent, as will the yell leaders and the Aggie band. It won't be like
the old days, Cheatham said. But it will be an Aggie bonfire. And for
this year at least, the tradition will go on.</TE>

<HD>Disney Cruise Ship Returns to Sea After 200 Fall Ill</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORT CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Disney workers spent several hours disinfecting a Disney cruise ship
Saturday after more than 200 passengers fell ill with a stomach
ailment on a seven-day cruise last week.</LD>
<LD>   A crew of more than 1,100 sanitized the 964-foot Disney Magic
hoping to eradicate the stomach bug before the ship left port about
an hour after its scheduled 5 p.m. departure for another Caribbean
voyage.</LD>
<LD>   "We would not sail if we didn't think it was safe for our guests
and our crew," Disney Cruise Line President Matt Ouimet said.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators with the national Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention examined the ship, but said they were unable to determine
the source of the illness.</TE>
<TE>   The passengers' symptoms point to the same common gastrointestinal
virus suspected of sickening more than 500 passengers and crew
members aboard the Holland America Line cruise ship Amsterdam in the
last few weeks, said Dr. Heidar Heshmati, director of the Brevard
County Health Department.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Holland America canceled a 10-day cruise out of Port
Everglades to allow time for a more thorough decontamination of the
1,380-passenger Amsterdam.</TE>
<TE>   Some Disney passengers arriving for the trip Saturday said they
were confident in the cleaning efforts, but some were taking
precautions.</TE>
<TE>   "We stocked up on every kind of belly aid you can think of,"
Michele Fagan, 37, told the Orlando Sentinel.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to departure, guests were given the option of rescheduling,
getting full refunds or taking Walt Disney World vacation packages
instead.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the guests on the Nov. 17 cruise who disembarked early
Saturday said the illness, which caused vomiting and diarrhea, was an
inconvenience but did not ruin their trip.</TE>
<TE>   "You just got sick," Steve Leanard of Old Tappan, N.J., told the
Florida Today of Melbourne. "It was like getting the flu.... It was
about 12 hours for me."</TE>
<TE>   At least 29 people were treated by two on-board physicians, Disney
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ouimet said passengers who fell ill would be compensated,
including refunds or vouchers for future cruises.</TE>

<HD>Hunters Not Deterred by Disease Threat</HD>
<DH>Wisconsin officials say many aren't turning in deer heads
to be tested for chronic wasting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WAUSAU, Wis.</DL>
<LD>State wildlife officials over the weekend sought a grim bounty -- the
heads of 50,000 deer -- to determine how far chronic-wasting disease
has spread.</LD>
<LD>   But many hunters were choosing not to part with their trophies
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   In what the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources described as
the largest wildlife disease survey ever conducted, the department
set up 200 collection sites where wildlife experts sawed off the
heads of deer brought in by hunters.</LD>
<TE>   "There has never been anything like this in the history of
wildlife management in Wisconsin or really anywhere," said Rick
Weide, a department wildlife biologist at a Wausau collection site
where he inspected animals, including a 3-year-old whitetail buck
shot Saturday by Darlene Svacina.</TE>
<TE>   The deer lacked signs of infection such as pus around the eyes and
antlers and a lack of meat around the ribs, but it will take several
weeks to conduct more definitive tests on brain tissue.</TE>
<TE>   "I am thinking the disease is not up this far north, but I want to
be sure," Svacina said. "We are just going to cut him up at home, put
him in the freezer and wait for the test results to come in."</TE>
<TE>   Chronic-wasting disease creates sponge-like holes in a deer's
brain, causing it to grow thin, behave abnormally and die. Experts
say there is no evidence the disease can infect humans, but the World
Health Organization advises people not to eat any part of a deer with
evidence of the incurable, fatal disease.</TE>
<TE>   The state is making an unprecedented attempt to kill all deer --
at least 25,000 of them -- in a 411-square-mile area west of Madison
where the disease was first seen in the state.</TE>
<TE>   But many hunters appeared unconcerned about the disease. O-W
Sports and Liquor in Owen registered 177 deer by late afternoon, but
only 30 heads were donated, owner Jackie Reinke said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many bucks being shot and they don't want to give up
the horns," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Department of Natural Resources spokeswoman Laurel Steffes said
reports on the head collections Saturday were mixed. Some stations
did not have as many as they wanted, and others were doing fine.</TE>
<TE>   "We really need to hammer the message that we really need those
deer," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The state announced in February that it found chronic-wasting
disease in three deer killed last fall west of Madison. It was the
first time the disease was found east of the Mississippi.</TE>

<HD>Girl Fatally Shot Playing in House</HD>
<DH>Bullet comes through 11-year-old's window in Minneapolis.
Police are uncertain whether the home was an intended target.</DH>

<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>An 11-year-old girl playing at her family's computer with her
6-year-old sister was struck and killed by a bullet that came through
the window of their home.</LD>
<LD>   The incident occurred shortly after 3 p.m. Friday in a
neighborhood in south Minneapolis. The girl died a short time later
at Hennepin County Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor R.T. Rybak went to the hospital to meet the girl's family.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a good, decent, hard-working family. It's an unimaginable
loss," said Inspector Sharon Lubinski, head of the police precinct
that includes the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The girl's identity wasn't released by authorities.</TE>
<TE>   There were no immediate arrests. Police were unsure how many
people were involved and whether the shooter was on foot or in a car.
A caller to police dispatchers said at least six shots were fired,
though neighbors gave conflicting accounts.</TE>
<TE>   There was nothing to indicate the girl's home was the intended
target, police said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a terrible tragedy, and these are cowards who have done
this," Police Chief Robert Olson said. "Somebody needs to come
forward and help us solve this case so we can identify who the
killers of this child are."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Pat Longs said the family is "very well-respected in this
neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   "They're part of us and this hurts all of us," Longs said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl is the fourth child since 1996 to be killed by a stray
bullet in the Twin Cities.</TE>

<HD>One Pentagon Constant Over Years: Its Historian</HD>
<DH>After three decades in the Defense Department, Alfred
Goldberg, 83, knows its past as well as anyone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Johanna Neuman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- He began his career as a military field historian in
London during World War II. Now, on the cusp of what could be a new
war in Iraq, Alfred Goldberg is still at it, gathering material as
the Pentagon's chief historian.</LD>
<LD>   Asked to account for his longevity, Goldberg, who turns 84 two
days before Christmas, seemed puzzled. "I don't consider myself very
old," he said.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington Monument can be seen through the windows behind his
desk in one of the many office buildings the Defense Department
leases in the Virginia suburbs. "There are more people working for
Defense in the Washington area outside of the Pentagon than in the
Pentagon," he said, explaining that the famous five-sided building
was built in 1943 to contain, well, an army. "The notion was that the
War Department would shrink after World War II and the building could
be used for other purposes," he said with nary a change of facial
expression.</LD>
<TE>   When Goldberg does smile, it's discreetly. Maybe he knows too
much. And he's not about to give away any military secrets. You don't
spend your career at the Pentagon without learning how to guard
against interservice rivalries, pork-averse congressmen or, for that
matter, visiting journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with a bit of coaxing, he will muse about history.</TE>
<TE>   He closely observed all 20 men who have served as secretary of
Defense since the first in 1947. In his eyes, Robert McNamara, who
served in the Kennedy administration, was perhaps the most effective.
"Probably, he had a greater overall grasp of everything going on than
anyone else," Goldberg said. "He had a phenomenal ability to absorb
information.</TE>
<TE>   "Vietnam ruined his reputation, of course, and left him with a
strong sense of guilt ever since," he added. "But he carried out
changes in the departmental budgeting system that have existed now
for more than 40 years."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg is big on Pentagon organization -- he co-edited a book on
the topic -- and on civilian control, which he thinks is the key to
the military's institutional strength. "The most effective
secretaries have usually been very forceful people," he said,
mentioning several times that Donald H. Rumsfeld is a strong
secretary who welcomes organizational improvements. "And also they
had a viewpoint, a dedication to civilian control."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the first secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, who
committed suicide less than two months after leaving office, Goldberg
leans over his desk to share another of the history books he edited.
He is eager to share dramatic before-and-after photographs that
reflect Forrestal's growing depression during his 19 months in
office. "Look at the picture when he took office and when he left,"
Goldberg said. "He was under tremendous emotional strain, and he
snapped."</TE>
<TE>   The people around him knew, Goldberg said, but President Truman's
motives for removing Forrestal, he said, had more to do with politics
than concern for the secretary's mental health. "Forrestal had not
been particularly supportive of Truman, and Truman had to reward
Louis Johnson, who was the chief fund-raiser for the 1948 campaign,"
Goldberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The historian thinks the second secretary of Defense might have
been kindly remembered by history were it not for the Korean War.
Johnson, a former assistant secretary of war and past president of
the American Legion, carried out Truman's orders to economize and
downsized the military.</TE>
<TE>   "The Korean War came along, it looked like things were going
badly, and somebody had to pay the price," Goldberg said. "He was the
sacrificial lamb. Out he went."</TE>
<TE>   It is that kind of matter-of-fact view of history that
characterizes Goldberg's approach to the job. Notice that a portrait
of Gen. George Washington hangs on his office wall, and he will point
out that it is just a copy, as if to avoid any errors of fact or
interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   The ninth of 11 children of immigrants from Bessarabia, a province
claimed at various times by Russia and Romania, Goldberg is one of
five remaining siblings -- the oldest is 96 -- who meet monthly in
their hometown of Baltimore. About 50 years ago, they formed a family
association, which now includes 23 children and what he refers to as
"45 or 50" in the generation after that.</TE>
<TE>   It is a rare vagary for Goldberg, who is a stickler for accuracy.
With a staff of five and the freedom to hire outside consultants and
editors, Goldberg is presiding over the writing of the official
history of the secretary of Defense, distinguished in part by access
to newly declassified documents. At the moment, he is deep in the
editing of Volume 5, chronicling 1961 to 1965.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg was a historian for the Air Force from 1946 to 1965, when
he joined Rand Corp. as a military analyst. After eight years he
returned to the Pentagon as a historian for the secretary of Defense,
where he has been for the last 29 years.</TE>
<TE>   His years of experience as a military historian with access to and
curiosity about the most arcane details of budgeting, equipment and
strategy make him unusually suited to the job.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy to report that people often ask me not to retire,
every day, especially people here," he said. "I'm fortunate to have a
long, deep background and understanding of the history of that
department. That's a big help in editing because you can edit
substance as well as form."</TE>
<TE>   He lives in a retirement community where his wife of 53 years can
receive help with her arthritis. He says he draws inspiration from
residents in their 90s, "still vital and active."</TE>
<TE>   These days, he also is overseeing the preparation of a history of
the Sept. 11 attack on the Pentagon, based largely on oral
recollections. His whereabouts that day included a conference in
Tysons Corner, Va., where top officials were gathering to discuss the
history of defense acquisition. After the attacks, the participants
kept to their schedule, perhaps convinced as Goldberg was that "we
may learn something useful by knowing what has happened in the last
55 years."</TE>
<TE>   In a lifetime of memories, perhaps his favorite came as a
historian on loan to the Warren Commission investigating President
Kennedy's assassination. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren told
Goldberg he wanted a historian on the panel because, and Goldberg
emphasizes that this is an exact quote, "I don't trust all these
lawyers I have."</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg is proud of the report that he helped write, confident in
its conclusion that Kennedy was felled by a lone assassin's bullets.
He grumbles about the "charlatans and dishonest people involved in
conveying notions of conspiracy." Mostly, he treasures the
"exhilaration" of getting history right.</TE>

<HD>Maine Court Is Asked for Guidance on Election</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Maine</DL>
<LD>With only nine votes separating Democrats from Republicans in the
struggle for control of the state Senate, Maine's outgoing
independent governor is asking the state's highest court for advice.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Angus King asked the Maine Supreme Judicial Court on Friday
for guidance about what his options and obligations are in certifying
a winner. But time is short: King faces a Tuesday deadline for
summoning the new Legislature to convene early next month.</LD>
<LD>   King said he believes it is unclear whether a governor must
perform a merely ministerial function by signing off on election
tallies forwarded to him by the secretary of state's office or should
examine disputed ballots himself.</LD>
<TE>   At issue is which political party will claim majority control of
the 35-member state Senate. The new state House of Representatives
will be held by the Democrats, and the incoming governor, U.S. Rep.
John Elias Baldacci, will be Maine's first Democratic chief executive
in 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   At last count in the Senate District 16 review, Democratic Rep.
Christopher Hall had nine votes more than Republican challenger
Leslie Fossel, but 63 ballots remained in dispute and four were being
challenged.</TE>
<TE>   The other 34 Senate contests were evenly split between the parties
at 17 each.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also cited the election in House District 80, where
Republican Stanley Moody led Democratic incumbent Elaine Fuller by
one vote, with 10 votes in dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice Leigh Saufley said the court would respond "in due
course," but added that no oral arguments before the court were
anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   King's letter to the justices asked in part whether a governor has
independent authority to determine apparent election winners and
whether a governor may certify anyone other than those tabulated as
apparent winners by the secretary of state.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democratic leaders Beverly Daggett and Sharon Treat issued
a statement Friday saying the best course would be for unresolved
disputes to be put before the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Republican Senate leaders Mary Small and Paul Davis
have called on Secretary of State Dan Gwadosky, a Democrat elected by
the Legislature, to recuse himself and his office from certifying the
disputed Senate race.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have argued that Gwadosky tainted himself by
campaigning for Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Gwadosky responded in a letter saying that he did not have
discretion under law to step out of the process.</TE>

<HD>Plans for Permanent WTC Tribute Mired by Mixed Emotions,
Politics</HD>
<DH>Divisions erupt among family members, survivors, architects
and officials over what form a memorial to Sept. 11 victims should
take.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin and Reed Johnson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It seemed like a dignified proposal to honor the World Trade Center
victims: The twin towers of light, which had been a temporary
memorial at ground zero earlier this year, would be relighted on
Staten Island for the holidays, near a landfill where human remains
had been taken.</LD>
<LD>   But the plan was scuttled when critics assailed the idea of a
memorial near a garbage dump and others complained it might undercut
a Manhattan tribute. Even a temporary proposal can stir up
controversy these days, as New Yorkers begin to ponder the more
difficult question of designing and building a permanent memorial at
the site of last year's terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   With a decision expected next year, deep fault lines have erupted
among family members, survivors, community leaders, architects,
historians and politicians. All insist that the city must create a
fitting memorial, yet this consensus is only skin deep. The larger
issues of what the tribute should look like and who it is meant for
are caught up in the same debates over memory and human loss that
have haunted the development of many other U.S. monuments.</LD>
<TE>   "The process of building a memorial in America may unify people,
but it can also tear them apart," said Edward Linenthal, author of
"The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City and American Memory."</TE>
<TE>   "Rival groups can form, with different agendas, and what started
out to be a simple tribute in public space can quickly turn into a
heated political battleground," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years the commemoration of episodes such as the Vietnam
War, the Battle of Little Bighorn, the internment of Japanese
Americans during World War II and the John F. Kennedy assassination
have provoked debates as fierce as those now swirling around the
World Trade Center site.</TE>
<TE>   Even memorials that seem noncontroversial today once sparked
vitriolic arguments on the history they sought to tell.</TE>
<TE>   America's vision of Gettysburg National Military Park in
Pennsylvania, for example, has evolved since the Civil War's
deadliest battle 139 years ago. At first, most of the memorials
honored the Union soldiers who died. In the 1890s, as the country's
regional wounds began to heal, there was a less regional approach,
honoring the dead on both sides. By 1938, an Eternal Peace Light
Memorial further emphasized national unity.</TE>
<TE>   But it took some 75 years to reach that point, and the acrimonious
debate about a memorial in New York City is heightened by the fact
that the traumatic event it seeks to commemorate happened less than
15 months ago. The horror of Sept. 11, 2001, is still fresh for many
people, and there has been little time to ponder a larger meaning.
Was the attack a story that can be fully told now -- or will it turn
out to be a chapter, a mere footnote, in a lengthy U.S. war against
international terrorism?</TE>
<TE>   History resists the process of commemoration because it is always
in flux, forever being analyzed and reinterpreted, said Mike Wallace,
who directs the Gotham Center for New York History. And even though
many family members are pushing to build a memorial as soon as
possible, he noted, it might be wise for the city to let some time
pass, so more perspective can emerge.</TE>
<TE>   New Yorkers may not have that luxury, however, because the drive
to build a memorial is now part of an accelerated building plan for
the 16-acre site in Lower Manhattan. Before the end of the year, the
city will unveil three design proposals for the area, including the
location where a memorial could be built. Early next year there will
be an international design competition, and a final plan will be
selected in late 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the design of U.S. memorials has taken much longer.
In Oklahoma City, five years elapsed between the 1995 bombing of the
Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and the final memorial dedication.
The Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, which sparked intense
controversy at first, took seven years to design and build.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, Wallace says, it might take nearly as long to
comprehend the larger meanings and lessons of Sept. 11. Even if
everyone magically agreed on a design now, he suggests, it might be
too soon to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   Still, hundreds of ideas for a permanent memorial have been
flooding the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., a government agency
formed to guide the site reconstruction. They range from quiet,
Zen-like park settings to huge, candlelit piers jutting into the East
River that would duplicate the length of each doomed tower. For some,
it is way too much, way too soon, to even contemplate.</TE>
<TE>   "We are barely beyond the one-year inundation, the anniversary,"
said Charles Wolf, who lost a son in the attacks. "And our
understanding of this will begin to change in five, 10 or 15 years.
Right now we're all still caught up in retribution, in war and other
issues, and I wonder if we're being forced to do this too early, with
a limited understanding."</TE>
<TE>   Anita Contini, who is directing the Lower Manhattan group's
memorial development process, insists that nothing will be rushed. If
an outstanding design fails to emerge from the competition next year,
she said, the process will start over.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll take as much time as is necessary," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, some family members are beginning to feel excluded
from the process.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent Staten Island public hearing, some expressed
frustration that they didn't know who was in charge of the decision.
Nick Chiarchiaro, who lost his wife and niece in the attacks, asked
angrily: "Who is Oz? Who is this person behind the curtain? Is that
someone here?"</TE>
<TE>   Despite these bruised feelings, most observers believe that family
members will have major input into the ultimate decision about a
memorial. Yet they will have to share a table that includes New York
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Gov. George Pataki, the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey -- which owns the former World Trade Center
site -- New Jersey Gov. James E. McGreevey and a host of local
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   There is no shortage of opinions on what the design should be, or
what it should say to future generations. Former Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, who moderated his initial belief that the entire site
should be a memorial, wants to see a "vast and soaring" tribute.
Pataki has said that the footprints -- or exact location -- of the
original twin towers should be exempt from commercial development.
Bloomberg, echoing the concerns of downtown residents, said the site
should not feel like a cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   A draft "vision statement" by victims' families is far more
specific, spelling out priorities for any memorial and museum: There
must be no street vendors hawking memorabilia in the area; the
footprints and land occupied by the former Marriott Hotel should be
exempt from commercial development; there should a visitor center, a
children's memorial center, a private area for families and a tomb
for unidentified human remains.</TE>
<TE>   The shape that powerful memorials eventually take -- and the
expectations that people initially had about them -- are often two
different things.</TE>
<TE>   In the traumatic hours after the Oklahoma City bombing, few could
have imagined that an eventual memorial would honor the dead with 168
empty chairs. Similarly, those who clashed over the Vietnam War might
not have expected the final memorial to be a quiet park where people
with radically different views would look at the same wall and be
overcome with emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Maya Lin, the Yale architecture student who won a competition to
design the Vietnam memorial, endured scathing, often racist criticism
for her idea of a memorial that simply listed on a black reflecting
wall the names of every U.S. soldier, sailor, airman and Marine who
died. The memorial has since been embraced because it allows
competing memories and emotions to exist side by side.</TE>
<TE>   In New York, officials will soon launch an artistic competition to
design the memorial, and some experts say that trusting a creative
eye instead of a committee might be the best way to guarantee a
design that echoes the magic of other monuments. Artists, curators
and community activists gathered recently at the Lower Manhattan
Development Corp. offices to discuss the project, and when family
members explained why they didn't want any commercial development on
the footprints of the original towers, there was broad agreement. But
one participant issued a provocative challenge.</TE>
<TE>   An artist might come up with a brilliant design, and shouldn't be
constrained by politics or fixed beliefs, said Kirk Varnedoe, former
curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   "You have utterly unquestioned moral authority and your voice is
going to be telling," Varnedoe told family members. "But I'm making a
difficult plea: I'm asking you not to use that power to constrain,
but to remain open. To see possibilities beyond what you may now
think."</TE>

<HD>NYC Sets Tax Hike to Offset Deficit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The City Council and the mayor have reached a tentative agreement on
an 18% property tax hike to help fill a $1.1-billion budget deficit,
Council Speaker Gifford Miller said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had proposed boosting property taxes by
25% to help balance the budget for this fiscal year, which ends June
30. But the City Council opposed such a large increase,
administration officials said.</LD>
<LD>   A vote on the agreement is expected before Thanksgiving, city
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   The tax hike would take effect in January.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't pretend it's a painless measure. It's a painful
measure," Miller said. "But when you are hemorrhaging money, you have
to take painful measures."</TE>
<TE>   City Council members also agreed to find $844 million in savings
through service cuts and debt re-servicing, Miller said, but the
details of where the savings would come from differed somewhat from a
plan Bloomberg released this month.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative agreement calls for restoring some funding for
libraries, the City University of New York, plus child-care programs
and foster-care programs.</TE>
<TE>   The plan also puts on hold Bloomberg's plan to close eight of 478
fire companies.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Miller said, a commission will be appointed to study how
the Fire Department can save $2.2 million, including determining
which -- if any -- firehouses should be closed.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg spokesman Ed Skyler confirmed the agreement has been
reached with the mayor "in principle."</TE>
<TE>   The city's budget woes don't end with this fiscal year. A budget
deficit of $6.4 billion is projected for next fiscal year.</TE>

<HD>Parade Honors Hunters of Snipers</HD>
<DH>Police Chief Charles Moose is grand marshal of event in
county where many victims lived.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SILVER SPRING, Md.</DL>
<LD>Montgomery County Police Chief Charles Moose really doesn't like
parades.</LD>
<LD>   Still, he was persuaded to ride in a convertible Saturday, passing
people wearing purple foam moose antlers and yelling his name, as
grand marshal of a parade honoring the law enforcement agencies that
hunted for the Washington-area snipers.</LD>
<LD>   "He's the man," 12-year-old Johanna Cahill said as she watched
Moose go by in a 1950s Cadillac. "He did a lot of good things for the
community."</LD>
<TE>   Moose dislikes parades so much that when he was chief in Portland,
Ore., he stayed home when the city honored its police force in its
annual Rose Festival parade.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the 13 people killed or wounded in the Washington area
were Montgomery County residents or had ties to the county. It also
was home to the sniper task force, a multi-agency team of thousands
of police officers and federal agents.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Moose the crowds came to see Saturday. He was mobbed by
people who wanted to shake his hand and thank him after an interfaith
service that preceded the parade.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since this event has come to closure, people have been
demonstrating their support and love for the police department,"
Moose said.</TE>
<TE>   John Allen Muhammad, 41, and Lee Boyd Malvo, 17, have been charged
in the killings.</TE>
<TE>   Several hundred people stood in the cold and wind to watch the
parade, which included police cars from sniper task force agencies,
high school bands, politicians and a turkey float for Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   Along the parade route, Irene Fergusen adjusted her antlers.</TE>
<TE>   "I've read the whole story of Chief Moose's life," she said. "I'm
happy we have him here. He's a wonderful person."</TE>

<HD>Along Lake Tahoe, Planning for a Throwback to the 1980s</HD>
<DH>Officials say building of luxurious homes on waterfront is
out of control. Some disagree.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev.</DL>
<LD>Lake Tahoe's unparalleled scenery used to be all about the
snow-topped mountains, the lush woods and the deep clear water. But
increasingly it's having to compete against spectacular shoreline
trophy homes.</LD>
<LD>   The lake's overseers say luxurious waterfront building has gone
overboard, and to reverse the trend, they adopted unprecedented
architectural and landscaping requirements last week, hoping to
return the lake's natural scenic qualities to 1982 levels by trying
to conceal man's intrusions in the alpine basin.</LD>
<LD>   "Homes are visually impairing the lake's aesthetics. They've been
getting bigger and bigger," said Dean Heller, Nevada's secretary of
state who chairs the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. "Property owners
are tearing down small, old homes and building homes five or six
times larger. The architecture is very bold, they're closer to the
shoreline and, worst of all, they're cutting down trees.</LD>
<TE>   "If the lake is overdeveloped and all you see are homes," he said,
"people will quit coming here, and there's no upside to that."</TE>
<TE>   Key among the new restrictions: a virtual ban on mansion-scale
homes that have risen along the shoreline over the last 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Well-heeled property owners have sued, angry at the prospect of
scaling back their construction plans or having to plant trees to
screen their homes from public view -- and jeopardizing their own
million-dollar views. Environmentalists say the law is a good start
but doesn't go far enough in reversing the effects of what they call
"monster homes."</TE>
<TE>   Rochelle Mason, executive director of the League to Save Lake
Tahoe, said the rules are overdue "but at least we're finally moving
in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Under the camouflage law, proposed home designs will be scored on
such criteria as color, type and number of windows, roof treatment,
construction material, landscape screening and how large the
structure will appear to boaters on the lake. If a home doesn't score
enough points, it can't be built.</TE>
<TE>   Any home with more than 2,200 square feet of surface visible from
the lake is now deemed too large for the typical 100-foot-wide
lakeside lots. Homes on a double-size lot can't be twice as big and
will have to meet even tougher concealment standards.</TE>
<TE>   High scores go to smaller homes constructed with natural stone or
wood, with heavily textured siding painted in dark earth tones,
multifaceted exterior walls, a dark roof, expensive glare-resistant
windows and sufficient plantings -- features that help them blend in.</TE>
<TE>   A boxy stucco house painted in light colors and with lots of
reflective windows and little landscaping is probably doomed on the
drawing boards.</TE>
<TE>   The rules can't change what's already been built, but existing
homes will have to meet some of the new standards if they are
modified. Over time -- perhaps 20 years or longer as more homes fall
in line -- officials hope Lake Tahoe's scenery will reflect how it
appeared in the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Brisco, the executive director of the lake's homeowners
association, said she fears that residents will resist making home
improvements in order to avoid the new requirements.</TE>
<TE>   An Incline Village real estate agent said his clients, including
property owners who haven't built homes, feel victimized.</TE>
<TE>   "They are facing onerous regulations that will prohibit them from
using the lots to the potential of their expectations when they
purchased them," said Bob Wheeler, who headed the Committee for
Reasonable Regulation of Lake Tahoe. It opposed the new rules and
argued for better enforcement of existing guidelines. In anticipation
of the rules, the committee filed a federal lawsuit last month
against the planning agency.</TE>
<TE>   The group contends that most of the 942 existing homes along the
lake's 72-mile perimeter -- just over half of it privately owned --
would not qualify under the new guidelines. It argues that the Tahoe
planning agency is overreacting and overreaching its legal rights,
and that there have been no surveys to suggest that "real people find
there is an unacceptable dominance of the human environment over
natural endowments."</TE>
<TE>   Reactions in town are mixed on that. "The homes are beautiful, but
some are so big we can't see past them to appreciate the lake when we
go on our walks," said Suzi Culbert, a Sacramento teacher, staying at
her time-share condominium here.</TE>
<TE>   But the trophy homes are part of the attraction, resident Alison
Johnson said. "People love looking at the houses. Besides, the people
building the big homes are the ones paying the taxes.... This is
bureaucracy snowballing out of control."</TE>
<TE>   The Tahoe planning agency was created by California and Nevada --
the state line bisects the lake -- and ratified by Congress in 1980.
Among its purposes is to preserve the basin's scenery by governing
man's intrusions in the environment.</TE>
<TE>   The lake's scenery has steadily deteriorated since 1982, when
officials first assessed the visual effect of structures. Experts in
visual aesthetics divided the lake into 33 shoreline segments, and in
their most recent evaluation last year, they found that some segments
have not worsened and a few have even improved with the removal of
old homes and tired motels. But nearly half the areas have been
visually degraded by development over the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   On that count, there is little disagreement.</TE>
<TE>   But Brisco, of the homeowners association, said the new rules
unfairly punish property owners who want to get the most out of their
land investment. At Incline Village, half-acre lots with 100 feet of
shoreline frontage are worth $3 million; a five-acre lot with 200
feet of lake frontage is valued upward of $20 million, according to
the local county tax assessor's office.</TE>
<TE>   She complained that the planning agency made few concessions to
homeowners and that the rules don't "reflect the real world of what's
going on along the lakefront. The way they're trying to control the
shorefront is punitive."</TE>
<TE>   Planning agency member Jim Galloway, who supported the
restrictions, said he was worried that some board members were driven
by motives less pure than preserving the scenery.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's an undercurrent of a social agenda and resentment
of rich people flouting their resources," said Galloway, who is also
a Washoe County, Nev., commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Club spokesman Terry Davis had argued for stronger
regulations, but said the adopted restrictions are nonetheless
"unmatched anywhere else in the country."</TE>
<TE>   "Lake Tahoe is unique nationally," Davis said. "It's a scenic
jewel that was allowed to develop, where it should have been a
national park. So it's necessary that there are regulations like
these."</TE>

<HD>Firm Cleared in Wellstone Crash</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Federal Aviation Administration said it found no violations after
reviewing hiring practices at the company that provided the pilots
involved in the crash that killed U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone.</LD>
<LD>   The review of Aviation Charter Inc. was sparked by media reports
of background problems with one of the pilots.</LD>
<LD>   It was separate from an ongoing National Transportation Safety
Board investigation into the cause of the Oct. 25 crash.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Conry, a convicted felon who exaggerated his flying
experience when he was hired in April 2001, was the chief pilot on
the flight that crashed, killing Wellstone, the two pilots and five
others on board.</TE>
<TE>   Conry trained for four months in 1990 to be a co-pilot for
commuter carrier American Eagle, but resigned while still a trainee.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation Charter managers said Conry told them he had flown 400
hours to 500 hours as a co-pilot on American Eagle ATR twin-turboprop
airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   A previous employer is prohibited from providing background
information that is older than five years, unless it is related to a
license suspension or revocation, the FAA said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Conry was convicted of felony mail fraud after leaving American
Eagle.</TE>
<TE>   Aviation Charter owner Roger Wikner has said he never would have
hired Conry if he had known of his record.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA review also looked into Aviation Charter's training of
another man who was not on the Wellstone flight.</TE>
<TE>   The man was trained by Aviation Charter in 1999 to be a jet
co-pilot after he fabricated a commercial license. The FAA, which
revoked his private pilot's license in 2000 after the company
discovered the fake commercial license, said the man "never flew
passengers [at Aviation Charter] as alleged."</TE>
<TE>   Aviation Charter spokeswoman Mary Milla said Wikner was pleased
that the FAA report "clarified the situation," but that Wikner didn't
want to comment beyond that.</TE>

<HD>Going to Puerto Rico Is Expos' Hot Topic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sending the Montreal Expos to P.R. will amount to nothing more than
bad PR if early reviews of the Expos' upcoming 22-game experiment in
Puerto Rico are any indication.</LD>
<LD>   Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post and ESPN posed a few
questions for Bud Selig about the unprecedented arrangement: "Who did
Puerto Rico beat out, Malta? Where you gonna send the Expos next
year, Yemen?</LD>
<LD>   "Nobody goes to Puerto Rico in the summer, Bud. Does the phrase
'en fuego' mean anything to you? Vladimir Guerrero will be frying
eggs on his forehead in the outfield. That homestand in September,
that's right in the middle of hurricane season.</LD>
<TE>   "You going to have a Nail Yourself to Your Seat Night? Whatever
else is wrong with Montreal, it certainly isn't its climate in the
summer."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which schools played for the Bourbon Barrel?</TE>
<TE>   No Gamble: Wide receiver-defensive back Chris Gamble of Ohio State
is like the hard-to-find Waldo when it comes to Heisman Trophy
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Chuck Culpepper of Newsday:</TE>
<TE>   "The mad craving to anoint a best player in the nation has
included everything but a flashlight and a canary, has meandered from
region to region and quarterback to quarterback and hunch to hunch,
yet somehow has never homed in on the one player who most commands
the game like he's still a 10-year-old star of the backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "He receives. He intercepts. He runs back punts. He runs back
kickoffs. He tackles. He gets tackled. Occasionally. They try to rest
him with 80 or 90 snaps, but last week, he played 130.</TE>
<TE>   "He's everywhere, so it's weird that he's been nowhere in national
discussions."</TE>
<TE>   Hoops of humility: Britton Johnsen of Utah didn't think he
deserved the Mountain West Conference basketball player of the year
award last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not trying to sound humble, I just don't believe I deserved
it," he told Slam magazine. "Maybe they did it based on potential?</TE>
<TE>   "I got a lot of hype before I came here, and Coach [Rick] Majerus
never liked that. Neither did I."</TE>
<TE>   Time machine: Mail service can be a little slow, but the arrival
of magazines in back-to-back months had some wondering if it was the
'80s all over again. John McEnroe landed on the cover of Tennis
magazine one month, Bjorn Borg the next.</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe won his last Grand Slam title in 1984 at the U.S. Open,
and Borg's last Slam was at the French Open in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Indiana and Kentucky. The awarding of the barrel
was discontinued in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: There's paranoia and then there's pragmatism. Because
the student manager of Maryland's football team is dating Virginia
running back Marquis Weeks, Maryland Coach Ralph Friedgen told her to
take off practice last week.</TE>
<TE>   His players didn't understand, so the coach explained.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, everybody thinks I'm nuts," he told the Washington
Post. "So I said to [Bruce] Perry, 'Let me ask you this: If your
girlfriend was a manager for Virginia, would she tell you what they
were doing?' He said, 'Well, I'd make her.' I rest my case."</TE>
<TE>   Virginia apparently didn't need any inside information, defeating
Maryland, 48-13.</TE>

<HD>Chaminade's Win Was Unbelievable</HD>
<DH>Victory over Sampson, Virginia is game's No. 1 upset</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody believed the score.</LD>
<LD>   Chaminade 77, Virginia 72.</LD>
<LD>   The 800-student NAIA school from Honolulu beat the nation's No.
1-ranked school on Dec. 23, 1982, in the biggest upset in college
basketball history.</LD>
<TE>   Virginia had a 7-foot-4 center who was en route to his third
straight national player of the year award.</TE>
<TE>   The Cavaliers had been to the Final Four the previous season. In
the four games before playing Chaminade, they won by 13 points at
Duke, beat Georgetown and sophomore center Patrick Ewing in what was
billed as "The Game of the Decade," and then went to Japan for a
two-game tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Playing without an ill Ralph Sampson, Virginia beat Houston,
featuring center Hakeem Olajuwon, and Utah in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 3,500 fans in the University of Hawaii's Blaisdell
Arena were there to see the No. 1 team and the No. 1 player. They
wound up seeing the No. 1 upset.</TE>
<TE>   When the score and story moved on The Associated Press wire around
2 a.m. EST, several newspapers called the New York office to verify
the copy.</TE>
<TE>   "Which Virginia did they beat?" one caller asked, thinking it
might have been Virginia State, Virginia Union or another school with
a similar name.</TE>
<TE>   The late Tom Mees was nearing the end of a "SportsCenter" on ESPN
that night and was given a piece of paper with the news of the upset
on it, but he balked at reading it.</TE>
<TE>   "We were dumbfounded," Mees told the Honolulu Star-Bulletin at the
time. "Nobody had heard of Chaminade then. I asked them to
double-check it.</TE>
<TE>   "Usually I would bolt for the door to go home and get some sleep,
but that night I went back upstairs and called someone in Honolulu.
If I was going to read something this momentous to the country, I
wanted to at least make sure I'd been right."</TE>
<TE>   Chaminade players Richard Haenisch and Mark Rodrigues knew the
outcome was right, and they celebrated higher than anyone else,
climbing on to the rims after the game in what became instant photo
classics.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second half, the crowd sounded like 35,000. You could hear
them saying 'Oh my God, they can beat these guys,' " Haenisch said.
"They rushed on the court and I sat on the rims. It was a great
feeling.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knew how to say our name. They thought it rhymed with
'lemonade.' Then you heard people say, 'Yes, Virginia, there is a
Chaminade.' "</TE>
<TE>   The 20th anniversary is being celebrated a little early because
the schools meet Monday in the opening game of the Maui Invitational,
an eight-team tournament that Chaminade, now a member of Division II
in the NCAA, hosts every year.</TE>
<TE>   The matchup was created by ESPN, and the tournament has invited
some of the significant participants to this year's event.</TE>
<TE>   "That game will be like the Titanic or Iwo Jima," current Virginia
Coach Pete Gillen said this month. "They'll be reviewing when they
beat us 20 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   The review has been going on for two decades and was only
heightened by the Silverswords' wins over highly ranked Louisville
and Southern Methodist the next two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Chaminade's Tony Randolph had played against Sampson in high
school in Virginia and in pickup games.</TE>
<TE>   That helped his confidence despite the eight-inch difference in
height. Randolph finished with 19 points, seven more than Sampson.</TE>
<TE>   "That team we had wasn't scared of anybody," Randolph said.</TE>
<TE>   Haenisch admitted there was some fear against a team that had just
beaten Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they just came from beating Phi Slamma Jamma and we were
intimidated a little early," he said. "When you start executing your
plays, you start believing. We were tied at halftime and went into
the locker room feeling they're not any better than us."</TE>
<TE>   Then came the game's signature play, and it was one of the
smallest players who pulled it off.</TE>
<TE>   "Both teams had a five-, seven-point lead but it was close,"
Randolph said. "Then Mark Rodrigues came off the bench and found Tim
Dunham off a back screen, and he slammed it home with Ralph Sampson
in the vicinity. That play was usually the one we used to shut the
door on teams. That night, when it happened, we knew right then
everything was clicking."</TE>
<TE>   Said Haenisch, now a broker in Los Angeles: "The alley-oop to
Dunham really got us going and let us think we can win this game.
Dunham said he was 6-1 or 6-2. He was 5-10."</TE>
<TE>   Dunham, who is the pastor of the Greater Faith Missionary Baptist
Church in Pittsburgh, Calif., didn't get caught up in the height
controversy or the hype around the play.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just another play, one we regularly did in games," he
said. "A two-handed alley-oop sounds more accurate."</TE>
<TE>   Sampson had been diagnosed with pneumonia after the Georgetown
game. He spent most of his time in Tokyo sick in his hotel room. He
returned to the court against Chaminade and had 17 rebounds against
the Silverswords.</TE>
<TE>   "All our players had played their hearts out in Tokyo," Sampson
said. "They relaxed too much when they got to Honolulu. They went to
the beach, got a suntan, got healthy. It was a situation where we
just weren't ready to play."</TE>
<TE>   Sampson, who works with youngsters through his organization,
Winner's Circle in Atlanta, isn't thrilled talking about the game.</TE>
<TE>   "My career speaks for itself as far as basketball is concerned,"
he said. "There are always lapses. People can call it what they want.
Now I'll have a chance to work with kids by doing some camps in
Hawaii. If a game like that can lead to something like this 20 years
later, that's great. It was special for Chaminade and the players and
fans. Me? I'll remember the Georgetown game."</TE>
<TE>   No one will ever forget Chaminade-Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, Virginia lost to North Carolina State one game
shy of another Final Four, and Chaminade lost to South
Carolina-Spartanburg in the NAIA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   It's the game on Dec. 23, 1982, that made history.</TE>

<DH>With electrifying talent and uncanny instincts, Vick could
become best ever</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Attner</AU>
<BD>Sporting News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sort through the gifts -- the 4.3 speed and the arm strong enough to
drill it 60 yards pretty much without a wobble and the instincts of a
scrambling running back that have you thinking "Barry Sanders" -- and
they leave you gasping for context.</LD>
<LD>   No quarterback in NFL history has been blessed with this
assortment of talent. Nobody. So does this make Michael Vick the
future of quarterbacking? That's certainly the conventional wisdom
around the league: To combat the increasing speed of defenses, you'll
need this kind of special athlete. But it's difficult to be the
future in a crowd of one. "If you can find other Michael Vicks in the
next 10 years, order me a couple," says Ozzie Newsome, the Baltimore
Ravens' senior vice president of football operations. Maybe as Vick
matures and becomes dominant, it will stimulate high school coaches
to keep their best athlete at quarterback. Maybe.</LD>
<LD>   But this much already is a given about Vick, whether he becomes
the next answer among quarterbacks or not: Before he retires, he will
be acknowledged as the most exciting, electric player -- not just
quarterback -- we've ever seen. And not just because of his dazzling
running skills; his arm will prove just as thrilling.</LD>
<TE>   Seeing is believing. And he is something to see -- a bundle of hip
feints and foot fakes and rapid bursts and passes from any angle that
make you laugh and smile -- and demand more. In a sport where teams,
not individuals, sell tickets, Vick is emerging as that rare guy
you'd pay to see. Brett Favre's like that now, as was Sanders. And
Deion Sanders in his prime -- what was more fun than the anticipation
of one of his punt returns?</TE>
<TE>   That's how it's becoming with Vick -- on virtually every offensive
play. Much like Barry Sanders, he has that innate ability to be
average on one snap and look like Superman the next, the marvel who
can get you to spill your popcorn -- and keep you standing. He can
turn a three-yard rush into an ESPN minute, a scramble into a run for
the memory bank. He already leads the league in "wows," yet he
remains eons away from a quarterback with a full portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   John Dorsey, Green Bay's director of college scouting, remembers
the strange feeling that permeated Lambeau Field during the Packers'
season-opening victory over the Falcons in September. Vick completed
his first 10 passes, kept rallying the Falcons and did everything but
replace Bart Starr on the stadium's Ring of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "When the game was over, there was a collective sense of relief
from every fan in the place," says Dorsey. "Every time he touched the
ball, you held your breath. He left a mark on Lambeau I haven't seen
an opposing quarterback leave in a long time."</TE>
<TE>   The Falcons' ticket manager has the easiest job in Atlanta these
days. He's usually begging folks to attend games -- until this
season, the team had only three sellouts since its 1998 Super Bowl
season -- but they'll fill the Georgia Dome for all eight dates this
year with fans who want just a glimpse of Vick.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm from Atlanta, and when I retire, I'm going to have my butt in
the Georgia Dome watching him," says Pittsburgh safety Lee Flowers,
whose team blew substantial second-half leads when Vick, among other
heroics, converted passes on third and 22, third and 23 and third and
24 into first downs. "It's nerve-wracking defending him. I just hope
and pray we don't have to play him again before I retire."</TE>
<TE>   And what's great is, Vick gets it. He embraces his role as
entertainer. He doesn't just want to succeed; he wants you and him to
have fun while he does it. Every week, he can't wait to jump on that
stage and turn on the lights and start the party. Yet he isn't
strutting after every success, or boasting about it later. He gets it
here, too; with his legs, you don't need any bluster.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun," he says. "You come out every week, and you know people
want to see you do things to excite them, and you want to do things
that make them want to come back to see you again. I hurt myself by
trying to make something happen every time, but I know I have a
special gift. And I'm not going to waste it."</TE>
<TE>   In his first season as a full-time starter, he has created an
unprecedented sense of anticipation throughout the league. If he can
accomplish what he is doing now -- driving the 6-3-1 Falcons toward
an improbable playoff berth after a 1-3 start, setting them up for a
win or tie with three fourth-quarter comebacks, all the while zipping
off amazing plays as routinely as Roger Clemens records strikeouts --
how scintillating will it be when he learns how to dissect a two-deep
zone mixed with a max blitz?</TE>
<TE>   "I can be the best ever," he says. "That's what I want to be. I
understand I've been blessed with rare abilities, so it is up to me
to develop them to their fullest."</TE>
<TE>   And don't brush him off as some out-of-control wannabe with no
sense for the game. Despite his inexperience, he had a streak of 171
passes (going back to last year) without an interception before being
picked off in Week 9, and he now has only two in 228 throws. His
interception percentage of 0.8 would be close to an NFL record. Wow.</TE>
<TE>   You ask Randy Mueller, the former New Orleans general manager, to
study Vick on tape and he can't wait to give you the results. It's
catching; once players, coaches and personnel guys watch Vick,
they're mesmerized. It's almost eerie the way these normally
conservative men all consistently use one word -- phenomenal -- to
describe some aspect of his talents.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the most athletic guy I have ever seen," said Mueller. "He
is awesome with his feet, simply awesome. His quickness and
acceleration, the way he plays out of the pocket, it's phenomenal. He
runs like a running back, not a quarterback. And you have no chance
-- no chance -- against him in the open field. Gosh, he is fun to
watch."</TE>
<TE>   Vick is Steve Young and Randall Cunningham and Fran Tarkenton and
Roger Staubach wrapped into one -- with accelerated athleticism none
of them could match. Donovan McNabb can run; this guy can explode.</TE>
<TE>   Already, Vick is starting to accumulate symbols of immortality.
He's elevating a team with average receivers and a so-so line into an
unexpected winner, one of the true measures of quarterback greatness.
Put him in the most pressurized situations -- the last minutes of a
game, his squad trailing -- and he responds with enlightened
performances, just as elite quarterbacks should.</TE>
<TE>   With 1:01 left in Green Bay, he drove the Falcons 35 yards for a
tying field goal. With 2:11 left against the Bears, he moved them 44
yards to set up what would have been a winning 45-yard field goal,
but it was missed. With 2:20 left and no timeouts against the Saints
in New Orleans, he marched the Falcons 60 yards to set up the winning
field goal as time expired. Down, 34-17, against the Steelers in
Pittsburgh, he told his teammates, "I'm about to make it happen." He
then guided them to two touchdowns, tying it with an 11-yard run that
ended a 50-yard possession in the final 1:55.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like Houdini," says defensive coordinator Mike Nolan of the
Ravens, who, along with the Bucs, have been most successful
containing Vick this year.</TE>
<TE>   And no one expects him to disappear anytime soon. Only get better

<HD>Singling Out Woods Is Hypocritical Act</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Wilbon</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You listen to some folks, you'd think it's Tiger Woods' fault Augusta
National has no female members. I read these diatribes criticizing
Tiger Woods for not coming out in favor of women being admitted to
Augusta, even though I can think of a half-dozen interviews in which
he has said he favors women being members of Augusta. But for some
folks, that's not good enough; Tiger Woods is apparently supposed to
be the caretaker of women's golf in America.</LD>
<LD>   I read an editorial in Monday's editions of the New York Times
that suggested that Tiger should boycott the Masters, the most
prestigious tournament in the world, in April so that he can send the
message that discrimination isn't good for the sport.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, is that right? I bet the editorial pages of the Times never
suggested that Jack Nicklaus should have boycotted the Masters
because Augusta National didn't have any black members. And if we
want to make it a little more current, I didn't see the Times
suggesting in that same editorial that Phil Mickelson or Davis Love
or Ryder Cup captain Hal Sutton -- all American men with wives and
daughters -- should boycott the Masters, or for that matter as much
as open their mouths in protest.</LD>
<TE>   Why Tiger and not, say, David Duval?</TE>
<TE>   Because Tiger is black. No, the Times didn't say that, I am. But
the writer couldn't have been more obvious. Sure, he's the best
golfer in the world, and the most influential, but even if Sergio
Garcia or Ernie Els was No. 1, a whole lot of folks -- like the
editorial writer for the Times -- would be crouching and waiting for
Tiger. I checked the clips this morning, and I didn't find any such
editorial by the Times suggesting CBS not televise the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger, the Times suggests, needs to have a social conscience but
other golfers -- read, white golfers -- do not. The men who run
broadcast networks do not. I didn't realize that of 248 golfers who
have made money on the PGA Tour this year, only one 26-year-old black
golfer is supposed to have a social conscience, and everybody else on
tour gets a pass. The Times ought to write another editorial
explaining why that's so.</TE>
<TE>   In our desperate search to find a clear and unwavering voice on
social issues, particularly as they relate to sports, we've rushed to
anoint Tiger Woods. Partly, this is his father's doing, saying that
Tiger is one day going to be as important as Gandhi, which is insane
and puts way too much pressure on the son.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger is 26. How many 26-year-olds who grew up middle-class in
Southern California and wanted for virtually nothing because his
parents gave him everything could possibly have a fully developed
social conscience and know how to express it on the world stage? No
matter how hard some folks wish it to be, Tiger isn't Arthur Ashe and
isn't ever going to be Ashe, or Muhammad Ali.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger didn't grow up in the shadow of Jim Crow "whites only" signs
in the South, or on the wrong side of the tracks. The set of
circumstances that produced the Jim Browns, Tommie Smiths and John
Carloses haven't come within 10,000 miles of Woods. He has no
legitimate reason, not yet anyway, to wake up every morning in a rage
over the injustices he has faced because he hasn't faced many, if
any. He'll get there, I suspect, in time. But damn if he should be
pushed there by the New York Times.</TE>
<TE>   And how is it that Tiger, by boycotting the Masters, absolves
white men who play golf from participating in the national discussion
on the exclusion of women at Augusta National? Maybe the Times hasn't
noticed, despite the reporting of their wonderful golf writer,
Clifford Brown, how often the words "no comment" come from the mouths
of golfers other than Tiger who won't go on the record with their
feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Generally speaking, I don't look to athletes for social
commentary. But on this issue, given that it has been raging for five
months, I would at the very least like to think there's a pulse.
Though I disagree with golfer Len Mattiace's position that he is fine
with Augusta not admitting women, I applaud him for not only voicing
what he believes but for saying golfers ought to open their mouths
and participate in such an emotional national discussion.</TE>
<TE>   In putting all the pressure on Tiger to settle this dispute by
withholding his excellence, the Times seems to miss the fact that
South African Gary Player has been one of the great crusaders for
racial equality in sports, and that Els, also South African, has been
willing to enter the difficult and emotionally charged discussions.</TE>
<TE>   My only real criticisms of Tiger throughout this debate have been
that he had better not allow marketers to present him as a crusader
while backing off in real life, and that his voice is far stronger
than he knows.</TE>
<TE>   Not only can he rock the boat, he can turn it over and shake it
like a bathtub dingy.</TE>
<TE>   If Woods wanted to boycott the Masters, I would applaud him.</TE>
<TE>   But for the gray old lady Times to suggest he should while making
no such demands on anybody else is too arrogant and too transparent
for me.</TE>

<HD>Controversy Pinches Businesses in Augusta</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>Terry Wick couldn't ask for a better place to cater to VIP golf fans
than the Clubhouse, a banquet hall he manages across the street from
the main entrance to Augusta National Golf Club.</LD>
<LD>   For the Masters tournament in April, big companies throw private
parties and pay in the five figures for Wick's red-carpet treatment.
They get duck with orange brandy sauce on the menu, leather couches
facing three TVs in one dining room, and a putting green in the
parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   But with the Masters nearly five months away, Wick's already
worried. He received e-mail from a major telecommunications company
canceling its plans. The message said Augusta National, under fire
for its all-male membership, is too controversial for wining and
dining clients.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a pretty big hit. That's about $60,000 we'll lose. They were
probably our second-biggest client," Wick said. "There could easily
be repercussions across the board for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   As a sort of Mardi Gras for the country-club crowd, Masters week
in Augusta is known for corporate largess. Companies rent clusters of
private homes for executives and guests, throw elaborate catered
parties and plaster their logos on rented limousines.</TE>
<TE>   But some Augustans, such as Wick, say the battle between Augusta
National and the National Council of Women's Organizations is taking
a bite out of the lucrative business they count on from Magnolia
Lane.</TE>
<TE>   Hootie Johnson, chairman of the private golf club, has refused
demands from the women's council to admit a female member by the 2003
Masters. With the Rev. Jesse Jackson threatening protests and Tiger
Woods on the defensive, some companies are deciding to duck the
controversy by staying away.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Starr, president of Augusta rental agency Corporate
Quarters, said "two or three" corporate clients have canceled, citing
budget cuts. She hopes bookings will bounce back in January, as they
did last year to avert a Masters meltdown after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that could be the worst thing to ever happen," said
Starr, who declined to identify clients. "Then you realize the
women's organizations could do just as much damage."</TE>
<TE>   Augusta's official business boosters scoff at the notion of an
economic Masters disaster. Since the tournament began in 1934,
Masters tickets have become among the most coveted in sports. For
every person declining an invitation, scores more wait to snatch it
up.</TE>
<TE>   "If a corporation decided not to come to Augusta for the
tournament, the tickets will not go unused," said Barry White,
director of the Augusta Convention and Visitors Bureau. "There's
enough demand. People will come. People will be spending money in
Augusta."</TE>
<TE>   But there's a big difference between the golf enthusiasts who pack
Augusta's hotels and restaurants simply to attend the tournament, and
corporate ticket holders who put on major productions.</TE>
<TE>   They bring in the big bucks. An estimated 2,000 homeowners rent
their houses, counting on hefty fees for mortgage payments or home
improvements. College students and teachers whose spring break
coincides with the Masters take temporary jobs as waiters and maids
for extra cash.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't get me wrong, you don't laugh at any of the money that
comes in," said Aimee Murphy, an image consultant who worked as a
house maid during the last four Masters. "But the big money comes
from those who are renting the houses, doing the catering and having
the functions."</TE>
<TE>   Wick, who normally hires 100 extra hands, said he has received 40
applications from displaced tournament temps whose regular gigs have
been canceled.</TE>
<TE>   One of them was Murphy, who says the homeowners who previously
hired her called last week to say their renters won't be returning.</TE>
<TE>   Which companies aren't coming? It's hard to say. Augusta
businesses zealously guard the identity of their Masters clients. And
no companies have publicly stated they're sitting out the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   But Augusta National has dropped its three sponsors -- Coca-Cola,
Citigroup and IBM -- to shield their image. American Express Chairman
Kenneth Chenault, an Augusta National member, has said he thinks
there should be female members.</TE>
<TE>   And there are signs some companies will still attend but are
cutting back spending because of the shaky economy. CBS passed on
renting the house where Murphy worked as a maid, though the network
still plans to televise the Masters. Wick said a large tobacco
company has scaled back its rentals to three houses rather than
seven.</TE>
<TE>   Some Augustans, such as Starr, say companies are more worried
about the budget pressures than the women's issue. Others acknowledge
they are loath to give any credit to Martha Burk, head of the NCWO.</TE>
<TE>   Vera Stewart, owner of Very Vera catering, normally has her
Masters menus planned by now. But she says several corporate
customers have put off signing contracts until January.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not willing to say that has anything to do with Martha Burk,"
Stewart said. "She's not going to hurt my business."</TE>
<TE>   Burk said she understands the frustration in Augusta. But she says
Augusta National deserves the blame, not herself.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if I decided tomorrow to give up this fight, the tournament
is so tainted. Sponsors would still not come back until the policy is
changed," Burk said.</TE>
<TE>   If Augusta National doesn't back down, Burk said, public protests
will be certain.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Gary Powell of the Richmond County sheriff's department said
nobody has applied yet for a public demonstration permit, which
Augusta requires, but peaceful protests will be allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think their biggest problem will be finding a place to stay
while they're here," Powell said.</TE>

<HD>Flying High in Philly</HD>
<DH>Fired by the Dallas Stars, Ken Hitchcock is connecting with
his new team. But he knows the goodwill won't last forever.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kara Yorio</AU>
<BD>Sporting News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The clock is ticking on Philadelphia Flyer Coach Ken Hitchcock. And
he knows it.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a certain time frame when the players want discipline,
want direction, want you to be able to lead the charge in adjusting,"
says Hitchcock, in his first season with Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Now is that time for Hitchcock. His team got off to a hot start
and is one of the best in the Eastern Conference, and his job is not
in jeopardy. But coaching life spans can cover a few games, two
seasons, four or whatever. Hitchcock's coaching life span depends on
what he can get out of his team and for how long. No matter how great
its achievements, though, a coaching life span inevitably comes to an
end.</LD>
<TE>   After getting fired by the Dallas Stars in January, despite
coaching more than six seasons -- which included one Stanley Cup and
another trip to the finals -- Hitchcock knows how it works. He will
fight to gain the trust of his players. He will teach them his system
and get them to believe. Then, they must try to be successful. If,
after succeeding, the team stumbles and starts to fall, another
process will begin. Ultimately, that process will end when Hitchcock
is fired, or he decides to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to his time with Dallas, Hitchcock can describe not only
the progress of a team's development on the ice but the process of
its demise off it.</TE>
<TE>   "There is the climbing up the ladder," he says. "Then when you get
there, there is trying to stay on top. Then there is going down."</TE>
<TE>   When the team is falling, often the players kick the ladder out
from under the coach. Hitchcock didn't see it coming with the Stars.
But after getting fired, he talked to former coaches, and now he has
identified a pattern.</TE>
<TE>   "First, [the players] get angry at each other," Hitchcock says.
"Then they get angry at certain individuals on the team. Then they
get angry at the coach."</TE>
<TE>   The last stage of anger is usually the final straw for management.
The truth is, the demise of a team starts long before the anger
reaches the coach.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you start falling, you start pointing fingers," says New
Jersey Devil winger Jamie Langenbrunner, who played for Hitchcock
with the Stars. "You start saying, 'The team shouldn't have done
this' or 'shouldn't have signed this guy.' Then the coach is too
hard. As soon as you point one finger, it's over. Looking back on it,
that's exactly what we did. We imploded."</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock was sent away with a reputation for being too negative,
for sucking the life and fun out of the game. But Langenbrunner says
that's not an accurate description.</TE>
<TE>   "He's demanding, but he's fair," Langenbrunner says. "He asks you
to play hard and play smart. He's a very big competitor, and he's
going to do everything in his power to win."</TE>
<TE>   At first, those are qualities the players need. They need the
energy from their coach. They want to be told where to go and what to
do on the ice. They listen only as long as those directions result in
success. With Philadelphia, Hitchcock's coaching has brought success,
and that success has brought him disciples in a fickle Flyer locker
room. The players are listening.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, it's all for one and one for all. Jeremy Roenick and
Keith Primeau and Mark Recchi and Roman Cechmanek and Hitchcock --
arms linked in a singular pursuit. So far.</TE>
<TE>   "I was excited right from the moment that I heard [Hitchcock was
hired] because I knew that he was going to bring an element that we
hadn't had here," Roenick said in a recent conference call, during
which he also denied rumors he didn't want to play for Hitchcock.
"He's a guy that's going to come in and take charge and who was going
to really instill a system we feel can bring us to a championship."</TE>
<TE>   It's the same system he used with the Stars, and he's instilling
it in the same way, but the method is getting no complaints. At the
moment.</TE>
<TE>   "Hitch just takes things to the bitter, bitter, ultimate detail of
everything," Roenick said, laughing. "He'll even tell you which way
your skates should be pointed in the neutral zone when checking
somebody."</TE>
<TE>   The Flyers are happy they are being forced to focus their efforts,
and it shows in their solid play as a unit.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to move up and down the ice as a group of five," Hitchcock
says of his system. "We're either all up or all back."</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock describes these Flyers as "a good team trying to be a
great team."</TE>
<TE>   "We're having fun and playing hard," he says. "We have a lot to
learn, but we're willing to dig in."</TE>
<TE>   Hitchcock is in control now. That's how the players want it. When
they change their minds, when they point that first finger, his
hourglass is empty. It's inevitable. Hitchcock must make the most of
his time while the sand still is falling.</TE>

<HD>Penalties Are Not Referees' Fault</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Oates</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The point that NFL games have been efficiently officiated again this
fall is compelling. And I'd say that on the whole it's true.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, it is obvious that too many penalties have been
called this season. Waves of falling flags mar the product.</LD>
<LD>   The officials, however, aren't primarily at fault. There are three
other causes, and they can't all be fixed:</LD>
<TE>   * Football is difficult to play well without making mistakes. Put
yourself in a player's shoes and focus on a complex assignment,
considering that in the next 15 seconds, while you're busy on the
assignment, a highly paid adversary will be there to knock youinto
the third row of the bleachers.</TE>
<TE>   * Many coaches don't do as much as they could to field properly
disciplined athletes who might be expected, at the very least, to
restrain themselves from jumping offside.</TE>
<TE>   * The NFL's 32 teams are so evenly matched these days that many a
player, seeking an edge with inappropriate moves, takes chances he
might not be guilty of in less competitive times. The simplest
example is the blocker who, in a struggle with a pass rusher, might,
in violation of the rules, hold him away from his quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Refs Usually Right</TE>
<TE>   The fiction that pro games are sometimes poorly officiated is
still out there.</TE>
<TE>   The loudest complaints come from those who have a strong partisan
interests in the result. They're rooting for one team or the other.
Or they bet one side or the other.</TE>
<TE>   What happens, typically, is that after a series of flying flags, a
flag is thrown against them on what seems a close call.</TE>
<TE>   After the screams, though, most complaints, on examination, prove
faulty or flimsy.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most controversial penalties is for pass interference.</TE>
<TE>   In many pro games, the usual complaint has been that the defensive
error, "didn't look that bad." But as every coach and official knows,
there needn't be much contact to ruin a closely timed pass play.</TE>
<TE>   Completions are hard enough to get when the coverage is proper.
When it's the slightest bit off, a completion is often out of the
question</TE>
<TE>   What's right or good about that?</TE>
<TE>   NFL Works at It</TE>
<TE>   One of the three hardest jobs in competitive sports, I'd say, is
officiating NFL games.</TE>
<TE>   The two that seem the most difficult are playing quarterback
effectively on an NFL field and hitting a pitched ball.</TE>
<TE>   Yet NFL officials maintain a high standard of excellence. And
lately, game officials have had more influence at New York
headquarters than formerly. Or as NFL Executive Vice President Joe
Browne said the other day, "There has been more buy-in from the refs
this year."</TE>
<TE>   The league office staff that on Mondays reviews the tapes of
Sunday's games, putting every play under a microscope, has been
joined by "two or three of Sunday's refs" each week, Browne said. The
referees help grade the officials, contributing live advice to the
taped action.</TE>
<TE>   They're Too Good</TE>
<TE>   Some things can't be changed. Football is complicated and it's
impossible to play the game error-free. And those who make mistakes
on a football field usually are subject to instant penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The symptoms -- fluttering flags -- have appeared all over the
league this season along with increasing parity in nearly every
division.</TE>
<TE>   The exact problem, if it is a problem, is that there are too many
good players on too many good teams.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide parity means that to compete on every snap, talented
professionals must perform at the extreme limits of their talent. And
as psychologist Bruce Ogilvie said, "You tend to make more errors
when the threat is overwhelming and you're fully extended over a
period of time."</TE>
<TE>   They're All Good</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the league is crowded with 5-5 teams, along with some .600
and .400 teams -- suggesting to some fans that all pro clubs are
mediocre. But how can you prove mediocrity by the standings?</TE>
<TE>   If the 32 teams all finished 8-8 in the standings, it could mean
they were the 32 greatest teams of all time. Absolutely the best.</TE>
<TE>   Or the worst.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, it's a meaningless stat.</TE>
<TE>   Of one thing, you can be sure: There are more great offensive
players than ever out there this season -- from Michael Vick, Terrell
Owens and Brett Favre to Priest Holmes, Donovan McNabb, LaDainian
Tomlinson, Marvin Harrison, Eric Moulds, Corey Dillon, Emmitt Smith,
Rich Gannon, Jerry Rice, rookie Jeremy Shockey, Peyton Manning, Deuce
McAllister, Tom Brady, Jeff Garcia, Drew Bledsoe, Ricky Williams,
Marshall Faulk and countless others</TE>
<TE>   When offensive talent as obviously superior as that gets stopped
often in a season of parity, it must mean that the defensive talent
is also well qualified.</TE>
<TE>   What we're seeing, therefore, are good offensive teams matched
against good defensive teams.</TE>
<TE>   Play-Calling Hurts</TE>
<TE>   The problem on some clubs with obvious talent is mediocre
play-calling.</TE>
<TE>   According to wire-service reports, some of New Orleans' most
prominent players agreed after a defeat last week that two things
were the difference in a 24-17 game:</TE>
<TE>   Falcon quarterback Vick beat their defense, they say, and the
plays called by their own coaches beat their offense.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he had been held back by the conservative calls that came
in from the bench, quarterback Aaron Brooks said, "Honestly, yes. We
have some explosive offensive players" who weren't allowed to
explode.</TE>
<TE>   Against a secondary manned by only three pass defenders, Brooks
was asked to throw only 31 times, including the swarm of passes he
delivered in the fourth quarter when the Saints, playing catch-up,
scored on two of his throws to make the final score seem more
respectably close than the game was.</TE>

<HD>Hey, Trojan Fans, He's Ready for Your Apology</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'd imagine Trojan fans have something they'd like to say to me today
now that Carson Palmer's Heisman arm rules L.A., and USC has slipped
past UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   Believe me, I know when it's time to give someone his due, stop
the bashing and, if necessary, offer an apology.</LD>
<LD>   I've been around long enough, though, to know Trojan fans will
never say they're sorry or cease the bashing.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE IS no question Trojan fans owe me an apology today.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when they were just abusing then-coach Paul Hackett, I
chose to remain positive, writing nothing but nice things about
Palmer in this very newspaper -- going back three miserable seasons
to Aug. 16, 2000, and scribbling: "I'm just going to proceed as if
Carson Palmer is my son, hoping he warms to the idea by the time he
leaves USC and signs his mega-million-dollar contract to play in the
NFL."</TE>
<TE>   It's generally accepted, of course, that I am smarter than most
Trojan fans -- just read their e-mail -- but I don't make a point of
lording it over the dummies or even mentioning it. This is just what
I do, spotting football talent long before those not so well versed
in the finer details of the game, you know, like most Trojan fans.</TE>
<TE>   So while I was embracing Palmer three years ago as one of my very
own kids, most fair-weather folks who dress in cardinal and gold and
stay home unless USC is playing Notre Dame or UCLA were getting upset
with him because he was throwing the ball to the other team with
regularity.</TE>
<TE>   Some Trojan yahoos were even wondering out loud at times why Matt
Leinart and Matt Cassel weren't being given some snaps.</TE>
<TE>   Before this season began, I sat with the great coach, Pete
Carroll, at Pac-10 media day, and he made the point of saying he
didn't want Carson, my son, feeling as if he had to carry the
Trojans, with the implication he didn't have the game to pull that
off.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're a balanced, good team," Carroll said at the time,
"Carson will be just fine."</TE>
<TE>   Now, of course, he's trying to sell Carson to the Heisman voters,
as not only the best player on the Trojan roster, but in the whole
country.</TE>
<TE>   "He's playing as the best player in the country would play,"
Carroll said. "He should win the Heisman if we finish out next week
the way we should."</TE>
<TE>   Well, I've come close to saying that for three years, and if USC
had initiated a Heisman campaign when the season began, most of the
Heisman voters might have voted in his favor because most of the
Heisman voters never really get to see most of the guys they're
voting for on a regular basis, which means they probably would have
missed the losses to Kansas State and Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   If you recall correctly, I avoided drawing national attention to
the fact Carson, my son, lost both of the games in which the Trojans
had him throw the ball the most this season. Imagine how it might
have looked if I had added up the totals and made a note of the fact
that his arm came up short at the time they needed it the most,
completing 18 of 46 passes against Kansas State and 32 of 50 against
Washington State while taking a sack and failing to find the end zone
in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   I had the kid pegged to be selected as the No. 1 player in the NFL
draft, and that was before I realized it was going to take him five
years to get out of school and mature into the young man who threw
four touchdown passes against the Bruins. I'm betting if there's a
way he can come back next year, he'll throw five or six touchdown
passes against the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I FOUND myself talking about the Heisman race on ESPN's "Around
the Horn" last week, and will probably do so again this week, and
while I'd pick the running back from Miami, the quarterback from
Miami or the running back from Penn State before my own son, everyone
in my family knows what a big teaser I can be.</TE>
<TE>   I do not sense the same level of understanding from Trojan fans,
however; but then the good news is that no one watches the TV show,
which really leaves it in the hands of my own son, who will be
appearing in East Coast prime time next Saturday against Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   And if UCLA Coach Bob Toledo is right for the first time this
year: "I'm sure [USC] will beat Notre Dame," then the kid should be
the one taking the Heisman bow.</TE>
<TE>   And like any father, I'll probably be moved to tears.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE CITY of Pasadena distributed a two-page press release claiming
that after more than 650,000 uses in the men's public restrooms, new
urinals saved more than one million gallons of water. And you thought
Toledo had a tough job; how would you like to be the guy counting the
uses in the men's restrooms?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ROSE Bowl handicap parking lot was the first filled, and while
it didn't appear everyone was handicapped, former Bruin players had
to park somewhere.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As predicted here earlier, now USC has to cheer for UCLA to beat
Washington State in order to go to the Rose Bowl or beyond. They
might want to lend the Bruins Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from S. Williamson:</TE>
<TE>   "You should see the smile on my face watching the Trojans crush
the Bruins, and that's because I went to USC, where we don't have a
coach wildly swinging a towel over his head trying to motivate the
fans or wake up the team; don't have alumni cheerleader yelling at
inappropriate times; and don't have our own sportswriter spewing
jealous comments."</TE>
<TE>   Who knew it was so easy to put a smile on the face of a Trojan
fan?</TE>

<HD>Cougar Apple Turns Mushy</HD>
<DH>With a chance to clinch at least Rose Bowl, Washington
State loses in third overtime, 29-26, to Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PULLMAN, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Now we know what it takes to cause the unthinkable, to make USC fans
root for UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   It takes a bizarre game hundreds of miles to the north. It takes
three overtimes and an officiating crew that huddles at midfield to
suddenly, unexpectedly, end the whole mess.</LD>
<LD>   It takes third-ranked Washington State losing to Washington,
29-26, on a controversial and utterly inexplicable Saturday night in
the frosty Palouse in eastern Washington.</LD>
<TE>   With the Apple Cup loss, Washington State fumbled away a chance to
clinch the Pacific 10 championship and now must defeat UCLA on Dec.
7. If the Bruins win, the Trojans go to the Rose Bowl instead.</TE>
<TE>   "People knew how important this game was," Washington State
offensive lineman Calvin Armstrong said. "I think a lot of us were
nervous."</TE>
<TE>   As their fans rained soda bottles onto the field in protest, the
Cougars limped away with more than wounded pride. Quarterback Jason
Gesser, knocked out of the game by an awkward sack in the fourth
quarter, was taken to the hospital for X-rays of an injury that
turned out to be a high ankle sprain.</TE>
<TE>   He will be on crutches for an undetermined period of time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping it's not going to be serious," Washington State Coach
Mike Price said. "We will see."</TE>
<TE>   The normally cheerful Price looked like a man who had caught
glimpse of a ghost. When asked about the oddness of this game, he
began with the end.</TE>
<TE>   His team was trailing by three points in the third overtime when
his backup quarterback, Matt Kegel, attempted a short throw toward
the sideline. Washington defensive lineman Kai Ellis tipped the pass
to himself but had it knocked out of his hands before he could
complete the interception.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Ellis fell on the loose ball, an official was signaling
incomplete pass. Washington State players clapped and headed back to
the huddle, thinking they had lived to play another down.</TE>
<TE>   Not so quick.</TE>
<TE>   The officiating crew gathered to debate what had happened. Players
pressed in from all sides. The crowd of 37,600 at Martin Stadium --
having braved pregame hail and chilling winds -- grew restless.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the call: It was a "backward pass" and therefore a live
ball. Possession was granted to Washington. Game over.</TE>
<TE>   "An unforgivable mistake," Price said of the decision. "It's ugly,
as far as I'm concerned, to see it end that way."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps ugly was the only way this game could have ended after
lumbering through most of the evening in a cavalcade of errors. Each
team blew chances to make big plays. By late in the fourth quarter,
they had combined for four turnovers, two botched punts and four
missed field goals.</TE>
<TE>   Given this ineptness, Washington State held a seemingly
comfortable 20-10 lead. But the momentum swung when Gesser,
scrambling to his right, was caught from behind by a rusher.</TE>
<TE>   "He was able to get hold of my jersey and drag me back over my
ankle and it popped," the senior quarterback said. "If I could have
played, you would have seen me out there. The doctor wouldn't let me
play."</TE>
<TE>   Washington rallied. Quarterback Cody Pickett, on a roll the past
few weeks, regained his touch in time to complete a seven-yard
touchdown pass to Paul Arnold with 3:13 remaining. When Kegel threw
an interception moments later, the Huskies drove downfield and tied
the score on John Anderson's 27-yard field goal with 15 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "We shot ourselves in the foot a lot of times, but I know
Washington State will say the same thing," Washington Coach Rick
Neuheisel said. "It was just a hard-fought game."</TE>
<TE>   Once overtime began, Husky kicker Anderson overcame the jitters
that caused him to miss a string of attempts earlier. The senior was
suddenly as solid as a rock, making kicks of 34, 46 and 49 yards to
give his team a 29-26 lead and set up the improbable last play.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him early in the game, 'You're going to have your chance
and you've got to come back,' " Neuheisel said. "God bless him he
did."</TE>
<TE>   That quickly, Washington State (9-2, 6-1) saw the end of any hope
for sneaking into the bowl championship series title game against
Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Washington (7-5, 4-4) clinched a bowl bid and extended
its winning streak in this state rivalry to five consecutive seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a crazy game," Pickett said. "The craziest I've ever
played in."</TE>
<TE>   Just crazy enough to make USC root for UCLA.</TE>

<HD>Oklahoma Wrecks Texas Tech</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oklahoma left no doubt about which team is the best in the Big 12
South.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth-ranked Sooners controlled the ball with Quentin Griffin
and harassed Kliff Kingsbury with its defense from start to finish in
Saturday night's 60-15 victory over 24th-ranked Texas Tech at Norman,
Okla.</LD>
<LD>   Griffin ran for 207 yards and three touchdowns -- his seventh
consecutive 100-yard game and third 200-yard game of the season -- as
Oklahoma (10-1, 6-1 in conference) won the South Division title.</LD>
<TE>   Kingsbury came in averaging 371 yards passing, but he completed
only 15 of 35 passes for a season-low 187 yards -- 67 of those on a
fourth-quarter touchdown pass. Oklahoma's defense forced two
safeties, sacked Kingsbury six times and intercepted two of his
passes.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's talked for three weeks about how they've scored 50, 60
points, and we hold them to one touchdown, really a meaningless one
at the end of the game," Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops said. "Just
another spectacular performance by the defense."</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners finish the regular season next Saturday against
Oklahoma State, then play 16th-ranked Colorado for the conference
title Dec. 7. Oklahoma beat Colorado, 27-11, on Nov. 2, and the
winner of next month's game gets a berth in a bowl championship
series game.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech (8-5, 5-3) won three successive games to get in
position to play for the South title. But the Red Raiders had no
answers for Griffin, or Oklahoma's defense, in their worst loss of
the season.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the best defense I've seen in four years," Kingsbury said.
"They just beat us in all phases of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma held Texas Tech to 24 points and nearly 270 yards below
its average.</TE>
<TE>   Kingsbury's worst game this season had been a 268-yard effort in a
loss to Colorado on Oct. 26. He is 0-3 against Oklahoma since beating
them as a freshman in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Raiders had 12 yards and no first downs in the first
quarter. They crossed midfield only once in the first half and were
outgained, 263-64.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin's highlight-reel 62-yard touchdown run on the second
possession gave Oklahoma a 14-0 lead and made it clear the Red
Raiders were in for a long night.</TE>
<TE>   Kingsbury was sacked in the end zone late in the first quarter,
making it 16-0. Kejuan Jones scored on a three-yard run midway
through the second quarter, then a holding call against Texas Tech in
the end zone resulted in another safety and a 25-0 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Shelby blocked a punt on Texas Tech's first possession of
the third quarter and Will Peoples recovered it in the end zone for a
32-0 lead. Two short touchdown runs by Griffin pushed the lead to
46-0 before Vincent Meeks scored for Texas Tech on a 98-yard kickoff
return.</TE>
<TE>   "They played with great tempo early," Texas Tech Coach Mike Leach
said. "They didn't really have any secrets. We kind of started
playing on our heels and stayed on our heels."</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Kansas State 38, Missouri 0 -- Darren Sproles ran for 116
yards and a 12-yard touchdown, setting school records for yards
rushing and all-purpose yards in a season, to lead the Wildcats
(10-2, 6-2) at Columbia, Mo. It was the 10th consecutive loss in the
series for Missouri (5-7, 2-6), which did not get past midfield until
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri quarterback Brad Smith, a redshirt freshman, became the
second player in NCAA history to pass for 2,000 yards and rush for
1,000 in a season. Smith began the game needing one yard rushing to
join Clemson's Woody Dantzler, who did it last season. Smith had 30
yards rushing in 13 carries and completed seven of 24 passes for 126
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State 63, Baylor 28 -- Josh Fields threw for four
touchdowns and ran for another as Oklahoma State qualified for a bowl
game by beating Baylor at Stillwater, Okla. Tatum Bell ran for 106
yards and three touchdowns in 14 carries as the Cowboys (6-5, 4-3)
beat the Bears (3-9, 1-7) in Baylor Coach Kevin Steele's final game.</TE>
<TE>   Rashaun Woods caught seven passes for 134 yards and two
touchdowns. He set conference and school records for yards receiving
in a season and a school mark for catches in a season.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut 37, Iowa State 20 -- Dan Orlovsky threw three
touchdown passes, freshman Terry Caulley rushed for 191 yards and
Maurice Lloyd had two interceptions at Ames, Iowa, as Connecticut
earned its biggest victory in Division I-A. Connecticut (6-6) scored
27 consecutive points after trailing, 20-10, to stun a team that had
been ranked ninth nationally in mid-October.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State (7-6) lost five of its last six after a 6-1 start.
Quarterback Seneca Wallace completed 19 of 44 passes for 216 yards
with four interceptions.</TE>

individual honor, but he and the rest of the Spartans got a good look
at why Johnson merits consideration.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson completed his sensational late-season surge by becoming
the ninth player in NCAA Division I-A history to rush for at least
2,000 yards Saturday when he racked up 279 and four touchdowns in the
first half of No. 15 Penn State's 61-7 victory Saturday at State
College, Pa.</LD>
<TE>   "He's got my vote for the Heisman," Rogers said. "I saw firsthand
what he could do."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson scored on runs of 11, 78, 11 and 38 yards, and his last
run gave the Nittany Lions a 48-0 lead with 2:38 left in the first
half. Penn State, 9-3 overall and 5-3 in the conference, got the ball
back with a minute left, and Johnson ran onto the field with the rest
of the offense before he was called back.</TE>
<TE>   Mercifully for the Spartans, Johnson's day -- and his remarkable
regular season -- was over.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a great season and a great run. This is the ultimate way to
cap off this season," said Johnson, a senior who started the season
with only 866 career rushing yards. "I didn't think I could be a
1,000-yard back. This was a long season, and I got frustrated at
times, but I really kept pushing and kept through all the hard
times."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson finished with 2,015 yards, becoming the first Penn State
player to top the mark. He also set an NCAA record by averaging 8.02
yards per carry, eclipsing the mark of 7.8 set by Nebraska's Mike
Rozier in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   "If you'd have said to me he's going to have 2,000 yards in one
year, I'd have said, 'Aw, come on,' " Penn State Coach Joe Paterno
said. "He finally got that feel for things, and he's spectacular.
He's like a man playing against boys out there."</TE>
<TE>   Michigan State (4-8, 2-6) gave up its most points since a 63-0
loss to Michigan in 1922.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin 49, Minnesota 31 -- Anthony Davis rushed for a
career-high 301 yards and five touchdowns in 45 carries as the
Badgers (7-6, 2-6) won back Paul Bunyan's Axe with a victory over the
Gophers (7-5, 3-5) at Madison, Wis. Davis' five touchdowns tied the
school record set by Billy Marek against Minnesota in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   The Badgers not only got the trophy that goes to the winner of the
longest-running rivalry in major college football, they became
bowl-eligible for the first time since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Purdue 34, Indiana 10 -- Brandon Jones rushed for 131 yards and
two touchdowns as the Boilermakers (6-6, 4-4) became bowl-eligible
for a sixth straight season and regained the Old Oaken Bucket in a
victory over the Hoosiers (3-9, 1-7) at West Lafayette, Ind.
Quarterback Kyle Orton came off the bench to complete 22 of 28 passes
for 173 yards in leading Purdue on five scoring drives.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois 31, Northwestern 24 -- Jon Beutjer threw three touchdown
passes and ran for another to lead the Fighting Illini (5-7, 4-4) to
a victory over the Wildcats (3-9, 1-7) at Evanston, Ill. Antoineo
Harris rushed for 178 yards and broke Illinois' single-season rushing
record, surpassing the 1,281 yards set by Illini career rushing
leader Robert Holcombe.</TE>

<LD>Center Adam Oates, out since Oct. 24 because of a broken left hand,
could be back in the Mighty Duck lineup this week. He will be
examined by a hand specialist Monday and may resume more active
practice Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Best-case scenario has him in the lineup Wednesday, when the Ducks
play Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   "We're trying for that," Coach Mike Babcock said. "We're pushing
for sure."</LD>
<TE>   A more realistic plan, provided the examination goes well, would
have him returning against the Kings on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Oates worked out with the team last week but has yet to push
himself. He has missed 14 games.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good, but I'm going to have a little conference with the
doctor to see when I can go for real," Oates said. "I'm still not
shooting with my backhand. I'm waiting for permission."</TE>
<TE>   Oates has pain in the hand, but that alone won't keep him out of
the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "There is some pain there, but if he has to play with pain, he
will," Babcock said. "He needs to know the hand healed enough that he
will not reinjure it."</TE>
<TE>   Oates has three assists in seven games this season. He was signed
over the summer to help improve the offense and seemed to be
adjusting to his new surroundings when he was injured against
Vancouver. He underwent surgery two days later to have two screws
inserted in the hand to help the healing process.</TE>
<TE>   Oates returned to the Ducks on Monday, but said he hasn't been
able to go full out in practice.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't done faceoffs and anything like that," Oates said. "I
need to know that I can take the abuse. That if I fall on the hand I
won't reinjure it."</TE>

<HD>Diaz Hopes Win Leads to Title Shot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirteen months ago, lightweight Julio Diaz saw a multimillion-dollar
deal with HBO and a looming championship fight slip through his
fingers with a controversial split decision defeat to Angel Manfredy.</LD>
<LD>   Six months later, Diaz's stock dipped further with a shocking
first-round knockout loss to unheralded Juan Valenzuela.</LD>
<LD>   But after dropping Felix St. Kitts three times in the fourth round
Saturday night and getting a spectacular technical knockout win in
front of 3,083 at Arrowhead Pond, Diaz is again talking title shots.</LD>
<TE>   "The title's always on my mind," said Diaz, a native of Coachella
who improved to 26-2 with 19 knockouts after the fight was stopped
with 12 seconds remaining in the round. "If we're talking about it,
then it's getting close. I don't want any more tuneups, though.
You're risking too much."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz, 22, hopes to meet the winner of the 135-pound championship
rematch on Dec. 7 between Floyd Mayweather and Jose Luis Castillo.</TE>
<TE>   St. Kitts (12-3-2) took the fight on three days' notice after
Diaz's original opponent, Carlos Ramirez, broke his right ankle in
training.</TE>
<TE>   In the semi-main event, super flyweight Martin Castillo improved
to 22-1-1 with a technical knockout of Keyri Wong, a teammate on the
1996 Mexican Olympic team, when the bout was stopped prior to the
ninth round on the advice of ringside physician Mike DeLuca.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, who has 14 knockouts, is being groomed for a shot
against World Boxing Assn. 115-pound champion Alexander Munoz (23-0,
23 KOs).</TE>
<TE>   Also on the card: Oxnard super middleweight Jose Aguiniga (17-0,
11 KOs) remained unbeaten with a second-round knockout of Jose
Sarabia (15-24-2); and featherweight Isidro Granados of Bellflower
got his first career knockout and improved to 3-0 by stopping Edgar
Sabal (0-5) in 2:23 of the first round.</TE>
<TE>   -- Paul Gutierrez</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior welterweight Arturo Gatti won a unanimous decision over
Micky Ward in Atlantic City, N.J., dropping him in the third round
and dominating from then on to avenge a loss.</TE>
<TE>   Gatti (35-6) clubbed Ward with an overhand right that knocked him
to his knees and caused him to fall forward.</TE>
<TE>   Ward (38-12), who beat Gatti six months ago in a slugfest
considered by many to be one of the year's best fights, was never the
same after that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vitaly Klitschko knocked out Larry Donald in the 10th round at
Dortmund, Germany, paving the way for a World Boxing Council title
fight with Lennox Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   Klitschko, 32-1 with 31 knockouts, caught Donald with a right in
the round, sending the American to the canvas for the first time in
his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Nelson kept his WBO cruiserweight title on a split decision
after struggling through 12 rounds with Panama's Guillermo Jones in
Derby, England.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson appeared to be outboxed by an opponent who had fought for
the WBA light-middleweight title only four years ago and had risen
quickly through the weights.</TE>

<HD>KEYS TO THE GAME</HD>

<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC</LD>
<LD>   Gary Klein's keys to the game, and how the Trojans measured up:</LD>
<LD>   1. Contain Tyler Ebell. USC still has not allowed an opposing
running back to rush for more 100 yards. Ebell, who had gained more
than 100 yards in six consecutive games, finished with 56 in 12
carries against the Trojans.</LD>
<TE>   2. Establish the run. Justin Fargas rushed for 43 yards in 16
carries, but his performance over the last few games made Bruin
cornerbacks bite on play-action fakes, opening up the passing game.</TE>
<TE>   3. Avoid turnovers and penalties. The Trojans did not commit a
turnover for the second consecutive game. They were penalized six
times for 55 yards.</TE>
<TE>   4. Mistake-free kicking game. Ryan Killeen kicked seven extra
points, including one from 35 yards, and a 27-yard field goal. Punter
Tom Malone averaged 40.7 yards on six kicks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA</TE>
<TE>   Steve Henson's keys to the game, and how the Bruins measured up:</TE>
<TE>   1. Protect freshman quarterbacks: USC registered five sacks, and a
safety blitz by DeShaun Hill caused Bruin quarterback Drew Olson to
fumble. Neither Olson nor fellow freshman Matt Moore displayed
sufficient poise.</TE>
<TE>   2. Limit the yards gained by Trojan receivers after they catch
passes. A greater problem was Trojan receivers getting behind Bruin
defenders and catching long passes. UCLA was so conscious of taking
away the short pass that Kareem Kelly and Keary Colbert were able to
get free deep.</TE>
<TE>   3. The defense and special teams must make big plays. All the big
plays went USC's way. Bruin special teams didn't help. Tab Perry
fumbled the opening kickoff and a bad punt snap later in the first
quarter resulted in a 34-yard loss.</TE>

<LD>For King assistant Mark Hardy, facing the Dallas Stars and Coach Dave
Tippett will always be a special challenge.</LD>
<LD>   The coaches worked together as assistants for the Kings the last
three seasons, with Hardy in charge of the penalty killers and
Tippett handling the power play.</LD>
<LD>   "Both of us know each other's teams very well," Hardy said before
the Kings faced the Stars on Saturday night at Staples Center. "We
can't worry about what he's going to do."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Aaron Miller has not taken many faceoffs, but he had to
step up for one in the first period Saturday against the Stars. With
the Kings short-handed, Miller was called into the circle to replace
Eric Belanger and won the faceoff.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winger Adam Deadmarsh sat out his fifth consecutive game because
of post-concussion syndrome. Deadmarsh, who was injured against
Toronto on Nov. 12, could be back in the lineup for the Kings' next

home against Florida.</TE>

<HD>Star Power Useless in L.A.</HD>
<DH>In first game at home in nearly three weeks, Kings score
twice in third period to beat NHL-leading Dallas, 2-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After spending 17 days and playing their last eight games on the
road, the Kings returned and featured the Felix and Ziggy show
Saturday night at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Felix Potvin recorded 29 saves for his second shutout of the
season and Ziggy Palffy scored twice in the Kings' 2-0 victory over
the Dallas Stars in front of a sellout crowd of 18,292.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to stay focused and the way [Dallas goaltender] Marty
Turco was playing, you knew that it was going to be a low-scoring
night," said Potvin, who has 27 shutouts in his career. "It's a lot
easier when it's a close game like this."</LD>
<TE>   Under former King assistant Dave Tippett, the Stars began
Saturday's game with the NHL's best record at 13-4-4-1 and were
coming off a 4-0 victory over the Mighty Ducks at the Arrowhead Pond
the night before.</TE>
<TE>   Turco, who recorded his third shutout of the season against the
Ducks, was sharp early against the Kings, who started strong in their
first game at Staples Center since Nov. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy drew a hooking penalty on defenseman Richard Matvichuk 29
seconds into the game. On the ensuing power play, the Kings pressured
Turco but failed to score despite taking three shots.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Stars ended up being outshot in the first period,
11-6, they also had their own share of solid scoring chances against
Potvin, who made highlight stops on shots by Manny Malhotra, Scott
Young and Mike Modano over the final half of the period.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin (8-6-3) had to be on top of his game on a Dallas power play
early in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   With the Kings' Bryan Smolinski in the penalty box for
high-sticking, the Stars missed a golden opportunity to score when
Dallas forward Brenden Morrow was unable to get to a loose rebound of
a shot by Young from the point. Potvin, who made the initial save on
Young, beat Morrow to the puck to keep the game scoreless.</TE>
<TE>   In the third period, Potvin was again put on the spot and again
was up to the challenge. With the Stars on their fourth power play,
Potvin stuffed a bang-bang scoring chance by Modano, and followed
that with successive diving saves on shots by Young.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings finally rewarded Potvin for his stellar play late in the
third period when Palffy scored the game-winning goal with 5:13 to
play.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' Erik Rasmussen, who played one of his best games of the
season, got the play started when he dug the puck out from deep in
the right corner. Rasmussen then fought off defenseman Sergei Zubov
and skated behind the Stars' net before getting the puck to Mathieu
Schneider at the left circle.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider's shot was blocked by Turco, but he left a perfect
rebound for Palffy, who scored from outside the right side of the
crease to give the Kings a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings finally put the Stars away when Palffy scored his fifth
goal this season on an empty-netter with 14.7 seconds remaining. It
was the type of effort King Coach Andy Murray has been looking for
from Palffy and one reason why he spoke to his top goal scorer
Saturday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "Ziggy and I just had a little talk before the game," Murray said.
"He knows what he has to do. It was more me asking what I could do to
help him as a coach as my laying down the hammer. He said, 'I've
gotta do some things,' and that's what I wanted to hear.... He
thought he needed to be more creative and he was."</TE>

<LD>In four years, Arturo Torres has helped lift the Loyola Marymount
men's soccer program to a new level. On Saturday, Torres sent the
Lions into unchartered territory.</LD>
<LD>   Torres scored in the 84th minute to give the Lions a 1-0 victory
over Cal State Northridge in the first round of the NCAA men's soccer
playoffs. It is their first playoff victory in just their second
postseason appearance.</LD>
<LD>   Junior Yuji Teranishi set up the winning play by drawing
Northridge goalie Joe Barton toward the left post and sent a pass
back across the goal, where Torres one-timed a header past Barton for
his eighth of the season and the 46th of his career, a school record.</LD>
<TE>   A skirmish between players and coaches on both sides broke out
moments after Northridge coaches wanted a foul called in the penalty
box near the end of regulation. Loyola assistant coach Mathes Mennell
and Northridge senior defender Brian Phillips were given red cards
for violent conduct. Mennell will have to sit out the Lions'
second-round match Wednesday against UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Northridge (14-5-2) nearly took the lead in the 67th minute when
Daniel Paladini hit the crossbar with a shot.</TE>
<TE>   "When he hit it, I thought it was going in for sure," Torres said.
"It was a wake-up call for us."</TE>
<TE>   The Lions (15-3-2) will look to avenge a 3-2 overtime loss to UCLA
in the first round last year. They have defeated the Bruins in two of
their last three meetings, including a 2-0 victory Sept. 22.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we're in Round 2," Torres said. "Hopefully we can get them
back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WOMEN</TE>
<TE>   Texas A&amp;M 0, UCLA 0 -- Aggie freshman goalkeeper Kati Jo Spisak
was the difference as she made two saves in the shootout to help
Texas A&amp;M (20-4-1) advance to the quarterfinals with a 3-1 victory on
penalty kicks at Drake Stadium. After Whitney Jones scored, Spisak
used her 6-foot-2 frame to punch away tries by Iris Mora and Allie
True. Texas A&amp;M's Amanda Burke, Heather Ragsdale and Laura Probst
beat Sarah Lombardo on their tries and the Bruins' Nandi Pryce missed
wide to clinch the upset win for the Aggies.</TE>
<TE>   Spisak made 10 saves in regulation to thwart the Bruins (18-4-0),
who had a 21-0 shot advantage but couldn't find the net.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan 2, Pepperdine 0 -- Therese Heaton and Michele Pesiri
scored goals in each half as the Wolverines ended the Waves' dream
season with a third-round victory at Ann Arbor, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Heaton scored her 10th goal in the 27th minute on a shot from 16
yards out after defender Andrea Kayal sent in a long pass. The
Wolverines (16-6-1) tallied again in the 57th minute when Perisi beat
Wave goalie Anna Picarelli.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine finished 18-2-2.</TE>

<HD>Veterans' Day</HD>
<DH>Beuerlein, 37, is one of five quarterbacks who are getting
new starts today</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All Steve Beuerlein's rowdy friends have settled down.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, lots of them are NFL assistant coaches, their playing
careers a fading memory. But Denver quarterback Beuerlein is still
plugging along, somehow zinging passes despite a reconstructed elbow
and shoulder. He will make his first start in almost two years
tonight when the Broncos play host to Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't feel like a rookie," said Beuerlein, 37, who replaces an
injured Brian Griese. "I wish I felt like a rookie again. I'm not a
thoroughbred by any stretch of the imagination, not that I ever was.
But back when I was 24, 25, I was able to rely a little bit more on
my athletic ability than I can now. Now, it's basically going to be a
knowledge of the game, an understanding of the game and how to get
the ball to the other guys and let them do the work."</LD>
<TE>   The Broncos are one of five NFL teams making a quarterback switch
today, joining Philadelphia, Washington, St. Louis and Pittsburgh.
The Steelers, Eagles and Broncos are atop their divisions, and the
Rams have rebounded from an 0-5 start by winning five consecutive
games.</TE>
<TE>   Beuerlein, who has played for six franchises in 16 seasons, made
the Pro Bowl as a Carolina Panther in 1999, when he threw for 4,436
yards and 36 touchdowns with 15 interceptions. In fact, in 1999 and
2000, he had better numbers in just about every category than Green
Bay's Brett Favre.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was going to finish my career with Carolina," said
Beuerlein, who was released by then-coach George Seifert after the
2000 season as part of a youth movement yet still lives in Charlotte
during the off-season. "That move surprised everyone -- the players,
the coaches. No one had a clue but Seifert."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Beuerlein is on his ninth head coach -- he played for Mike
Shanahan before, with the Los Angeles Raiders -- and his final NFL
city.</TE>
<TE>   "Denver is my last stop," he said. "I've told my wife I'm not
going to play anywhere else. I'm beyond the point in my career where
I can keep moving around. I've got too much pride for that. If I'm
going to play, I'm going to finish my career with Mike in Denver."</TE>
<TE>   At every turn, there are reminders of the generation gap between
Beuerlein and some of his teammates. He's a guy who wears jeans and a
golf shirt, for instance, and last week saw rookie Clinton Portis
boarding the plane wearing a silk outfit with matching silver shirt
and pants.</TE>
<TE>   "They were pajamas," the quarterback said. "They were my
definition of pajamas. They were pretty sharp threads. [But] I'm more
conservative by nature and by age."</TE>
<TE>   Portis wasn't going to take that pajamas crack lying down.</TE>
<TE>   "The stuff I wear now, Steve wore when he first came into the
league," he said. "Like in 1973."</TE>
<TE>   A look at today's other quarterback changes:</TE>
<TE>   * Pittsburgh: Kordell Stewart is back to face Cincinnati after
Tommy Maddox was knocked out of last Sunday's game with a spinal
contusion. Stewart, who made the Pro Bowl last season and finished
third in league MVP voting, was benched late in the third game this
season and replaced by Maddox.</TE>
<TE>   "If Tommy's not ready to come back, I have to go in there and
play," said Stewart, who quietly fumed over the benching but was
always supportive of Maddox. "What happens after that is out of my
control; but when the opportunity comes for me to step on that
football field and play, I have to play. As far as trying to be the
guy back on the mountain ... it ain't about that stuff. It's about
being ready when the opportunity comes and presents itself and do
what we're paid to do -- win games."</TE>
<TE>   This could be Stewart's last hurrah with the Steelers, considering
he has one year left on his contract and is due to make $6.3 million
in 2003. He wants out of Pittsburgh, where fans are quick to boo him
and he feels unappreciated. There's a chance he could wind up in
Dallas next season.</TE>
<TE>   * St. Louis: After bursting onto the scene and essentially saving
the Rams' season, Marc Bulger will return to his role as Kurt
Warner's understudy. Warner, recovered from a broken pinkie on his
throwing hand, will step back into the starting lineup at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   A two-time league MVP, Warner got off to a painfully slow start
this season, throwing one touchdown pass with eight interceptions in
three-plus games. Coach Mike Martz has made it clear there's no
quarterback controversy -- the job belongs to Warner -- but watch for
Martz to reverse his field if things don't go well against the
Redskins.</TE>
<TE>   Because of their 0-5 start, the Rams have left themselves with
precious little wiggle room. If they lose more than one more game,
their playoff hopes likely will flutter away.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to go and give it everything I've got," Warner said. "I
still know what I can do on the football field. I'm focused on
playing well. I played well for a long time. I don't look at the
situation like all of a sudden I'm going to fail, or I'm not going to
be able to play football again. I'm just going to do what I do and
let the chips fall. I'm not going to play not to fail."</TE>
<TE>   * Philadelphia: Koy Detmer steps in Monday night at San Francisco
for Donovan McNabb, who suffered a fracture near his right ankle on
the third play last Sunday yet somehow found a way to play the rest
of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Detmer has not started a game in three seasons and has six starts
in his six-year career, five of those coming in 1998. Even though
Detmer has thrown only 17 passes since 1999, the Eagles seem to have
confidence in him. The stakes are high -- at 7-3, they have a
one-game lead over the Giants in the NFC East, and Philadelphia is a
game behind Green Bay and Tampa Bay in the quest for home-field
advantage in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Detmer's first start might be his most memorable, even though it
was a 24-16 loss to Green Bay. He threw two touchdown passes and,
after one of them, celebrated by pointing at Favre on the sideline,
thrusting his hips forward and making a vaguely obscene gesture
borrowed from Beavis and Butt-head.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hilarious," said Eagle running back Dorsey Levens, who
played for the Packers at the time. "I was dying on the sideline. But
some people took offense to it. Brett was [angry]."</TE>
<TE>   * Washington: The Redskin quarterback carousel continues to spin.
Shane Matthews is headed back to the bench, and Danny Wuerffel moves
into the No. 1 spot to face the Rams. In order, the 4-6 Redskins have
started Matthews, Wuerffel, Patrick Ramsey, Matthews and now
Wuerffel.</TE>
<TE>   "When you've got a group of quarterbacks who, maybe there's not a
lot of difference in how they play, to me you have to give them all a
chance," Coach Steve Spurrier said. "Danny really has not had a
chance this year."</TE>

<LD>**** Makings of a classic</LD>
<LD>   *** Smash-mouth football</LD>
<LD>   ** Good for an end around</LD>
<TE>   * Strictly fantasy fodder</TE>
<TE>   ** Buffalo (5-5) at New York Jets (5-5), 10 a.m.: Jet receiver
Lavernaues Coles says of him and Chad Pennington, "One of the high
goals was to try to be a Jerry Rice and Steve Young combination."
Keep climbing, Lavernaues. LINE: New York by 3.</TE>
<TE>   * Detroit (3-7) at Chicago (2-8), 10 a.m.: The bad news: In more
than 80 years, the Bears have never lost nine straight games, but
face that prospect this week. The worse news: One of the Lions' three
wins was against the Bears. LINE: Chicago by 5 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** St. Louis (5-5) at Washington (4-6), 10 a.m., Channel 11:
Patrick Ramsey calls Ram quarterback circumstance a "win-win
situation." Then again, anything compared to the Redskins would seem
to fit that description. LINE: St. Louis by 4.</TE>
<TE>   *** San Diego (7-3) at Miami (6-4), 10 a.m., Channel 2, KNX
(1070): Suffering from an extreme case of East Coast bias, the
Chargers have won only once in that time zone in the last seven
years. And even that victory hardly counts since it was against the
Cincinnati Bengals in the opener this season. LINE: Miami by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Atlanta (6-3-1) at Carolina (3-7), 10 a.m.: Rodney Peete and
the Panthers humiliated Falcons, 30-0, earlier this season. Peete
brings with him a history of convincing performances around
Thanksgiving. Ask Troy Aikman and UCLA. LINE: Atlanta by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Jacksonville (5-5) at Dallas (3-7), 10 a.m.: Since taking over
at quarterback for the Cowboys three games ago, Chad Hutchinson
hasn't thrown an interception in 86 attempts. He also hasn't won a
game and Dallas has scored only 24 points. LINE: Jacksonville by 2
1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Cincinnati (1-9) at Pittsburgh (5-4-1), 10 a.m.: Kordell
Stewart earned teammates' respect by not speaking up when he was
benched for Tommy Maddox. Now, with the Steelers in crisis mode,
Stewart's performance could speak volumes. LINE: Pittsburgh by 11.</TE>
<TE>   ** Minnesota (3-7) at New England (5-5), 10 a.m.: Former Raider
linebacker Greg Biekert, now a Viking, has had this game circled on
his calendar "for personal reasons." He was the one who recovered Tom
Brady's fumble that was later overturned in last season's playoffs.
LINE: New England by 7 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   *** Cleveland (5-5) at New Orleans (7-3), 10 a.m.: In 1999, the
resurrected Browns got their first victory against the Saints on a
Hail Mary pass. A mere three years later, only five players from that
Cleveland team remain and only three Saints are left. Love that
salary cap. LINE: New Orleans by 5 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   *** Tennessee (6-4) at Baltimore (4-6), 10 a.m.: Titan tackle
Henry Ford knows how much Ray Lewis means to the Ravens: "It's
similar to the Jackson Five without Michael." So if Lewis plays,
don't expect the Titans to moonwalk their way through this one. LINE:
Tennessee by 2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Oakland (6-4) at Arizona (4-6), 1 p.m., KMPC (1540): About
25,000 members of Raider Nation are expected to make the trek to
Tempe, Ariz. Didn't realize that Friends Fly Free promotion was still
going strong. LINE: Oakland by 8.</TE>
<TE>   ** Kansas City (5-5) at Seattle (3-7), 1 p.m.: Seahawk quarterback
Matt Hasselbeck with the delusional quote of the week: "We're not
that far from being good." LINE: Kansas City by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** New York Giants (6-4) at Houston (2-8), 1:15 p.m., KNX (1070):
Michael Strahan throws Texan quarterback David Carr a backhanded
compliment: "I take my hat off to that," he says of Carr's 53 sacks,
"because that's tough." LINE: New York by 5 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   **** Green Bay (8-2) at Tampa Bay (8-2), 1:15 p.m., Channel 11,
KLSX-FM (97.1): The winner of this game could determine whether the
NFC title game is played in sunny central Florida or the unbearable
winter of Wisconsin. LINE: Tampa Bay by 3.</TE>
<TE>   *** Indianapolis (6-4) at Denver (7-3), 5:30 p.m., ESPN, KLSX-FM
(97.1): Broncos are dominant during the day (7-0), but nightmarish at
night (0-3). Linebacker Ian Gold might have a solution: "Maybe we
need to have a powwow over a bonfire." LINE: Denver by 6 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   *** Philadelphia (7-3) at San Francisco (7-3), Monday, 6 p.m.,
Channel 7, KNX (1070): Now it all makes sense. Koy Detmer, Donovan
McNabb's replacement at quarterback for the Eagles, has thrown only
17 passes in the past three years. That explains where he found all
the time to grow that hideous beard. LINE: San Francisco by 7.</TE>

<HD>A Good Backup Is a Must-Have</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>How do you separate the Super Bowl contenders from the pretenders in
the NFL, now that traditional means such as win-loss records and
winning streaks and form charts have been rendered useless?</LD>
<LD>   Put away the darts and the coins, the rocks, paper and scissors,
and take a look at the backup quarterbacks.</LD>
<LD>   You can't win a Super Bowl without a good one anymore. Since John
Elway retired, the only quarterbacks who've won the Super Bowl --
Kurt Warner, Trent Dilfer and Tom Brady -- were backups during the
exhibition season of their team's championship runs.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, backup quarterbacks can keep you out of a Super
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Shaun King was Dilfer's backup for Tampa Bay in 1999. (This was
before the coaching cognoscenti arrived at its landmark ruling that
Dilfer was indeed an adequate backup trapped inside the body of a
floundering first-stringer.) Pressed into the lineup after Dilfer was
hurt in Week 12, King rode the Buccaneers' defense as far as the NFC
final against St. Louis. There, King completed only 13 of 29 passes,
threw two interceptions and Tampa Bay lost, 11-6.</TE>
<TE>   The next season, Oakland hosted the AFC final, armed with a Pro
Bowl quarterback in Rich Gannon but not much behind him. Unprepared
for Baltimore's unorthodox defensive strategy -- Goose! You go sit on
Gannon! -- the Raiders suddenly found themselves relying on Bobby
Hoying to rally them from a 10-point halftime deficit. Which meant
the Raiders went on to lose, 16-3.</TE>
<TE>   Already this season, 16 teams have gone to their backups to bail
out injured or ineffective starters -- unless you include the
Washington Redskins, who have gotten carried away with the concept.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Steve Spurrier fashions himself as a connoisseur of backup
NFL quarterbacks; he once was a very ordinary one himself. Preparing
for his first season with the Redskins, Spurrier was so intent on
stockpiling backup quarterbacks -- can't win a thing without one,
he'd heard -- that he forgot to find a starter and now rotates three
backups in and out of the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   A closer look at how the 16 backups have fared in their relief
stints this season -- subtitled, "The Packers Better Keep a Close Eye
on Brett Favre's Left Knee:"</TE>
<TE>   Saved the Season</TE>
<TE>   Chad Pennington, Jets: The Jets were 1-3 when they finally gave up
on beating an old warhorse and replaced Vinny Testaverde with
Pennington. In six starts, Pennington is 4-2, the Jets are one game
out of first place in the AFC East and Pennington's completion mark
of 75.3% is better than Kenny Anderson's single-season NFL record of
70.5%</TE>
<TE>   Marc Bulger, Rams: Inherited an 0-5 underachieving Super Bowl
favorite, handed them back 5-5. Can't do any better than that. Which
is why St. Louis is so worried as Warner flexes his little finger
again today against Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Maddox, Steelers: Came off the bench to lead the Steelers to
their belated first victory in Week 3, then stayed in the lineup,
going 4-1-1 in his next six starts, setting the club single-game
passing record in the process. The head and spinal cord injuries that
knocked Maddox out of last week's loss to Tennessee could cause pain
in Pittsburgh for weeks to come.</TE>
<TE>   Improved the Situation</TE>
<TE>   Joey Harrington, Lions: Wasn't ready for the Sports Illustrated
cover, but that's not his fault. Has led the Lions to three victories
this season, which is one more than anyone did in 16 games last
season.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Blake, Ravens: Who is Travis Taylor? No one knew, not even
his teammates, while no-risk Chris Redman was directing the Baltimore
offense. Taylor is a speedy wide receiver with big-play potential, as
the rest of the league discovered once Redman got hurt and Blake came
in to restore the long-forgotten vertical pass to the Raven playbook.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Kitna, Bengals: Hard to believe, but Kitna has a quarterback
rating of 108.4 in his last three starts. In Cincinnati, that and
four quarters will get you a 27-20 defeat on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Held the Fort</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Holcomb, Browns: With Tim Couch hurt, he passed for three
touchdowns in the opener, which should have been enough for victory.
And then Dwayne Rudd spiked his helmet. Passed for two more
touchdowns the next week in a 20-7 win over Cincinnati, stirring a
who-should-start debate in Cleveland that Couch has barely been able
to quell since his return.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Johnson, Falcons: Won the only start he had to make -- and it
wasn't an easy one, against the Giants in New Jersey. Highly
encouraging news for the Falcons. Given Michael Vick's
roller-coaster-without-a-seat-belt approach to the quarterback
position, there will be more starts for Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Johnson, Buccaneers: He's no long-term starter, as the Buffalo
Bills painfully discovered. But coming off the bench after Brad
Johnson cracked some ribs, he proved that in Tampa Bay, two Johnsons
are better than one.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Hasselbeck, Seahawks: Torched the fort last season, which is
why he began this one backing up Dilfer. Dilfer's torn Achilles'
tendon gave Hasselbeck a second chance -- and the signing of Jeff
George gave him incentive not to fumble it. Somewhat surprisingly, so
far, so good.</TE>
<TE>   On Second Thought</TE>
<TE>   Chad Hutchinson, Cowboys: He's 0-3 since replacing Quincy Carter.
Adept at handing the ball to Emmitt Smith and not much else.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Lucas, Dolphins: Needed four starts and a home game against
the Ravens to finally record a victory in relief of Jay Fiedler. That
broken thumb might have stung at the time, but it was the best thing
that could have happened to Fiedler's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Weinke, Panthers: Lost the job to 36-year-old journeyman
Rodney Peete during the exhibition season, then reminded everyone why
when called upon to replace the injured Peete in Week 7.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Chandler, Bears: Needing to add a veteran quarterback during
the off-season, the Bears went cheap, signing Chandler rather than
trading for Drew Bledsoe. Jim Miller and Chandler are a combined 2-8.</TE>
<TE>   Too Soon to Tell</TE>
<TE>   Steve Beuerlein, Broncos, and Koy Detmer, Eagles: Both mopped up
one-sided victories last Sunday after the starters had hobbled off
hurt. Beuerlein has the best credentials of any backup on the board;
Detmer hasn't started a game since 1999. Two Super Bowl campaigns
rest tenuously on how well these long-relief assignments go.</TE>

<HD>Andreychuk Reaches 600-Goal Milestone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Andreychuk became the 14th member of the NHL's 600-goal club by
scoring two third-period goals to lead the Tampa Bay Lightning over
the New Jersey Devils, 3-1, Saturday night at East Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   "It kind of blows me away, some of the names that are there,"
Andreychuk said. "Someday I'll be sitting on a boat somewhere and
I'll think about it. Right now, it's hard to fathom."</LD>
<LD>   Andreychuk got the 600th goal of his career and ended a 1-1 tie on
a power play at 33 seconds of the final period. Like many of his
goals, it wasn't pretty. It was a bad-angle shot that beat Corey
Schwab.</LD>
<TE>   "I kind of ran out of options, Scotty [Stevens] made a good play,"
said Andreychuk, who also scored his 500th goal at East Rutherford
against Washington on March 15, 1997, playing for the Devils. "He
didn't come to me. I'm looking to pass it to the middle. I just had
to throw it on goal as a last resort."</TE>
<TE>   Andreychuk tied Jari Kurri for 13th place among career goal
scorers when he got No. 601 on a deflection at 2:53.</TE>
<TE>   New York Islanders 3, New York Rangers 1 -- Brad Isbister scored
twice and rookie Mattias Weinhandl had three assists in the third
period to rally the Islanders at Madison Square Garden.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Nashville 2 -- Marian Gaborik scored three goals at
St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   Gaborik's second hat trick this season and fourth of his career
moved him into the league lead with 15 goals.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 5, Columbus 2 -- Marian Hossa scored three goals, including
the game-winner, at Ottawa and the Senators extended their unbeaten
streak to six games.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 6, Atlanta 3 -- The Capitals scored three goals in an
88-second span of the second period at Washington and ended a
five-game winless streak.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Buffalo 1 -- Steve Shields made 22 saves and the Bruins
scored three power-play goals to win their sixth consecutive home
game.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina 7, Montreal 3 -- Erik Cole had the second hat trick of
his career and Carolina tied a franchise road record by scoring five
times in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, Philadelphia 0 -- Ed Belfour made 25 saves at Toronto
for his second consecutive shutout and the 61st of his career, tying
him with Colorado's Patrick Roy for the most among active
goaltenders.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 4, San Jose 1 -- Martin Straka scored twice during a
four-goal second period at Pittsburgh, and the Penguins ended a
seven-game winless streak against the Sharks.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 3, St. Louis 1 -- Eric Messier, Joe Sakic and Milan
Hejduk scored, and Patrick Roy made 19 saves at St. Louis to end a
three-game winless streak.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 3, Chicago 1 -- Roman Turek made 32 saves and Denis
Gauthier scored the tiebreaking goal at Calgary, Canada, and the
Flames ended a seven-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 1, Edmonton 1 -- Tommy Salo stopped 36 shots for host
Edmonton and counterpart Curtis Joseph made 26 saves. Salo faced 26
shots in the first two periods.</TE>

<HD>Irish Offense Piles Up Points</HD>
<DH>Holiday leads attack with four touchdown passes, helping
No. 8 Notre Dame to 42-0 victory over Rutgers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SOUTH BEND, Ind.</DL>
<LD>The Notre Dame offense finally put together a performance to match
its dominating defense.</LD>
<LD>   Carlyle Holiday tied a school record with four touchdown passes,
completing 13 of 25 for 270 yards as the eighth-ranked Fighting Irish
beat Rutgers, 42-0, on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "Our offense did a great job of playing the way I think they can,"
Coach Tyrone Willingham said after Notre Dame gained a season-high
478 yards.</LD>
<TE>   The victory gave Notre Dame (10-1) its first 10-win season since
going 11-1 in 1993. It also gave Willingham the most wins by a
first-year Irish coach, passing the marks of 9-1 by Ara Parseghian in
1964 and Terry Brennan in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   "That is about our team, our assistant coaches and our team,"
Willingham said of the 10 wins. "They are the ones who deserve the
credit."</TE>
<TE>   Willingham took over a 5-6 team and has the Irish on the brink of
a bowl championship series berth. A win at seventh-ranked USC on
Saturday would clinch a spot for Notre Dame, which could wind up in
either the Orange or Sugar Bowl after the final BCS standings are
released Dec. 8.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish have struggled at times with Willingham's complex West
Coast offense. But against the weak Scarlet Knights (1-10), the
offense had no problems.</TE>
<TE>   Holiday threw touchdown passes of 38 and 63 yards to Arnaz Battle,
who had three catches for 108 yards, and added a 37-yarder to Omar
Jenkins and a 26-yarder to Maurice Stovall for his the first
four-touchdown game -- tying a school record shared by five others.</TE>
<TE>   Holiday, who threw three touchdown passes last season and one
through four games this season, has nine touchdown passes in the last
six games.</TE>
<TE>   The 42 points are the most for the Fighting Irish since they
scored 45 against Rutgers two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Grant rushed for 68 yards and a touchdown in 18 carries,
giving him 1,001 yards for the season. He is only the seventh Irish
running back to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season. Autry
Denson (1998, 1,176 yards) was the last to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Shane Walton returned an interception 45 yards for a touchdown. It
was Walton's seventh interception this season, the most by an Irish
player since Todd Lyght had eight in 1989.</TE>

<HD>Unloved but Undefeated, Buckeyes Are in the Chips</HD>
<DH>Ohio State is 13-0 and will play for national title in
Fiesta Bowl after latest escape, 14-9 over Michigan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>In a cloth-coat, labor-intensive, throwback game that would have
pleased Woody but not Bo, Ohio State beat Michigan on Saturday, 14-9,
clinched a share of the Big Ten title, a 13-0 regular-season record
and a berth in the Jan. 3 Fiesta Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   You don't like it?</LD>
<LD>   Tough tortilla chips.</LD>
<TE>   To those who say they'd rather watch paint dry than Ohio State
play, that there are half a dozen one-loss teams out there right now
that could beat the Buckeyes, the Buckeyes say this:</TE>
<TE>   "We don't care," linebacker Matt Wilhelm said. "The people who are
talking have already lost a game, or rooting for people who lost a
game. They're not 13-0."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's win before a record crowd of 105,539 at Ohio Stadium
unleashed a floodgate of emotion for a football-crazed school that
hasn't won a national title since 1968 and a lot of those years could
blame Michigan for it.</TE>
<TE>   It's been so long between titles, and postgame dances after
all-important games against Michigan, fans could even tolerate the
pepper spray that kept them from tearing down the goal posts.</TE>
<TE>   The collective exhale that swept across the field after Will Allen
intercepted a last-second Michigan pass near the Ohio State end zone
could have launched a hundred hot-air balloons.</TE>
<TE>   A season in which "take it to the wire" could be the Buckeyes'
theme ended in typical fashion with Ohio State clinging to victory,
same as it did against Cincinnati, Illinois and Purdue.</TE>
<TE>   Decisions, decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you want to cry, do you want to scream?" Wilhelm said of his
joy. "You don't know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Buckeyes did a little of both.</TE>
<TE>   It was an afternoon of retrenchment and retribution, Ohio State
settling a score with Michigan and clearing up one half of the
until-now convoluted national title picture.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, the No. 2 Buckeyes were officially extended an
invitation to the Fiesta Bowl, site of this year's bowl championship
series national title game.</TE>
<TE>   "We accept!" Buckeye Coach Jim Tressel said.</TE>
<TE>   The other title-game spot is Miami's to lose. If the Hurricanes
defeat Syracuse next week and Virginia Tech on Dec. 7, they will face
the Buckeyes in a matchup of the nation's only undefeated schools.</TE>
<TE>   If Miami loses, the second spot will be a BCS standings fight
among several one-loss teams.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing has been easy for Ohio State this year and Saturday was no
different.</TE>
<TE>   "They did what they had to do to win," Michigan quarterback John
Navarre said of the victors.</TE>
<TE>   Same old Buckeye story.</TE>
<TE>   After spinning their wheels for more than three quarters and
losing the field-possession chess game, the Buckeyes scored the
game-winning touchdown on Maurice Hall's three-yard sweep around
right end with 4:55 left.</TE>
<TE>   It capped one of the most angst-filled drives in Ohio State
football history, highlighted by Craig Krenzel's quarterback sneak on
fourth and one at the Michigan 33.</TE>
<TE>   Twice before, Tressel ordered a punt on fourth and short in
Michigan territory. The second call backfired when Andy Groom's kick
went only 13 yards to the 23.</TE>
<TE>   "I was catching static from a lot of people, 105,000," Tressel
said later.</TE>
<TE>   But the third time, Tressel said he had no choice,</TE>
<TE>   "Krenzel would have killed me if we had not let him continue that
drive," Tressel said.</TE>
<TE>   Krenzel went left for the first down to the 32, then set up the
winning touchdown with a 26-yard pass to tailback Maurice Clarett.</TE>
<TE>   Hall's scoring run came on an option pitch from Krenzel, the first
time Ohio State has run that play this year.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there was still plenty of time left on the clock, and
Michigan had a history of playing demolition derby with Ohio State's
splendid seasons of 1969, '93, '95 and '96.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan, which dropped to 9-3, quickly moved the ball down the
field and had first and 10 at the Ohio State 30 when defensive end
Darrion Scott poked the ball loose from Navarre, Buckeye end Will
Smith recovering the fumble with 2:02 left.</TE>
<TE>   Time to storm the field?</TE>
<TE>   Not so fast.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan used its last two timeouts, held Ohio State on downs and
got the ball back at its 20 with 58 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   In the final minutes, the freshman Clarett turned to Tressel on
the sidelines and said, "How come the clock goes so slow when you're
winning?"</TE>
<TE>   Not, as it turned out, because it was on Michigan time -- although
the gods were certainly going to make Ohio State sweat.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolverines had two shots at the end zone with seven seconds
left.</TE>
<TE>   Tressel, who runs the Buckeye offense, could only hold his breath
and watch.</TE>
<TE>   "I took my headsets off with seven seconds left and said, 'Come
on, D,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, after Navarre's second-down incompletion, there
remained one tick left on the home-town clock.</TE>
<TE>   With only one heave left, though, Navarre underthrew Braylon
Edwards short of the goal line and Allen stepped in for the
interception.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, forever, it was done.</TE>
<TE>   "When Will made the interception, I just started crying," Ohio
State strong safety Mike Doss said.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't alone. The whole stadium was flush-faced and
wet-streaked in crimson -- a satisfying byproduct of the elation and
the pepper spray.</TE>
<TE>   At last, a transcendent moment involving a game against Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Years from now, if Ohio State goes on to win the national title,
Buckeye fans will talk about the game that got them there, the game
in which Clarett shook off a painful left shoulder injury and
shouldered the load, finishing with 119 yards in 20 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "He knew what this game meant to his teammates, he knew what it
meant to Ohio State," Tressel said. "He was going to play no matter
how he felt."</TE>
<TE>   It was a new dawning in Columbus. Tressel, in two seasons, scored
his second win against Michigan. It took former coach John Cooper 13
tries to beat Michigan twice.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing we do with history is try to learn from it,"
Tressel said.</TE>
<TE>   Lesson learned, 14-9.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Columbus is ours tonight," tight end Ben Hartsock said.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, tomorrow and, who knows, after Jan. 3, maybe forever.</TE>

<HD>Jackson's Record Day Leads Oregon State Over Oregon</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CORVALLIS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Steven Jackson rushed for 153 yards and set the Oregon State
single-season rushing record as the Beavers handily defeated Oregon,
45-24, in their annual Civil War rivalry game Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   With state bragging rights and a Pacific 10 Conference bowl
position on the line, the Beavers finished with a slightly better
season than the Ducks, who had been ranked as high as No. 6 before
losing five of their last six.</LD>
<LD>   Oregon State is 8-4 overall and 4-4 in the conference. Oregon
dropped to 7-5 and 3-5.</LD>
<TE>   The game was dominated by Jackson, who ran for two scores and
caught a 69-yard touchdown pass from Derek Anderson. It was the
sophomore tailback's ninth game this season with 100-plus yards and
he finished with 1,656 yards this season.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who went into the game ranked fifth in the nation with an
average of 136.6 yards a game, surpassed Ken Simonton's school record
of 1,559 yards set in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson completed 21 of 37 passes for 370 yards and four
touchdowns, upping his season total to 24 touchdowns and passing
Jonathan Smith's school record of 20 set in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's Jason Fife completed 14 of 33 passes for 182 yards and
one touchdown. He was intercepted three times.</TE>
<TE>   The only bad news for Oregon State had to do with kick returner
Brandon Catenese. The junior was charged with steroid possession last
week and did not play in Saturday's game. The charge wasn't made
public until Friday.</TE>

<HD>Palmer's Leap Should Earn Him More Than a Look From Voters</HD>

<LD>Carson Palmer rounded the corner and lumbered toward the giant gold
"S" and his battered helmet was filled with a single thought.</LD>
<LD>   "Touchdown."</LD>
<LD>   Across the field, USC Coach Pete Carroll had another thought.</LD>
<TE>   "I was like, 'Oh no! Get out of bounds!' "</TE>
<TE>   A few yards away, guard Eric Torres had the same thought.</TE>
<TE>   "I was terrified he was going to ... "</TE>
<TE>   Then, just like that, he did.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer leaped for the end zone like a giant salmon flopping
upstream, throwing his 6-foot-5 body into the air as Ricky Manning
Jr. dived at his legs.</TE>
<TE>   He twirled, he somersaulted, he crashed to the ground with a USC
ovation thundering in his ears.</TE>
<TE>   It looked like John Elway. It felt like Sam Cunningham. It was
coated in bronze.</TE>
<TE>   For a Heisman Trophy candidate whose resume lacked only a single
defining moment, this was it.</TE>
<TE>   USC's 52-21 annihilation of UCLA wasn't only about a cross-town
rivalry, but a cross-country message.</TE>
<TE>   Don't all you voters out there get it yet?</TE>
<TE>   The hottest team in the country is being led by the best player in
the country, period.</TE>
<TE>   Four more touchdown passes with no interceptions, 254 yards.
Completed 59% of his passes.</TE>
<TE>   And one large leap that said it all.</TE>
<TE>   "The play was about more than just the leap," Carroll said. "It
was about a culmination of things."</TE>
<TE>   It was Palmer showing he was willing to grab the biggest game of
his career and shake it until it turned cardinal red.</TE>
<TE>   It was Palmer showing that, after a sometimes wobbly five-year
marathon, he will finish his college career in a dead sprint.</TE>
<TE>   "It was Carson showing the grit and leadership that has made him
the best player in the country," Carroll said. "I told him it looked
like John Elway at the Super Bowl. I also told him it scared me to
death."</TE>
<TE>   Not to mention, it was the former pretty boy showing he could take
a punch.</TE>
<TE>   "Surprised?" Manning said, when asked about the hit. "Yeah. I was
surprised he got up."</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Palmer get up, he leaped up with his hands in the air
as if he had scored a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   His 22-yard run actually ended on the one-yard line. The touchdown
was actually scored by Justin Fargas on the next play.</TE>
<TE>   But Heisman voters who will watch the video on weekend sports
shows might not know that.</TE>
<TE>   And maybe, because the clip is sure to be shown plenty of times,
it will encourage them to actually check out the rest of Palmer's
game.</TE>
<TE>   You know, such as how his first pass floated 34 yards into Kareem
Kelly's hands for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Or how he completed his next five passes, culminating in a perfect
bomb to Keary Colbert for another touchdown?</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter, Palmer was seven for eight for 128 yards.</TE>
<TE>   You know Ken Dorsey, the Miami quarterback and Heisman favorite of
those who don't play close attention?</TE>
<TE>   Palmer was as impressive in that first quarter as Dorsey has been
in several entire games.</TE>
<TE>   Or how about Brad Banks, the Iowa quarterback and favorite of the
Midwestern writers who are also nutty enough to think Ohio State is
one of the best teams in the country?</TE>
<TE>   Palmer's first-quarter yardage was better than Banks' yardage in
his last four quarters combined.</TE>
<TE>   "What more does he have to do?" Carroll asked for the umpteenth
time. "This was the biggest game of his career so far, and to come in
here and perform like that is incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer smiled and shrugged and deflected credit like it was a
rushing Bruin linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   "Today it was all about our defense," he said while standing at
midfield after the game.</TE>
<TE>   Later, a couple of yards away, he said, "Today, all the credit
goes to our offensive line."</TE>
<TE>   But as he approached the Trojan band in the end zone, waving two
fingers in time with the music, it became clear that it was all about
him.</TE>
<TE>   "Heis-man, Heis-man," they had chanted.</TE>
<TE>   "Carson! Carson!" they now screamed.</TE>
<TE>   He walked to the edge of the stands and delivered high-fives as he
walked into the Rose Bowl tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody held up a stuffed bear and he playfully punched it.
Somebody else pulled out a jersey, and he carefully autographed it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an amazing feeling," he said. "To come in here and beat them
like this. It's huge. It's awesome."</TE>
<TE>   It's ownership is what it is.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer ends his career dominating the Bruins with a 3-1 record,
1,036 passing yards, 10 touchdown and three interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   If only, on Saturday, he could have leaped one more yard.</TE>
<TE>   "I really thought I had a chance to get into the end zone," he
said. "I wasn't thinking of getting injured. It was all instinct."</TE>
<TE>   Is he still that short of convincing Heisman voters?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if this is good enough," he said, shrugging again.</TE>
<TE>   The Heisman Trophy is not a career award. If it was, well, on
Saturday Palmer also became the all-time Pacific 10 Conference leader
in passing yards and completions.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not. It's about one year, a dozen games, punctuated by
that one moment.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer has now offered compelling testimony in all areas.</TE>
<TE>   Closing arguments are next week against Notre Dame.</TE>

<HD>Auburn Shows Its Mettle, Upsets No. 9 Alabama</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Auburn dug deep into its tailback rotation and came up a winner.</LD>
<LD>   Freshman reserve Tre Smith ran for 126 yards in 25 carries and
Jason Campbell threw two touchdown passes to Robert Johnson as the
Tigers upset No. 9 Alabama, 17-7, Saturday at Tuscaloosa, Ala.</LD>
<LD>   "Nobody gave us a chance," said Smith, pressed into action by
injuries to three players ahead of him. "Everybody was talking junk,
about me especially, and the rest of the running backs."</LD>
<TE>   The Tigers, 10 1/2-point underdogs, led, 17-0, at halftime and
used a stifling defense to shut down the Southeastern Conference's
top offense.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn, 8-4 overall and 5-3 in the conference, relied on Smith
against the nation's top-rated defense because of injuries to Carnell
Williams (broken leg), Ronnie Brown (sprained ankle) and Chris Butler
(pulled groin). Fullback Brandon Johnson also did not play.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a classic case of guys not being denied," Auburn Coach
Tommy Tuberville said. "We had one running back and he had [126]
yards.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't get any better than winning the Iron Bowl on the
road."</TE>
<TE>   The Crimson Tide (9-3, 6-2) had won five consecutive games but
couldn't score on three fourth-quarter trips across midfield.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Auburn players took turns brandishing the school's
banner in front of their fans before finally heading to the locker
room.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all they were talking about, Alabama and how they were
going to blow us out of the stadium," Auburn defensive tackle DeMarco
McNeil said.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama turned the ball over on downs three times in the fourth
quarter, the final time with 53 seconds remaining after a drive
stalled at Auburn's 35 with an incomplete pass.</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Louisiana State 14, Mississippi 13 -- Marcus Randall came
off the bench and threw two touchdown passes to help the Tigers rally
at Baton Rouge, La. LSU (8-3, 5-2) needed the victory to stay on top
in the Western Division race. The winner of Friday's game between LSU
and Arkansas will play in the SEC title game against Georgia on Dec.
7. Mississippi (5-6, 2-5) lost its fifth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Randall started the second quarter and completed 13 of 20 passes
for 179 yards and two touchdowns. He was sacked once and ran for 31
yards, and his 27-yard touchdown pass to Michael Clayton with 6:34
remaining erased a six-point deficit and put the Tigers ahead for
good.</TE>
<TE>   LSU held Mississippi to 61 yards rushing, sacked Eli Manning twice
and intercepted him twice. Manning completed 19 of 38 passes for 218
yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas 26, Mississippi State 19 -- De'Arrius Howard ran for a
career-high 121 yards and the Razorbacks held off a fourth-quarter
rally to win at Starkville, Miss. Arkansas (8-3, 4-3) has won five in
a row.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State (3-8, 0-7) pulled to within seven on Ray Ray
Bivine's 26-yard touchdown reception from Kyle York with 3:20
remaining. After the Bulldogs recovered the ensuing onside kick at
their own 47, they drove to the Arkansas 20 before Tony Bua stopped
York trying to scramble for a first down on fourth and five with just
over a minute left.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee 24, Vanderbilt 0 -- Cedric Houston ran for 140 yards and
a touchdown as the Volunteers rushed for 242 yards to win at
Nashville. It was the 20th consecutive time Tennessee (7-4,4-3)
defeated Vanderbilt (2-10, 0-8).</TE>
<TE>   Casey Clausen started after missing Tennessee's win over
Mississippi State last week because of an ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   Clemson 27, South Carolina 20 -- Bernard Rambert ran for two
touchdowns, including a two-yard score with 9:38 remaining to help
the Tigers win at Clemson, S.C. Rambert also had a four-yard
touchdown run in the first quarter for the Tigers (7-5), who beat the
Gamecocks (5-7) for the fifth time in six years.</TE>

<LD>Television viewers in Southern California who were clicking the
remote control Wednesday night, searching desperately for something
-- anything -- in that vast small-screen wasteland, might have been
fortunate enough to stumble upon KSCI, the regional Korean-language
channel.</LD>
<LD>   Had they done so at the right hour, they would have come across
one of the most entertaining international matches played this year,
South Korea's enthralling 3-2 defeat against Brazil in Seoul.</LD>
<LD>   The game could easily have been billed as "The World Cup Final
That Might Have Been."</LD>
<TE>   The world champions were given all they could handle by the South
Koreans, who finished fourth at Korea/Japan '02 and would have met
the Brazilians in the final had they not lost to Germany in the
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere in Seoul was unrivaled, the 63,000 "Red Devil" fans
being every bit as loud and intense as they were during the World
Cup, and the players rose to the occasion.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that day, the same thing had occurred in Gelsenkirchen,
Germany, where an inspired Netherlands team upset Germany, 3-1, in a
game equally pulsating and incident-filled.</TE>
<TE>   Playing the full 90 minutes for Brazil in Seoul was the Real
Madrid duo of Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos.</TE>
<TE>   Playing for the Netherlands in Gelsenkirchen was the Barcelona
quartet of Patrick Kluivert, Frank de Boer, Michael Reiziger and
Philip Cocu. Significantly, each played only 45 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   That was because of an even more important game that was to be
played Saturday: Barcelona versus Real Madrid at the Nou Camp stadium
in the Catalonian city.</TE>
<TE>   By prior arrangement, Dutch Coach Dick Advocaat and Barcelona
Coach Louis Van Gaal, his predecessor in charge of the Netherlands
team, had agreed that the four Barcelona players on the Dutch team
would play only one half.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing 90 minutes [on Wednesday] against Germany and then on
Saturday against Real would be too much," Advocaat said in agreeing
to the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Real Madrid Coach Vicente del Bosque apparently did not ask Mario
Zagallo, Brazil's interim coach, to limit Ronaldo or Roberto Carlos'
playing time, despite the players' tiring journey from Madrid to
Seoul and back.</TE>
<TE>   And so when Saturday rolled around and the fans streamed into Nou
Camp expecting to see the return of Ronaldo to his former club, they
were disappointed. Ronaldo had picked up a cold at the game in Seoul
or on the way and did not play.</TE>
<TE>   The Barcelona faithful therefore took it out on another former
Barcelona player who had made the switch to Real Madrid, Portugal's
Luis Figo. He was pelted with bottles when he went to take a corner
kick in the second half and the referee promptly took both teams off
the field.</TE>
<TE>   Order was restored in the crowd, play resumed and the game ended
in a 0-0 tie. A moral victory for European champion Real Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   That's what the rivalries are like among the world's leading
clubs. Their rosters are filled with the most exceptional of players,
high-priced thoroughbreds who command huge salaries and intense media
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   The performance of teams such as these, along with Manchester
United, Bayern Munich, AC Milan and a score of other leading clubs,
is scrutinized worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Someday, it might even be that way in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, painfully slowly, in fact, Major League Soccer is moving
to join the rest of the world. It might not happen in our lifetime,
but it will happen.</TE>
<TE>   Another small step was taken in that direction last week.</TE>
<TE>   There was another player who was on the field Wednesday in Seoul
and a continent away two days later. Hong Myung Bo is his name, and
Friday the South Korean defender could have been seen touring the
Galaxy's rapidly rising stadium in Carson during the day and watching
the Lakers at Staples Center that night.</TE>
<TE>   Hong is a welcome addition to MLS, and to the Galaxy in
particular, but it is going to take either an exponentially greater
financial commitment or an incredibly long time for the league's
clubs to approach the status of, say, Real Madrid or Barcelona.</TE>
<TE>   Both those clubs have a century of tradition behind them, true,
but surely the whole point in establishing a professional league in
the U.S. was to one day have clubs in the league that are among the
world's finest.</TE>
<TE>   If not, why bother?</TE>
<TE>   But MLS will grow in stature by only small increments the way
things stand. Perhaps that is as it must be for now, but it can't
last forever.</TE>
<TE>   When television makes it possible to sit in one's living room and
be entertained by the world's best players, the only way MLS is going
to pry viewers out of their armchairs is to feature the world's best
players itself.</TE>
<TE>   And that means raising the salary cap way, way above its present
limit.</TE>
<TE>   It also means scrapping the league's all-too-close ties with U.S.
Soccer, which right now is something of a one-way street.</TE>
<TE>   The league has certainly benefited the national team by producing
American players who can compete internationally. That makes the
federation look good, but what's in it for MLS?</TE>
<TE>   There will come a time in the hopefully not-too-distant future
when MLS will realize that it can't succeed at the gate with American
players alone.</TE>
<TE>   The all-too-stringent restriction imposed by U.S. Soccer on the
number of foreign players allowed on MLS rosters will have to be
modified, and preferably abandoned altogether. Players should be
selected on merit, not nationality.</TE>
<TE>   Just look at the rosters of Real Madrid and Barcelona. Both clubs
could virtually field a world-class starting lineup without a single
Spanish player. And their fans don't complain. Quite the contrary,
they demand the best.</TE>
<TE>   American fans should demand no less.</TE>

<HD>Bowl Party! Everyone Invited!</HD>

<LD>The math is enough to warm the hearts of money-hungry athletic
departments and desperate alumni alike: 56 of 117 Division I-A teams
-- a whopping 47.9% -- will play in a bowl game this season,
seemingly a win-win situation for everybody.</LD>
<LD>   Alumni can now add to their shot-glass collection with a
hand-picked selection from the Gaylord Hotels Music City Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Coaches can fire up players by reminding them they're one victory
away from playing in the Continental Tire Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   Athletic department officials can light their cigars with money
earned from the Diamond Walnut San Francisco Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   And one lucky team can fill next year's media guide with stirring
highlights from a victorious trip to the ConAgra Foods Hawaii Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Really, all you need to know about the existence of 28 bowls is
this: Five teams from Conference USA are eligible to qualify, making
it possible for Southern Mississippi (6-5, 4-3 in conference play) to
sneak into the New Orleans Bowl as the conference's fifth-place team
... if the Golden Eagles can get past pesky East Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The bowl-qualifying madness even has some coaches confusing
victory over Temple with actual achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just a great accomplishment for our football team,"
Boston College Coach Tom O'Brien said after a 36-14 victory over the
hapless Owls guaranteed the Eagles a fourth consecutive bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College improved to 2-4 in the Big East, a conference mark
that would have thrilled Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   The Badgers finished 2-6 in the Big Ten -- a .250 winning
percentage -- but became bowl-eligible, of course, by defeating
Minnesota, 49-31, and improving to 7-6 overall.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a beautiful feeling knowing we're going to a bowl game,"
said Wisconsin running back Anthony Davis. "It's a great feeling to
play well and win with everything on the line."</TE>
<TE>   This reaction comes from a program that just two years ago became
the first Big Ten team to win consecutive Rose Bowls.</TE>
<TE>   Not everybody was so happy with their bowl prospects.</TE>
<TE>   You wouldn't want to have been stuck sitting next to Florida State
defensive tackle Darnell Dockett on the flight home Saturday from
North Carolina State.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Dockett bellyached about going to the Gator Bowl
last year, hinting not-so-subtly at how important a victory would be
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell you, I don't want to go to Jacksonville [for the Gator
Bowl]," Dockett told the Tallahassee Democrat. "That's just the most
horrible bowl I went to in my life. I want to go to a big bowl."</TE>
<TE>   Florida State had 162 total yards and lost to North Carolina
State, 17-7.</TE>
<TE>   (Hours later, however, Florida State backed into a BCS bid as the
Atlantic Coast Conference champion when Maryland lost to Virginia.)</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Iowa Coach Kirk Ferentz had the best idea.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawkeyes are probably going to the Rose Bowl for the first
time since 1991, but some Iowa fans worry that the Hawkeyes could
wind up in the Capital One Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   But Ferentz wasn't concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "The great thing now is we can put our feet up and watch everybody
else sweat," he said. "It doesn't get much better than that."</TE>
<TE>   Needed: More Incentive</TE>
<TE>   The many reasons Texas Tech wanted to beat Oklahoma:</TE>
<TE>   * Coach Mike Leach would have earned $87,500 in contract
incentives if the Red Raiders defeated the Sooners.</TE>
<TE>   * Senior quarterback Kliff Kingsbury, the Big 12 Conference's
all-time passing leader, could have led Texas Tech to its first
conference championship game.</TE>
<TE>   * The Red Raiders could have ruined the BCS chances of two
top-five teams in consecutive weeks.</TE>
<TE>   So what happened?</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech lost, 60-15.</TE>
<TE>   Who Called That One?</TE>
<TE>   Rivalry week brings out the best -- and worst -- in teams. Here's
a nomination for the worst play in Saturday's games.</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern trailed Illinois, 24-10, midway through the third
quarter and failed to convert on fourth and goal from the one when
quarterback Brett Basanez faked a run to the right, then threw a
lateral across the field to offensive lineman Trai Essex.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-4, 280-pound Essex caught the ball, stumbled forward a
few steps and was tackled for a three-yard loss.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois assumed possession on downs, marched 96 yards for a
touchdown and ultimately won, 31-24.</TE>
<TE>   See You on Graduation Day?</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee defeated intrastate rival Vanderbilt for the 20th
consecutive time, this time by a 24-0 score.</TE>
<TE>   But the Commodores didn't seem too perturbed. After all, an NCAA
study earlier in the season showed that 100% of Vanderbilt football
players who entered the university in 1995-96 graduated within six
years. Tennessee graduated 8% of its football players over the same
span.</TE>
<TE>   "I've made some really good friends and had some good times here
and that's what college football is all about," said Vanderbilt
senior receiver Dan Stricker.</TE>
<TE>   He Won it for Ma Ragone</TE>
<TE>   Dave Ragone has been throwing passes for a long time at
Louisville, so long that he set the school record for victories by a
quarterback by defeating Alabama-Birmingham, 41-21.</TE>
<TE>   He threw three touchdown passes, earned his 27th career victory
and, perhaps most important, played for the first time in front of
his mother at Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   Aurelia Ragone does not like watching her son play because "I get
so emotional ... I worry too much," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But she changed her mind to see Ragone play against UAB in his
final home game.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the biggest game of my career," Dave Ragone said.</TE>
<TE>   Ragone wasn't so successful in pursuing the school's career
rushing record for quarterbacks.</TE>
<TE>   He needed 11 yards to get the record, but had minus-nine in six
carries.</TE>
<TE>   Did Everyone Get a Record?</TE>
<TE>   San Diego State receivers J.R. Tolver and Kassim Osgood combined
for two NCAA season records in the Aztecs' 38-34 victory over Air
Force.</TE>
<TE>   Tolver and Osgood have 213 catches between them, the highest total
for two teammates, and have a combined 2,928 yards receiving, also a
record for two teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Not wanting to be left out, Air Force's Chance Harridge scored
three times and set the NCAA season record for touchdowns rushing by
a quarterback with 22, passing Chris McCoy of Navy, who had 20 in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   Train Stopped</TE>
<TE>   Texas Christian running back Lonta Hobbs is known as the Fast
Train From Clarksville, but his team was derailed by East Carolina,
which had the nation's 106th-ranked defense.</TE>
<TE>   Hobbs had 158 yards rushing, but the Horned Frogs, ranked No. 22,
had seven turnovers in a 31-28 loss.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a superior effort on the defensive side of the ball,
absolutely superior," East Carolina Coach Steve Logan said. "One of
the best I've seen in my years here."</TE>
<TE>   Lesser-Known Rivalries</TE>
<TE>   Montana State halted a 16-game losing streak to rival Montana,
defeating the Grizzlies, 10-7. Montana quarterback John Edwards,
obviously affected by the swirling wind and snow conditions,
completed one of 19 passes for 11 yards and threw an interception in
the first half.</TE>
<TE>   The third-oldest rivalry of them all -- Yale and Harvard -- was
won by Harvard, 20-13, but only after Coach Tim Murphy lit into his
team before the 119th game between the schools.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy's pregame words of wisdom: "You don't get what you deserve,
you get what you earn."</TE>

<TE>   Is It 2002 A.D., or 1972 A.D.?</TE>

Minnesota, leading us to wonder what similarities, besides uniform
No. 28, he shares with the former USC great of the same name.</TE>

<HD>Cal Ends Drought in the Big Game</HD>
<DH>Bears have an easy time in 30-7 triumph over Stanford,
their first in the series since 1994.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>While a sellout throng of 71,224 was busy filling Memorial Stadium on
Saturday for the 105th game between archrivals California and
Stanford, the public address announcer made an announcement: "Enjoy
the game in a safe, positive and friendly environment."</LD>
<LD>   Of course, the fans booed loudly.</LD>
<LD>   And who could blame them? After all, who wants any of that
feel-good stuff when you can enjoy an old-fashioned case of genuine
dislike instead?</LD>
<TE>   The first Cal sellout crowd in eight years saw the Bears grate
their chief tormentor, end seven years of frustration and claim the
Axe with a 30-7 Big Game blowout of the Stanford Cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   There were some big performances, from Cal tailback Joe Igber, who
ran for a Big Game-record 226 yards, and from quarterback Kyle
Boller, who passed for 188 yards and two touchdowns to LaShaun Ward.</TE>
<TE>   But as far as Big Game standards go, this one took on the
appearances of a more modest production, which is what happens when
Stanford stares at a 2-9 record and California is posting its first
winning season in nine years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to knock down some of the barriers in front of us,"
said Cal Coach Jeff Tedford. "Now, we get to sit back and reflect."</TE>
<TE>   The Big Game has not been Cal's to call its own since 1994, the
last time the Bears won. The Bears were 7-5 under first-year coach
Tedford and there were reports last week that boosters were concerned
he might bolt for a better job, even though Tedford is in the first
year of a four-year deal and Cal is coming off a 1-10 season.</TE>
<TE>   "This is so big for our seniors, our program, our team, our coach
and our school," Boller said. "And, hey, we got the Axe to Berkeley."</TE>
<TE>   This series has come a long way since the first game in 1892, a
14-10 Stanford victory played in a grassy field at the corner of
Haight and Stanyon in San Francisco. Herbert Hoover was the Stanford
student football manager.</TE>
<TE>   The rivalry is deeply rooted in tradition. Stanford, the private
school, versus California, the state school. Red and white versus
blue and gold. Two teams separated by a bay, competing in the same
conference, recruiting the same players, fans not liking each other
all that much.</TE>
<TE>   As the Stanford players stretched before the game, they were
taunted by Cal fans.</TE>
<TE>   "Tyrone hates you, Tyrone hates you," they yelled, referring to
Tyrone Willingham, the Stanford coach who quit to take over at Notre
Dame this season.</TE>
<TE>   When the California band formed the letters "Cal," the fans in the
Stanford section chanted "Boring, boring."</TE>
<TE>   The game was more bashing than boring, with Cal holding a 23-7
lead at the half behind Igber, who had a 42-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford scored the first time it had the ball, but its last 13
possessions resulted in nine punts, two intercepted passes, a lost
fumble and the ball going over on downs.</TE>

<HD>Bad From the First Drop</HD>
<DH>Bruins don't quit, but they can't make up for turnovers,
particularly a fumble by Perry on opening kickoff.</DH>

<LD>The UCLA players looked at the scoreboard. They blinked, but the
numbers wouldn't go away.</LD>
<LD>   "I mean, it's like it's not even real," cornerback Ricky Manning
Jr. said. "It's like, 'There's no way this is happening.'</LD>
<LD>   "It's reality. That's what hurts, because it was real. We were
getting beat by that many points. It's just ... weird."</LD>
<TE>   The USC lead was 21 points before 10 minutes were gone. Then it
was 28.</TE>
<TE>   Then 35, 38, and finally an astounding 45 points before two late
touchdowns in the final three minutes of UCLA's 52-21 loss.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt hopeless out there," said receiver Tab Perry, who started
the flood of Bruin mistakes when he fumbled the opening kickoff. USC
turned his error into a touchdown one play later.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing we could do to really rally back. We were
trying. We didn't give up at all," Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the kickoff return was tough. That set the momentum of the
game, when I fumbled that."</TE>
<TE>   It was one mistake of far too many, a season's worth of bloopers
in one ballgame.</TE>
<TE>   There were seven Bruin fumbles, four of them lost.</TE>
<TE>   There was a high snap by Rusty Williams on a punt that sailed into
the backfield, setting up the third Trojan touchdown after it was
recovered at the UCLA 23.</TE>
<TE>   There were the two freshman quarterbacks who had trouble handling
the immensity of playing in front of 91,084 fans.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Olson stumbled on his first play, and later threw his first
interception of the season. He was the picture of calm compared to
Matt Moore.</TE>
<TE>   Moore mishandled the first two snaps he took after Coach Bob
Toledo confounded onlookers by sending him in during the second
quarter as planned despite an 89-yard touchdown drive directed by
Olson the possession before.</TE>
<TE>   Moore bobbled the ball on his first snap, then lost it on the
second at his own 14, setting up yet another USC touchdown</TE>
<TE>   "I knew Matt was going to come in sometime in the second quarter,"
Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little bit [surprised], just because we'd just gone [89]
yards, we went down the field and I felt like we had some momentum
going. I'd finally settled down. Obviously it was the coach's
decision and that's it."</TE>
<TE>   That's it for a lot of UCLA's players against USC.</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Mike Seidman, like Manning, is a senior who will never
know what it is like to beat USC after losing four in a row.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, a tear slid down his cheek until he dammed it with
his hand.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just losing," Seidman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just couldn't believe what was happening. They beat us.... At
least we kept fighting and trying."</TE>
<TE>   At least there was that.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody could say that a year ago, when the Bruins were blamed for
basically giving up in a 27-0 loss.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew we just weren't going to quit," Seidman said. "This is
not a team that quits."</TE>
<TE>   No one can say they did, especially after Moore and John Sciarra
directed touchdown drives in the final minutes of what threatened to
become the worst loss in the series by either team since a 52-0 UCLA
loss in 1930.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it was merely the biggest since 1979.</TE>
<TE>   "This team just doesn't give up," said freshman running back Tyler
Ebell, held to a mere 56 yards after UCLA was forced to pass to try
to catch up.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin fans? Many of them didn't stay until the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I was aware of that," Ebell said after UCLA fans began
leaving in the third quarter and Trojan fans serenaded them with,
"Nah-nah-nah-nah, goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin fans might have been trying to beat the traffic, but it
was a day when the only way to beat it was probably to stay until the
end.</TE>
<TE>   "All I saw was red," Ebell said. "It's kind of upsetting to see
all our fans leaving.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough. We came in and thought we could beat them, and we
could have beat them. We had too many turnovers. That's what beat us.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not as great as the scoreboard showed.... We beat
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Manning didn't withhold his praise, calling Carson Palmer the best
quarterback he has faced along with Joey Harrington last season at
Oregon,</TE>
<TE>   "They've got some good receivers, and they outplayed us," said
Manning, who was beaten badly by Keary Colbert on a 51-yard pass play
for the second touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sad. I just feel we have to move on."</TE>

<KH>THE RIVALRY/ No. 7 USC 52, No. 25 UCLA 21</KH>
<HD>Receivers Strike Early and Often</HD>
<DH>Trojans' big plays take advantage of Bruins' vulnerable
secondary. Colbert scores twice, once on a reverse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keary Colbert stood alone in the end zone, swayed to the music of
USC's marching band and soaked in the atmosphere after the Trojans
dominated UCLA on Saturday at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Colbert, USC's junior flanker, said he wanted to savor the moment
after providing the Trojans with several electrifying ones of his own
in a 52-21 rout of the Bruins.</LD>
<LD>   "The game goes by so fast, you don't have time to appreciate it
when it's happening," Colbert said. "This is the time to enjoy it."</LD>
<TE>   Colbert scored on a 51-yard pass play in the first quarter and a
34-yard reverse in the third quarter to lead another mostly
outstanding performance by the Trojan receiving corps.</TE>
<TE>   Senior wide receiver Kareem Kelly caught a 34-yard touchdown pass
from Carson Palmer 16 seconds into the game and also had a 41-yard
reception that set up Colbert's scoring run.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman wide receiver Mike Williams again appeared a step slow
because of a left thigh bruise but still caught six passes for 66
yards. Tight end Gregg Guenther caught the first touchdown of his
career.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter whose number is called -- we're all capable,"
said Colbert, who finished with four receptions for 84 yards. "I just
got some opportunities today."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, who has taken a backseat to Williams most of the season,
got the first chance when USC caused Tab Perry to fumble the opening
kickoff and recovered at the Bruin 34.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a script, but when you get a turnover like that you need
to make a sudden change and go for it," offensive coordinator Norm
Chow said.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly beat cornerback Matt Ware to the goal line on the left side
and leaped to catch Palmer's pass. Ware's momentum pushed Kelly into
the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew it was a matter of time till my number was called," said
Kelly, who extended his streak of games with a catch to 46. "We were
watching a lot of film on [cornerback] Ricky Manning and Ware this
week. I saw they were vulnerable to double moves. I gave him a hard
step inside, he bit on it and there it was."</TE>
<TE>   Colbert carried the load on the Trojans' next possession, catching
three of Palmer's five consecutive passes during an 85-yard drive.
Manning came up on a play-action fake and Colbert got five yards past
him as Palmer lofted a pass that resulted in a 51-yard scoring play.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of guessed he was going outside and he beat me inside,"
Manning said. "I didn't move my feet right. He got by me."</TE>
<TE>   Said Colbert: "I was just waiting for the ball to come down and
thank goodness it finally did."</TE>
<TE>   Trojan Coach Pete Carroll said he feared a letdown after USC took
a 28-7 lead into halftime, but Kelly and Colbert provided an
immediate third-quarter charge.</TE>
<TE>   On the third play of the second half, Palmer and Kelly connected
for a 41-yard pass play that gave the Trojans a first down at the
Bruin 34.</TE>
<TE>   Chow then called a play the Trojans installed last week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's called 18 Option Line," Colbert said. "When Carson said that
in the huddle, I looked at [wide receiver] D. Hale and tapped him on
the head. We knew we were going to score."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer took the snap and handed the ball to fullback Malaefou
MacKenzie, who ran to his right with tailback Justin Fargas trailing
on what appeared to be an option play.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is penetration by the defense and Keary can't get the
ball, I can keep going or run the option," MacKenzie said.</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie pitched the ball, but Colbert grabbed it heading in the
opposite direction and sprinted untouched down the left sideline for
a 35-7 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Right when I cut off tackle I knew I was going to score," Colbert
said. "I saw Carson in front of me and I was just thinking, 'I don't
want him to look faster than me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Colbert said he would savor Saturday's moments well into the
night. He will begin thinking about next week's regular-season finale
against Notre Dame today.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great feeling," he said. "Hopefully, we'll feel it
again next week."</TE>

<HD>52 Stickup for Trojans</HD>
<DH>After routing Bruins, Palmer and Co. need their help for
Rose Bowl berth/ UCS turns early UCLA mistakes into fourth win in a
row in series</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Go back into USC history, deeper than Kareem Kelly and Keary Colbert
on quick-strike scoring routes.</LD>
<LD>   Thumb through the pages of the Trojan record book like Carson
Palmer flipping passes past befuddled UCLA defenders.</LD>
<LD>   There it is. The last time USC defeated UCLA in successive seasons
by such a mountain of a margin was 1929 and 1930, under legendary
Coach Howard Jones, in the first two games of the series.</LD>
<TE>   Now add this to the lore, a thoroughly one-sided 52-21 Trojan
victory Saturday at the Rose Bowl, one year after a 27-0 drubbing of
their cross-town rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the sixth in a row for No. 7 USC (9-2, 7-1) and
fourth in a row against UCLA. The Trojans would win the Pacific 10
Conference championship and a Rose Bowl berth if UCLA beats
Washington State on Dec. 7, and their bowl championship series hopes
are also alive.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the BCS is looking at us, I hope we get a shot," said
Palmer, the Trojan senior quarterback. "This is a great
accomplishment. To beat UCLA so convincingly twice in a row, that's
unheard of."</TE>
<TE>   At least since the leather-helmet era more than 70 years ago, when
USC beat UCLA, 76-0 and 52-0. Scores such as that in a rivalry such
as this are unheard of any more.</TE>
<TE>   But two years into his tenure, Trojan Coach Pete Carroll is doing
an admirable job of keeping up with the Joneses.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm jealous of our freshmen," Palmer said. "Before they leave
here, they are going to play in the BCS championship game. They are
going to do a lot of special things under Coach Carroll."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer is cramming his share of special achievements into a senior
year that has him in Heisman Trophy contention. He passed for four
touchdowns against No. 25 UCLA (7-4, 4-3), including two in the first
five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The first came one play after Tab Perry fumbled the opening
kickoff -- the first of five Bruin turnovers. Kelly faked cornerback
Matt Ware with an inside move and broke free in the corner for a
34-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer completed five in a row on the next Trojan possession and
Colbert ran past cornerback Ricky Manning Jr. to haul in a long pass
for a 51-yard score that gave his quarterback the Pacific 10
Conference career yardage record.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojan defense was efficient as well, forcing a punt situation
after giving up a 32-yard gain on a screen pass to Tyler Ebell. But
the punt never occurred because the snap by Rusty Williams sailed
over the head of Nate Fikse, setting up USC on the Bruin 23-yard
line.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer scrambled for 22 yards and Justin Fargas scored from one
yard to stretch the lead to 21-0 with 5:42 left in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   For USC, the start was unforgettable.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they gave up right when we took the ball from them three
times and went right down the field," USC cornerback Marcell Allmond
said. "When a team scores 21 points to nothing in the first five
minutes, it puts a knife in somebody's back."</TE>
<TE>   For UCLA, the start was unfathomable.</TE>
<TE>   The game was shaping up as worse than last year's debacle in which
a dispirited Bruin squad stopped playing hard, an experience so
disturbing that Coach Bob Toledo refused to discuss it this week.</TE>
<TE>   But this time the Bruins fought back, marching 89 yards and
scoring on a seven-yard run by Manuel White early in the second
quarter. Freshman quarterback Drew Olson found a rhythm, completing
three of three passes for 58 yards during the drive.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin defense held and UCLA got the ball back at its six.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were back in the game," Ebell said.</TE>
<TE>   Inexplicably, however, Toledo pulled Olson in favor of fellow
freshman Matt Moore, who fumbled the first two snaps. He picked up
the first and handed it to Ebell, who gained eight yards. But
defensive tackle Mike Patterson recovered the second, and Palmer soon
hit Malaefou MacKenzie with a two-yard touchdown pass for a 28-7
lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought he could handle the snap and make the play," Toledo
said of inserting Moore. "Why not? Our plan was to play him. We think
he's an excellent football player. We had him warmed up. He took
snaps on the sideline. That one play obviously contributed, but
that's not what lost us the football game."</TE>
<TE>   On the field, Ebell was dismayed.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was weird," he said. "Drew finally got some
confidence and it was odd to see Matt go in, even though he can do
the job too."</TE>
<TE>   Neither quarterback was particularly effective. And neither was
Ebell, who was held to 56 yards in 12 carries, the first time he has
had fewer than 100 since becoming the starter seven games ago.</TE>
<TE>   Olson completed eight of 17 passes for 121 yards, was sacked three
times, fumbled once and had a pass intercepted for the first time.
Moore was seven of 11 for 64 yards, including a touchdown pass to
White late in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Any thoughts UCLA had of mounting a comeback were dashed when USC
opened the third quarter by moving 80 yards in four plays. Palmer hit
Kelly with a 41-yard pass and Colbert scampered 34 yards on a reverse
for the touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "At the half we were hanging in there, but when they went down and
scored to make it 35-7, we were in a world of hurt," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the crowd of 91,084 was dressed in UCLA blue and gold,
and they streamed for the exits after Palmer threw his fourth scoring
pass, a three-yard dart to Gregg Guenther with two minutes left in
the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Our coaches were saying there must have been free pizza in the
parking lot," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   Red-clad fans chanted goodbye to the Bruins. They chanted "Beat
the Irish," a reference to USC's game next week against Notre Dame.
They chanted "Heisman" for Palmer's benefit.</TE>
<TE>   And they chanted Carroll's name until the game ended and players
carried the coach to the end zone. UCLA's home stadium had been
transformed into a salute to Troy.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not the Trojans return to the Rose Bowl on New Year's
Day, sweet memories from Saturday will linger.</TE>
<TE>   "We came into an adverse situation with everything on the line and
we played lights out," Carroll said. "So many opportunities were
cashed in right off the bat, that's the mark of a real good football
team.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans were loud from end to end, they couldn't have been
better. Our goal is to get here, to the Rose Bowl, so every time we
play here, we want it to be special."</TE>

<KH>NOTES/ THE RIVALRY/ No. 7 USC 52, No. 25 UCLA 21</KH>
<HD>USC Makes Ebell Feel Abandoned</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A defiant Tyler Ebell said he wasn't given a fair chance to extend
his streak of 100-yard rushing games because UCLA was forced to
abandon the run.</LD>
<LD>   Just another Bruin talking nonsense, USC defensive end Omar Nazel
said after the Trojans contained the freshman tailback en route to a
52-21 victory Saturday at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, he's nobody to us," Nazel said of Ebell, who was limited to
56 yards in 12 carries, ending his streak of 100-yard games at six.
"He's just a regular old running back."</LD>
<TE>   Stopping Ebell was a great source of pride for the 9-2 Trojans,
who have not allowed a 100-yard rusher this season.</TE>
<TE>   They limited UCLA to 40 net yards rushing in 33 carries (1.2-yard
average) and recorded five sacks, two by Kenechi Udeze. USC has held
its last six opponents to fewer than 100 yards rushing.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-9, 170-pound Ebell was the first freshman and only the
second player in UCLA history to rush for at least 100 yards in six
consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, though, he was just another back who found little room
to maneuver against the Trojan defense, which began the game ranked
eighth in the nation against the run.</TE>
<TE>   "He felt like he was going to come out here and take over this
game, like he was [Colorado running back] Chris Brown or something,"
Nazel said. "But as you could see, he's just like all the other
running backs we've faced. He's just as susceptible as everybody
else."</TE>
<TE>   Auburn tailback Carnell Williams came closest to reaching the
100-yard mark against USC, rushing for 94 yards in the opener Sept. 2
at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell, who needs 86 yards against Washington State on Dec. 7 to
become only the third freshman in Pacific 10 Conference history to
rush for 1,000 yards, wasn't all that impressed with the Trojan
defense. He hinted that things might have been different had the
Bruins not fallen behind early.</TE>
<TE>   "Their defense was OK," Ebell said. "We just had to abandon the
running game. They definitely were fast. But as far as being as good
as they think they are, they're not."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC safety DeShaun Hill said the Trojans emphasized stopping the
run, then pressuring UCLA's freshman quarterbacks, Drew Olson and
Matt Moore.</TE>
<TE>   That resulted in several blitzes, including an effective one by
Hill, who tackled Olson for a 23-yard loss and caused a fumble that
was recovered by linebacker Melvin Simmons at the 50-yard line early
in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I disguised it the best I could," Hill said of the blitz. "As
soon as they hiked the ball, I hit my gap and it was wide open.
[Olson] saw me and tried to get rid of the ball early, so I put my
arm up and blocked him from moving his arm forward."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Leach set the tone for the game when the USC safety forced a
fumble by UCLA's Tab Perry on the opening kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   Grant Mattos recovered the ball for USC at the Bruin 34, and on
the next play Carson Palmer passed to Kareem Kelly for a touchdown
and a 7-0 lead after only 16 seconds had elapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Leach, aware that kickoff coverage has been among USC's weakest
areas, said he was determined to make a big play.</TE>
<TE>   "Kickoff [coverage] the whole year has been kind of soft," he
said. "We haven't been doing our job. I said, 'We've got to do this.
We've got to get off to a good start.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruin defensive tackle Rodney Leisle played for the first time
since Oct. 5 and had one tackle. Last week Leisle said his foot
injury still gave him pain and he probably would not play.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Phillips, starting at defensive tackle for the first time in
two years, led the Bruins with seven tackles.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Dave Ball's sack streak ended at eight games. UCLA
had only one sack, by linebacker Brandon Chillar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC center Norm Katnik suffered a sprained left ankle in the
fourth quarter and was replaced by senior Derek Graf. Katnik's
availability for the Notre Dame game Saturday at the Coliseum has yet
to be determined.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perry had a boot on his left ankle after the game and said it
appears to be a high ankle sprain, an injury that could keep him out
of the Washington State game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the loudest ovations of the day came after Sunny Byrd got
his first carry of the season in the fourth quarter. "I heard that,"
Byrd said. "It got me pumped up."</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, a senior, was pressed into service as the Trojan tailback
last season because of injuries. He carried 20 times for 40 yards in
last season's 27-0 victory over UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   With plenty of healthy tailbacks this season, Byrd has been a
reserve fullback and special teams player.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd, however, lined up at tailback with the game in hand and
carried three times in a row for a total of 11 yards. Two plays
later, freshman Hershel Dennis replaced him and scored the first
touchdown of his career on a 38-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marcell Allmond, who made the transition from receiver to
cornerback during training camp and started for the first time on
Oct. 19 against Washington, got the first interception of his career
when he picked off an Olson pass in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "When the ball is in the air, I know how to go get it," he said.</TE>

<LD>CS Northridge (0-1) vs. Jacksonville (1-0) at Oregon John Thompson
Foundation Challenge, 3 p.m. -- Northridge has to do a better job of
holding leads. It scored the first 16 points Friday and led 45-27
with 18 minutes play, but went on to lose to Portland State, 69-65.
Ian Boylan led the Matadors with 20 points. Senior guards James
Daniels and Kevin Sheppard scored 18 points each for Jacksonville in
an 85-55 win Friday over Florida Saint Leo, a Division II school.</LD>

<LD>If basketball were like hockey, the Clippers would be 9-3-1 for an
outstanding start to 2002-03. Alas, roundball teams play four
quarters instead of three periods and the Clippers' success over
three quarters hasn't translated into victories.</LD>
<LD>   "I know we have to find a way to close games out," Coach Alvin
Gentry said.</LD>
<LD>   The best example of the Clippers' inability to finish off the
opposition happened Friday against the unskilled but hard-working
Denver Nuggets, losers of five consecutive before Gentry's team hit
town. The Clippers built a 16-point lead early in the fourth but
couldn't put away the Nuggets.</LD>
<TE>   James Posey's basket at the buzzer enabled Denver to complete a
72-70 comeback victory, but it wasn't the real reason the Clippers
lost. There were several factors at work, perhaps led by the
Clippers' inability to hold the ball for a quality shot at the
basket.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers had seven turnovers in the fourth quarter, which the
Nuggets turned into three points. But more to the point, that was
seven times the Clippers failed to get off a shot. The Clippers had
15 shots, making four, in the fourth. The Nuggets took 19 shots,
making 10.</TE>
<TE>   Power forward Elton Brand, the Clippers' leading scorer with an
average of 16 points, did not take a single shot in the final
quarter. Center Michael Olowokandi, averaging 15 points, had only
three shots. Point guard Andre Miller, averaging 15 points, also had
three.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers last played a standout center on opening night, when
Cleveland's Zydrunas Ilgauskas scored 19 points and took nine
rebounds in the Cavaliers' 98-96 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Clippers get their first look at Houston's Yao Ming.
After a slow start, Yao is now a starter and coming off an 18-point,
eight-rebound game in the Rockets' victory Friday over the Washington
Wizards.</TE>
<TE>   "He's for real," Michael Jordan said of Yao, the No. 1 pick in the
2002 draft.</TE>

<HD>Adams Stars in Arizona Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hassan Adams and the top-ranked Arizona Wildcats had quite a debut
Saturday at Tucson in a 107-68 rout of 19th-ranked Western Kentucky.</LD>
<LD>   Adams, a freshman guard from Westchester High, scored 22 points
and his dunk on a lob from Jason Gardner gave the Wildcats an 18-4
lead seven minutes into the game.</LD>
<LD>   After the Hilltoppers, also playing in their season opener, closed
to within 27-17, Arizona stepped up the defensive pressure to help
ignite a 24-2 run. Adams' 10-footer with 1:35 to go in the half
capped the run for a 51-19 lead. Luke Walton and Will Bynum each made
two three-pointers and Rick Anderson had one during the run.</LD>
<TE>   "The defense is coming," Coach Lute Olson said. "This could be a
very, very good defensive team by the time we get done."</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats, who led by as many as 42 points, already looked
pretty good, and they didn't have guard Salim Stoudamire, the Pacific
10 Conference freshman of the year last season who sat out the game
because of a sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson scored 14 for Arizona, all in the first half, and Gardner
added 12, all in the second half. Walton had 12 points and seven
assists and Bynum scored 12. David Boyden scored 26 for Western
Kentucky, including four three-point baskets.</TE>
<TE>   "If we want to win," Adams said, "we have to destroy whoever we
play. If it's a top 20 team or not."</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Pittsburgh 82, Duquesne 67 -- The Panthers, opening a season
ranked in the top five for the first time in 15 years, overcame a
below-average game from star Brandin Knight to pull away for the
victory over its cross-town rival.</TE>
<TE>   The first men's game in the $96.4-million Petersen Events Center
-- the most expensive ever built on a Big East Conference campus --
was unexpectedly tight for much of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt (1-0) trailed until the final minute of the first half, then
Julius Page scored eight of his team-high 17 points in a 16-7 run to
start the second half for a 49-36 lead. Knight finished with 13
points.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Tricco, a transfer playing for the first time since the 2001
NCAA tournament with Gonzaga, and reserve guard Brad Midgley each had
13 points for Duquesne (0-1).</TE>
<TE>   No. 6 Duke 101, Army 53 -- Freshman Shavlik Randolph scored 23
points in Durham, N.C., for the Blue Devils, who improved to 21-2 in
season openers under Coach Mike Krzyzewski.</TE>
<TE>   Dahntay Jones and freshman J.J. Redick each had 14 points, and
Daniel Ewing added 10 for Duke.</TE>
<TE>   Joey Payton led Army with 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Oklahoma 82, Princeton 63 -- Ebi Ere started quickly,
scoring the Sooners' first nine points, and finished with 27 points,
seven rebounds, six assists, two steals and a blocked shot in the
championship game of the Sooner Invitational in Norman.</TE>
<TE>   Jabahri Brown scored 14 and Hollis Price had 13 for the Sooners
(2-1), who shot 53.6% and had a 34-24 rebounding edge on the Tigers
(1-1).</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana Lafayette 79, No. 12 Mississippi State 76 -- Brad Boyd
scored 33 points and made a three-pointer with 1:12 left to put the
Ragin' Cajuns ahead for good in the upset in Starkville, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs played their season opener without star center Mario
Austin, who is being held out pending an NCAA ruling on his
eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Johnson added 26 points for Louisiana Lafayette (1-0),
including four free throws in the closing minutes to help clinch it.</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 Cincinnati 54, Tennessee Tech 48 -- The Bearcats (1-0) went
more than nine minutes without scoring, but Leonard Stokes ended the
drought with 15 consecutive points to help defeat the Golden Eagles
(0-1) in Cincinnati, eight weeks after Coach Bob Huggins suffered a
heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Huggins kept his temper in check until the Bearcats' second-half
slump, when he railed at the officials and yelled at his players for
their offensive performance. Stokes led all scorers with 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   In other games involving top 25 teams:</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Mouton had 18 points and James Thomas finished with 13
points and 15 rebounds for No. 3 Texas (2-0), which rolled to an
81-55 victory over Stephen F. Austin (0-1) in Austin, Texas.... Ben
Gordon scored 22 points to lead No. 14 Connecticut (1-0) to a 91-72
win over Quinnipiac (0-1) at Storrs, Conn.... Dwyane Wade scored 22
of his 32 points in the first half as No. 16 Marquette (3-0) took an
80-68 victory over Texas-San Antonio (1-1) to win the Pepsi Blue and
Gold Classic in Milwaukee.... Jarvis Hayes scored 19 points,
including 11 in a 22-5 second-half run, and No. 18 Georgia (1-1) beat
Belmont (1-2), 87-71, at Athens, Ga.... Dante Swanson had 23 points
to lead No. 25 Tulsa (1-0) to a 71-61 victory over New Mexico State
(1-1) in the Roundball Invitational at South Padre Island, Texas.</TE>

<LD>Long Beach Wilson wasn't about to let one Mann get in the way of its
sixth Southern Section boys' water polo title in the last seven
years.</LD>
<LD>   The top-seeded Bruins defeated Corona del Mar, 14-11, in the
Division I final Saturday night at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach,
surviving an eight-goal effort by John Mann.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson (31-0) didn't take control of the game until midway through
the fourth quarter, when it scored two goals 30 seconds apart to take
its first three-goal lead, 14-11.</LD>
<TE>   Second-seeded Corona del Mar (21-8) had a 5-2 lead during the
second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Servite, the top-seeded team in Division II, had a tough
time early before pulling away to a 15-8 victory over unseeded Los
Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   Servite (29-2) trailed, 5-3, before scoring four goals in the last
1:21 of the first half -- the final one a length-of-the-pool shot by
Trevor Clark.</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos (17-16) scored on its first two possessions of the
second half to tie the score, 7-7, but Servite scored five unanswered
goals to take a commanding 12-7 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The top-seeded teams in Division III, IV and V weren't as
successful. Manhattan Beach Mira Costa upset South Pasadena, 9-7, in
Division III, La Verne Damien won its first section title with a 10-9
victory over two-time defending Division V champion Riverside Poly,
and Santa Maria Righetti toppled Ventura, 10-9, in overtime to win
Division IV.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura's Luke Bannan tied the score, 7-7, with eight seconds
remaining in regulation, but Matt Dale scored two of Righetti's three
goals in overtime to lift the third-seeded Warriors (27-5) to their
third title in the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   Damien (29-2) and Riverside Poly (27-5) were tied seven times
before Damien's J.P Wright stole the ball at mid-pool and fired a
pass to teammate Philip Giudice, who scored to give the second-seeded
Spartans a 10-9 lead with 59 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Mira Costa (24-7) won its second title in three years, taking a
two-goal lead on Travis Buchannan's goal late in the first half and
keeping South Pasadena at bay. . South Pasadena (25-8) was trying for
its first section title since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Bonita won its second consecutive Division VI title with a 15-8
victory over second-seeded Hacienda Heights Los Altos. Nick Corjon
scored three of his team-high four goals in the first half as the
top-seeded Bearcats (24-10) built a 7-2 lead.</TE>

<LD>Since the state cross-country championships began in 1987, no City
Section runner has won an individual title.</LD>
<LD>   That could change next weekend, when Manuel Ruiz of North Hills
Monroe High makes his run at history and tries to continue a story
line that reads like a Disney movie.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, Ruiz arrived from Mexico to live with his brother.
He spoke little English and had never engaged in any running except
for racing to catch the bus in Mexico City.</LD>
<TE>   Basketball was his sport.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, 5 feet 8, tried out for the freshman-sophomore team at
Monroe. He was cut.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to his physical education class, where once a week,
students were required to complete 10 laps within 30 minutes to
receive an A.</TE>
<TE>   Teacher Leo Hernandez, who's also an assistant cross-country
coach, saw Ruiz finish his laps in 18 minutes. The next week, Ruiz
ran 12 laps in the same time.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I got excited," Hernandez said. "I said, 'That's it, you're
going to run cross-country.' "</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz finished sixth in the City final and in the spring won the
City track title for 3,200 meters. Last season, he won the City
cross-country title and 3,200.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday at Pierce College, he ran the three-mile course in 14
minutes 54 seconds to win his second City cross-country title in
preparation for the state final next week in Fresno. Although Ruiz
missed the City record of 14:42, as well as the school record of
14:50, he can still accomplish a feat two former Monroe runners
haven't -- finish in the top three in the state meet.</TE>
<TE>   "He wants to be the best runner to ever come out of Monroe," Coach
Dean Balzarett said. "It's going to be interesting to watch."</TE>
<TE>   The Monroe runners Ruiz is trying to surpass are Cesario Marquez,
who won the City cross-country championship in 1981, and Richard
Nance, who did the same in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   No City runner has finished higher than fourth in the Division I
state race. Ruiz put himself in contention by his performance in the
individual sweepstakes race of the Mount San Antonio College
Invitational on Oct. 26. He ran 14:50 over the 2.91-mile course, the
fastest among Division I runners.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz came to the United States to fulfill college ambitions. He's
going to graduate in June by finishing his high school credits in
three years instead of the usual four. He receives mostly A's and
also works part time as a cashier for a fast-food restaurant. He's
expected to receive a college scholarship, with Arizona among the
leading candidates.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, father and sister still live in Mexico. He thinks of
them when the pain begins to enter his muscles and he must call upon
all his strength to keep running.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of trying to become someone in life," he said. "You have
to keep trying, keep pushing."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said he knows what makes Ruiz a successful runner.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got will," he said. "He didn't know what running was. He
didn't know whether a 4:50 mile was fast or a six-minute mile was
slow. He wanted to be the best at any cost. He can take more pain
than anyone else I've seen in 15 years of coaching."</TE>
<TE>   Balzarett has coached cross-country for 38 years and says Ruiz
could be his best runner. He jokes about taking the basketball coach
to dinner every week to thank him for cutting Ruiz.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz, who never liked running before joining the cross-country
team, runs 40 to 50 miles a week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that just happened," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He understands the chance to make history is within reach.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be hard, but I'll try my best to see what happens,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Balzarett is confident Ruiz knows what he can do.</TE>
<TE>   "He's ready to run real fast," he said.</TE>

<HD>Garbisch Helps Upset Wilson</HD>

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jamie Garbisch of Los Alamitos knows the agony of defeat, and the
agony of the feet, too.</LD>
<LD>   After missing early-season matches while rehabilitating stress
fractures in both feet, she played sparingly in two defeats this
season against Long Beach Wilson. But Saturday she experienced the
incredible thrill of victory as the second-seeded Griffins came from
behind to upset top-seeded and defending-champion Wilson, 7-15, 15-7,
16-14, 10-15, 20-18, in the Southern Section Division I-AA
championship match at Cypress College.</LD>
<LD>   "It's so surreal," said Garbisch, a 5-11 senior outside hitter who
had 20 kills. "We had nothing to lose. We gave it all the heart we
had, and we did it."</LD>
<TE>   Especially after the Griffins came out and promptly fell behind,
9-0, to open the first game.</TE>
<TE>   But Los Alamitos (29-7), No. 4 in The Times' rankings, staged a
late rally in that game before losing, came from behind to win the
second and third games and came out on top in a see-saw fifth game
that was played with rally scoring and included seven ties. The
Griffins finally put away Wilson (33-3) on a smash by Katie Carlson
after 2 hours 20 minutes of play.</TE>
<TE>   "Jamie didn't play the first match against them and only played
limitedly the second time, and only on defense, with no jumping," Los
Alamitos Coach Sue Monsoor said. "She's a great player, and after all
that time on the bench just watching, she's learned a lot and become
a very savvy player, too."</TE>
<TE>   Garbisch, one of nine seniors on the Los Alamitos roster, was not
the only player to contribute. Junior outside hitter Kara Uhl added
15 kills and four blocks, and Carlson finished with 11 kills. Senior
defensive specialist Laura Kroneberger had 21 digs and setter Ashley
Filkins had 53 assists and 12 digs.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson got a match-high 25 kills by junior middle blocker Brett
Quirarte and 22 kills by sophomore outside hitter Cynthia Barboza.
Emily Hendrickson added 19 kills and setter Alli Dillon had 81
assists.</TE>
<TE>   -- Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   Newport Harbor d. Westlake Village Westlake, 15-6, 15-2, 15-11 --
The top-seeded Sailors (26-6) won a rematch of last year's Division
II-AA semifinals by beating the Warriors (22-4) in less than an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Alyson Jennings had 10 kills, Emily Turner had nine kills and
Kristin McClune and Lauren Miller each had eight blocks to lead
Newport Harbor. Rachel Smith had seven kills and Courtney Wade had 21
assists to lead Westlake (22-4), which made its first appearance in
the finals since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei d. South Torrance, 15-13, 15-1, 15-10 -- The
Monarchs (28-8) won a second consecutive Division II-A title as
Mallorie Croal had 16 kills and four blocks and Kimberly King had
nine kills and six blocks to deny South Torrance its first title.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley Hardwick had 11 kills and 28 digs, Annie Meyers had 10
kills and 29 digs and Caroline Kim had 25 assists for South Torrance
(22-9).</TE>
<TE>   Temple City d. Santa Margarita, 15-11, 16-14, 15-9 -- Jacqueline
Jackson had 23 kills and Jessica Jackson added 13 as top-seeded
Temple City (24-0) won the Division III-AA title, its first girls'
volleyball title. Brianna Bowman had a match-high 24 kills for Santa
Margarita (22-9).</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach Marina d. Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, 15-4,
15-11, 14-16, 13-15, 15-9 -- Becky Green had 38 kills, including four
in the decisive fifth game, as third-seeded Marina upset top-seeded
Mira Costa in Division III-A to win its first title since 1997.
Martha Gardikas had 17 kills and Tawnya Maosi had 10 for Marina
(19-4). Mira Costa (23-5) got 23 kills apiece by Sydney Donahue and
Whitney Turner.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano St. Margaret's d. San Pedro Mary Star, 15-8,
15-9, 15-4 -- Outside hitter Polly Bendush had 14 kills, including
six in the second game, and Mara Balak shined on defense for the
Tartans (23-4), who won their second consecutive Division IV-A title
and fourth in a row overall.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Junior Liza Pasciuto of Murrieta Valley spat as she passed the
two-mile mark in the Division I girls' race of the Southern Section
cross-country championships at Mount San Antonio College on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   That is not an unusual occurrence for a runner in a cross-country
race. But Pasciuto's action was a symbolic one because she had
collapsed shortly before the two-mile mark in the Division I final at
Mt. SAC last year.</LD>
<LD>   "It was my way of saying I was going to make it," Pasciuto said
after winning her first section title to lead Murrieta Valley to its
first section championship. "Last year was in the back of my mind,
but I tried not to worry about it."</LD>
<TE>   Murrieta Valley finished a disappointing 11th in last year's
section final without Pasciuto, but the Nighthawks beat runner-up
Thousand Oaks, 70-102, on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels so great," Pasciuto said after running 17 minutes 38
seconds over the 2.91-mile course. "[Winning this race] was one of
the goals we had set for ourselves at the start of the season."</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Karen Camburn finished fifth in 18:09 for Murrieta
Valley, the No. 14-ranked team in the nation, which also received
17th- and 18th-place finishes from seniors Bonghabih Shey and Rachel
Corrington.</TE>
<TE>   There were several other outstanding performances in the meet that
determined the section's team and individual qualifiers for the state
championships at Woodward Park in Fresno next Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Hesperia Sultana, the No. 3-ranked girls' team in the nation, won
its third Division II title in five years with a 46-119 victory over
Irvine Woodbridge. Freshman Danielle Varela and junior Kelsey
Delagardelle of Sultana finished first and second with times of 17:40
and 17:58, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Poe of Etiwanda and Los Angeles Loyola turned in dominant
victories in the Division I boys' race, and Phillip Reid of Oxnard
Rio Mesa won a classic duel with Michael Haddan of Woodbridge in the
Division II final.</TE>
<TE>   Poe, a senior, was at the front of the pack after a 4:51 first
mile. But he broke open the race shortly thereafter as he headed up
the switchbacks and finished in 14:48.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola won Division III titles in 1984 and 85, but the Cubs'
80-124 victory over Dana Point Dana Hills gave them their first title
since moving to the Division I level in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Reid, a senior, broke away from Haddan shortly before two miles
and then held off a late charge by the Woodbridge junior to win in
14:43.</TE>
<TE>   -- John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   One week after running what she called her "worst race ever,"
Belen Mendoza of Sun Valley Poly ran the best race of her life at
Pierce College to win the City Section girls' cross-country
championship by 23 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   The Parrots' senior finished in a personal-best 18:14, running the
three-mile course 1:11 faster than her preliminary time and 35
seconds faster than her previous best time of 18:49, which she ran in
a Sunset Six League meet last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Last week I was preoccupied with SATs, studying and college
applications, so my mind wasn't really there," Mendoza said.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Megan Adams of San Pedro was second in 18:27 to lead the
Pirates to their second consecutive title and third in four years.</TE>
<TE>   San Pedro claimed its second boys' title and first under
fifth-year Coach Bruce Thomson, accumulating 51 points to beat Monroe
(73) and seven-time defending champion Belmont (91), which had won 17
of the previous 20 team titles.</TE>

<LD>The six fillies and mares entered in today's $100,000 Cat's Cradle
Handicap are fond of Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   The California-breds are eight for 20 in Inglewood with Castling,
who is 6-1 on Russ Hudak's morning line, unbeaten in two local
starts.</LD>
<LD>   A daughter of High Brite trained by Carla Gaines for owner John
Harris, Super High has a win and a second in two starts on the
Hollywood Park main track and will be favored to win for the seventh
time in 12 lifetime races.</LD>
<TE>   Worse than third only twice in her career, Super High will break
from the rail in the 7 1/2-furlong race as she tries for her third
win in her last four starts. After five consecutive races on the
turf, Super High returned to the dirt on Nov. 2. She made the front
as the 8-5 favorite and went on to win the California Cup Matron at
Santa Anita by 2 1/2 lengths. With Patrick Valenzuela still serving a
suspension, Jose Valdivia Jr. will ride the bay filly.</TE>
<TE>   The Cat's Cradle marks the return of Bella Bella Bella. Owned by
Team Valor, the Soft Gold filly won the Golden Ballet here last year.
Idle since April 28, she will be making her first start for trainer
Simon Bray.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Castling, Cee's Elegance is the other two-time Hollywood
Park winner in the field. The 5-year-old gray mare has won twice in
seven starts here, but her last win was more than 18 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the field are Hadl, who will be making her first
start for trainer Jeff Mullins after being claimed for $50,000, and
Elaine's Angel, who was third behind Super High in the Matron.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The seventh at Hollywood Park is a $49,000
optional claimer at 1 1/8 miles on the turf. Mister Kybelee is
probably the one to beat as he drops out of graded stakes company for
trainer Julio Canani, although a case can be made for several others
in the field of 10.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Dan Hendricks. The trainer won with four of his first
seven starters at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Glen Disanto. The New York-based trainer is 2 for 42 in
2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Mister Kybelee, T.H. Lear
and R Baggio in the seventh, Shezasummerbreeze and Free Spin in the
eighth and singling Mushroom Countess in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 4/31. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $19.20/$169.80. Total money bet: $234.</TE>

<HD>Feeling Fine, O'Neal May Start vs. Bucks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal didn't have much to say as he left practice
Saturday. Nor were any words necessary.</LD>
<LD>   His big smile said it.</LD>
<LD>   His bouncy step said it.</LD>
<TE>   The lighthearted mood of his teammates said it.</TE>
<TE>   But the most telling sign of all came from Laker Coach Phil
Jackson, who said that his center was doing so well the day after his
first game of the season that Jackson was strongly considering
starting O'Neal tonight against the Milwaukee Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   After sitting out the first dozen games of the year following
off-season toe surgery, O'Neal entered Friday night's game against
the Chicago Bulls midway through the first quarter. In all, he played
21 minutes, scoring 17 points along with seven rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Although the rust was evident and his leaping ability limited,
O'Neal reported afterward that his toe felt good.</TE>
<TE>   "The true test," he said Friday night, "will be in the morning."</TE>
<TE>   And what did he say Saturday morning?</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say anything is different than I said it was 11 hours
ago," O'Neal told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Not totally true.</TE>
<TE>   "He had some stiffness in his legs," Jackson said. "But that's
natural. He was playing hard."</TE>
<TE>   Even if O'Neal starts tonight, Jackson said, he won't play more
than 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Mark Madsen, who has yet to play this season because of a
strained hamstring, may finally make it onto the court during the
Lakers' three-game trip this week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will honor broadcaster Chick Hearn, who died at 85 in
August, by unveiling a jersey bearing his name tonight as part of a
pregame tribute. Former Laker player and executive Jerry West and
Hearn's widow, Marge, will speak before Hearn's jersey takes its
place alongside those of the team's retired superstars. All fans in
attendance will receive a commemorative pin and a media guide
containing a special photo section on Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Milwaukee, 6:30</TE>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Lakers 4-9, Bucks 6-5.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Bucks (2001-02) -- 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Talk about bad timing. This isn't the homecoming
Milwaukee rookie center Dan Gadzuric, a former Bruin, had hoped for.
Saturday, UCLA's football team got pummeled by USC. Tonight, Gadzuric
may well get pummeled by O'Neal.</TE>

<LD>   A 3-year-old gelded son of Splash Bac, the California-bred won by
two lengths and now will try for another victory against a tougher
field in the $15,000 El Ocho Setenta Handicap tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Billingsley Creek Ranch and S&amp;L Associates and trained by
R.C. Howell, Bcr Get Bac Jac will be taking on a field that includes
five other quarter horses and the talented appaloosa Hes Spotless.</LD>
<TE>   Owned by Edward and Theresa Denike and trained by Patricia
Visscher, Hes Spotless has won seven of 12 and gave He Doll a battle
in an allowance race Nov. 3. He was beaten a half-length.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the field are Azure Classic Star; Ferragamo, who
finished third behind He Doll and Hes Spotless three weeks ago;
Crocodile Hunter, Seeks Joy and Rail Skimmer.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Alpine Socialite. 2. Comair Cs. 3. Nora Gvl. 4.
Dream Journey. 5. Jordans Streaker. 6. Frolic's Flash. 7. Faster Than

<HD>Mavericks Rally to Stay Unbeaten</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Anyone who doubts whether the Dallas Mavericks are the NBA's best
team might think differently after seeing how they won their 13th in
a row.</LD>
<LD>   Trailing by 16 points late in the third quarter, their zone
defense failing and their offensive touch missing, the Mavericks put
everything together in a thrilling fourth quarter to pull out a
115-105 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Led by Dirk Nowitzki, Michael Finley and Steve Nash, Dallas used
an 18-1 run to catapult into the lead. Seattle went ahead once, but
the Mavericks answered on their next possession to continue the best
roll in franchise history.</LD>
<TE>   "To find a way to win games like this is a sign of a champion,"
said Finley, who had 29 points and 11 rebounds. "We found a way
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Dallas' hot streak is the fourth-best in league history. The only
three teams that have done better all made it to the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks will try to match the 14-0 start by Boston in
1957-58 when they play at Detroit on Wednesday. They could be going
for the record of 15-0 -- set by Washington in 1948-49 and tied by
Houston in 1993-94 -- on Thursday at Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   The SuperSonics led by 16 points in the first quarter, and also
late in the third quarter, silencing a crowd of 20,011.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be aggressive," Seattle Coach Nate McMillan said. "We
did that for three quarters and then we got back on our heels."</TE>

<HD>Watson Lifts Grizzlies to First Win of Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Memphis' first sellout crowd this season got to see Michael Jordan
play and the Grizzlies win.</LD>
<LD>   Reserve Earl Watson scored a career-high 17 points and the
Grizzlies beat Jordan and the Washington Wizards, 85-74, Saturday
night.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just a matter of time for us to collectively come to a
point where we made it happen," Watson said.</LD>
<TE>   The Grizzlies (1-13) gave Hubie Brown a victory in his sixth game
as coach and ended the worst season-opening losing streak in
franchise history. Memphis averted the league record of 17
consecutive losses at the beginning of a season held by Miami (1988)
and the Clippers (1999).</TE>
<TE>   It was Brown's first NBA victory since 1986, when he had a 4-12
record coaching the New York Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know we didn't win the World Series, but what happens now
is it takes a little pressure off the kids in the community. That's
what I'm happy about," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Watson, a second-year guard out of UCLA, had five assists. Jordan
led Washington with 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis outshot Washington, 50% to 38%.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a bad loss for us, and it leaves a bad taste in
your mouth," said Jerry Stackhouse, who scored a season-low nine
points. "It's an embarrassing loss."</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 95, Portland 94 -- Hedo Turkoglu made two free throws
with 14.4 seconds remaining at Portland, Ore., to lift the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Rasheed Wallace, who with guard Damon Stoudamire was cited for
misdemeanor marijuana possession early Friday morning in Washington
state, led Portland with 30 points and nine rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Stoudamire did not play for the second game in a row and the third
time in the last four.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 96, Minnesota 82 -- Kerry Kittles scored 17 of his 19
points in the first half, and Jason Kidd had 18 points and 12 assists
to lift the Nets at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Garnett had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Timberwolves,
who play seven of their next eight games on the road -- where they
are 2-4 this season.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans 97, Cleveland 84 -- Baron Davis scored 13 of his 17
points after sitting out the third quarter at Cleveland because of
back spasms, and the Hornets sent the Cavaliers to their 10th loss in
a row.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 106, Indiana 91 -- Richard Hamilton had 22 points and five
teammates scored in double figures at Indianapolis, and the Pistons
ended the Pacers' winning streak at nine games.</TE>
<TE>   It was only the second time this season that the Pistons, who lead
the league in scoring defense at 79.6 points per game, scored 100
points.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 109, Atlanta 99 -- Shammond Williams stepped into the
starting lineup and had 19 points and six of the Celtics' 17 steals
at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pierce scored 31 points and Antoine Walker scored 22 for
Boston, which scored 24 points off 25 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Utah 110, Chicago 90 -- Matt Harpring and Karl Malone each scored
20 points at Salt Lake City and the Jazz extended its winning streak
to four games.</TE>
<TE>   Utah has shot 50% or better from the field in three consecutive
games.</TE>
<TE>   Denver 80, Phoenix 79 -- Ryan Bowen's layup as time expired at
Phoenix gave the Nuggets their second buzzer-beating victory in as
many games.</TE>
<TE>   Bowen's basket came after the Suns appeared to have won on Shawn
Marion's slam with six-tenths of a second remaining after a missed
shot by Stephon Marbury.</TE>

<LD>Gee (yawn), is it time to start the season already?</LD>
<LD>   Oh, the other guys opened three weeks ago?</LD>
<LD>   Well ... OK.</LD>
<TE>   If doing the same things over and over and expecting a different
result stands as a definition of insanity, then making the same
mistakes over and over and thinking you can keep getting away with
them can stand as a definition for hubris, the Greek word coined to
describe the arrogance of their gods.</TE>
<TE>   So it was that Shaquille O'Neal walked onto the Staples Center
floor three weeks and three days into the season, with everyone
confident that the Lakers, who'd been shot as full of holes as Al
Capp's old cartoon character Fearless Fosdick, and trailed Dallas by
nine (yes, nine) games in the West, would roll, from that point.</TE>
<TE>   As the San Antonio Express-News' Glenn Rogers wrote, "This would
be considered a disastrous, perhaps fatal, start for any other
contender ... but not here. Why?</TE>
<TE>   "Because it's all BS: Before Shaquille O'Neal."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dirk Nowitzki, after the Mavericks flattened the Lakers:
"Shaq is the Lakers, pretty much.... When it comes to April and May,
the Lakers will be the Lakers. They'll be the team to beat."</TE>
<TE>   Between now and then, however, the local superhero has his work
cut out for him. When O'Neal returned, the Lakers also trailed their
archrivals, the Sacramento Kings, by 5 1/2 games, not to mention the
Seattle SuperSonics, Houston Rockets, Phoenix Suns, Minnesota
Timberwolves, Utah Jazz, Clippers and Golden State Warriors. On the
plus side, the Lakers were ahead of the Denver Nuggets and Memphis
Grizzlies, so you can't say their time without Shaq was a complete
disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this is an annual rite: Lakes open as favorites....
Something goes wrong.... Phil Jackson is unconcerned.... Problem
persists even longer than Phil figured.... Just as panic threatens to
break out in the streets, or at least on the talk shows, the Lakers
arise to realize their greatness yet again.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, even Jackson, the Alfred E. ("What, me worry?")
Neuman of the biz, whose specialty is keeping everyone calm, seems to
signal an unusual level of concern, noting, as he did last week: "I
mean, we just do not have an easy road ahead of us, where
everything's going to fall into place and turn around."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the local inclination to cut O'Neal as much slack as he
needs, it must be noted the Great One put himself on the injured
list, deferring off-season surgery to Sept. 11, or 18 days before the
off-season ended.</TE>
<TE>   Had he gotten his second opinion (the first, which he ultimately
heeded, was in hand) and undergone surgery by Aug. 1 -- seven weeks
after the season ended -- he could have made the opening of camp,
which he needed.</TE>
<TE>   That ignores everything O'Neal went through last season. His toe
hurt, he was heavy, he lacked his old explosiveness, he felt put upon
by everyone.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was no longer concerned about his weight, he was just a
big guy, and he would take a while after the season before deciding
what to do about his toe.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he even bristled at Jackson when Phil told him they
needed him to turn it up during the San Antonio series, before
turning it up dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal has been remarkably upbeat this season but still lacks his
old explosiveness. If he can't practice, as he couldn't last season,
he may have to get by without it, as he did last season.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is so far ahead of the field, he can still dominate this
way, as he did in the end last spring when he might have been a
little ... say, 20 pounds ... over that 342 he claimed to be.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, you can only imagine what he would do if he ever got
back down around 325, although it has been a while since anyone has
seen that.</TE>
<TE>   And, as a Laker official notes, "You never will again."</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't only O'Neal who came out of their latest, scariest
triumph feeling omnipotent. It was the whole organization.</TE>
<TE>   Hubris is an occupational hazard of dynasts, whose confidence is a
huge advantage ... but has only to move a hair over the line to
become overconfidence.</TE>
<TE>   After their escape from Sacramento, they talked about signing
Charles Oakley, an old curmudgeon who would have come in handy. After
they scattered the New Jersey Nets, Oakley's name fell off the
agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The moves they made seemed motivated as much by salary. Lindsey
Hunter, owed $6.3 million, was traded for Tracy Murray, owed $3.7
million, and Kareem Rush, a prospect but one who might not be the
kind of rookie who would play right away for Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   With O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and Jackson knocking down $42 million a
season, expenses are always a concern. Laker people often note that
compared to the billionaire owners, Jerry Buss is like the proprietor
of a mom and pop store.</TE>
<TE>   Buss had vowed to keep the payroll under the $52-million tax
threshold but said it was OK to go over to re-sign Devean George,
which was seen as a major concession.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Buss has made tens (actually, more like twenties, or
fifties) of millions of dollars in three title-winning seasons in a
new arena, and should have been able to afford to sign George and
more, had he been persuaded they needed more.</TE>
<TE>   Not that anyone seemed too worried. Unlike the summer before when
they added Samaki Walker, Mitch Richmond and Hunter, there was little
mention of holes to fill.</TE>
<TE>   (I'm obliged to note that lots of people shared their image of
themselves, including moi. I thought they should get Oakley and had
more money to spend than they wanted to talk about, but I also wrote
they had enough help for Shaq and Kobe.)</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless ...</TE>
<TE>   When Jackson arrived in 1999, he stripped them down (goodbye,
Ruben Patterson), brought in player/mentors (Ron Harper, Brian Shaw)
to introduce a new, professional note, and surprised himself by
winning a title.</TE>
<TE>   Two seasons and two more titles later, it was hard to remember
they still hadn't found a backup center so they could cut O'Neal's
minutes, or, after the failed J.R. Rider and Richmond projects, added
any firepower.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Kings went from circus act to legitimate contender,
adding Mike Bibby, Bobby Jackson, Hedo Turkoglu and Keon Clark. The
Spurs brought in a new team around Tim Duncan, preparing for next
summer's final piece of the puzzle, when David Robinson retires and
they go after Michael Olowokandi. The Mavericks became a power.</TE>
<TE>   Now, besides crossing their fingers that Shaq's toe is OK, the
Lakers have a new nightmare scenario: The West is catching up ... or
on their doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   If you thought that was a long and winding road to last season's
happy ending, check out this season.</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   Breaking new ground as far as what one can say on TV while being
completely wrong, Charles Barkley predicted that Yao Ming wouldn't
score 19 points in a game as a rookie. Yao promptly got 20 against
the Lakers and, two games later, outscored Shawn Bradley in Dallas,
30-0. After scoring 30 points in his first seven games, Yao averaged
19.6 in his next three, in only 24 minutes, shooting 23-26.</TE>
<TE>   TV being more about visuals than wisdom, this still became a coup
for Turner. Barkley kissed a donkey that Kenny Smith had brought into
the studio. Even rival ESPN felt obliged to show that on
"SportsCenter."</TE>
<TE>   No more chastened than usual, Barkley then swore he'd kiss the
donkey again if Yao became one of the game's five best players. At
least, Charlie won't be proven wrong within a week on this one.
Nevertheless, he and that mule could get to be an item.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Robinson, who got a $30-million deal from the Chicago Bulls,
is buried on the bench, almost as unhappy with them as they are with
him. "OK, I'm not starting and I didn't complain about that," he
said. "But now I come off the bench and it's, like, one mistake and,
'Come sit down.' That's frustrating as hell."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bill Cartwright, asked what Robinson must do to play more:
"He's going to have to make a shot. That'd be pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers switched hotels in Sacramento, leaving the Hyatt where
Bryant got that infamous bacon cheeseburger. Bryant, however,
remained weak for days, suggesting it might not have been food
poisoning, and the Lakers were reportedly looking for a new hotel
before that.... In other news that may or may not be related, the
Kings hired a new chef, Gary Gainey, who was formerly the chef and
restaurant manager for Hyatt Regency Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Life among the 76ers and life only (cont.): Allen Iverson, fearing
an impending TV feature on his restless lifestyle, sat down with two
local writers, telling them he feared being framed by the
Philadelphia police and might have to leave town. Two days later, he
recanted, as usual, saying, "I want to be right in Philadelphia, it's
as simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   Maverick assistant coach Donnie Nelson, on their fast start: "It
comes down to your competition, where you rank with the Lakers and
the Kings of the world. We're [12-0] and we've caught some teams at
the right time, which happens in the NBA. If we had played San
Antonio a couple times, or Sacramento, would we be sitting here with
this record? Probably not. I wouldn't go crazy over being undefeated
at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Spur center Robinson on his 40-year-old backup, Kevin Willis: "His
body looks better than my body and I always thought I was in great
shape. He still runs like a deer. And he's still strong."</TE>
<TE>   Willis is also known for his short arms. During a visit to the
Sydney Zoo at the 2000 Olympics, Kevin Garnett nicknamed a kangaroo
"Kevin Willis."</TE>
<TE>   Karl Malone, asked if Denver's muscular Nene Hilario reminded him
of himself as a rookie: "He can come talk to me in 18 years."</TE>

<LD>MARK HEISLER'S NBA RANKINGS AND COMMENTS</LD>
<LD>   GAME OF THE WEEK</LD>
<LD>   DALLAS AT INDIANA</LD>
<TE>*--*
Rank  Team (rec.)           Comment (last week's position)
1     DALLAS (13-0)         Byron Scott on Mavericks: "They're
                            serious challengers to the Lakers." (1)
2     SACRAMENTO (11-4)     Kings still messing around more with
                            Jackson than with Bibby. (2)
3     SAN ANTONIO (9-4)     Good news: Willis breaks into rotation at
                            40. Bad news: As Admiral fades. (6)
4     DETROIT  (11-3)       East's mini-Beast: 6-8 Wallace gets 12
                            points, 19 rebounds, 10 blocks vs. Heat.
                            (4)
5     NEW JERSEY (10-4)     Not yet, the Nets aren't class of East:
                            Scott steams as they fall at Boston by
                            17. (3)
6     INDIANA  (10-2)       If Pacers can't re-sign Reggie Miller, I
                            know local team that can use him. (5)
7     NEW ORLEANS  (10-3)   Magloire a minor disappointment at 8.5
                            points, 9 rebounds, but Elden's back. (7)
8     PHILADELPHIA  (9-4)   Iverson goes off on cops, Brown in Year
                            5, Coleman's back: How are 76ers 9-4?
                            (10)
9     BOSTON  (9-4)         Team that thought it invented game now
                            Launch City, averaging 28 threes. (9)
10    HOUSTON  (7-4)        Barkley may be wrong, but I doubt he'll
                            admit it: Yao's time has already begun.
                            (15)
11    SEATTLE  (8-5)        Brent Barry averaging 13.5 points, 5.1
                            assists, shooting 51%, 50% on threes. (8)
12    LAKERS  (4-9)         Upgrade from Samaki/Samake to Shaq helps,
                            but there's a long way to go. (21)
13    MINNESOTA (7-7)       Local papers speculating on trouble
                            between Garnett and Szczerbiak again.
                            (12)
14    PHOENIX  (5-6)        Nice surprise: Marbury playing like point
                            for first time since he left Minnesota.
                            (13)
15    UTAH  (7-7)           Jazz retires Hornacek's number. Better
                            the team should talk him into comeback.
                            (22)
16    PORTLAND (6-7)        Huh? Cheeks sits all three points, starts
                            Pippen. Trail Blazers go 3-0. (16)
17    ATLANTA  (6-7)        The case for contraction, NBA style:
                            7,852 see Hawks lose to Timberwolves.
                            (19)
18    MILWAUKEE  (6-5)      At least, he can still complain: Mason,
                            averaging 7-7, says Bucks lack urgency.
                            (17)
19    ORLANDO  (7-7)        Bottom threatens to drop out of season
                            again as Grant sits with "tendinitis."
                            (11)
20    WASHINGTON  (6-7)     Jordan's knee being tested with 11 of 17
                            on road, including four back-to-backs.
                            (14)
21    TORONTO  (4-8)        Headline after N'diaye blocks eight:
                            "Nobody blocks shots like your Mamadou."
                            (18)
22    CLIPPERS  (4-9)       Not showing up? Brand, Olowokandi in
                            league top 20 in nine categories. (20)
23    GOLDEN STATE  (4-10)  Musselman on the firing of Memphis'
                            Sidney Lowe: "Better him than me." (27)
24    CHICAGO  (4-10)       Since Jordan left in '99, Bulls 0-19 on
                            their annual November trip West. (23)
25    CLEVELAND  (2-12)     Not quite yet: Miles (38%) still has to
                            learn to shoot, averaging 12 points. (24)
26    NEW YORK  (2-9)       Still losing with Sprewell -- so, of
                            course, next order of business is trading
                            him. (25)
27    MIAMI  (2-9)          Mourning hints at another comeback -- but
                            he's a free agent, so it's not likely
                            here. (26)
28    DENVER  (4-9)         Bzdelik's 77-a-game offense on track to
                            break record low by four points. (28)
29    MEMPHIS  (1-13)       Grizzlies making biggest adjustment:
                            Gasol averaged 21 for Lowe, 11 for Brown.
                            (29)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   When -- Thursday. Time -- 4 PST. TV -- TNT</TE>
<TE>   Story line -- Hopefully, you'll have a better Thanksgiving than
the Mavericks, sent to Indiana to play the Pacers for your enjoyment.
Both teams are young, deep and off to tremendous starts.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UC Irvine, playing most of the game without foul-plagued, 7-foot
center Adam Parada, gave up 11 consecutive points midway through the
second half and lost to Western Michigan, 73-62, in a consolation
game of the Sooner Invitational in Norman, Okla.</LD>

<HD>USC Gets Defensive in Another Victory</HD>

<LD>It's early in the season, but the USC women have already learned a
concept that applies to any sport: Play defense the whole game no
matter how your offense is doing and you can still have good results.</LD>
<LD>   The concept worked again Saturday as the Trojans battled their way
to a 55-48 victory over New Mexico before 356 at the Sports Arena, a
crowd made minuscule by the afternoon USC-UCLA football game in
Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   Even with minimum fan support, USC improved to 3-1, overcoming a
40-34 deficit by holding the Lobos to eight points in the final 7:29.</LD>
<TE>   Ebony Hoffman paced USC with 18 points. Jessica Cheeks had 15 and
Rachel Woodward added 11. While the Trojans again struggled from the
field, shooting under 40% for the third consecutive game, they had 18
steals and forced 31 turnovers. New Mexico center Jordan Adams led
all scorers with 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   Now as the Trojans move into the teeth of a difficult
nonconference schedule, starting Friday with Notre Dame, Coach Chris
Gobrecht knows her team has to do more than just stop teams.</TE>
<TE>   "Defense is carrying us right now," Gobrecht said. "But we've
started a pattern I'm not real comfortable with, struggling to get in
gear and [playing well] down the stretch. I think part of it is we
were concerned about the number of early games we'd have, and the
team has been pacing itself a bit. Now past [the WNIT] we can get
after it the whole time."</TE>

<TE>   Hawaii 70, UCLA 66 -- The Rainbow Wahine shot 52% (22 of 42) from
the field and made 25 of 36 free throws to win a season opener over
the Bruins in the Waikiki Beach Marriott Classic in Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA, which led, 31-30, at halftime, shot 34% from the field in
the second half and 38% (27 of 71) for the game. Michelle Greco, who
made all six of her free throws, led the Bruins with 20 points, but
she made only seven of 22 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Willis came off the bench to score 18 points on seven-for-10
shooting for UCLA. She made three of her four three-point shots.</TE>
